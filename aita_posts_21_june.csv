c3kxbn	2019-06-22 03:54:14	muddyrose	WIBTA for ruining a child's innocent (but highly annoying) fun?	"It seems like a child has gotten a hold of a phone, unsupervised, for the first time ever.  

I have no idea how they got my number, but they called a few times, the first time they left a message saying ""Hi muddyrose, I smell like poop"", after that I tried to ignore it but it's late and I want to nip this in the bud. 

I pulled the classic *67 on my landline and the child picked up. I asked a few questions but they just parroted everything I said. I told them that I was going to call back tomorrow to hopefully speak to an adult, and they started rapid hitting buttons. I just hung up at that point. 

I don't recognize the name or number that pops up on my phone when they call, but they are from my area (my phone even tells me the name of the town so I don't have to Google the number)

Prank calls are normal kid nonsense, I don't care about that. This kid seems *really* young, like 6-8 years old, and they're doing this after 11pm. That seems a little less normal, and it was honestly really frustrating trying to see if the kid needed help or was just being a turd (I'm going with turd)

Would I be the asshole if I followed through with my threat? Or should I let this go and hope it doesn't happen again? I don't want to get the kid in trouble, but there's an art to prank calling. This kid was just being straight up annoying.

c3kui4	2019-06-22 03:45:59	mojorisin1960	AITA For refusing to help my 20 year old daughter with her homework?	"I‚Äôm a high school English teacher. My daughter just entered her junior year of college. She is a bright, hardworking student who aspires to attend grad school and eventually attain her PhD. She is an excellent writer, but she is also insecure. She doubts her writing skills and often comes to me for help. Since her freshman year, she has been emailing me her papers so that I could look them over and make proper edits and corrections before she would submit them to her professors. I was happy to oblige.

Fast forward two years later, I feel that since she‚Äôs now an upperclassman in college, she shouldn‚Äôt need my help anymore. I think of it as taking the training wheels off. Realistically, how much longer can I edit her assignments for her before it becomes too much? I know that she would allow me to edit her papers until she reaches the highest level of education possible, but as an educator myself, I can‚Äôt allow that. 

I recently edited one of her papers and told her that that would be the last time I would edit her assignments. She told me that she relies on me, to which I said was part of the problem. I said that as a young adult in college, she should not have to rely on her parent, but herself. I told her that this can‚Äôt go on for the rest of her academic career. She‚Äôs now very upset with me, which was to be expected, but I actually feel a little bad. 

Part of why I feel bad is because she thinks that she needs me. As I mentioned before, she lacks confidence in her writing skills. In my opinion, she is a talented writer. I‚Äôm not exactly biased, either, considering she proudly shares the positive feedback from her professors. Also, any corrections I had to make were minor. I barely ever had to correct more than a handful of grammatical errors and the like. I know she will do just as well without my help. She just doesn‚Äôt know that.

She (33F) grew up mostly without a dad and probably wishing she didn't have a mom. I'm unclear on what exactly happened because either she has repressed the memory or she was just too young, and her own mother has two different accounts. Nowadays her mom will swear that she left her husband because he was abusive and she had to protect her kid. My wife says back in the day her mom would tell her her father left because he found out she was gay, but I think this may have been an attempt to guilt her into staying in the closet.

Whatever it is, the guy left for most of her life and just recently started getting in contact. I (32F) found out when my wife started crying one evening, and I had to comfort her because feelings of abandonment and internalized homophobia had started resurfacing. She decided right then she didn't want to reconnect, I supported her, she blocked him. Then, somehow (I suspect through her mom) he started contacting me. One thing led to another and we started texting each other a bit.

I feel bad for this guy. He has a completely different story than my MIL about what happened, painting her as a golddigger that left when he ran out of gold, and he seems very repentant and almost pathetic. He's been begging me to encourage my wife to just give him a chance.

c3kt02	2019-06-22 03:41:39	somefolkaresilly	AITA for expecting the benefit of the doubt?	"Edit 3:after talking with an asshole enthusiast, i‚Äôve come to the realization that my understanding of the situation was incomplete in such a way that made me the asshole. I have since apologized to the person in question.

Edit 4: if you still want to aita me for The situation I thought I was in, the reply I made to u/nakedstreets more adequately describes the situation I thought I was in

Background: I recently cut communication with someone who‚Äôs been part of a friend group since high school over differences in our stances about firearms in America. The situation boiled down to this person previously having left a larger group chat between our friends after several heated arguments about various political and cultural issues, citing the strain of the arguments on their ties to the friend group, intending to potentially return after a while. The rest of us in the meanwhile have by no means stopped arguing, though some of the more contentious topics (namely guns), have been isolated in a separate chat. Over the past week or two, I've laid out my stance on firearms, which to put it it lightly, is diametrically opposed to this other person's views.

&#x200B;

This is where the AITA really starts.

&#x200B;

Having finished laying out my views, I invited this person to read, not to read and discuss, but to just read the arguments that I had made, exported into a separate PDF. I did not ask for any feedback at all, even just reading it and rejecting it without further consideration was explicitly made clear to be an acceptable outcome.

This was after this person did ask me again to not include them in this process of me laying out my views, citing the strain of an argument between the friend group, which is why I made it clear that all reactions could be kept between myself and this other person, without any involvement with the friend group, so as to try and avoid their undesirable outcome.

I asked to be given the benefit of the doubt in just reading what I had to say in that given context above, citing our years of knowing each other, our close political views barring this one issue, the concession that this never had to be brought into the larger group chat to be argued, and its personal importance to me (to which I compared our shared feelings on other issues like the southern border and abortions).

This was met with again a sentiment that they did not want to read or engage with this topic, citing the stress it puts on the friend group.

&#x200B;

I can see it both ways. I can understand that I might have pushed too hard, though I feel that in this case, given our history, I should have been given the (as the title says) benefit of the doubt.

&#x200B;

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Alternatively, do you think I misjudged the situation, and did not fully comprehend it, there being another reason this issue was rejected out of hand? I realize that it's a polarizing and intense topic.

Edit 2: i‚Äôve been getting a few comments now, and one of them helped me realize some thing that I might not have necessarily made clear: The thing that this person wasn‚Äôt comfortable with was everyone in the chat arguing about it. They did not necessarily indicate that it was this topic that they were uncomfortable with discussing so much as the former reason. That‚Äôs why I went and made these concessions to accommodate them being uneasy"	Asshole	0	0

c3kqq3	2019-06-22 03:35:11	FormerAmoeba	AITA for not paying someone in Monopoly	"Recently, I invited a few friends over to play Monopoly. One of my friends agreed to come under the condition that they would also be writing a paper while they play (I'll call them A). Originally, there were going to be four players. So, if one person was a little more preoccupied with their homework, we wouldn't mind because it wouldn't take too much away from gameplay. However, one friend left before we could start the game, so only three would be playing (with A multitasking with homework). 

Fastforward into the evening, we're all having a good time. We're chatting before we start the game and everyone is in a good mood. The one friend leaves and the three of us start playing. Most of the properties had been bought when I happened to roll doubles and landed on a space that belonged to A. Before they could notice, I rolled my second roll. 

The other player noticed and decided to say something to A. But by that point, I had already rolled again and escaped paying the fee. A immediately shut down and refused to continue the game because they didn't want to play competitively. This ended the game for everyone and A left soon after. 

I realize that not everyone may play Monopoly this competitively, but this is generally how I've always played. AITA?

Edit: ""A"" immediately shut down and quit the game, not me. I even tried to establish that, going forward, we would all pay rent no matter what. But ""A"" refused and quit regardless."	Asshole	0	0

I apologized and we moved on. 

But things still are not the same. I can tell they still have some type of animosity towards me. Fast forward a week of us not regularly communicating how we usually do and my one friend had her graduation ceremony. She asked me to go quite a while ago and I told her I‚Äôd check and see if I‚Äôm off work and if I was I‚Äôd love to go. 

Well the day came and I had texted all three of them ‚ÄúWhat are you up to?‚Äù No answers. So I decided to make plans and keep in mind I had no address to this graduation though I didn‚Äôt ask I still got no reply earlier. Around 6:30pm, my friend who was graduating sent an address in my group text, not addressing anyone just an address. I thought this was strange like that could have gone to someone else?

This is the same friend from my previous post, so refer to that for some context if need be. 

I was deployed for 9 months a short time ago, and a month or so before I left, my best man got engaged. I made it a point to see him before I left because we weren‚Äôt on the greatest of terms and I wanted to fix that. Everything seemed cool after that, but that would soon turn to shit. 

Being 7-8 hours ahead was not easy when talking to people back home, so I cherished all time I had. I primarily used WhatsApp because it was the most stable platform. I informed everyone that wanted to talk to me before I left to download it if they wanted to talk to me. 

Everyone except this friend did, even if they only sent 1 or 2 messages while I was gone. This guy wanted to use Snapchat for some reason. Any time that I got a chance to talk to him, I did, checking in and eventually asking details about the wedding. I was supposed to extend another 3 months, so I needed to know what day his wedding was so I could see if I would be home for it. Every time I asked him anything about the wedding, he would go silent for at least 2 days. I asked him a couple times as to why, and he always had something. ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm not on facebook very often.‚Äù I asked for an email, any other means of comms he preferred, and it was always Snapchat. He never answered why he refused to use WhatsApp. 

One of the biggest questions was who would be his best man, as he asked me to be a groomsman. This question always went unanswered. Side note, Snap would always prove unreliable, failing to send messages from him to me. He texted my wife about this because he didn‚Äôt want me to think he was ignoring me, and when she asked why he didn‚Äôt use WhatsApp, silence. 

That was my breaking point, I sent him a message saying (paraphrased) ‚ÄúI understand that Snap sucks for you, but I don‚Äôt accept that you are being lazy about contacting me. You have until (36 hours) to find a reliable way to reach me, or I‚Äôm done making the effort.‚Äù 

His response: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt appreciate your attitude towards my wedding. Best man is (name) and I will be looking to replace you as groomsman. I hope you‚Äôll still be at my wedding‚Äù 

I was taken aback, I wanted to rip him apart, but I simply said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs so much I want to say, but I know it will be wasted on you. I will not be at your wedding. I sincerely hope that it is all you hope it will be.‚Äù

Everyone was irritable, and we all just wanted to board. For context (not sure if this works differently in other airports) before other boarding groups were called, groups 1 and 2 lined up early in designated, labeled areas.  The front of the two lines were separated by ropes, but behind the ropes the two lines jumble up into one. I was group 2. 

Now, after the announcement that boarding will begin, I am waiting in line behind the point-of-jumbling. But (to my chagrin) the flight doesn‚Äôt actually start boarding for probably another 20 minutes. So at this point, I‚Äôve been waiting in my spot in line for almost half an hour, and an elderly man with his elderly wife come up and he taps me on the shoulder. He asks if this is the line for ‚ÄúGroup 1‚Äù to which I respond that the two lines have jumbled and both groups have blended together. 

Here‚Äòs where I start to get annoyed. Instead of moving to the back of the line, the couple stayed put. And they happen to be standing a few feet in front of where I had been waiting in line. I wait a bit to see if they‚Äôre going to move, but they just slowly inch towards the line. 

I do not like budgers. 

I say: ‚ÄúExcuse me, sir - this is the line for both groups 1 and 2‚Äù

Man: ‚ÄúYes, I am group 1‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúAnd so is half of the line behind you‚Äù

Man: ‚ÄúWell are you?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm group 2, but people behind me are group 1, and you‚Äôve cut in front of them‚Äù

His wife then gets involved and wags her finger in my direction with an ‚Äúexcuse me young man, mind my own business please.‚Äù 

I thought that was very snooty of her.  

At this point, I‚Äôm annoyed, restless, and now, I‚Äôm in it to finish it, so I counter the wife with something along the lines of: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm shocked that even at a quarter of your age I‚Äôm more aware of airport etiquette than either of you.‚Äù

That did not go over well. Others in the line start to catch on that the argument is escalating, and we get more-or-less forcibly separated by onlookers in the line. So, lo and behold, the couple stayed in line and boarded before the other Group 1ers, and I was getting dirty looks for the rest of the boarding process. 

I did not board any slower with them in front of me, because Group 2 only boards after all of Group 1, but the rest of the Group 1ers behind me *did indeed* board later than they would have otherwise. But to be clear, the budging had no direct negative effect on me personally other than exposure to public ridiculousness. Me speaking up was solely based on the principal that budging is wrong.

My friend‚Äôs home life is pretty toxic, every time I‚Äôm over there his 4 year old half brother is annoying him, or his mom is yelling at him in German over the smallest things, (his dad died in the army in 2010, he got a step dad in 2014 who just recently left his mom a few months ago) so things aren‚Äôt really going good for him, he always texts me to come over and ‚Äúsave him‚Äù or asking to come to my house but I say no every time.

Now here‚Äôs my side of the story, I really don‚Äôt like being at his house. My friend is a great person and he‚Äôs like a brother to me, I‚Äôve known him since we were 8, but god damn his family is incredibly toxic, I don‚Äôt like being around them just as much as he does. You may be asking ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you invite him over?‚Äù My friend likes to swear a lot, and we usually do things like watch YT and R rated movies in his living room, at my house no swearing is allowed and we can‚Äôt really do anything we would be able to do at his house because my parents just don‚Äôt allow it, I don‚Äôt want my parents/family judging my friend in a negative light.

Second reason and main reason is that I just like staying in my room all day and doing what I want to do. I don‚Äôt have depression or anything like that, but to me an ideal day is staying in bed and watching Netflix. I‚Äôm not even socially awkward or anything, I just would rather not talk to anyone, I love being by myself.

c3k8ie	2019-06-22 02:43:22	starvinmarvin1230	AITA for getting angry at my SO for failing to make dinner as planned	"My SO and I live together and he‚Äôs recently taken up cooking. We live in a big city where cooking isn‚Äôt necessarily the norm and takeout options are plentiful, so this is as much a hobby of his as it is a necessity. Also, we don‚Äôt have a stocked fridge and pantry. You basically eat-as-you-go from the grocery store. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where he cooks something 3-4 nights a week, usually letting me know in advance so that I don‚Äôt make other plans or waste additional money on takeout.

Yesterday around 3pm, I asked him if he was planning to make dinner so I could figure out my evening. He said he was, but that he was going out for ‚Äúhappy hour‚Äù drinks with a co-worker first. He generally gets home around 6:30 and happy hour is typically over by 7, so I assumed things would likely be an hour or so later than usual. 

When he wasn‚Äôt home by 8:15, I sent him a text asking if dinner was still on. He replied... 30 minutes later.... saying that he was still at the bar so I might want to order something myself, but that he was still planning to cook. I said ‚Äúthanks, you fucking asshole‚Äù to which he replied that his co-worker was deep into an emotional conversation with him so he hadn‚Äôt been able to reach his phone.

Just to be clear, the issue here is not that I‚Äôm entitled to the cooking. I don‚Äôt care if he does it every night or not at all. I wouldn‚Äôt care if he cancelled at 5pm for a late night with his friend or colleagues, I just want to know whether to fend for myself or not (and to a lesser extent manage my own time).

He ended up getting home at 9:30, 2 minutes before my delivery guy. At this point I am starving and overly angry and yell at him for being an inconsiderate prick. I said that unless there‚Äôs a legitimate emergency, there‚Äôs no way a cancellation text wasn‚Äôt possible. I said I think it‚Äôs completely disrespectful and tantamount to standing someone up for dinner or just generally ghosting. He was somewhat apologetic but mostly thought it was a huge over reaction.

He ended up cooking for 10:30 and I ate my part for lunch.

c3k8ad	2019-06-22 02:42:45	killy420	WIBTA if I reported a family to CPS for leaving their small children unsupervised?	"A rather large family moved into the house that is directly across the road from my work. They have at least 4 children (that I've seen). The youngest must not be older than 3, and maybe the oldest kid  being 5 or so... so young enough to need supervision when playing outside. My community does foster home programs for refugees, I believe they may be Syrian, not a hundred percent sure. Of Muslim faith, anyway. Nothing against that, btw. 

Once the nice weather started to hit this spring, the children started playing outside on their bikes. I would see them on my lunch break and leaving work to go home. My work is a government facility, with a rather large parking lot. The building is clearly marked with signs of no trespassing. However the kids started using the parking lot as a place to ride their bikes.

Both the janitor and myself have tried to shoo them away and explain this is a parking lot where there are moving vehicles and it's potentially dangerous - but to no avail, they are either too young to understand, while the others only know a few words of English. No parents in sight. 

There was one day where one of the kids fell on his bike in the parking lot and started to cry. The janitor happened to be outside for a smoke break at the time. She took the kid across the road to the house and knocked on the door. A man opened the door and a woman (who the janitor assumed was the mother) laughed, smiled and waved her in. Seemed to have no idea whatsoever what her kid was doing. 

The kids have even been around on busy evenings with lots of cars and traffic in and out of the building. One evening I had to step out to grab something from home (I live just up the hill). I went and drove back. At this point it is dusk. Pull into the parking lot, around the corner.... and on go the brakes. Little girl no older than 3 pedaling away right in the middle of the lane. Heart in my throat, I honked my horn to get her attention, and waved her out of my way. I rolled down the window and pulled up beside her and tried to explain as simply as I could she should not be here in a parking lot.... especially at dusk with lots of traffic and no fucking supervision. 

I'm afraid someone is going to get hurt or worse. I've seen them driving up and down the middle of the road, too, while it normally doesn't have much traffic it is a blind turn. I've almost hit deer there in the mornings. The parents don't give two sweet fucks about what their children are doing. Trying to talk to either the parents or the kids gets nowhere because of the language barrier. WIBTA if I called CPS? Or at the very least police to try to get the parents to understand they're putting their kids in danger?


UPDATE: So the janitor spoke with one of the people who sponsor the family and let them know their concerns with the children playing in the parking lot /road. Hoping this will solve the issue at the lowest level. But we will wait and see....."	No A-holes here	0	0

c3k6q3	2019-06-22 02:38:29	ostrichmatingritual	AITA for leaving a passive aggressive note in the laundry room?	"This is so trivial and yet I‚Äôm fuming.

My building has laundry rooms on each floor with 2 washers and 2 dryers. I‚Äôd been checking and someone had been using both washers, but they had different times on them. I also saw 2 laundry baskets so assumed 2 different people. Fine. I left, came back later to find both empty, so put in my clothes. 

Sorry to get all math-y here but the wash cycles are 25 min and the dryer cycles are 45 min which makes it a little annoying to plan. When I put in my load, I knew one of the dryers would be open when the wash cycle ended. However, both dryers were still full with a half hour on each! So obviously someone was re-drying their clothes. The dryers are inefficient but I was a little infuriated that now my wet clothes had to stew for 30 min. Again, fine. I left.

Half an hr later, come back, one of them is at 0, the other is at 5 min. I don‚Äôt WANT to be an asshole, so I decide not to take out the clothes in the finished cycle and go back to my apartment which is by the way right across from the laundry room so I can hear when people go in. 5 min later I heard the door open, close, open. Yes, dryer time, I naively thought. Except I got played as hell because now both dryers say 45 min!!!! That mofo started a new dryer cycle!! This confirmed that a) the same person was using both, and b) they‚Äôre a raging cockfart in my honest opinion. I should also note the washers have clear doors so they can clearly see my poor sopping wet clothes sitting there. 

So I wrote a note and stuck it to a dryer. Here‚Äôs a transcript: ‚ÄúHi. Next time you see someone‚Äôs clothes in the washer could you maybe not take up BOTH dryers and then run the dryers AGAIN? I found it to be pretty inconsiderate/a dick move. I am aware the dryers are inefficient but you could have been more thoughtful. Thanks a bunch. Have a great weekend.‚Äù

I guess my question to you Reddit is, is this a breach of laundry etiquette or should I have sucked it up/planned better? AITA for lowkey considering pouring juice in the dryer? Ok I know the answer to that one.

Ryan (not his real name) is one of my new friends. He's a really great guy and lives next door at my apartment complex and he's living his life like a hippie. He says he does not really relate to hippie lifestyle but he loves being free to do whatever he wants to do. He told me he decided to live like that after years of struggling with depression after his mother passed away years ago.

He smokes crack all day and barely takes a shower. His body stinks so bad but I did not want to hurt his feelings so I never made a fuss about it.
Ryan has introduced me to some of his friends and they always invite me to join them whenever they're hanging out or visiting the beach etc.

2 days ago we went to the beach in my car. It was past midday when we drove home and as it was getting really hot, Ryan started to stink really bad. But apparently nobody paid attention to it. The smell lingered in my car after they left, even after I deodorized it. And it kind of pissed me off. I did not want to hummiliate him in front of his friends, so I only talked to him about it later that night. 
I said casually ""Hey buddy. I don't want to sound rude or anything. But you're my good friend and I just want to help.""
Then I gave him a roll-on.

He got really pissed and looked rather offended and he even told me if his body odor bothered me so much then maybe we should no longer be friends and then asked me to leave him alone.

I talked to one of his friends that I have a crush on about it later and she was so horrified. I told her as a friend I only worried about his personal hygiene, nothing else. But apparently she did not share the same opinion about it. She said that's just how Ryan is. And I should have been more sensitive and asked the other kids' opinion first on how to approach him about it without offending him since they have known him longer than me.

So I said ""So nobody has ever told him that he stinks?""
She said ""We've been friends with him for many years. He's always had problems with his low self-esteem and we did not want to hurt him. He's our good friend and we love him the way he is. That's such a dick move from you!""

c3k3ni	2019-06-22 02:30:09	garbagefoodthrower	AITA for throwing out my girlfriend's food?	"Basically the title. This has been going on for months where my girlfriend makes or buys food and lets it sit in the fridge for weeks and it gets all gross and moldy. I've talked to her about this a million times and every single time I hear ""I'm going to eat it for lunch tomorrow!"".


Here's the thing: I did a little experiment and counted all the leftovers in the fridge over the past 4 months just to see what she actually takes and what she doesn't. On average she saves about 3 meals a week in the fridge so over 4 months that's 48 meals. Guess how many she ate... two. 


FUCKING TWO MEALS she ate that she actually saved. I've sat her down about this calmly and said she is wasting money by letting it rot, other people could eat this food (or I could eat it but she never lets me eat it either) and so on and so forth. *Nothing* works on her. Nothing, and I'm fucking so tired of it. We're not going to break up over it or anything but I've just resigned to throwing her food out the second that it touches the fridge. This is where I think I'm an asshole but I kind of think it's a necessary evil as it's taking up space and she never cleans the fridge so I'm left to deal with the fallout. She got mad at me for doing this for the last few weeks but I explained to her that we've had 15 conversations about this exact thing and she did nothing about it and so I took matters into my own hands by throwing it all out.


I try to preserve the soups and stuff in the freezer as best I can but most of her leftovers are from restaurants and stuff, which are basically things that have to be eaten either right away or next day at the latest and as such I can't save it or give it to a neighbor or a food shelter. We're not in dire straits for money or anything but this is a gross waste of money we could use. If she's going to let it rot in the fridge and not eat it then it's just as much wasted money as if I threw it out so I just preemptively bin it before she has the chance to let that happen.

c3k2uh	2019-06-22 02:28:05	lostchild333	AITA for not wanting my roommate to drive my car while I was away?	"A year ago, I moved down South and got two roommates. I‚Äôm not incredibly close with either of them, but we get along and can communicate which is essential. For the sake of privacy, I‚Äôll call them Amy and Rachel. I had some time off recently and decided to go visit my parents. Rachel doesn‚Äôt drive and Amy does, but doesn‚Äôt have a car, so I asked the latter if she would drive me to the airport and then pick me up. I never gave her permission to do anything else with it, though I never said not to either. I also gave her gas money in case there wasn‚Äôt enough to pick me up from the airport.

Anyway, Amy dropped me off and picked me off. Things seemed easy enough. The day after I came back, I was running errands with Rachel. I found some condiment packets in my car, which was weird because I had cleaned it out before I went home to visit. 

Rachel noticed my confusion and said, ‚ÄúI think Amy picked up Chick-Fil-A on her way home the other night.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, Amy was using my car while I was gone?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. She drove to work and some other places. I assumed you had told her it was okay.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything further. When we got back, I talked to Amy about it. She confirmed she had used my car and assumed it was okay. I said I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with her using it outside driving my car to and from the airport. While she‚Äôs a good driver, she‚Äôs not on the insurance and shouldn‚Äôt be doing it more than necessary.

c3k1nh	2019-06-22 02:24:35	Sergant_Stupid	AITA by being passively petty to my roommate or should I confront her?	"I have a roommate who is constantly eating all the food I buy (without doing ANY grocery shopping at all), my leftovers, and my snacks. Even going as far as coming into my room when I'm not home and taking snacks or weed, sometimes even my random items like lotion. I recently had $40 go missing and I was just angry but also too shy to be conventional. 

I know it sounds like not a big deal just ask her what's going on, but the actual idea of that scares me to death.

So now I am writing on certain food I have in the fridge ""pls do not eat"" so it doesn't sound too forceful, instead just desperate. Sure enough she came home saw the note crumpled it up and threw it in the trash. Then I heard her slamming cabinets and the dryer door. I didn't see her take it off but I did see it in the trash and I swear I saw it on the food earlier.

For my bf the breaking point was him realizing she ate a snack he was saving for later when he came home from work. He knocked on her door and asked if she's been going in our room. Of course she responded no. She lied and made it seem like she was confused and played dumb.

She is known to be manipulative, a compulsive liar, and she even told me she ""used"" to be a klepto. All of these traits she had told me about previously when we were friends. I did see the red flags but it was too late bc I had already signed a lease.

So, am I being the asshole by being petty and hiding things better and writing stuff on food, or should I confront her somehow? Theres only a month left on the lease I figured I could just wait it out maybe instead of making things tense and awkward."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We were super close almost immediately but for the last year and a half things have been strained. Our interests have diverged and while I would make time to go to her events, she would never go to mine. She went back to school and got busy. Around the same time she got a new bf and any spare time she might have had left was taken and we didn‚Äôt hang for a while which was understandable.

This bf wanted to go on a break on month 3 of their relationship and Sarah was devastated. She called me and a couple friends to hang out and we all did. Personally I thought she was better off without him. Eventually the break ended and they got back together but she‚Äôs changed a lot since dating him. She‚Äôs become judgemental of us and even more withdrawn from our friend group and only seems to hang out with his friends. We (our friend group) have gone to the bf‚Äôs events many times and from my perspective act friendly at these events. The bf‚Äôs friends, however, are kind of stand-off-ish to us.  He has come to only one of our parties and only came because he could bring his friends too. I think he might have some social anxiety and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs necessarily a bad guy, but I feel like she‚Äôs had to sacrifice her friendships to make him comfortable. Or maybe she‚Äôs done with us and looking for new friends, which is fine but

Very recently she‚Äôs been trying to reacquaint herself with our friend group and me but I‚Äôm feeling hesitant. I feel shirked aside while she makes all this room for a bf that doesn‚Äôt seem all that committed to begin with.

I would feel worse if that was the gist of it, but she‚Äôs been coming to my house and hanging out with my roommates for the entire time I‚Äôve lived here. So she has time for these people but not for me.

She recently asked me repeatedly to go shopping with her but I refused for no reason other than I don‚Äôt wanna open myself up to someone who might fade out of my life again. We were crazy close for a while and when that switched I was very confused and hurt. I‚Äôm a very introverted person so I only wanna spend time with people if they‚Äôre going to be worth it in the long run. Also, it‚Äôs been MONTHS without hearing anything from her.

But I know from mutual friends that this past year has been very hard for her and she actually feels very bad about abandoning her friends to hang out with her bf‚Äôs friends. I guess I just don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on with her. I think she‚Äôs really cool but based on how often I‚Äôve felt rejected by her, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it to try to be her friend again. But from her perspective, I feel like maybe I‚Äôm abandoning her when she‚Äôs going through a rough time. AITA if I just decide I‚Äôm not gonna go out of my way to repair this friendship?

In this time we made many friends. It is a small college so I made friends with practically everyone in the dorms (extrovert).
We break up. I would be moving away to another university next semester and she didnt want the long distance.

Once we start my last year here, we were still friendly to each other and since we shared the same friend group we hung around each other. At one point she got a new boyfriend and I didnt want to be around them cause i still had feelings for her. I choose to just avoid my friends for a while in order to not see her. At this point my friends tell me that they want to hang out with me and not her and that they were only nice to her because she made me happy. Eventually they as a group tell her that they dont want her hanging around them any more. They did this without telling me. This hurt her a lot and blamed me for it even though I told her otherwise. At this point she blocks my number and ignores me if im passing her and leaves the room if im there. Since we weren't together a lot of people started being mean to her. And saying things to me like ""how could you stand her voice"" and other negative things. I always just told them that I loved her and to be nice. For the most part they listened but it bothered me since shes is a sweet girl. Throughout the rest of the semester she was mostly friendless. But didnt get bullied all too much since I told everyone to quit.

Next semester rolls around and there are a lot of new people at the dorms. Me being an extrovert made friends with the majority of them. They however didnt know she was my Ex or who she was and would make fun of her for certain things. I would always tell them to stop. I tried in one occasion to talk to my ex and ask her who was bothering her were since I know she hates confrontation and wouldn't stand up for herself. She just ignored me and left the room. The semester went on and I was tired of telling people to be nice to her and stopped. I dont know why it should be my job to have to defend someone who obviously no longer cared about me as a friend. Her boyfriend could've helped. Well a couple of months after I stopped helping apparently the bullying got so bad that she quit college, changed her number and deleted all social media. She never reported things to the dean she was too shy.^ I feel so guilty for this, and feel like if I had kept trying to stop people from messing with her she would still be here getting her education."

She's been able to figure out every single collar, harness, and tieout system we've tried on her.

We're in the process of moving to a larger property outside of town to help her stay out of trouble.

c3jxdh	2019-06-22 02:12:55	disneyhalloween	AITA for recording my brother saying ‚ÄúNazi‚Äôs get so much hate but you have to understand them‚Äù	"EDIT: Ok please do not think my brother is a Nazi. He doesnt go on reddit or fourchan, and The orignal conversation I recorded was him and my sister arguing whether Nazi was a good insult or not and he was saying no while she was saying yes. He‚Äôs not political at all, which is my biggest gripe with his nonsense, he‚Äôs just trying to be funny and doesn‚Äôt care what he‚Äôs actual saying. I titled the post this because I thought it was provacative and might help get a response and illustrate the absolute extreme of what he says. because I‚Äôm actually really torn on this issue.

My younger brother can be really annoying sometimes and says really stupid things that we get into fights about. Today we were in my room and I hear him yell something about Nazis while arguing with our sister. I was about to respond but just started recording instead. I record about fifty seconds before interupting and saying something like ‚Äúwhat are you even saying bruh, do you hear yourself speak?‚Äù and then playing the recording.

Our sister and I thought it was hilarious, and my brother was flusttered but still kind of laughing. Then like half way through the recording it plays him saying ‚ÄúNazi‚Äôs get so much hate but you have to understand them‚Äù Me and my sister immediately started laughing and paused it. Then he starts calling me ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and that I‚Äôm taking it out of context and CNN and Fox News and whatever.

It is out of context. The next thing he  says is ‚Äúwe studied them and ....‚Äù but the fact that its so out of context is what‚Äôs funny. So I kept teasing him, asking what he would do if I put it on insta or something. Then he took my phone to delete it, but I took his and he was forced to exchage hostages without deleting it. A little later I was looking at photos of our youngest sister‚Äôs birth with her and he comes and says how she was only smiling with him because she hates me or whatever. So I played the small clip of the recording and he gets upset again and leaves. So now he‚Äôs watching a movie with our two sisters, which he‚Äôd been bothering me to go watch before (why he was in my room to start with) but now he doesn‚Äôt want me in his room because I‚Äôm fake news.

The thing is it‚Äôs really hard to tell when my brother is getting upset or his feelings are hurt because unless he‚Äôs actually mad he reacts the same way he does when he thinks something is funny, like all of this happened within 20 minutes or so and he was smiling the whole time and kind of whining. And we have the typical sibling relationship were we jokingly and nonjokingly fight a lot and sometimes I can‚Äôt tell which is which. 

But I felt kind of bad when he walked away from me and I started wondering if maybe I went to far? Today he wasn‚Äôt too bad but sometimes he really says some offensive/hurtlfull things and then forgets he said them, I kinda just wanted him to learn a leasson I guess? And it was also pretty funny I can admit that but I get he probably feels violated and powerless to be recorded like that, not that I‚Äôd ever actually do anything with it.

My mom said he shouldn‚Äôt say things without thinking and doesn‚Äôt think it was too big of a deal and he‚Äôs not actually mad but she usually takes my side. My younger sisters usually take his side because they like him more since he spends more time with them (I go to school out of state while he comes home every weekend) and Dad wasn‚Äôt there, so I don‚Äôt feel like I can get any unbiased opinions.

This happened 7 months ago with a cousin who we will call Alicia who is a lesbian or so she says, she makes a huge deal about being gay but I know for a fact she flirts with guys secretly and hasn‚Äôt even tried to date a girl. I don‚Äôt really care about that but what enrages me is that she constantly ‚Äúcomes out of the closet‚Äù in social events to make herself seem like a brave person. She did it at a party with friends, the first time we met when she was 14, to every new person she meets and most recently at one of our cousins funeral. When she did I snapped at her at the after event telling to knock it off, no one cares that you‚Äôre a lesbian and how dare you try to make this funeral about you. She started crying and tried to call me a homophobe to which I told her to stfu and get out of here, others of my family tried to call me down but some did speak up about her inappropriate speech at the burial. There were other things said between me and her out of anger and it finally got really nasty when I called her a fake lesbian attention whore who sucks the attention from anyone she meets and that she would suck d*ck if it put her in the spotlight.  Mean I know but I‚Äôve disliked her for so long and with the emotional turmoil of losing someone I was so close to sent me over the edge. She cried and ran away and we haven‚Äôt talked since it happened including no contact with her enabling mother. Some people say I should apologize but I would only do it if she did to which she said she owes no apology so I told her f*ck off, I still get flak from that side of the family every now and then.

c3juv2	2019-06-22 02:05:56		AITA for getting mad over people playing ping pong?	So me and my other 2 friends were at a hotel in Florida. We had been at the pool all day and had just gotten back from dinner at a restaurant away from the hotel. By the time we were back it was already dark. We decided to go back down to the pool area since there was a ping pong table and we thought it would be fun to go for a swim then play ping pong. As we got out of the pool and were a few yards away from the ping pong table a family of four walked right past us to the table before we could. We were kind of annoyed but figured it‚Äôs okay since we could just wait for a few minutes. Right as the family gets to the table the kids start climbing all over the table and screeching. (Keep in mind these kids had to be around 9 or 10 so imo this was pretty immature for their age). One of my friends half-jokingly said ‚Äúoh lord no‚Äù, then he told us he was just going to go back up to the hotel room. Well... it turns out my friend knew what he was doing. Me and my other friend decided to stay down and boy was that a mistake. We decided to stay close enough at a spot next to the table to the point that the people knew that we were there and waiting to play, but not stalking them. Well the family ‚Äúplayed‚Äù ping pong for the next 30 mins. What they really did is the family drank their Starbucks and the kids climbed on the table and played tag while occasionally playing an actual ping pong point that would last 2 shots. The reason we waited this long is because we thought the whole time that they would leave pretty soon. The family saw us too which made it even more annoying. After 30 mins we decided to just go because there was no way they were going to leave anytime soon. As we were leaving I said to my friend ‚Äúwhy do people have to be such inconsiderate jerks!?‚Äù Loud enough to where the family could hear.

c3jtdq	2019-06-22 02:02:04		AITA for ghosting a guy after he said someone else‚Äôs name during sex?	"Posting via mobile, so excuse the poor formatting...

I few weeks ago I connected with a guy I met on Tinder and we agreed to meet up for a date. Things went well, and we connected over dinner. From the beginning, he was very open and honest about recently finalizing his divorce and wanting to keep things casual, which I was totally fine with. 
A few drinks later and we manage make it back to his place where we proceed to do the deed. I‚Äôm trying to keep a tiny bit of modesty and will refrain from too many details, but during sex he blurted out another woman (I‚Äôm assuming his ex wife‚Äôs) name. He didn‚Äôt react or mention it at all, so I feel like he was not aware that it happened. 
Fast forward to present day... and he is asking to meet up again for another date. I was so turned off by what happened and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to get that out of my head, and have yet to respond to his messages.
I know going radio silent and ghosting someone is such a shitty thing to do, and I am usually so against it. I don‚Äôt know how to even begin to explain to him what is going through my head... ‚Äúheyyyy, so when we were having sex, you said someone else‚Äôs name and it really freaked me out so I don‚Äôt want to see you again.

c3jsu9	2019-06-22 02:00:47	yeetitaway2	AITA for leaving the room when my grandma teased me?	"Hello redditors, throwaway because i need to vent, but want to start tame. this happened a few days ago, but it's really been bothering me. there's a fair amount of backstory about just my family's realtionships and behaviors in general, but to put it succinctly, my family is very much a 'it doesn't matter how you take it, that isn't how i meant it' family. as in, if they say soemthing that is hurtful, if you mention it to them, they will double down and blame the person whose feelings is hurt because 'that's obviously not how i meant it/why did you take it that way'. with this in mind, let me set the scene

&#x200B;

Me, freshly awakened from a nap, feeling that fuzzy/clingy feeling that makes me seek out human interaction. In search of said human interaction, i enter the living room, and try to initiate small talk. my grandma looks up and says something to the effect of 'Lazarus has finally arisen'. tone was that line of could have been a joke, might have been meant snarkily.

little more backstory: naps are kind of frowned upon in my immediate family, for a reason which is a post in itself really.

Immediately I pull a 360 and say something to the effect of 'nevermind'. in my mind, it was neutral enough, and i didn't want to leave without saying anything or odds are i'd be followed back to my room and asked why i left the room.

&#x200B;

Big mistake. cue a ten minute lecture on how i was being disrespectful and have a bug up my ass. I admit i could have just shrugged the comment off, but at some point between starting and ending college, my tolerance for just 'putting up' with something i don't like shrunk, even (especially) for family.

&#x200B;

so reddit, am i the asshole?

edit for a bit more info: I usually handle teasing quite well, the two things that i really hate and have asked multiple times to be off limits after being encouraged to do so by a therapist is napping and food."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3jqts	2019-06-22 01:55:28		WIBTA for telling my sister how I really feel about her BF?	"I (23F) have always been really close to my siblings (27F) and (19M) and we all stayed close when my sister moved state for work 2 yrs ago.  She met a guy there (34M if that matters) and they hit it off and started dating, and tl;dr, I really didn't like him. The first time we met we drank to celebrate my sis' new apartment, he quickly got drunk and inappropriately bragged about ""spending time"" with my sister overnight. Sister laughed and didn't sound embarrassed but I was mortified.

I met him a few times after that when she brought him home to meet my mom or I visited and we never really got on, hes generally unpleasant to me and makes jokes at my expense. Hes fine with my bro so i dont know what the issue with me is. Things are awkward at best and frosty at worst. We dont greet each other and dont say goodbye, and I don't think any of us care. I dont personally like the way he treats my sister (she has uncontrollable anxiety and he often forgets to do the things she needs to be reassured/calmed down no matter how many times she (quietly,politely) asks, even if it's something small like getting her a glass of water or holding her) but shes happy with him so I guess that's what counts.

I've always really looked up to my sister and I hate how much hes dented her self esteem and self confidence just by not taking care of her anxiety problems. If he doesnt get home from a night with friends at the 'right' time my sister will think hes cheating because 'shes not good enough' and she'll be inconsolable for a few hours. All I think it would take from him is a text saying ""I'm okay, be home soon"" and my sis wouldn't be a shaking sweating crying mess but he never does. She thinks so highly of him that she thinks hes too good for her and it hurts me to see her like this.  the reason I ask if I'm TA is because my sister's brought up the idea of moving in together and marrying this guy and I dont know if I should keep quiet and deal with it or say something.

I kinda wanted an outsider perspective. my bro says I should let her know how I feel about how he treats her/me but idk if that's a good idea - is my own personal judgement of this guy seriously clouding the idea of my sister marrying him? My sisters anxiety is a lot to deal with so I'm really not sure if I'm going for the jugular just because hes struggling to cope and as a protective angry sibling I think she deserves more.

c3jpvy	2019-06-22 01:52:52		AITA for not helping my little brother out with rent money?	"I'm 26, my little brother is 20.

All throughout my childhood he's been a real piece of fucking shit. Always trying to get on my nerves and get me in trouble and piss me off in every way possible. Even with punishment and diplomacy and patience and ignoring, he never learned from ANYTHING since he has a severe learning disability.

I moved out a while back to get away from him. I couldn't deal with him. I tried but he was just perpetually a piece of shit. And when I did get away, I cut all contact with him, just said ""Should have thought about that before always trying to piss me off."" Haven't invited him to anything. Haven't talked to him at family gatherings. I even warned him that I'd do this if he didn't stop, and he didn't stop.

Because of his learning disability, he has trouble with reading and math and as such has a hard time finding a good job.

He recently got a job at McDonald's, but recently my parents started charging him rent, because he's directed his foolishness towards them, and they're threatening to kick him out if he doesn't have the money, because they've had enough of him.

Ever since he's been charged rent, he's found it harder and harder to pay it off, and a few days ago, has turned to me to help him, since I make the most money and am his brother.

But plain and simple, I just said to him, ""Should have thought about that when I warned you and you didn't stop. If you end up on the streets, that's your fault for being such a piece of shit.""

Ever since he's been spamming my email asking me for help, to where I had to block his contact because I've had enough. I am not contributing to his foolishness and asshattery.

Would I be charged with neglect if I didn't support him? And would I be the asshole? I mean I'm afraid of him ending up on the streets but at the same time am aware that I did warn him."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3jpus	2019-06-22 01:52:47	DreamingDown	AITA for getting upset that my husband helped pay for a prostitute in the Netherlands for our 17 year old son?	"I honestly can't believe I'm typing this out, but I feel like I need some perspective from people we don't know in real life. 

My son just finished his junior year of high school in late May, and the Monday afterward he took a 10 day trip to the Netherlands and Belgium with my husband. My husband is Indonesian, so he has many business partners, family and friends who chose to move to the Netherlands. As far as I was told, they had a great time.

Last night, I got a WhatsApp text from one of our cousins that stays in regular contact with both my son and I. My cousin said ""what did she look like? Have pictures?"" I read it, then it got deleted by our cousin (you can delete messages on WhatsApp, you'll see a message was sent and deleted but you won't see what was written). Our cousin apologized and I pretended not to have read anything. I figured it had something to do with my son though.

My son recently began his day camp counseling job so I figured he met a girl he works with and they hit it off or something. So I asked my son if he met anyone at his new job, and if he told our cousin about some ""pictures"". That was when his expression changed and he looked directly at my husband, who looked startled. My son blurted out that there are no pictures and my husband assured my son that things will be okay. That was when I realized something weird was going on, not just a summer fling

My son and my husband explained that they had been in Amsterdam and they had passed the Red Light District. They didn't walk through that street, but my son half-sarcastically asked my husband's former college housemate (who was showing them around the city) how old you have to be to get a hooker there and he said you have to be 16. That was when my husband himself made a joke about how my son can have some ""better company"" if he'd like. They laughed it off but on the second to last night there, my son asked if he could go see a girl in the red light district. My husband's friend warned him that the brothels can be seedy and dirty, so he offered to find an escort service that would be willing to go to their hotel. And so the next night on their last night in Amsterdam, a prostitute visited my son for an hour in the hotel while my husband and his friend went to dinner down the street. I didn't ask for the details, but my son assured me that he used a condom.

I just sat there not believing what I had just heard. I'm not opposed to sex work, but I didn't realize how uncomfortable I was with the idea of my son buying a woman until I heard it from him. And to hear how my husband hid it from me was even worse. My husband defended our son and said it wasn't that bad because our son used his savings from his previous job to pay half the fees and tip. I understand if my son and my husband want to do things without the interference of mom, but I felt that this was really pushing it."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3jpoi	2019-06-22 01:52:17		WIBTA for telling my best friend that it‚Äôs really not her business if her boyfriend and I were physically intimate?	"My (f28) best friend (f24) recently became official with her boyfriend (m22)

Myself and boyfriend hung out a few times after the party, and while he was definitely, for lack of a better phrase, DTF. I decided I was not, and upon discovering they were actually seeing each other, uninvited him along a weekend trip to stay with my family. 

I was a bit upset with her for not telling me they were a thing, otherwise I‚Äôd never have gone there in the first place (not to mention it looks like we were in a competition and I‚Äôm the sad friend with no partner) and was equal parts annoyed and weirded out as a mutual friend was telling me that he was doing all the ‚Äúromantic‚Äù stuff for her that he‚Äôd offered to me but I‚Äôd declined (making me candlelight dinners etc).

To be fair I have a lot more experience in casual dating, and the boyfriend has only ever had one (very long) relationship that ended horribly last year, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like he was kind of hedging his bets with the both of us, and whether or not he and I hooked up is something she should be asking him.

And I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I also think if the possibility of myself and him being intimate months before they were official is an issue, she should considered that BEFORE she committed to someone that did the dodgy on her friend.

I‚Äôve tried to reach out to my birth father a handful of times in my life- when I was 18, 25ish, and maybe 28 or so. He has answered my emails but doesn‚Äôt want to meet me. He left when my mom got pregnant. They were young (19), and over time I‚Äôve become more accepting of the reasons he left- they weren‚Äôt dating. And he was young. He was also a big college soccer player and probably worried for his future. He is married with a daughter now. She‚Äôs 20 or so. He also lives a few miles from me. It‚Äôs a bizarre feeling. 

Anyway, I look just like him. I am fully aware that I need to move on, seek therapy, get a grip, etc., but it‚Äôs always bothered me that I have to live with knowing what he looks like but he gets to carry on through life without knowing my face. It‚Äôs easy to pretend something (someone) doesn‚Äôt exist if you don‚Äôt know how to picture them. 

So anyway, his company‚Äôs (he owns it) Facebook is public and they posted a big photo of him for Father‚Äôs Day... saying HFD to the dad of the year. It made me half annoyed and half sick. In response, without any text included, I emailed him a picture of my face. It‚Äôs embedded and I know he saw it because he‚Äôs responded the handful of other times I‚Äôve ever emailed. My husband says I need to move on and it‚Äôs an asshole move when my birth father has clearly expressed that he‚Äôs not interested in ever meeting me.

They have a potential buyer who wanted to do a inspection and bring their handyman to check the condo. The realtor (who works for the landlord) requested to do an inspection of the house on the 17th with the buyer's handyman and family. I agreed to this, but soon after the realtor texted me to tell me that it was too far out, and they would need to make an appointment earlier. We agreed upon the 10th of June which was a whole week earlier. At this appointment we were supposed to have the buyer, realtor, and handyman come to do the inspection. So, on the 10th I came home from work expecting everything to go as planned. They handyman/inspector was at my house at the appointment time. He was able to get in the condo and check everything out, but the owners did not show up. I waited over an hour and figured that was the end of the story. Well it turns out that the condo had a lot of electrical issues, so the buyer requested to send another handyman to check out the sockets, this is where it went wrong. I come home to let the handyman in and am instead face to face with the handyman, the realtor (a different one then we had been working with) and the buyer and their entire family. The realtor told me they had a inspection scheduled, but when i told them they had scheduled their appointment last week for the inspection the buyer became irate. I told her I would be ok with the handyman coming in because that's what me and realtor and agreed on, but I wasnt about to let the entire come and inspect the house. They didnt show up the previous week, and i felt no obligation. My house was dirty. My girlfriend and I both work over 50 a week each. We had figured the handyman was only going to be in the living room, so we didnt really clean anything else in the house. The buyer told me her 90 year old mom was from out of the country and they wanted to show her the condo before she left. I told her sorry, but I was never made aware of this and i was not comfortable with it. As this rate she fell apart yelling at me until her daughter came and took her away.  I hated turning them down, but it wasnt planned and I did not feel any obligation to potential buyers who made an offer. Am I the Asshole ?	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Ok so, I‚Äôve written on here before about my grandma and my mom. In the last post I mentioned how I was hospitalized and what not, I was there for three weeks and had a surgery done on June 10th. I was discharged a week ago. I‚Äôm sorry for not responding to anyone, things got a bit hectic but I appreciated everything everyone said! Anyway onto the actual issue. Basically, I have Crohns. I was diagnosed about a year ago but they caught it a bit too late and the medication wasn‚Äôt strong enough so I needed to get surgery. Now some of my doctors have been saying how stress can make my symptoms worse but since I got the damaged part removed I should be fine. There‚Äôs always a chance that it could return though so I should be careful to not trigger it. Now, I‚Äôm no stranger to being stressed out a lot, and by that I mean like really stressed. To the point where I sometimes just lose my absolute shit. I have shit control over it but I‚Äôve been getting better at managing it. So today, I had a disagreement with my mom over text and I was talking to my grandma about it and she‚Äôs like no your mom is absolutely correct. (I don‚Äôt know if it matters to write about the disagreement but I can write about it if it‚Äôll help you guys decide, if not I‚Äôd rather just not talk about it. Just tell me if y‚Äôall need it.) I showed a bit of frustration at it but let it go because we just drifted from the convo. So about an hour ago, my grandma came to me and said how my health should be number one in my life and how I shouldn‚Äôt let anything get to me. I agree with that 100%. Then she‚Äôs like you shouldn‚Äôt let your parents decisions affect you, let it go and move on with your life. Don‚Äôt argue with what we and with what they do. I was like ok so basically I can‚Äôt give my opinion properly and argue my side without you guys on me about getting stressed? She‚Äôs like yes. I also asked that I can‚Äôt even defend my side and that you guys can do whatever you want and I have no say? She‚Äôs like yeah. That‚Äôs when I lost it and said how that‚Äôs the dumbest thing I‚Äôve EVER heard in my entire life, what an absolute joke of a thought. She‚Äôs like whatever that‚Äôs the truth and I‚Äôm like oh ok suRe. I stormed off into another room. Have been there ever since. Anyway I wanted to know if I was the ass for yelling at her. Does what she said actually make sense? Like my grandma is a really rational person and intelligent person. This doesn‚Äôt make sense at all. Like I literally can‚Äôt argue and state what I want without them jumping on my ass about it. Am I in the wrong? Should I have accepted what she said? I‚Äôm 15 if that makes a difference in your judgment. Sorry for the long post.


Edit: ok so basically the disagreement between my mom and I was that since I was in the hospital, I never got a chance to take my finals. I‚Äôm starting to gather all of the stuff I missed during my classes so I can properly study. The thing is, my dad helps me with my math and what not and I asked him if he could come over to my house (not my grandmas house, I was only visiting her since my mom didn‚Äôt want me to be alone, I‚Äôm going back home tomorrow) on Sunday to help me with my math. It would be a few hours maximum. Now, my parents are divorced and I‚Äôll admit they aren‚Äôt on the best terms, never were. I asked my mom and she said no that I could go over to his place. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable going over there since like it‚Äôs an Airbnb (my dad has recently moved to the country I‚Äôm currently living in so he‚Äôs trying to get adjusted) and I want to be comfortable where I am so I can study. I told my mom that it would only be a few hours and that I just needed to review. She didn‚Äôt really respond to any of my texts since she needed to go back to work."	Not the A-hole	0	0

&#x200B;

We were to be at the wedding and after-party until late, and then go to her sisters house (a work-in-progress home torn to shambles at the moments because of the renovations) and stay the night in order to take care of her dogs. I'm totally against this. My girlfriend's sister uses her for so much in her life; making her feel like it's her responsibility to do everything she wants. So, of course, ""we"" obliged. 

&#x200B;

Now, it's nearly 9 o'clock at night, and my girlfriend mentions to me that her sister wants me to go her their house (mind you, I will be dressed in a suit and tie at the wedding) after the mass and take care of her dogs. 

&#x200B;

I told her no due to it not being my responsibility, and that she would have to ask another person. My girlfriend did the whole ""please? Do it for me?"" thing, and again... I told her no. I refuse to do more for her sister than I need to. She treats my girlfriend like trash. Besides, I'm not going to get changed just to go over to her house for an hour and tend to her dogs. I love dogs. But it's still not my responsibility. 

&#x200B;

I continued to tell her that, and then my girlfriend hung up on me. I don't feel bad about telling her no. I'm just simply not doing it. He sister has plenty of friends who she could ask that she is much closer with. My gf is now texting me begging me to do it ""for her"" and saying how much it would mean to her. I'm not budging. 

&#x200B;

She is now very upset and texting me over and over.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: gf asked me to do something that isn't my responsibility for her sister. Her sister treats her like shit so I said no, stating that I wouldn't care to do her chores for her. GF begs ""do it for me"" and I still said no. AITA?

I did it because she was not grading ANYTHING, almost everyone in the class had an F because she graded one thing the entire grading period, then she yells at everyone when we try to talk to her about it saying that it is our fault for getting the grades we got, I was not one of the people with an F but it bothered me that she wouldn't even listen to us. It wasnt like she didnt have time to grade, this was back in winter and we had plenty of snow days. So I made an anonymous google account and typed an email saying how she needs to grade things and stop yelling at us for our grade. It was probably too harsh to send to a teacher. so AITA	Asshole	0	0

I defrosted the fridge by unconnecting  it and opening it but he kept plugging it back in and closing it. Aka it was not defrosted. He also left his locker unlocked which is an automatic failure. 

WE FAILED the inspection because of this. Along with the things we failed on was the floor, the sink, the window, the fridge.

&#x200B;

I attend a prestigious private university in one of the most populous cities in our region of the world. My family is very well off as my father is the CEO of one of the most successful holdings in our nation. I am studying engineering and in my faculty there is a man who I will refer to as Ali. Ali is Syrian and sought refuge in our country. He came here with his two young sisters and his mother. His father passed away in the Syrian war. His family currently lives in a small single bedroom apartment and are supported by my countries government aid. He has a sponsor so he can attend my University.

&#x200B;

Ali and I are both studying Civil Engineering. I have been in love with him since grade 1 of University. The problem is he has deep feelings for a Syrian girl who also ran away to my country. She doesn't want to be with him as far as I know. Since we are nearing graduation, I want to tell him that if he lets her go and chooses to start a relationship with me then him and his family would be financially secure for life. I want to propose this idea to him and his mother. I am not technically persuading him to marry me, but if he does he would be saving his family from ever having to go back to Syria. And he would know this. AITA for making this offer?

Edit: for everyone begging to know my nationality, I won‚Äôt reveal this however I will say that I am NOT Arab.

Ayen is staying at (her brother) Fred's house for the summer. Fred knew that she was a light user. So he made it clear that if she caused any ""problems"" he would kick her out. We wanted her to stay for full 3 months, so we overlooked a lot of ""problems"", didn't snitch on her. Even when his brother pulled us (her friends) aside and asked. Fred isn't a very nice person, it's abvious that he doesn't want her in the house even tho it's their parents house. He only lets her stay because he promised their mother.

Ayen always looked like she knew what she was doing. We weren't even worried about her until today, she really had her shit together before. We were hanging out as a group and Ayen went to bathroom. She had a yellow brownish powder in her bag. She looked fine when she came so we didn't really care. And then some people left until there were three of us. Her brother called her phone, she wasnt cabable of talking, we muted it. Her brother called several times, he started sent some messages, those looked like they were personal familiy issues so we didn't read them. Her brother didnt stop calling, we answered and he started yelling at us without listening. We lied that Ayen was in the bathroom and there was too much noise to hear the phone. I dont think he brlieved it but didnt say anything. We gave her Narcan and splashed water on her face, went outside so the wind would hit her.

We went home when she sobered up. It was a dreadful night for me. I dont know of we should tell her brother about it. I really want her to stay, this isnt her avarage night. It never happened before, i'm sure it wont in the future. she is a pleasant person to be around but this isn't right. I wont be helping her if I dont tell her brother. But I know her brother wont help her either. He's just going to send her back. Maybe he wont even buy her a plain ticket before kicking her out.

c3jbq1	2019-06-22 01:14:52	aitathrowaway12358	AITA for feeling disrespected when my wife puts my name after my children's names on cards?	"TL;DR - Found a card my wife gave to my mother and found that she signed my name last, and after my kids names, when signing the card. I told her she's making me feel disrespected and a lesser part of the family, and she said if I wanted my way, I should write the cards. AITA for feeling disrespected over her signing my name last on a card?

&#x200B;

Obligatory throwaway. My wife \[30F\] and I \[29M\] have been together for 10 years, married for two, and we have a 4 year old, a two year old and a two month old.

&#x200B;

We were over at my mother's house yesterday for a family event (it was her birthday last week). After I said happy birthday, she told me she got the gift and the card we had sent her the week before. This is probably where I fucked up, because I had no idea that we had sent her a card, let alone multiple, thinking that my wife took initiative because she personally loves getting cards. I read the card and noticed that at the bottom, she'd signed the card ""Wife, child 1, child 2, child 3, my name"". Typically, the husband/boyfriend's comes first, then the wife/girlfriend's name comes before all of their kids' names, I wouldn't even mind being second after my wife instead of first on the card. It rubbed me the wrong way that she'd purposely put my name after my kids. Then, I noticed she'd done that with every single card she had sent on our behalf (my mother has them on display) for the past few years and I can only assume she does it too when she sends cards to other family members too.

&#x200B;

I asked her about it when we were at home, and she didn't see anything wrong with it, saying that if I wanted my name first, then I should write the cards to my family. But I don't think it's about that, I feel like when she's putting my name after my kids' names, she's undermining me as a husband, father and part of my family, and I feel plain disrespected. When I told her how I felt, she apologized for making me feel disrespected, but the offer still stands; if I wanted to be first on the card, I need to write the cards. Nothing really got solved other than me feeling ignored, so I've been trying to work out how to talk about it with her.

&#x200B;

AITA for feeling disrespected because my wife puts my name last, and after my kids' names, when she's signing cards for my family?

&#x200B;

Edit: To me, I don't feel ""lesser"" than my children, I just feel like the husband and wife should be paired together, as it is proper etiquette (as a few people pointed out in the comments). Still, I don't think it's right for my wife to be passive aggressive about name order because I've forgotten birthdays, anniversaries and special events for family members on a few occasions."

Thing is the week before the guest was due to arrive my parents left on vacation out of state and they didn't come back until the guest was practically there. As a result I was alone to clean and detail the guest room and the rest of the house although mom didn't say exactly what she wanted cleaned (the guest room and bathroom was a given.) so I cleaned everything up and downstares, did the laundry, kept up with the gardening, cleaned/restalked the fridged ect. Everything but mom's room.

My mom is pretty dirty and her room has a shoes, dirty clothes, and food wrappers spinkled all around. I just didn't want to clean it. I don't know, I think it was mostly the dirty clothes/underware that I didn't feel like touching. I just closed the door so nothing could be seen.

Well, mom and dad came home hours before the guest and when she discovered her room wasn't clean she started yelling at me. she was telling me I'm an ungrateful, lazy brat who can't do anything right. She said that when she wants the whole house ready she means the *whole* house. Now I just feel like I didn't a good enough job but I still feel grossed out by her clothes. i'm so conflicted.

c3j8ln	2019-06-22 01:06:41		AITA for being overly sensitive about pictures that include me on social media?	"So today, my boyfriend posted a picture of him and I together at prom online. I‚Äôm super insecure and I really hate how I look. (I don‚Äôt understand what he sees in me.) And I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with pictures of me online. 

I don‚Äôt use social media ever because of that as well. He convinced me to download it but I have no interest in other people‚Äôs lives whatsoever. 

On the app, I have my friends added but whenever I see my picture posted I feel insecure and I hate it. I wish they asked me first. I thought people were supposed to ask when posting pictures of other people? I do my best to ignore the pictures but I feel awful when I see myself. I don‚Äôt hold grudges towards them and I know people our age love constantly posting pictures. I get that. 

I don‚Äôt tell my friends to delete their pictures because I don‚Äôt want to seem like a terrible person but I thought my boyfriend would understand today. I asked him if he could delete his picture that he posted but he did declined because people already ‚Äúliked‚Äù his photos. It was a post of 4 photos but I just wanted him to take out the one of me. 

I got pretty upset and sorta spanked him. Not hard enough to hurt him and not with the intention to. If it makes sense, we spank each other for fun sometimes when we‚Äôre going up the stairs or just when we stand around so it‚Äôs a normal thing for us I guess. (I wanted to apologize for that today if it did hurt him.)

After some time, my bf then brought up my guy friend who also had a picture with me posted. This is one of those posts I try to ignore. He was trying to connect dots and come to the conclusion that I like him still but that honestly angered me. I love my bf very much and I try to spend as much time with him without bothering him or seem clingy. I liked my friend a very long time ago but even now I only speak to him once every 3 months. 

I didn‚Äôt want to argue over something like this so I just stayed quiet and left the room. We used to argue about stupid stuff all the time and I didn‚Äôt want this to be another one of those times. I thought my bf would understand but I guess he didn‚Äôt so I just deleted my social media instead. He‚Äôs not talking to me right now but when he does I really want to apologize and give him a hug."		1	0

I‚Äôll just call her Ms A and my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô  will be called J 

So the J asked the teacher if she could go to the bathroom 

J: Ms A can I go to the bathroom?
Ms A: yeah just leave your phone on your desk.

and so J puts her phone on her desk and when Ms A isn‚Äôt looking she grabs her phone and runs to the door. I yelled at her to come back and put her phone back but she ignored my warnings so I told the teacher that she took her phone and so fourth when she came back Ms A took J‚Äôs phone away and said she could have it back at the end of class

J: did you snitch?
T: no Ms A found it 

and then a ‚Äòfriend‚Äô of mine that shall be known as S said

OP: uhh yeah I snitched 
J: Bro ITS NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS JUST SHUT THE F**K UP 
OP: bro you took your phone when Ms A told you to leave it here and why did you have to bring your phone to the bathroom? 
J: SHUT THE F*** UP 
S: shouldn‚Äôt you apologise? 
OP: dude J isn‚Äôt going to accept my apology cause most people don‚Äôt really accept my apologies 
J: OH SO YOU THINK IM LIKE EVERY BODY ELSE? NOW IM EVEN MORE PISSED 
OP: you have done so many bad things I couldn‚Äôt handle the guilt of keeping it all a secret and besides your phone being taken away for like 15 minutes isn‚Äôt going to harm you
J: JUST LEAVE ME THE F*** ALONE. YOU JUST LOST A FRIEND 

It seems like it‚Äôs too late to save this friendship with J and she‚Äôs in all of my classes so i can‚Äôt escape her. I feel like it was wrong to snitch on her like that but the other half of me felt it was the right thing to do and besides she was kind of a toxic friend."		1	0

What if he really would do some of the awful stuff he jokes about?‚Äù  I kept a distance but never really thought it was a done deal.

The other day, I learned that he admitted (to my boyfriend) that he killed a dog.  Intentionally.  It was his ex girlfriend‚Äôs dog.  

Now, I remember when the dog died.  There is a chance that this guy is lying.  The dog was old and sick, and the ex girlfriend would not have fucked around - she would have taken him to the vet, she would have pressed criminal charges.  But, to me, lying about killing a dog doesn‚Äôt make things better; no normal person kills a dog, or lies about it.

I told my boyfriend that under NO circumstances is he allowed in our house ever again.  I told him I was already toying with the idea of cutting him off completely, and this is the final straw for me.  He has come over once in a while with friends to pregame because we have the condo downtown - I told my boyfriend that, moving forward, he is 100% banned from the household.  

I told my boyfriend if I find out that he has been allowed in our house, even when I‚Äôm not there, I *will* tell people what he said.

So my boyfriend is now telling me that he feels uncomfortable telling me anything else about people, because he‚Äôs ‚Äúafraid of how I will react.‚Äù  He‚Äôs telling me I‚Äôm being judgmental because, people change.

I've been seeing a woman I really like for six weeks. I can really see myself dating her and having a future with this Potential Girlfriend (PG) . When we started sleeping together it got a bit embarrassing as I could never 'perform' when using a condom. It meant I felt like a disappointment to PG and I was scared she would go with somebody else. We discussed not using condoms as she was on birth control. PG said she wanted me to get tested as she had gotten the all clear the week before we started dating and she hasn't been with anyone since. I told her that I was clear because I was 100% sure at the time that I was. 

I got tested one year ago and I had only slept with one woman after that. We didn't use condoms because she said she was all clear and on the pill too. I thought because of that I was clear too. PG is a bit of a  hypochondriac and said she wanted me to get tested so I said I would but I assured her I was clean and promised that I had used condoms the whole time with the only woman I had been with since getting tested. (I only said it because I was confident I was clear)

I got my results back and I have chlamydia.  Therefore so does PG now. The other person was a liar.  I told PG. She started to cry and she really got angry about the fact I wasnt truthful. She said that if I had been honest about the fact I didn't use condoms with the last person at least she could have taken some accountability for it. I think she's going to ghost me.

I feel like hearing the positive parts of these comments might make him feel good (by letting him know that my family really really likes him), but being reminded that he can't go on these trips and stuff might hurt him, making telling him at all an unnecessary and hurtful action.

c3iq1g	2019-06-22 00:18:36	aldriecht	AITA for making people watch through the credits of a movie with me?	"I‚Äôm a film student and it‚Äôs a tradition I‚Äôve been taught by my teachers that you‚Äôd watch through the credits as form of acknowledgment to the work every single person has put into a movie.

I‚Äôve never put it into consideration up till I started studying film but I realized that it‚Äôd be a dream for me to end up being one of those people in the credits.

I usually watch movies late at night with my sister and she usually leaves when the credits start rolling (unless there‚Äôs a post/mid credit scene, thanks Marvel!) and ends up frustrated, thinking that it‚Äôs just wasting her time.

She usually has to wait for me and I feel that it kinda ruins her overall experience because we go home together.

I feel bad that because of this tradition she has to  effectively waste her time but I‚Äôm not telling her (or anyone) that they HAVE to watch the credits.

Most of the other people that I watch movies with haven‚Äôt expressed a clear dislike for this (they usually use their phones or leave the theatre first).

There are times where the time spent watching the credits has resulted in unfortunate outcomes like missing the last train/bus and having to spend money on a taxi home. 

But the fact that people have to wait through them for me makes me feel really guilty and I do feel like their time could be better spent if they didn‚Äôt have to wait for me. 

I also feel kinda awkward when we‚Äôre usually the last few people left and the staff cleaners start cleaning the theatre. 

For the record, I think my sister would at least stay if she knew I was actually going to be in the credits but that‚Äôs a pipe dream away.

My problems with her have arisen in the last year or so. 


She has become obsessed with her self diagnosed mental health to the point that she will blame random things on a mental illness she hasn‚Äôt been diagnosed with. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with a few and can recognize certain aspects of it in her but she blows everything out of proportion from what I can tell. I‚Äôm basically her therapist at this point, whenever a minor issue arises she‚Äôll text me and it‚Äôs been taxing as she never takes my advice and I don‚Äôt know what else to do.


She‚Äôs also been very flaunting her being bi, but she has stated she wouldn‚Äôt date a girl and is in a relationship with a guy. She claims she doesn‚Äôt want people to know yet it‚Äôs one of the first things she will tell her new friends.

I‚Äôve been trying to distance myself from the group of mutual I‚Äôm in with her, they‚Äôre all girls who are a tad bit misandrist and I feel like I‚Äôm just there because I‚Äôm the ‚Äúgay friend‚Äù when I don‚Äôt want that to be the thing people know me for. They all think I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo masculine‚Äù or whatever and want me to go do makeup with them and stuff I personally dislike.


I want to tell her that she has to stop self diagnosing herself, she has to stop using the fact she claims she‚Äôs bi for attention, she has to stop using me as her therapist and talk to her actual therapist (yeah she has one but she doesn‚Äôt talk to her), she has to stop telling everyone I‚Äôm gay and that I‚Äôll be taking a break from chatting and seeing her until she can find a way to stop being so dependent on me. But I‚Äôm afraid of what I‚Äôll do to her. I know her parents aren‚Äôt supportive and I don‚Äôt know how close she is to our mutual friends. Am I the one whose just being insensitive and harsh?

EDIT/INFO: I still want to be friends with her, but I want her to get her baggage together while we take a break. I know for a fact I‚Äôm one of like five close friends she trusts. I have told her many times that I would always stick with her no matter what but that was before she got so open."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3imlb	2019-06-22 00:10:23	Supermog2	AITA for using my skateboard as a traveling method at ~1AM on the street?	"I (19M)arrived to my town at ~1AM, the bus dropped me off 30minutes from my home like usually. I had my skateboard with me so I decided to hop on it to get home. I got home in 7-8 minutes because it was all downhill and the streets were in good shape with no cracks so I didn't fall. On my way home, I got honked at by a car which surprised me because I didn't think I did anything dangerous.

I deliberately took a less crowded route which had more light and had a lower speed limit so that I could be seen easier. I wasn't going that fast, ~15 km/h at max (there is a speedometer in one of the streets). I didn't do any tricks, I was strictly using my skateboard as a traveling method.

Pavement was not a possibility as they were full of cracks which I would've fallen over many times.
I was not under the influence of alcohol.

It really got me thinking, did I do anything dangerous by using my skateboard at night? Should I have just walked instead? AITA?

Edit: I couldn't go that fast as I mentioned. I was always in a ""be ready to stop"" mode even when I saw the streets 100-150 metres ahead. I had to take no turns. Of course I went with the mindset of ""If I happen to get hit, it would be only my fault."" There were no parts where there were no streetlights and there were no parts where I didn't see the street 40-50 metres ahead of me. I was wearing a grey shirt and bright green shorts I am 1.90m, idk if that'd help notice me."	Asshole	0	0

c3ikeg	2019-06-22 00:04:53	HalfACheeseHead	WIBTA if I purposefully cut my hair before my sister's wedding?	"Alright, I am sure being spiteful can be considered being an asshole. However let me give you the backstory here as I think it's justified.

My sister (30F) is getting married in October. I (21F) am her maid of honor. I'm also a lesbian. I dress a bit more masculine than a lot of girls, but I like to be pretty and dress in cute clothes sometimes too.

I had my hair very short for a long time, but I recently grew it out a little below my shoulders. I wasn't planning on cutting my hair, but mt sister made sure to tell me not to cut it short before the wedding. Okay, cool? I wasn't planning on it so its weird she would bring it up out of nowhere.

Then we went bridesmaids dress shopping. Again, I was ALREADY planning on wearing a dress. My sister told me I am NOT to wear a tux, that we are all wearing dresses. I never even brought up wanting to wear a tux EVER in my life. I don't like dresses but I do wear them for formal events.

And now today: my uncle was talking with me. He was asking how I'm supposed to get ripped if I don't eat meat. I brought up that I'll be seeing him in 4 months again (for the wedding) and I'll show him that you can be muscular and not eat meat. 

My sister busted in ""No."" 

What do you mean no?

""You're not going to be buff for my wedding.""

Okay no one can get incredibly defined and massive in 4 months.. I just want to have muscle.

""No.""

With all this said and done, I want to cut my hair off. I won't get jacked enough in 4 months to bother her, and I wont wear a tux because we already have the dresses (and again, I don't like tuxs). 

Reddit, WIBTA if I purposefully cut my hair off before my sister's wedding? 

(My stepmom overheard me upset speaking with my girlfriend and tried calming me down: ""bridezilla"" is a true occurrence, my sister is a perfectionist, she may just have a specific picture in mind for her wedding. And I understand what she was saying.... I would like to add that my sister has never been comfortable with me being gay, and has called me homophobic slurs my whole life. That's the full story, thanks)."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c3ijig	2019-06-22 00:02:38		AITA For saying health issues aren‚Äôt an excuse to be fat?	"I have a friend who is very overweight, who has another friend who is also very overweight.

In a conversation with these ladies, we got on to the topic of weight. I expressed the dissatisfaction I‚Äôm experiencing after dealing with multiple ongoing health issues over the past few years. My friends friend (let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúJane‚Äù) jumped down my throat about how I could ‚Äúeat more‚Äù and ‚Äúif you‚Äôre fat what am I.‚Äù I explained that it isn‚Äôt about her, but rather about how I feel about myself and the ways my body has changed a bit. This led Jane into a long rant about how some people can‚Äôt help being fat, and how she‚Äôs only overweight because of her health issues.

This vexed me, so I said many people have health issues but still figure out ways to take care of themselves. She said she has hypothyroidism, so unlike me she doesn‚Äôt have energy to workout.

 I explained that I too also have hypothyroidism, and that in fact, I don‚Äôt even have a thyroid. But that I still manage what I ate even when I can‚Äôt go to the gym. 

 I also said that I understand you gain some weight dealing with thyroid issues but not enough to become morbidly obese. That it‚Äôs very rare to have a health problem that makes you gain enough weight to be THAT overweight, and hypothyroidism definitely isn‚Äôt one of them. At some point people have to acknowledge that some weight gained is their fault and not their disease. She started crying and told me I was fat shaming her, and my friend agreed. 

She‚Äôs made a lot of comments in the past about my body, and has implied I have an eating disorder (I don‚Äôt, like at all). She always tells people I‚Äôm only skinny because I don‚Äôt eat. (Also a lie).

My friend is saying I should apologize to Jane but I stand by everything I said she‚Äôs been a passive aggressive bitch to me for too long. 

I WILL apologize though if I‚Äôm in the wrong, so AITA?"		1	0

For my graduation gift, I asked my parents for some money to put toward a vacation in July for me and said boyfriend. Because it‚Äôs my graduation gift, I paid entirely for the hotel and I plan to (hopefully) split food costs pretty evenly. 

The hotel used up most of my money for the trip, so I have been trying to save up any money I can to use for gas, food, etc. My boyfriend seems to be under the impression that my parents will just ‚Äúgive me more‚Äù if I don‚Äôt have enough, which isn‚Äôt the case. I‚Äôm not sure how much my boyfriend plans to contribute on this trip, so some lack of communication does fall on me.

However, the other day he asked for some cash because he needed adderal for a long night of studying. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with this but I handed him a 20 (part of my graduation money). When I handed it to him, I told him I expect it back because that‚Äôs my graduation money and I don‚Äôt have a source of income for a month. 

It‚Äôs been about a week and no money back. I‚Äôm really not one to make 20 dollars a big deal, but I really don‚Äôt have much disposable income.

I met her half way between our states, and was driving home just chit chatting, and everything seemed fine.

I'm back in school because I saved up tons of money from work to pay for it and have doing amazing.

"So my friends and I (mostly me) have been planning a trip to a music festival for over a month. The person in question, who I'll refer to as D, has backed out before then suddenly wants to go. Ok, fine. I buy the tickets, book the hotel room and work out the fine details.

Cut to 2 days ago, I get told by our mutual friend, G, that they're planning on leaving at 6PM due to work. Ok, cool. I'm annoyed but whatever.  I have family in this town that I want to see, and the only time available is sometime tonight (Friday, day 1 of our trip. I'm in our hotel room waiting for something to happen as I type this). I message our group chat so they know I'm here, we're checked in and their room keys are at the desk in case I'm not here. 

D springs that he's bringing ""A friend"" (that's literally what he said) not only on me, but G as well. I freaked out because I worked really hard to plan this and don't like sudden changes to plans l I'm keeping this, and don't want to be stuck in the same room as a total stranger. 

D said he's playing his part and it's not a big deal, and doesn't understand why I'm not comfortable with that.

AITA for basically blowing up and telling him that it's not cool for him to spring shit like that on me last minute?

UPDATE AND FOLLOWUP AITA

The weekend went horribly. D treated me like total shit the whole time (complained when I got sick and didn't want to go out (they went out without me), the wait time at a restaurant I suggested, and then called me going to a candy store that sells retro candy to get some for my mom stupid) and G didn't step in and say anything. I ended up hiding in the candy stores bathroom and crying because I was so miserable. 

I decided I was done. Told G that I didn't feel wanted by them and was going home, said bye to him, and drove the 4 hours back to my city. They stayed well into the night and the only times I talked to G was letting him know I was home, and him doing the same. D apparently didn't even realize I was leaving until he saw me walking back towards my car.

I haven't spoken to them since, and I'm kind of refusing to speak to D until he apologizes to me (which part of me knows will never happen)

c3i497	2019-06-21 23:24:49	throwaway1616-	AITA for refusing to pay for somebody's phone I accidentally broke?	"So a few weeks after arriving to start an exchange in a different country I go along to a social event put on by the university at the local rec centre. Before we all split off into groups we are all told by the student organisation running the event that it is our responsibility to look after our personal belongings and that there are lockers available if we need them. Most people (myself included) don't use the lockers, and when my group is rotated to play on the basketball courts I wrap my phone in my hoodie and put it in the corner of the room like most others.

&#x200B;

A few people ('Steve' included) put their phones in the open on the small wooden benches at the ends of each court by the hoops. As we're playing, I take a shot and it bounces off the backboard and smashes right onto Steve's phone. When I find out who owned the phone I obviously apologise and because I feel bad for him I offer to ""put some money towards getting a new screen"" (the words I used). He seems happy with this and says he'll be in later contact to arrange the details.

&#x200B;

Fast-forward a few days and I get a message from him saying that the repair cost 150 euros and he expects me to pay in full. This took me completely off guard, since in my country repairs would usually only cost the equivalent of 30-50 euros, and since I only offered to pay for some of it. I even looked up the cost for screen repairs in our city and turns out he went to an apple store instead of a local repair shop which would have only cost 50 euros. I tell him that I'm willing to pay 25 euros towards it - half of what the repair should have cost. Cue him telling me that I'm obliged to pay him at least half of the amount he paid, and that he wants to meet in person to deal with the conflict. I tell him repeatedly that I feel uncomfortable meeting in person, and that I literally could not afford to pay 75 euros due to my immediate financial circumstances, and also because I didn't think it was fair. 

&#x200B;

After some more back and forward he starts asking some of my friends where I live and what events I'm going to (since I had only given him my facebook information prior), so I send him a message detailing my reasons for not paying him and then block him completely (if anyone wants, I can post this message in the comments or else I'll exceed my post character limit). I also unfriend a few people I know that are close to him, since a few of them start sending me messages out of the blue asking if I wanted to hang out. I didn't end up staying friends with anybody in those groups, nor did I go to any future exchange events out of fear for my own safety, so as far as I'm concerned the matter is resolved. Years have past and he's still on my facebook block list, and I don't intend to contact him again UNLESS the consensus is that I was TA, which is why I'm posting it here. So tell me, AITA?"

c3i1ti	2019-06-21 23:18:54	invisibleagain	AITA for telling a bullied friend he has no idea what he's talking about?	"I have a very close friend group made up of the sort-of outsiders kinda people. Some of us are part of the LGBT community in a conservative school, some come from very poor or abusive backgrounds, some have incredibly unstable home lives, some are foster kids. It's small, and we all feel safe and open with each other because we know everyone here has seen and been through some shit. We take care not to hit each other's triggers or be too assholeish-like one girl has issues with sex, so we don't make lewd jokes as it tends to set her off on panic attacks.

One of my friends has had some serious problems with bullying. His tormentors haven't physically attacked him, but he's been degraded and has anxiety and body issues due to it. Sometimes he stutters because his anxiety is so high. He's one of my best friends, and normally I'd always have his back, but the other day he was listening to some song about being invisible and there was a lyric about wishing all they had was sticks and stones. He specifically picked out that lyric to be like yeah, people don't get how words are so much worse.

Now, I'm one of the kids from an abusive background (now in the foster system, in a safe house). It was some pretty difficult and terrible years, though, and I don't think this kid knows what he's talking about since he's never had to hide bruises or lie to an ER doctor about a broken bone. You want people to stop treating you like shit, then sure, I do too. But believe me, you don't want them to beat you like shit instead. I told him he doesn't know what he's talking about and that's ridiculous to say, and he started his stutter (which made me feel bad) and left. A few of the others said I was out of line since I know how anxious he is and how much he's been hurt, and he doesn't need it from me too.

But I still think he had no idea what he was saying, and it was a bit insensitive to talk about wishing people used sticks instead of words in front of an abuse victim. AITA for saying something?

Edit: Alright, I think I got the message. To all of the people saying not to compare abuse, I wasn't and that isn't the way I meant it. But since it came across that way, I can probably assume that's the way my friends took it. I'll apologize and try to come up with a better way to talk to him about things like this.

c3i1bs	2019-06-21 23:17:44		AITA for being upset that my husband borrowed $2000 from his mother without my knowledge?	"So today as I was leaving work, I got a call from my husband asking me to stop by an ATM to see if it would let me take out $1000. I asked him why, and he said he‚Äôll tell me when I get home and to just see. Okay... so I stopped and tried, but it only let me take out $400. I called him and told him and asked him what it was for, again, and he still said he‚Äôll talk to me when I get home.

So of course when I get home the first thing I ask is what he needs $1000 for, and he said he doesn‚Äôt need $1000, he needs $2000. *What. For?!?!?!!?* A truck he found on Facebook.

Now I will grant him, we do need a new vehicle. He drives a shitty minivan that definitely has some issues.  He says this truck is ‚Äúone that you never see for sale at this price‚Äù. But we don‚Äôt have $2000. We barely have $1000. So I asked him where he‚Äôs gonna get $2000 from. He said he called his mom and borrowed it from her.

I was... pretty upset. I told him that it was bullshit that he didn‚Äôt talk to me before asking his mom for that much money. He said it was 4:30 and he had to hurry before the bank closed, so he didn‚Äôt have time.

Now he‚Äôs upset because I think he feels I overreacted, and I‚Äôm upset because he thinks it‚Äôs ridiculous I‚Äôm upset about this.

c3i0v5	2019-06-21 23:16:30	sparklyh0e	AITA For wanting to retroactively turn down being my mom's maid of honor?	"TL:DR My mom got engaged to an unstable asshole and refuses to accept her own role in our toxic relationship. AITA for wanting to remove myself from the Maid of Honor responsibility?

My mom announced that she was engaged about 8 months ago. I live out of state so I asked around my family to get a general vibe for the guy before meeting him. I didn't hear anything too crazy so I didn't think much of our impending meeting.

Well. After meeting I realized he was just a repeat of all the mistakes she made with my own father in their early days. Alcoholic/drunk driving. Unresolved PTSD. Gun fanatic (which makes her uncomfortable, or it used to). Emotional whiplash.
My brother and I expressed our distress at her values being suddenly forgotten and were met with her distrust.
Now she's suddenly started playing this strange game of secrets where she keeps a lot of information secret from members of the family and then gets upset if anyone 'shares her business'. Basic information like, what state she's in, how her doctor's visits went, whether or not her fiancee is in jail. You know, the usual.
So now I'm CONCERNED. Like, ""do you need HELP? Is he hurting you? Let me in!""

Before now I always thought, oh he makes her happy, he can support her (she's legally blind), and they can have a life of traveling which she loves. But now...
I accepted the Maid of Honor position because I love my mom and I want her to be happy. But shouldnt the MoH be someone that has supported you through the relationship? I dont feel that I support her relationship with this man and her relationship with me has gotten more toxic since theirs began...

c3hzng	2019-06-21 23:13:36	exitmusic_for_a_film	AITA for making a joke about a black girl‚Äôs skin?	"English isn‚Äôt my first language, I‚Äôll try and make this readable.

Last year I was at a party and I was in a circle of people passing joints around. At one point, a guy swings his joint around while talking and touches a black girl‚Äôs arm with it. He apologised and then she said something like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, looks like it didn‚Äôt leave a burnt mark‚Äù.
So I jokingly said ‚Äúwell of course it didn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre black‚Äù.
Everyone was shocked and demanded I apologised for my racist comment.

Now, I come from a country where it‚Äôs really rare to see black people, and this story happened when I was abroad in a country with more black people around, so taking into account that I‚Äôm not used to interact with them and I might accidentally say something hurtful, I apologised even if I felt I wasn‚Äôt being racist, cause I didn‚Äôt want anyone to be offended.

But now I‚Äôm thinking about it again and I still don‚Äôt see how my comment was inappropriate, so if it was please explain to me why, I don‚Äôt wanna make the same mistake again.

My rationale is that I didn‚Äôt say that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs black so she must steal‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äôs black so she must be lazy‚Äù, I just implied that she‚Äôs black, so it‚Äôs hard to see a burnt spot on her skin. It‚Äôs logic, there‚Äôs no prejudice or racism in it.
Maybe I said something borderline inappropriate, maybe I could have kept it for myself, but I don‚Äôt think it was racist.

AITA?

Edit: Seeing what most of the comments say, I think I need to clarify: of course I didn‚Äôt mean that black skin doesn‚Äôt burn, I know it burns. That‚Äôs why it was a joke, I wanted to say something absurd. I‚Äôm probably still the A-hole, but not a total idiot.

Edit: Well, I‚Äôve read enough. The response is unanimous, I am indeed the asshole. I accept it, I‚Äôll work on that and try not to make the same mistake again. I just want to say that I never meant to offend anyone, I just joke around a lot, and I apologise if I upset anyone with this post, it wasn‚Äôt my intention. Thank you all for the feedback guys!"

Due to medications and stress, I always have a very low libido, but every time I get to see him I feel pressured to have sex.  I'm not at all attracted to him and I wish there was something much more interesting in this relationship.

Half a year ago, I broke up with him because I felt unsafe and objectified during the relationship.  
He'd constantly bring up how I was barely legal and he would never stop making inappropriate jokes despite me telling him clearly that I don't appreciate him talking about me like that.
I'm very uncomfortable with PDA and touching, but he'd complain and get upset every time I wouldn't kiss him or hold his hand.

I cut him off completely for a few days after breaking up with him, but he'd leave me voicemails of him crying and begging for me back alongside essay-length texts explaining that he would be okay with an open relationship (which I want no part in).

I felt bad for him and got back with him out of pity, but since then, I've felt even more hatred and disgust towards his behavior.  I'm embarrassed to be seen around someone like him.  I feel disgusting seeing him because I know he'll beg me to sleep with him.

I don't talk to him nearly as much as I used to before we broke up and sometimes deliberately avoid talking to him so I can spend time on studying or my hobbies.

It's hard to converse with him on these issues because I feel like if I made him upset, he'd blackmail me into staying with him or bother me about how he'll find someone better, like he does to his exes.

"After my friend had stayed at my place two separate occasions in a week, where i picked her up close to midnight and drove her to train station at 5:30 am, was texting me when her flight back home was delayed and her mom was flying into her city. so her mom had to stay in a hotel for the night, since she didnt make it back in time. She was texting me, explaining how her mom had to pay $200 for hotel and transportation and what not. So I said, ""you could pay her back with the money you saved money by staying here and by me picking you up. pay her $100. So it will even out.""

just some background. the second time she was here, she originally said she was going to rent a car, but then when she got here, at 10pm she changed her mind (she hadn't ever reserved the car) and asked me to pick her up, which was at 11:30. we got home past midnight and then i had to drive her in the morning at 6am.  so i got like 4 hours sleep.  She did give us a token of appreciation in the form of a bunch of samples of products she got for free at a trade show.  when her flight was delayed, she said it was canceled and the next flight she was able to get was 3 days later.  i offered that she can come back to our place if needed a place to stay but we were already in bed that time (it was past 10pm), so she'd have to get herself to our place. she declined the offer and said she'd sleep at the airport.  then the next morning she said she got a flight for that morning.

c3hwnj	2019-06-21 23:06:18	TakeMe_ToTheMoon	WIBTA for telling my sister I don‚Äôt want to travel with her?	"So I (22F) recently came home from a 10 day solo trip to Greece. My little sister (21F) immediately demanded that I take her with me on my next international trip, which I‚Äôm not a fan of for various reasons.

1. She would slow me down and end up costing me more money. I like to travel light (I bring only a carry on and one small daypack as my personal item on flights), but she is a heavy packer and would bring large luggage, which of course she would have to check for flights and slow me down at airports if there are connecting flights. I am also someone who prefers to stay in hostels since I can save money on accommodation and also socialize with other travelers. She would never do this - she is a hotel only kind of person. She went on a trip to Tybee Island, GA with her ex-bf a year ago and spent almost as much money on a hotel for the two of them for four nights as I did on my accommodations in Greece for nine nights. Plus, she would not want to socialize with people in a hostel. 

2. Our interests are very different. I enjoy trying new things and really experiencing local culture - off the beaten path kind of things, local food, local nightlife scene, outdoors activities like hiking if the destination permits, etc. She likes to stick to the touristy things and really likes to shop. I don‚Äôt mind some shopping but I don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of my time that way. She is also a picky eater and I can‚Äôt see her being down to try a lot of different foods abroad. She doesn‚Äôt like going out/drinking at all either, but it‚Äôs something I like to do if the location allows.

3. Despite being 21, she acts like she‚Äôs 16. She‚Äôs really volatile and the littlest things tend to set her off with no warning - she will become completely insufferable and not fun to be around. I‚Äôm afraid that if I travel with her and she gets into one of her moods, it will ruin part of the trip. This has happened before on a family trip to Myrtle Beach and my whole family was affected by it.

4. She tends to be prejudiced toward people of different backgrounds, especially people of color. Which makes me wonder why she even wants to travel at all?

Overall, I just don‚Äôt think our personalities and travel styles mesh together to make an international trip work or be satisfying for both of us. However, when I inevitability start to plan my next trip I know that my parents and her would have something negative to say if I didn‚Äôt include her... Especially if I decide to go somewhere with a friend who has the same travel style as me. Going on a trip with her would be a gamble and lot of money to spend for me to not get what I wanted out of it. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to me since we are both adults and should be able to live separate lives. I don‚Äôt think I should have to include her in something as big/financially taxing as international travel if I didn‚Äôt want to.

c3hwak	2019-06-21 23:05:27	xXshmaylorXx	"WIBTA if I told my landlord about my roommates ""shenanigans""?"	"First time posting here. Obligatory I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for formatting.

My husband and I moved into an apartment with our mutual friend and my coworker we'll call F. We have all worked together at some point and she was one of the first people that knew I had any interest in my husband before we got together.

We were living with my parents for a while and my mother had a change of heart and decided we needed to live elsewhere. No big deal. Already planning on moving in with F and it just got pushed up a couple of weeks. She was very accommodating to us and assured us it was no big deal.

Now I should elaborate, she got fired from our job we all had together about a year ago for being high on meth and Xanax and literally drinking work booze on the job. I thought that was all in her past, as she had moved away to 'get her shit together' and I believed her. She seemed okay and stable. I was wrong.

About a week after we moved in she revealed to me that she had done meth to get some 'extra energy' so that way she could get the house ready for us. I told her no big deal, just don't make it a trend and as long as you don't have it in the house we won't have problems (I've had issues with drugs in the past.) This is when the shit starts.

She misses work one day and is diagnosed with severe alcohol detox, malnutrition, and a certain blood sugar disorder. I went to the hospital and showered her when she was too weak to even stand. When she gets home, she asks me to smash her meth pipe and then tells me that she has meth hidden in the house that she hid too well from herself. I try to keep my emotions down and do what she asked. She never found the meth that day.

Fast forward to yesterday. She's up at 6 am loudly cleaning and blasting music. Cool whatever she's a cleaner. Just 6 am? She knows I'm a sleeper and I had to be up at 10. I deal with it, go to work, and come home. She goes to work that evening and proceeds to make a whole scene. It's a small business and she ended up posting a bad review on our Facebook page. I get several texts from co-workers because apparently I'm her care taker.

I text her and tell her it's a threat to our well being when she does shit like that. She then tells me 'it's my house and y'all can just go' (which she has done before, and only does this when she's drunk) and I told her no.

My question is WIBTA if I told our landlord about what she's doing?? My husband and I have a child that lives with my parents and I don't feel comfortable having my daughter over with her erratic behavior (more than I described, I can go into detail about random men coming over all hours of the night, or her just screaming for no reason.) I care about her but the way she's being is too much and I'm at my wit's end.

I need help dealing with the problem.

But other people tend to look at married couples and judge their activities and finances as a unit. A side note: I made some poor choices and went through a manic episode that led her to throw me into jail twice, file a restraining order that lasted 2 months in the midst of divorce being filed. I lived with my parents during that time. We reconciled about 3 months ago. And the debt stems from all of this.		1	0
c3hsbi	2019-06-21 22:55:45		AITA - My dad threw away my clothes so I took something of his and don't want to give it back	"I moved out of my parents' house three years ago, but left some of my clothes in my old room at their house, which I thought they were fine with. Where I live now is a very old building and has very little closet space. I intended to eventually move the clothes out, but hadn't done so yet. They hadn't expressed any desire that I urgently move them or really ever mentioned them at all. My room at their house remains an unused room in their basement they don't go in. They have lots of other bedrooms and plenty of storage space.  
  
A few months ago, my mom went on a holiday and my dad decided to ""clean house"". By that I mean he took all of my clothes from my old room and threw them away (or gave them away, not actually sure which, but doesn't matter). Did not say one word to me about it. No warning. Never gave me an opportunity to take them myself, which I absolutely would have. We literally live in the same neighborhood; he could have easily left them at my house, even if he wasn't going to tell me, or asked me to pick up the bags of clothes. But he made an extra effort to take them somewhere else and would have had to drive past my apartment to do so.  
  
I was extremely hurt and angry when I found out. My dad was basically unapologetic at the time. He's not good feelings. At all. So one day soon after this when they weren't home, I took away some cheap artwork he had recently put up in a room of their house. Nothing valuable or meaningful. I wanted to show him how I felt by taking away something of his. My dad basically thought of this as a funny tit for tat game, but I was still hurt and wanted empathy.
  
My dad did eventually actually apologize and I accepted his apology and want to move on even though I'm still hurt by what he did.  
  
But now my mom has been asking me to put back the artwork and that my dad has been looking to replace it with identical pieces. I find this hurtful and don't want to give them back or for him to replace them with the same thing. Obviously they can do what they want in their house and maybe what I did was petty and childish, but explaining my feelings in words just doesn't work with him.

c3hrup	2019-06-21 22:54:36	ananon1221	WIBTA If I asked my friend if we could skip dinner with his Parents?

Danny moved away at the end of fifth grade with his family because of a job offer his dad got, yet Paul and I remained good friends throughout middle school and up until now (we‚Äôre all in High School). 

Once every year, Danny returns to our town for a couple days on a trip with his family. His grandparents live here and so he visits with them, and then one night, he has a sleepover with Paul and I at Paul‚Äôs house. It‚Äôs been this way for several years now.

Next weekend, we‚Äôre going to have our annual sleepover. Now our sleepovers consist of the usual things: pizza for dinner, video games, movies, staying up late into the night, etc. However, nearly every year, Paul‚Äôs parents set the dinner table and requires us to eat dinner with them.

We sit with Paul‚Äôs parents and brothers, and have this long dinner in their dining room. Frankly, I‚Äôve always found it to be awkward and unenjoyable, with his parents controlling the conversation and asking us all about school and numerous other topics. Especially when we could be in the basement watching a movie or doing something much more enjoyable, as I figure most people my age do during these things.

Because of this, I have found myself wanting to text Paul before we get together next weekend as ask that we just have our food in the basement, where we can avoid a lengthy and awkward conversation with his parents and brothers, and instead do as we please. However, I keep holding back because I worry that I‚Äôll come off as rude or obnoxious. 

I know that since he‚Äôs hosting and I‚Äôm the guest, then it would be polite to just put up with it, but given that I‚Äôve done it several times now and we can clearly handle ourselves, I want to ask him if we could pass on the family dinner. Additionally, we wouldn‚Äôt be skipping his parents‚Äô only chance to catch up with us, as we‚Äôd be going upstairs for breakfast the next morning.

Kelly has been dating a childhood friend of my BFs named Steven, and we‚Äôve been all hanging out as double dates and etc. which I think she‚Äôs a really sweet girl. Here‚Äôs the kicker: before I officially met her, my Bf told me the backstory between Kelly and another good friend *Tina, and how they aren‚Äôt friends any more. About two years ago, both girls were best friends, and both girls liked the same guy. Unfortunately for Kelly, the guy liked Tina more, and as a result Kelly started making up rumors, gossip, etc. because Tina ‚Äútook her man‚Äù when in reality she didn‚Äôt do anything. The last I‚Äôve heard about it was that Kelly called Tina up crying and said to meet up and apologize, but it never happened. And until this day Kelly has been avoiding/pretending it never happened, with her Bf supporting her actions. 

Now I don‚Äôt use this information to judge her, as I only know the Kelly I‚Äôve seen now, and we‚Äôve become really good friends. The problem now is that over the past couple months, I‚Äôve met and hung out with Tina, and she‚Äôs super chill and fun to hang out with as well. Kelly knows I‚Äôve been hanging with her now, but is know using sneaky ways to find out if me and my BF have invited her to events or hangouts. The last straw was when Kelly secretly messaged my Bf about a day trip we‚Äôre planning, even stated she wouldn‚Äôt go if she was coming to. 

Mind you, Tina knows that I know, and has said that she does not mind being in the same group as her, it‚Äôs Kelly and her BF avoiding her. I‚Äôm tired of the constant hiding that‚Äôs starting to involve me and my BF because of their issue. Would I be the asshole if I told her I knew, and that she should just apologize to settle the conflict?

EDIT: The only reason I feel like chiming in is because Kelly and her Bf  has now secretly asking my Bf and the friend group of how close me and Tina are. I originally was gonna leave their business to them, but now I feel like I‚Äôm getting in the middle more and more."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c3hn91	2019-06-21 22:43:51	sleepymcgrew	AITA for being an hysterical cat mum?	"Background information; My cat (Gatsby) recently fell out of a second floor window and smashed his right hind paw pretty badly. The vets thought that they would have to amputate the leg initially, but instead decided to try to splint it instead. While Gatby's leg is splinted he need to be caged to restrict use of the paw, however, he is able to have occasional supervised room rest, but no stairs, jumping, climbing etc.

The cage is kept in the communal lounge, my household comprises of my BF (who owns the house), me, and our 2 lodgers. 

I came home from work tired and a bit grumpy, saw that one of my lodgers had friends over in the lounge, and went straight to my room to read in bed. My BF came home slightly after, and mentioned that Gatsby was on the sofa. I was immediately pretty annoyed, as I felt that our lodger was out of order letting Gatsby out of the cage, especially with people over (Gatz is not good with people.) My BF reassured me that Gatz was fine sleeping on the sofa, and that it was natural for our lodger to assume it was fine to let him out as we always do it. Knowing that I was a bit on edge I decided to let it go, despite feeling a bit anxious about it. 

Less than five minutes later I hear Gatsby hissing and wailing, and send the BF to investigate (I was mindful that I might overreact as tired). Our lodger was bringing Gatsby up the stairs to our room, and he was hissing and scratching at her. Apparently he was starting to become stressed and aggressive with the people in the room, so she decided to bring him up to us.

I was furious, as this situation was unnecessary. My poor cat was stressed out, and if we don't give that leg a chance to heal he may lose it!

My BF thinks the whole situation is a 'no harm no foul' and that I am overreacting. I think that I should have a word with her about boundaries, as I  feel she overstepped a boundary letting my cat out without checking first. She has never owned an animal before, and is a little immature in regards to her attitude towards their care IMHO.

Am I the asshole or an hysterical cat mum for being this cross about it???"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c3hmsw	2019-06-21 22:42:41		AITA for using this guys garbage bin?	"PLEASE READ. Title isn't accurate. I just didn't know how to word this situation.

Part of one of my jobs involves servicing appliances and vending machines at stores and buildings. I drive a company truck with lots of shit in the back. It's a cross between a tractor trailer and a cube van kind of.

Anyways, I'm done my service call at a local grocery store. I have some excess garbage and cardboard in my truck that I'd like to get rid of. Usually if I service a bigger store that has a compactor and cardboard baler I use the opportunity to offload some trash. Literally nobody cares.

I have maybe 8 sheets of cardboard, not big and a couple plastic bags of trash (pop bottles, candy wrappers etc). Really isn't a lot. I'm about to throw it out when the manager of the store stops me.

He yells at me because I'm apparently not supposed to ""dump my trash"" onto them. I tell him that I'm working here and he tells me that I'm not an employee of the store. At this point I'm shocked. I start getting pissed and tell him that it's just a few sheets of cardboard and one bag of garbage... He says that it doesn't matter, it's not my store. I tell him it ain't your store either, you're just a manager.

He tells me that I have a terrible attitude and goes back inside.

I was so dumbfounded at how petty this guy was. It took me a second to process what just happened. This corporate grocery chain has a huge Baler that compresses thousands of pounds of cardboard and a massive garbage bin. Apparently offloading a few sheets of cardboard and one bag of garbage was a problem. I used to work in a massive grocery store during school. Literally nobody would give a fuck about this. It's not like I'm dumping a whole truck of garbage. I'm also repairing shit at your store FFS.

Just want to see if I'm sane or not by asking this question. I'm still dumbfounded by the pettiness"		1	0

c3hjwm	2019-06-21 22:35:42	i-hte-myslf1im-srry	AITA for only keeping a relationship with my dad because he financially supports me?	"Long story short, my parents separated when I was 10 but didn‚Äôt divorce until I was 18 to keep custody out of question. This left a lot of time for my dad, who was the sole person in charge of keeping their investments for retirement in order. This gave him a long time to cheat my mom out of money right under her nose. I chose to live with him until he kicked me out, but my sister quickly left to live with her because he was bringing women into the house within a month of my mom leaving. I know he hid the houses they rented out because he had me fix one of them up and it was under his girlfriends name. The company he started when he got laid off is also conveniently not in his name either, he‚Äôs been paid under the table the whole 8 years.

Anyhow. Once he kicked me out he completely disowned me. Never saw me. Never paid a dime to my mom. I‚Äôm severely disabled mentally and have been hospitalized and sent to treatment. They said I shouldn‚Äôt have lived through the night, let alone at all. On my way I asked for my dad to meet me but he decided to finish the play he was at instead of coming. My mom never left the hospital except to work. For a month she lived there with me, while my dad would seldom come.

Fast forward. I live with my mom and she takes ambien. She spills all her dirty secrets when she‚Äôs like that (including me being the first one to know that I have a half sister) she refuses to acknowledge it in the morning so I never bring it up but the next thing she told me was my dad cheated on her with my aunt. It‚Äôs been over three years and I finally wanted some answers. I knew my dad probably cheated with the first woman he dated after the divorce so I sat down alone with my aunt and asked her if my dad ever cheated on my mom. It turns out he first got caught when I was in my moms belly. He tried with my aunt. A few women here and there. Until my mom couldn‚Äôt take it and left. He‚Äôs always blamed it on her. 

I just learned this 2 days ago and my world has been flipped. It explained a lot of my childhood that I never knew was not normal. I don‚Äôt feel like I can look at my dad the same, but I‚Äôm literally the only child of three that knows and it‚Äôs eating me alive. My dad helps my mom financially support me now. But knowing what he did to my mom hurts me to the core. I don‚Äôt know if I can look at him the same, but at the same time I literally can‚Äôt live without his support. I know now why they never told us, because this would be the outcome. And I know they feel like they contributed to my problems, so they want to help me. But I have no idea what was fake and what was a lie. What else he‚Äôs hiding."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3hj58	2019-06-21 22:34:01	fIyingpoof	AITA for stating loudly that the best place to have a catch up conversation is right in the entranceway of Costco?	"We've all been to the store and seen people we want to catch up with and that's great.  Grocery stores are the centers of our community and all that jazz.  But one of my biggest nails on a chalk board pet peeve is people standing in the doorways having conversations blocking and impeding foot traffic.  Especially a store like Costco on a Saturday.  When we entered last weekend, there were 2 elderly couples having a conversation blocking over half of the entire entrance with a flood of people navigating around them.  Not 5 feet away from the person checking memberships.  They could easily move 15-20 feet and be entirely out of the way.   

So I looked at my friend and stated loudly that ""the best place to stop and talk is always right in the doorways of course"" and glared at the offending party who had a sort of ""well I never"" reaction and slowly started to shuffle off but I was already moving on.  My friend seems to think I'm the asshole but I mean who stands right in a doorway and doesn't move?

Edit: more info, I looked at the membership checker person first for guidance, but they were obviously frazzled by the elderly couples presence but were too afraid to say anything, probably for fear of being rude.  I almost felt like I was saying something ""for them"" if that makes sense."	Not the A-hole	0	0

In this time weve connected so much and we both started to love eachother. Shit got more serious between us, but the timing for a relationship was bad: we both wanted to be free.

One evening the girl kissed my boss in front of me and all my friends. Ive told her that really hurted me and asked if she cant do stuff in front of me or near me. We agreed.

So i threw a party for 90 people and invited her too, on one condition: *dont kiss any of my friends or other ppl at the party*, she ensured me everything was gonna be ok.

That night she slept at my place. 

At the party she had a threesome in the bathroom and give this dude a bj and sex. There were rumours and she denied everything and told me crying that it wasnt her. Then i took the phone and saw a convo with the other girl of the hethreesome trying to cover everything up.

I got so mad that i wanted to delete her out of my life. Even though we werent in a relationship, ww both were very important to eachother and connected in a special way.

Since i saw the post i decided to delete her on social media and not talk to her again.

I work at a bar in a gym and everytime i see her, she tries to be kind to me and say hello and stuff, but because i really want to cut her out of my life i ignore her everytime. I dont do it out of anger, just out of selfrespect.

I didnt work a shift with her yet.

I haven't seen him in at least 9 months at this point, I have a week off work so 3 weeks ago I ask him to stay at my place for a few nights, chill out, play games, watch movies etc. We agree he'll come down for 3 days and agree the days he'll come to mine on (Mon, Tue, Wed). With about a week left I ask him if he's booked his train so i can organise times. Turns out he can't do the Monday now as he has a job interview. I ask why he can't come down afterwards and he made plans to see his GF that evening as well now (I have no clue when he was going to tell me this if I didn't ask). We agree he'll come down for the Tues and Wed.

With 4 days to go he cancels on me, apparently he's stressed from looking for a job and a new apartment, this wouldn't be so bad if not for 2 things: 1. He's finished his Uni work for at least a month now, he's had plenty of time to do those things and has only just started now.

2. I've been telling him to do these things for months on end now, I've kept saying you can't leave this shit to the last minute, he has no where else to live if he can't pay rent (no parents in the country)

Honestly it just pissed me off so much, I've been so hyped for this week, planning out what we can do on what days, it's been something that I've been looking forward to since the day we planned it. So I want to know, if I ghost him for a week or two (We normally play games over discord 2 or 3 times a week) WIBTA?

I have a friend with a little rat of a dog thats extremely aggressive, by no means could this dog pose any lethal harm to anybody but when our friend group meets up at his place it'll bark growl and lunge at anyone in the room, it's been neutered but is still extremely aggressive. I was once picking up my friend from his place when one of his cousins opened the door thinking it was another family member coming from the garden and the dog straight jumped at me and bit my leg, obviously this was an accident on the cousins part but it still made me grow a severe dislike for the dog and my friend doesn't believe me that I've been bitten even though I had an actual flesh piercing wound. Pretty much everyone else in our friend group also despises the dog but I'm the only person scared of it even if I could yank it across the room if it bit, I don't want to fight some dog if I can just try to avoid it.

c3he29	2019-06-21 22:22:07	IllustriousPickle5	AITA for wasting food at a restaurant in front of children?	"I went out for dinner a while back with a group of friends, some with children between the ages of around 5 to 8. I was informed beforehand by a friend that it would be a buffet, and I say okay.

We reach the restaurant and I urgently want to go to the toilet, so I go just as soon as we have been showed our table.  I come back to the table and see plates with food on them, and waiters serving food. Turns out that it's the kind where the waiter serves the unlimited food on the table, and not the serve-yourself kind, which was what I was expecting.

I sit down at my empty seat, and there's a plate with several kinds of starters on it. I'm informed by my friends that this is for me. I look at my plate, and see a lot of food I strongly dislike and never touch - mushroom, corn etc. In addition, there's a pretty huge amount of food because I wasn't there while the waiter was serving the food and they tend to serve a good amount there unless you specifically tell them. I try to eat some of it, but dislike it more than I thought I would, so I eat a small part of it, and  left the remaining so that I could better enjoy dishes I might like later on. I ask if anybody else wants anything from my plate, everyone declines.

Everything is going fine until the waiter comes to clear the plates. I make a gesture for my plate to be cleared too and just as it about to be picked up, one friend stops the waiter. She asks me if I'm going to eat any of that, and I say no. Immediately, she gets mad and tells me I shouldn't be wasting this much food because (a) there are kids starving around the world and I'm being disrespectful and (b) it would set a bad example for their kids who might think its okay to waste food.

I generally don't waste food, and I told them why this time felt like an exception. Additionally, I see no point in eating more food when you don't want to. Almost everyone in the table strongly opposed this, and a few them got really mad when I continued to refuse to eat that particular plate of food. In their defense, we live in a country where poverty is slightly more abundant and children are often taught from a young age not to waste food.

About a week ago my sister lost her phone which had her driving license in it. I told her to go to the DMV to get a replacement but she told me no that instead she was gonna do it online. I tried telling her she needs to get it asap because due to her line of work (delivery driver). Who knows how long it would take by doing it online. Plus I believe they give you a temporary license at the physical location.

However she didn't listen to me. I'll admit my sister isn't the brightest person. She's quick to have a temper tantrum also so we ended up in a fight. Eventually I let it go whatever her life right? So today I found out she ended up on a shady website which offered her a replacement for 4 dollars. I wasn't surprised when she also told me the bank found a suspicious transaction of 22 dollars. The bank blocked the transaction and gave her a new debit card to which she is now waiting for. To wrap the story up she asked me if she could use my debit card to pay her bills. She said she could send me the money through zelle and then she would use my card. I told her I didn't feel comfortable doing that to which she said ""thanks for nothing"" and hung up the phone.

We've been getting into some fights because she says that, since I'm working and she's living off student loans, she thinks I should pick up the tab the majority of the time.  I'm big on saving money and personally don't see why we shouldn't be splitting things close to 50/50.  She chose to go to law school before we got together, so I don't think it's my responsibility to cover more than half of our date expenses because of a choice she made on her own.

So a little backstory‚Äî my father is my best friend and we have an incredible bond. My mother and I have an incredibly strained relationship and she is a textbook narcissist. My wife (we‚Äôre both women) also has a narcissistic mother who can‚Äôt stand me, and a father who was basically absent up until her adulthood. Essentially, our true family is my father, but we still visit all the other parents (they‚Äôre both divorced).           
We‚Äôve been going through ivf to conceive and I am now pregnant with a baby boy. I have gotten so much shit for the baby‚Äôs name that I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm being TA or if I‚Äôm just going crazy and having pregnancy brain.             
I am giving my baby a middle name (not first) in honor of my father but it‚Äôs not even his actual name‚Äî think giving a middle name Harrison but the name of my father is Harry (fake for obvious reasons). My mother and my wife‚Äôs parents are livid. They think if we give a name tribute to my father, they need them as well with future kids. First of all, I‚Äôm not having four kids, and also I have my names decided for all the children we‚Äôd be having, none of which are tributes to them. My wife is on the same page but she‚Äôs starting to feel guilty.          
My mother and her mother are both threatening to not be around their grandson if he has a middle name in honor of my father. They both tried to make me promise my next child will have something in honor of them, and I said absolutely not. My wife‚Äôs father keeps guilt tripping me with sob stories of how his grandson will always think one grandfather is better than the other.          
They also keep trying to get me to change his first name in honor of them with the excuse that the name I‚Äôve picked is ‚Äúugly‚Äù which sets me off as I‚Äôve been dreaming of giving my son this name for years. I told them all they are jeaprodizing any chance of a relationship with him over his name. My father was so excited about the baby having a middle name similar to his first name but now he‚Äôs upset with how horrible the rest of the family has been. He feels guilt like my wife.            
Am I being a dick here? I have no remorse and I‚Äôm about to tell them (with my wife‚Äôs permission) that they can‚Äôt come to the hospital when he arrives if they don‚Äôt stop as they‚Äôre causing me an insane amount of stress with the constant texts and phone calls.

c3hc1y	2019-06-21 22:17:30	wattsud	AITA for telling my dad I'm not sticking around?	"My parents separated when I was pretty young and my mom was awarded full custody. My father wanted to stay in my life at first, but the courts ruled in favor of my mom controlling visitation until he found a place to live and got a job. He was really bad off back then, and my mom was at least able to make bills. Instead of getting his act together, my father never tried to get involved with me again until recently when my mom died and he accepted custody. He has a house, a job, a GF, and she has a little boy. All living together.

I didn't have to move out of state or anything, but it's a good distance from where I've lived my whole life and my best friend was still willing to take the time and gas to come see me. When he got here, my dad was very standoffish and when he left I was told I wasn't allowed to interact at with him at all anymore. I'm sure it's because he's a year older, has face piercings and some tattoos, and does weird styles and colors with his hair. My dad went so far as to lock my social media so I can have no contact.

But my best friend is like my *best friend.* We've been through a lot-we grew up poor, we've had our fair share of bullying and family problems. I love my mom, but she wasn't perfect and there was a lot of shit to work through. He is a great guy who's always stood by me, and my dad dismissed him solely on his appearance. I got pissed and told my dad not to expect me to be around in a year when I turn eighteen, and his girlfriend told me I should be ashamed for using that as blackmail.

c3hade	2019-06-21 22:13:29	pdecobos	AITA for me (19F) to park at my work‚Äôs lot after 10 PM?	"I wasn‚Äôt too sure which subreddit this rant would fit under, so if you find a more fitting place please let me know! Also typing on mobile so forgive me in advance for terrible grammar mistakes.

Some context:
I work right next to the city‚Äôs college campus. At work, we have a super crammed parking lot, so managers advise employees to park at the college campus during the daytime, and park at our lot for late shifts. Late shifts are considered anything ranging from 11 PM-12 AM. During the day I have no problem parking at the college, it isn‚Äôt a far walk at all and getting out of our parking lot is actual hell when there are rushes. My only thing is, I have been told by multiple people that there have been several instances where people have been assaulted/followed to their cars at night at the college campus parking structure (where I park for work). I have already had an instance where I was followed after work at night, and no I didn‚Äôt contact the police or on campus security, I was scared for my life and ditched. Did not get a good look at whoever it was and did not want to go back to see. Knowing this, I have taken extra precaution at all times during the day, carrying pepper spray with me. That being said, I really try not to park there after a late shift.

A couple days ago I was scheduled for a late shift (ending at 10 PM). I have seen multiple employees park at our lot for much earlier shifts, and they are not shift leads nor managers. I thought to myself that 10 PM is a reasonable enough hour to be deemed as late enough to be allowed to park there. 

I park my car where the other employees park and head in to work. I notice a shift lead staring at me for a good minute, I wave, but did not get a wave back. I thought that was strange since everyone is super friendly at where I work, especially anyone higher up. I don‚Äôt think much of it and proceed to get ready before clocking in. My manager then approaches me, telling me I am not allowed to park at the lot unless I am off at midnight, which is completely understandable except for my certain situation of having a life threatening experience. I tell my manager I understand, but later on talk to her one on one to explain to her why I don‚Äôt feel comfortable parking at the college campus and walking there by myself at night. My manager seemed empathetic and understood. 

Here‚Äôs my dilemma, I have another late shift tonight (I get off at 10:30) and the same shift lead is going to be working tonight. Am I considered the asshole if I park at my work‚Äôs parking lot again? I have a feeling that I can be written up for ‚Äúinsubordination‚Äù.

c3ha23	2019-06-21 22:12:44	Derpalganger	AITA for calling out stranger's illegal actions?	"tl;dr at the bottom

&#x200B;

Background: I've been told by a friend that he cuts in lines or traffic backups because no one ever says anything or does anything to stop him. ""I do it because I can."" I took this to heart as these people piss me off.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend and I were on vacation in the Rocky Mountain National Park. Multiple people were walking out off the path into the fragile tundra landscape to take pictures or take rock mementos. Both illegal. After the first few I was tired of seeing and I said ""It's a pretty big fine to leave the trail"" in a loud but calm voice as we passed the next few. Each time, the GF gave me a look like ""mind your business.""

&#x200B;

A couple sites later, a group of late teen/early 20s people were out on rocks for selfies and whatnot. To get to these rocks, they would have had to hop a fence with a sign saying do not enter. Knowing she didn't like me correcting their behavior, I just shouted to them (to make sure they heard as we walked away) that a ranger was coming down the path. My hope would be that this would scare them into coming off the rocks back into the designated viewing area without directly confronting them. They gave no fucks.

&#x200B;

My GF told me she didn't like me saying anything, they'll get what they deserve eventually. My argument was that they are destroying resources and possibly removing enjoyment for future visitors until they do get repremanded by park rangers. I said ""It really bothers me that no one says anything to correct them."" She replied ""It really bothers me that You do.""

&#x200B;

For the rest of the weekend when people did something inconsiderate or illegal that I would normally say something, I instead looked at her to get my attention off them. She would smile and hug me to calm me down.

&#x200B;

I don't feel she ITA, she can feel however she wants about correcting strangers. Was I being an asshole?

&#x200B;

tl;dr - I drew attention to people breaking laws while no park rangers were around to stop them."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3h9ty	2019-06-21 22:12:11	ChuckOsteen	AITA for asking a woman I like to wait for me?	"I (24M) met a woman (21F) online who is chill and cool as fuck. We started talking about 2 weeks ago and already I‚Äôm into everything she fucking does and her personality just drives me wild! I‚Äôm honestly surprised she is single but I‚Äôm paranoid it won‚Äôt be that way for long.

I‚Äôve been planning on moving for a while now and in August, I plan to actually fly out to the area I‚Äôm going to be moving too. A weird coincidence, but she actually lives out there. 

Now I have already made it clear to her that I‚Äôm definitely crushing on her. She accepted my feelings but hasn‚Äôt returned any because we don‚Äôt really know each other. I can respect that reason because it makes legitimate sense. 

Anyways, a few days pass and I just cave by letting this girl know that I want to a reasonable chance. I want to actually meet her in August when I fly down there and I want to go out on a date with her.

When I say chance, I mean that I want her to reject every other guy until I get a chance to go on a date with her. Which is roughly 40 days from now. 

She actually agreed to us meeting up and even agreed to going a date to see how compatible we are. Unfortunately for me, she didn‚Äôt say that she would give me the ‚Äúchance‚Äù I‚Äôm looking for. That means if she falls for someone in that timeframe, my chance of hooking up with her is gone. It sucks and I would like a to avoid it, but if that happens, then it happens.

Now, I just like scum for asking her to do that for me. All I did was ask for to wait for me which doesn‚Äôt sound bad to me beforehand, but now I just wish I could take it back. I ended up coming off as desperate and oh god how I hate this feeling.

Beforehand, asking her to wait for me didn‚Äôt seem like a bad idea, but now I‚Äôm regretting it. So AITA for asking her that or am I making a big deal out of nothing?"	Asshole	0	0

She has a condition that makes her sweat excessively called hyperhydrosis that she‚Äôs very self conscious about. It mainly only affects her hands and she gets really sweaty palms at random points throughout the day. When we first started dating she‚Äôd be too embarrassed to hold hands and one time on a walk she was wearing a polyester shirt and jeans so she didn‚Äôt have any material to wipe her sweaty hands. I told her I didn‚Äôt mind and she could always use my shirt to wipe her hands anytime she needed. She got into a habit of giving me a hug and grabbing my shirt from the back to dry her hands whenever she needed to, which I don‚Äôt mind at all if it makes her feel better. The last 2 weeks she had exams and I knew she‚Äôd be nervous and sweat more so I wore cotton T-shirt‚Äôs every time we were together. Yesterday while doing the wash I noticed that my T-shirt‚Äôs are starting to pill /drag in the spots she always grabs.

c3h9bl	2019-06-21 22:10:59	skksiiiooo	"AITA for telling a woman in a packed coffee shop that I'd move ""when her friend came""?"	"So I've noticed this annoying and demeaning and rage inducing trend where a public place is packed (Starbucks, library, park, commuter rail), I sit at an empty seat and a lady sitting across says that seat is taken as she is waiting for her friend. Yes, even on a packed train where we're all going home after work, though this one starts off with their purse and bags taking up the seat.

As you can probably feel from the vibe of my post, I feel this is incredibly selfish and uncalled for behavior. We live in a society (America), hoarding a public good (seats) like this leads to anarchy in the system (people must stand, sit on the ground, walk far away to find an alternative) as there is less for everyone else (2 seats for 1 person). The final straw that broke the camel's back was when I was at the university library, it was packed, the same ""this seat is taken for a friend who is coming"", and fortunately someone else was leaving and I took their spot, only to witness the woman 45 minutes later leave with no one ever arriving.

After that whenever I ask if that seat is available and I hear the ""I'm waiting for a friend"" I say ""alright well I'll leave when the friend arrives"", and just sit down. And if the other person arrives, I get up and go. Which I think is a fair compromise. Though at this point it's exhausting trying to change everyone and so I see a girl telling people that open seat is taken and I don't even pick that battle anymore, going somewhere else totally."

H (my dad girlfriend) is.... indescribable. The start of their relationship (which started about 2-3 years ago) was okay. Normal. Until she was so drunk that she started hitting my dad and screaming at the top of her lungs that she hated me and my sister, hates my family, etc. She only got kicked out because of me and my sister. We told our family who made her get out. 

Now recently, she‚Äôs moved back in. She‚Äôs fine, no fights really, annoying at best. Until about 2 weeks ago. We went on an all expenses paid trip to Disney.

c3h7xc	2019-06-21 22:07:52	Bi-shy-ready2cry	AITA for having a messy workspace and being upset when a colleague tidied it without permission?	"I have been at my organisation for a bit over a year and was recently promoted, which meant I moved desks to another part of our small (20ish people) open plan office. My new neighbour N and I are arguing. Our teams before my promotion were unrelated so we were no more than friendly acquaintances. She is still not in my team and is at the same level in the organisation as me. N has worked in offices longer than I've been alive, while this is my first job after graduating. Our desks are separate, but touching on a short side. There are no barriers/cubicles.

I keep a light-to-medium cluttered desk (I think it's light but upgrading for objectivity) - pens and papers spread about. Nothing sensitive/confidential, stacked, touching another desk, contravening health and safety requirements, or dirty.  A completely clear workspace is distracting to me and I like to have everything I need to hand, then leave it overnight so I can get back into the same headspace quickly the next morning. It looks messy but I know where everything is. I also have a learning disability, that I don't discuss with random colleagues, which makes personal organisation a hard-mode task. I put my effort into staying organised so I have a strong work product, so tidying my desk is high-effort and low priority.

Recently I was leaving for an event when N asked if I was leaving my desk 'like that' and told me she didn't like sitting next to a messy desk. I didn't really say anything, shuffled some stuff briefly and left - I was rushing to meet a taxi when she spoke to me. When I returned the next day, I thought stuff had been moved but couldn't remember how much I'd shuffled when I was leaving.

Yesterday, I went out again and when I came back this morning, everything on my desk had been piled into my inbox. I've lost two documents as a result of this 'tidy'.  I was upset and asked her about it. She told me: I was being inconsiderate; not respecting her 'visual space'; no one else has as messy a desk (untrue); and that in offices you need to stay tidy. I told her to stop touching my stuff. We went in circles for a minute before I said I didn't think this was a productive discussion so we sat in silence until she left for a meeting.

If N'd come to me in the two months we've been neighbours at a quiet moment, told me she was unhappy and asked to find a solution, I'd probably have been taken aback but cooperative. As it is, I don't feel I was given a fair chance to understand and fix the problem - just ambushing and passive aggression. I also don't think messiness is a default AH quality (but N clearly does!). I'm seeing her on Monday and am going to try to talk to her, so keen to hear perspectives on if IATA here or not to help me decide my approach. Thanks for reading, sorry for long-windedness!

"My parents died when my youngest brother was in high school and I took him in (there was nobody else except our middle brother who was in grad school) and supported him through college graduation. Our relationship had always been complicated, then we both lost our parents and were thrown together at a time when I was just starting to have my own life and he was in the middle of being a rebellious teenage dickbag.

These days he lives near me and has grown up quite a bit, but he's still in his 20's and tries to leverage me for help with things, including money, that a person his age might go to a father for. I have my own kid now and my own family so I can't make myself available for this the way I might otherwise, and frankly I don't like him and don't feel like I'm his dad so I wish he'd stop acting like we have that relationship. He fails to respect my boundaries and is stressful to deal with.

But none of this is the actual AITA conundrum.

The conundrum is that my wife's father has taken a liking to my brother. They go to sporting events together. My wife's parents buy him presents on holidays and have hosted his birthday party a couple times. My wife doesn't have any brothers and her dad seems to really enjoy the interaction.

That was uncomfortable but fine, until my FIL started hinting to me that I am a bad father to my brother and that he hopes I'll do better with my own child. When I say I won't do something for my brother, my FIL gets exasperated and does it instead while shooting passive aggressive barbs my way about it. They (MIL&FIL) try to guilt me into doing things with him and invite him to events that I don't want to invite him to, sometimes events involving my actual son. They make a point of inviting him to family events that I host and don't want him to attend. It has become flagrantly disrespectful and their disapproval has become more and more open over time. It is clear that they see my brother in the most sympathetic light possible, as an orphan who looks up to a brother that is snubbing him, but it is more complicated than that and I wish they would realize they are outsiders that don't have the whole relationship history and back off.

My brother and I don't get along, I have no obligations to him, and I'm sick of having him inserted into my life. As much as my life would improve if I could forbid my in-laws from having a relationship with my brother, I know that's between them and definitely not my place.

c3gzgo	2019-06-21 21:48:52	MooPara	AITA for not getting too excited over a friend coming out as gay	"A bit of a background, I have a good friend I've known ever since we were in the army together, I was his commander in fact until he left for officer's school himself. We've kept in touch after leaving the army, and now we study together in university. So we've gotten really close again, studying together for tests, doing projects together and just hanging out a lot.

My own beliefs about the whole sexuality issue is that I don't really care about it, I don't really care who you want to have sex with, just that you're a good person to be around. I kinda see it as a non-issue, because well.. have fun.

So about a week ago, while having dinner at my place, he sat my girlfriend and me on the couch and said he is gay and that we are the first ones he is coming out to.

My girlfriend responded with a hug and saying how wonderful it is, and I followed suit in congratulating him, a congratulations he felt was insincere. Because I didn't feel too happy about him coming out as he said.

This led to a talk about why did he even feel the need to come out to us, meaning neither my girlfriend nor I ever showed any disdain towards anyone in the community, quite the opposite, we have many friends who are either gay or lesbian. He even knows me deeper than that because another one of the soldier in my platoon when I was its commander was gay, and it was never an issue. I mean we both also know a friend from the army who recently went through a sex change and again it was never an issue. So I was rather baffled by why was I a target of coming out since it won't have any impact on our friendship.

His argument is that coming out is really tough and that he wanted our support and friendship when he comes out to his family. I answered with the fact that he only needed to say ""I'm coming out to my parents tonight, can I count on your support"" and I'll answer with ""Oh, you're gay? Sure, what time?"". 

Some of those mentioned friends side with him on this, saying it is hard to come out even to friends because the first time you do this, is also the first time you admit it out loud. I won't go into some of the discussions that mentioned that today coming out is not really a deal and that they just brought home a boyfriend to meet the parents instead of a girlfriend or vice versa and never had the ""coming out"" conversation.

Right now he seems hurt by this whole ordeal and that I don't really make a fuss about him being gay, as though it's an affront on his character. 

So am I an asshole for that? And any advice on what to do to amend it in your opinion?

c3gz86	2019-06-21 21:48:21		AITA for not regarding writing online erotica as cheating?	"I got into a debate with someone regarding what is or is not cheating. They brought up a lot of online stuff, and one of the things they regarded as cheating was writing smut.

I write erotica for websites because they get the most attention, and therefore bring in the most feedback. I've found that sprinkling in the occasional sex scene in my writing allows for a lot of creative leeway in exploring plots, and the audience genuinely seems to appreciate thoroughly written fiction instead of sex with no context or depth. Not involving sex often leads to a small audience, and my interest wains. I took a long writing hiatus and moved from tumblr to literotica for a more mature audience, and found that even writing a great sex scene requires a lot of skill, and I think it's genuinely improved my writing all around.

My friend insists that it is all pleasure-based and I'm feeding fantasies with my own fantasies, which isn't completely true, as I write about a variety of things, a lot of which doesn't fall into my 'kinks'. I do like the idea of people getting off on my writing, but in a very vague, gender/identity-less way, like more about them appreciating my work than thinking about me writing it.

My friend basically thinks I'm in a relationship with the random internet strangers that read my work and said I would be an asshole to continue doing it when I get into a relationship (this came up because a potential relationship is on the horizon). I said writing is my passion, and I would probably disclose it to some degree with my partner, but I wouldn't give them access to all of my erotic work, it's way too embarrassing. I don't communicate at all with the people that read it, barring maybe a ""Thank you!"" to a comment, so there are no actual relationships, the whole thing is anonymous.

Apparently mum ran off with my older sister before I was born, with a deeply abusive man. She got pregnant and came back to our home city. My grandmother took my sister and the police were called. My gran got a caution. 

Gran refused to have anything to do with my mother until she had an abortion. It took her a while to find anyone willing to do a later term abortion but she got it.

I thought about this a lot and several months later told my mother I knew. She sobbed and told me she had murdered her own baby. She was deeply mentally ill for a while, and ashamed that I knew. It still affects her even now. 

My mum didn't see my grandparents (her mother and stepfather) for a while. Eventually mum confronted gran and when gran refused to apologise for telling me the secret mum left.

Eventually mum was disowned. Gran wouldn't talk to her. Went on for years.

When I was 19 my mothers biological father died. My mum was fragile but coping. I told my gran mum was a wreck and I exaggerated it so that she'd let mum come to the house. She did. They've had a good relationship since.

Mario told me that he didn't know who to talk to about this, but needed to tell someone and he felt that I was the best person. Mario presents as a straight cis gender man, and has only ever had girlfriends. He told me that he was in love with my best  friend and he realized that he was gay and in love with him and didn't know what to do. I stayed on the phone with him and comforted him, even after I told him I didn't have time because I was studying. So fast forward to last week.

I advised him against it, but he told me he was going to do it anyways. My B.F. is a very anxious anxious person, and also a very kind person. I was worried about what kind of impact it would have on him to have Mario tell him this, while they were sharing a hotel room in another state, so I called him to tell him. My B.F. told me he was very disappointed that I didn't keep Mario's secret. I tried to explain I thought I was doing what was best for him but he still said he mad. He also told me it was a prank and they were testing me to see if I would keep it a secret and I failed. Am I the asshole?	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3gtur	2019-06-21 21:35:50	wifeclothefromtrash	AITA? My wife threw away the outfit she wore on our first date and implored me not to get it out (she's gained weight) and I did. She is beyond livid with me.	"Posting from a throwaway since my wife and I talk on reddit all the time at work and I don't want her to see this if the votes swing wildly one way or the other. 

I've been married to my wife for just over 8 years. I say it's a wonderful marriage and I am just as in love with her as I was when we met. We are 28 and 29 respectively. We both have full time jobs and probably needless to say we don't have the bodies we did when we were 21. I've gained probably 20lbs. She gained about 2 or 3lbs a year until 2 years ago she went from I'd say 140 to about 230 (over the course of two years or so, not overnight). No doubt her metabolism changed and her dietician and NP said that her body went into starvation mode after trying a low carb diet she heard about on a podcast. I still think she looks amazingly sexy and up until about a month ago we had an amazing and fun sex life. 

So a month ago her semi-estranged half sister showed up out of the blue and had lost a ton of weight. She claims the success was due to the exact diet my wife had tried out 2 years ago. My wife is a very normally happy-go-lucky person but this sister has the ability to send her into a crazy spiral (sister is the child of man her mom had an affair with and split up her family...a metric ton of baggage all around). 

Well my wife tried the diet again but after a week she'd gained about 10lbs and she sort of had a breakdown. I came home to her stuffing bags and bags of her ""skinny clothes"" into a trash bin. I asked her what was up and she said she had resolved that she was going to be 230 forever and wanted no more reminders or false inspiration. I told her I was very happy with that but lets be reasonable that the clothes would be so much better of being donated. She agreed and I got them out of the bin. 

However right on top of was the outfit she had worn on our first date. I have incredible memories of that night and the way she looked was a wonderful combination of sweet and cute with just enough sexiness to make her so intriguing. That outfit is extremely sentimental to me. I asked her if I could keep just that one. She ripped the pieces out of my hands and threw it right in the trash and told me ""fuck no, and don't you dare get it out."" 

When I was taking the stuff out for the trucks the next morning I saw the outfit again and just couldn't let it go so I took it and hid it in the garage not thinking she'd find it. Well she found it. And she is pissed, so pissed that she has not spoken to me since she found it. She has doubled up her therapy sessions and I think that outfit and me keeping it represents everything that is wrong in her life; her weight, her family dynamic, our inability to conceive, her work problems and on and on. 

I want to be a good husband but I also feel that I should be allowed to keep some things that are meaningful to me as long as the are not obtrusive or shoved in her face. She obviously disagrees and is as mad as she's ever been at me.

c3grzm	2019-06-21 21:31:44	skksiiiooo	AITA for confronting gym staff about how disgusting the smith machine area was?	"The other day I was working out on the Smith machine and there were literal clumps and balls of dust, hair, dirt, and debris. This is Planet Fitness, so at $23/mo I feel I'm not exactly entitled to the most pristine conditions, so I notify the staff on the way out. The next day I'm back working out and I see more clumps of dust, dirt, and debris around the smith machines. I tell the staff to please vacuum it and they say they vacuum every 6 to 12 hours. Then I ask another staff to clean the area up and she says ""it's a gym and gyms get dirty"". At this point I had given them numerous chances and was becoming visibly frustrated. I called management in front of them who then directed me to someone else who said they'd have someone call me back and they never did. I finally met the manager in person and she was fine and understanding of my situation, as I brought her to the area and it wasn't hard to display the dustballs and dirtballs and hair clumps all over the place, some as long as 2 inches. The manager said they've been doing their best to clean, and that staff gets frustrated because they vacuum in the morning and then within a couple of hours it's dirty again. She had one of her staff vacuum it, and then I went on my workout.

Imo it's not too much to ask to have a baseline hygiene in a workout area. And I also feel that while my direct ask may have been uncomfortable for me and everyone involved, at least I got results when I could've done what many people do and just passively aggressively write a 1 star review on Yelp without giving them a chance to fix the issue. It was just super awkward and I felt like a dick having to go up the ranks all the way up to the main manager just to get someone to vacuum as the staff refused to vacuum specifically at my request as apparently they were defeated with how many times they clean daily."

We live in a town we‚Äôre I have no family or friends and all I pretty much ever do is work. I like spending time on the weekends with my husband because I like spending time with him but also bc I literally have no friends or way to make friends here. 
So just now he texts me saying he was invited to a friend of a friends birthday for a guys night. This means the only free time this weekend we‚Äôre we would normally spend time together he wants to spend with other people while I sit at home. My thoughts are that I work full time and he has been un-employeed for 10 months.

I don‚Äôt want to tell him he can‚Äôt go or even put out the vibe that I don‚Äôt want him to go because I feel like that would make me an asshole? Would I be, or are my feelings justified?

It's essentially a trip where seniors who have just graduated high school go to the beach for a week with their friends. He has been gone for a week, they're leaving tomorrow. I happen to be going to a beach nearby this weekend, and asked if hed like to meet up. Hes been in an iffy mood because he got badly sunburnt, so I kinda slowly went into the idea. He said he wasnt sure and that he would have to ask his friend, since he would use their car. His best friend said no, and my boyfriend said ""I wanna hang out with my people for another day."" Its understandable, i told him earlier that if he just wanted to stay with his friends that would be completely fine, as I'm hype to see my own beach friends tonight.

 He called me later saying he actually did want to see me, and asked if someone could take us somewhere. He was alone when he asked me this (important for later). My one friend has her license, so I asked if she'd mind driving her sister (one of my best friends) and I to get my boyfriend. She said she couldn't, because she has a cornhole tournament tonight. 

I called my bf to let him know that I didnt have a ride for him, and I asked him if he could Uber to me. He was with his friends when I called him. He said no, and that it would be a ""waste of money"". This is the first thing that upset me. Then, I offered him my own money to pay for a ride there and back. His response was, ""I really dont want to argue with you over the phone. It would be a waste of money since I cant stay there long. I love you and I'll talk to you later."" I was really surprised. I wasnt arguing with him at all. I said, ""hold up. I just offered to pay you for a ride here and back."" He said ""that's not going to work, I really dont feel like arguing about this."" I said ""okay. You seem to be in a bad mood and you're kinda hurting my feelings, I'm just going to let you go back to what you're doing. I love you and I'll talk to you later."" He replied with a ""love you too!"" in a cheerful, passive aggressive tone.

I was really, really surprised by his attitude. Especially because I just offered to pay for a round trip, 25-minutes-each-way uber ride for him. He has this ego that he puts on in front of his friends where he acts super ""dude-bro"", and it confuses me. Hes such a softie around me and I love it about him, I really dislike how different he is around his friends.

Hes so sweet and romantic, normally. Loves snuggles, kisses, hugs, hes silly, gentlemanly, and polite. This isnt normal for him at all, and hes never acted like this before.

I usually visit a couple times a year, and I love sitting in their kitchen just listening to them reminisce on old times. Listening to them talk about their lives when they were young is something I will never get tired of hearing.   
  
Fortunately, I haven‚Äôt had to deal with the loss of a grandparent yet. I am now old enough to realize how important these visits are to me, and I would like to secretly record (audio only) our long talks. I would simply ask them if it was ok, but they tend to be very wary of technology and would most likely be uncomfortable being recorded. Even if they did agree, I can‚Äôt see them being able to ignore the fact that they are being recorded, which would almost certainly be noticeable when listening to the recording.  
  
I just want to save some of the old stories, and have something to relive the good times after they pass. Something to pass down to our kids one day, and hopefully add our own stories to with their kids.

c3ghfl	2019-06-21 21:08:42	phan_my_man	WIBTA if I asked my dad to keep his wife out of my life completely?	"My parents have been divorced for over 12 years now and both have dated and now remarried. 

My mother just married a man she has been dating for over 5 years, who we (my siblings and I) are perfectly accepting of. My dad, however, started dating a woman 20 years younger than him (less than 10 years older than my sister) less than three years ago. They got pregnant so she moved in, causing me and my brother to move out.

So now it is myself and my older siblings living with my mum, while my younger sister (15) lives with my dad and his family. My oldest sister (22) moved out of my dads 10 years ago and has very little contact. My brother (20) was very upset with my dad for moving in some random girl without our permission so he moved out when the wife moved in and has no contact with my dad. 

Now I (17) only moved out around the time that their baby was born (just over one year ago) and still have regular contact with my dad. While there are some things I have against my dad, I try to get along with him and avoid conflict. The main reason I moved out was because of his wife.

They got married a week before the baby was born but from the time she moved in she didn't like me. For the 8 months that I lived in the same house as her she spoke to me only about 3 times despite me attempting to create conversation with her. After moving out, she did begin to speak to me at times, for example if out for dinner, but I discovered a few months ago, that she told my dad that she hates me and blames all of their marital problems on me. 

More recently, I've found when spending time with my dad, she is constantly interrupting me while I am trying to speak with my dad. Or if I start talking about something she will always find a way to argue with me about it. To put it blatantly, I don't want to subject myself to such a hostile environment.

My idea was to text my dad and tell him that I no longer want to be anywhere near his wife and will only be spending time with him on the condition that his wife will not be there. To be clear I have no problems with the baby, he could bring her, I don't care, she's just a kid.

I am worried that this may upset my father and I don't want it to seem as though I am making him choose between her or me. She is his wife and I get that, I just don't want to be involved with her in anyway.

I have been struggling with social anxiety and depression for about four years now but because of my age (15) i didn't get medication until around half a year ago. This medication was quite light. Reasently i got stronger meds and don't take my old ones anymore. 
Yesterday my dad asked me to give my old pills to my older sister who had been stressed with school. I said i didn't feel comfortable doing that as they are perscribed medication. I told him if he thought she needed them he should just ask the docter. The conversation moved on and i didn't think about it anymore.

That evening my sister comes into my room and asked me for the pills... i told her that she couldn't have them but she said our parrents told her it was fine and that i shouldn't be so stuck up. She told me that in other country's they just sold this stuff in the pharmacy and that she needed them. Me being both physically and mentally weak ended up giving them to her. 

Now i'm overthinking if i wasn't just being overly stuck up and feeling bad about it so i thought i should just post it here.

c3ggd4	2019-06-21 21:06:20		AITA For ending a 2 month dating period with a guy to work on my mental health? This man says he is depressed because of me now	"So we only dated casually for about 2 months. Before then we were just real good friends that went out and had lunch or dinner once in a while.

During those 2 months we dated, we hooked up a couple of times but we never got to the ""I love you's"" or meeting one another's families or anything like that. 

Anyway, during those 2 months I started having some mental health problems with my anxiety at an all time high and I felt very depressed at the same time. And nothing against this guy, but it was quite a bit with him as well. 

He wanted to post our status on social media literally seconds after we decided to start dating and I had to politely stop him from that because it's way too soon and we were not an official couple, just dating. That same day he said he was ready for me to meet his parents and wanted to take me to their ranch for a family reunion in a few days. 

All of this was so fast and overwhelming and after reflecting, I felt it was best for me to be on my own for some time and just not date and focus on myself.

He did not take it very well. When I gave him the news he was upset, and angry, which made me feel awful about myself for hurting someone like this. He said I changed his life and helped him be a better version of himself. After a few days, he called to apologize for trying to guilt trip me and we stayed friends.

Well now 2 days ago...he texts me to tell me he's a depressed mess because of me and his feelings for me will never go away and he has been having the worse time ever trying to cope these last few days.

But the thing is, I feel good being on my own right now. I'm doing so many things that are helping me as a person, and I have told him several times in a nice way of course that I'm just not into the idea of dating him right now. Then he just contacts me again to tell me he's sad and he's miserable and doesn't feel good about himself.

This is all bringing me down mentally after I had progressed with my mental health..I feel like a piece of crap for rejecting him and putting him through this and well....it's making me just not wanna be with him at all. Am I the asshole for all this??"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c3gfss	2019-06-21 21:05:12	skuchull	AITA for leaving home when my mum ignored my dysphoria? (Took away my binder as punishment)	"So I'm new to this whole Reddit thing so idk what to expect. I just didn't know what to do with myself and I was recommended this subreddit. So I'm trans which you can probably already tell. I'm ftm so I bind. My mum accepts me but didn't quite understand what I'm going through. She often misgenders me and dead names me. I kinda tried to ignore it the best I could.
   
 So last week I came home from school with my report card. It was relatively good; all A's and B's except for one d. My mum was not happy. She started yelling at me for doing so bad in school. She took a deep breath. ""Hand over your phone,"" she said flatly. I nodded quickly and handed it over. She still didn't look satisfied. She then marched into my room. I was confused so I just followed. She opened my drawer and grabbed my other binder that I want currently wearing. 
     
""I think I'll just hang on to these until you've shown me you can improve your grades."" I was in shock. She then continued. ""I also expect you to hand over the binder you are wearing right now. I want you to give it to me before dinner."" I didn't even know what to say. ""You can't just take those away. I NEED them. Take my phone. Take my laptop. I don't care just please don't take my binders,"" I said in a shakey voice. ""Well now you've got some motivation to focus on your studies,"" she smiled and walking away. 
     
I felt a pit in my stomach. I knew if I went too long without binding I would do something rash. Dysphoria is a bitch like that. Thoughts started racing through my mind. No. Giving up my binder is not going to happen no matter what. I texted my friend and asked if I could stay over. They said yes so I quickly packed my bag and went to the front door. ""Where are you going?"" My mum asked in an accusatory voice. ""To a place where I'm accepted,"" I said slamming the door. I wish I could say I delivered it all bravely but in reality I said it barely above a whisper. I let out a deep breath and ran. My phone started buzzing. I knew it was my mum so I ignored it. I got to my friend's house and told him what happened. I was out of breathe for he lived somewhat far.
     
I then checked my phone. My mom was flooding my messages. 'where the hell do you think you can stay besides here' 'don't come crying to me when you end up failing highschool' I muted my phone and walked into my friends house. Later when I checked my phone again there were more messages from my mum. This time they were apologetic she was saying she overreacted and she just wanted me to come back. Then I did something I kinda feel bad about doing. I blocked her. I haven't come home in a week but my mum can't really do anything about that because I'm 18 so I have a right to choose where to live.
     
A thought has been itching at me. Did I do the wrong thing? Am I being the asshole in this situation?

c3gf95	2019-06-21 21:04:00	hardblob	AITA for pressuring my gf to get a raise at her job?	"TLDR @ bottom

&#x200B;

Context: I run and operate a small business in the city while she works full time in a suburban mall. Her full time job supports her needs and if she has any left over it goes into our business (which she also owns). We've been open and operating for 2 years and things are looking good.

Story: She works full time for a local jeweler for the past 5 years. When she started minimum wage was $12/hr. Since she has earned raises. Her most recent (few weeks ago) got her to $16.50.

During her employment, she has been at the owners beck and call. Opened by herself, closed by herself, dealt with horrible clients, robberies and has trained almost every new employee. On top of her duties she has also accomplished several awards and certifications in jewelry stuff (Sorry I don't know correct terms) from some of the big jewelry companies. Needless to say she knows her rocks and has earned every dollar.

Fast forward to this week. She has been helping open a new location while training entry level sales staff. Minimum wage for the state is still $12/hr but will raise to $13.50 by July 2020, its all part of a push to make $15/hr min wage state wide by 2025. One of the newer employees with little to no sales or jewelry experience slipped and told my gf that both new employees were getting paid $15.00/hr strait out the gate.

My gf is way too kind to say anything. However, my dumb ass has put the notion into her that she deserves a much larger raise. At least $2-$4 for the cost of living increase. Plus the new store is more of a distance away and she is accepting more responsibilities like manager but without the title.

And yes, if she sees a raise then the leftover income funnels into our company. This has helped us in the past.

If i'm wrong and she gets declined or worse, she loses her job, she won't make her school loan payments, car payment, insurance, credit card and even bus fair will become a hard hit issue.

Even if she were to come and put 100% of her effort into our business, I wouldn't be able to pay her enough AND keep the expenses of the company paid up at least for another year. Hell the reason we are making a small profit most months is because I won't have a salary until we've reached a specific milestone and my parents let me crash/eat for free while we save money.

So needless to say she needs/wants this job plus jewelry is her first passion and I do not wan't to take it away from her. However I believe she has the right to more and her boss is playing her because she wont speak up. 

Now to be specific I told her ""You need to talk to your boss and tell him that a $1.50 increase from entry level after everything you've done in the last x years is kinda disrespectful and you deserve at minimum $19/hr"".

Am I wrong? Am I an asshole?   


TLDR: GF worked for years from $12/hr to $16/hr. Now entry level is $15, I tell her to confront boss and get a bigger raise. She might lose everything, AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c3ge5e	2019-06-21 21:01:39		AITA For not wanting to buy a house with my friend	"My friend and I have known each other for 6+ years. The first year of which we were in a romantic relationship. When we first met, I was in a pretty bad place. I was unemployed and living at my dad's house. I had dropped out of school a few years earlier and had zero self-esteem and just wallowed in self-pity. Then I met my friend. Somehow, he saw some value in me and brought me out of my dark place. I believe that through his emotional support and encouragement, I was able to find a decent job, get my own apartment, pay off my debts, and even go back to school to finish my bachelor's degree. During my time at school, he even let me stay with him rent free and he would cover most of the expenses. I was essentially a free-loader during those two years at school.

Now that I have finished school, I received a my first salary job paying $65k/yr in Austin, where housing is moderately expensive (at least in comparison to what I am used to). I start next month, and he wants to take this opportunity to buy a house together and build equity since he has been renting his house this entire time. He's desperate to get out of our home town and sees this as his only chance to get out. He's confident he'll be able to find a job that offers him the income to maintain a share of the mortgage payments. Maybe that is the case, but I am also unsure of my ability to maintain my job. A part of me feels like this new job of mine is going to be over my head and I'll be fired within my first few months working there. Then it would be me unable to make payments.

There's also the side of me that want to move out and be on my own. I would like to keep things simple and just rent an apartment, even if it is a waste of money. I am apprehensive about entering this commitment that could be a financial nightmare if things go wrong. Even if it isn't, I feel like there would still be the commitment of not selling the house in the first few years if we don't want to lose money.

I owe my friend a lot. I want to pay him back for all that he's done for me, but I am not sure if I can take this step towards showing my appreciation. I have already told him I am strongly inclined towards renting an apartment for myself, and now he's shut me out and barely speaks to me."	No A-holes here	1	0
c3gctk	2019-06-21 20:58:38	blackbeardmain96	WIBTA if I stuck my bestfriend with a house he cant afford	"This happened a few hours ago on my way home from work and I'm at a deilma here. Ill start at the very beginning here. About 4 months ago I 23(m) was living in my moms house her and her boyfriend when she got a job across state that paid almost double so she obviously took it and told me shed like to sell her house soon. Not a big deal me and my bestfriend have been talking about getting a place together for the past few years anyways. So me and my buddy are looking at houses for rent since neither of us want a apartment complex and this wildcard goes and buys a house. Again not a big deal our rents about the same and this past Wednesday we start moving in. He was a little picky about certain stuff even before we moved in which wasnt a big deal cause his house his rules but then today he texts just as I'm leaving work and says ""Hey I know you'll probably a little upset but I don't (insert my dogs name here) in the living room since it has new carpet. I was FLOORED. I've had my dog for 2 years and she is my absolute world. Shes been there for me when me and my bestfriend got into fights and other sad matters. Now that might not sound like a big deal but heres the issue. The living room of this house is roughly 1/3rd the size of the house. So my dog would be allowed to go into the kitchen (roughly a little bigger than the average pool table), the dining room (roughly the size of 2 pool tables) and my room. Shes a 2 year old chocolate lab with more energy than a toddler. She needs as much room as possible. So in the end I'd be paying 400 a month for my bedroom and a bathroom since I wouldn't be able to use the living room without her crying or barking. So my question. WIBTA if I moved back into my moms house and left him with the house that he cant afford by himself?



Just to clarify i already spoke with my mom and she said shed have no problem putting off selling the house as long as I pay utilities. Also sorry if any spelling errors or bad formatting or rambling I'm on mobile and still pretty upset.

c3g98k	2019-06-21 20:50:56	justanaccountig	AITA for not wanting to helicopter my brother?	"Throwaway because I'm the anxious type.

For a little bit of context, I'm an 18 year old man. I'm on summer break after my first year of college, looking for a job. I plan to go back next semester. 

&#x200B;

My brother is 17, just barely graduated high school, and has a penchant for lying. He's lied about various things, including whether or not he's completed his school work, picked up his cap and gown, submitted medical forms to college, things like that. He also has a habit of saying things just to get a rise out of people (he told our mom he wasn't going to college in September ""just to piss her off""). He also has a history of credit card theft.

&#x200B;

My mom, on the other hand, has been dealing with this for the entirety of his high school career. She's been on his ass, telling him to hand in things, get a licence, pick up this and that, etc. But, she's also not punished him for stealing from her, bought him a car after none of his behavior changed, and continues to let him have the car despite him continuing to lie to and provoke her. She's not punished him for becoming physical and yelling at her.

&#x200B;

Lately, I've been charged with keeping a constant watch on my brother's activities. My mom will call me upwards of six times in a row to relay messages to my brother. She tasks me with taking pictures of his things to make sure he's getting them done, taking notes of how much money he has, when he leaves and comes home, etc. She also says that if \*I\* don't do this, she'll end up losing her job.

&#x200B;

I completely understand that this is a stressful situation for her, but I feel like I'm not the best person to keep tabs on him. I'm not his father, and our actual father has done nothing in this situation. I don't want to be insensitive, but I really don't think this is my job.

c3g83u	2019-06-21 20:48:18		AITA for being upset with my mom for not comforting me when I cry?	"I am a young adult, and I am chronically ill.  I have been chronically ill for a while now, but not my whole life, and I have gone in and out of being able to ‚Äúfunction‚Äù normally, so it‚Äôs still very hard on me sometimes.  I am not able to do everything I would like to do because of being sick, and that (obviously) sucks.  I am not a crier and am not an emotional person in general, so I typically do not bother crying, but sometimes, with my illness getting in the way of things I desperately want to do, it becomes too much, and I just want to cry about it.  My mom does not see the point of crying, I think, and she is obviously stressed for having to take care of me (and the rest of the family, who are not very nice to her, and NOT sick btw), so she typically ends up yelling at me to stop because ‚Äúshe can‚Äôt take it‚Äù or ‚Äúcrying isn‚Äôt good for me‚Äù.  Which stress is not good for my health, yes, but just bottling it up isn‚Äôt good either.  I have told her multiple times that she is very harsh with me, and that I wish she would try to be nicer and just let me cry it out and comfort me instead of yelling, but she just says that she‚Äôs trying the best she can, and that I‚Äôm criticizing her.  Now, granted, she does do everything for me in terms of my medical appointments and making sure that I go to the right doctors and trying to get me feeling better.  She also stays home with me and (most of the time) will make sure to be home when I am having a bad health day, so I don‚Äôt have to be alone.  She also buys my groceries, and make sure I have things according to the diet my doctors put me on.  She does do a lot for me, so I understand the perspective of ‚Äúoh, well I‚Äôm asking her for MORE‚Äù, but I am not able to talk about these things with friends, because I‚Äôm embarrassed about my limitations, and all I ask is to not be yelled at when I break from all the stress and depression that being sick brings.  I‚Äôm not sure if she realizes how harsh she is sometimes, but whenever I try to say something about it, she yells.

PS.  I mentioned that my family is not very nice to her, and I also want to add that they are not grateful to her for everything that she does around the house, whereas I thank her every time she drives me somewhere or gets me groceries.  I try to let her know that I appreciate everything, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to matter with her tolerance of me crying.

PSS.  I mentioned that stress isn‚Äôt good for me, and my mom agrees and often says this, but when she is venting to me about whatever (her life is very stressful, too) sometimes I ask her to stop talking about a stressful subject if I am having a bad stress day, and she also yells at me and gets mad and defensive.

"I am a month pregnant with my first baby, my husband and I are very excited and we have talked about how we want to raise our children. My husbands family is Catholic and my family is atheist, my husband and I have decided that we aren't going to baptize our kids until they are old enough to make that decision themselves. His mom has been very persistent in telling him we are to baptize our kids, regardless of how I, the mother, feels about it. 

She always brings up our wedding and how we didn't have it in the church like she wanted (me being atheist it wouldn't have veen allowed anyway) so baptizing our kids is the least we can do for her and his dad. We have told her that she can take the kids to church with her when they are older if they want to go with her but this doesn't seem to be enough. And she always jokes that she's going to secretly ger the baby baptized when we aren't around.

I feel bad for not wanting to get our baby baptized it's just something that I find uncomfortable, but it's something his mom really wants and she has been very helpful and supportive so far with my pregnancy and i keep feeling guilty about it.

Recently, for the past few weeks, shes been coming round my house. This is a long time coming, shes been kind of avoiding it. However, we've ran into a bit of an issue. I own minecraft, and havent played it for a very long time. This is because I used to be very addicted to it, where I spent about 8 hours a day - whilst trying to balance sleep, work, university. It was a very linely time. This is my first girlfriend, and the issue is is she always wants to play minecraft. This is because at home she doesnt own a console, and doesnt want to shell out on the PC version. I mean, to the point where she will just ignore me in favour of playing. However, she seems to believe that it can be a fun couple activity. 

I just dont really feel like playing, not going to lie. We got into a bit of an argument about it, and now we're kind of being off with one another. She thinks I should be able to play without becoming addicted or something, which is not what i fear, im just minecrafted out. Should i suck it up and play to make her happy?

Some of our other friends are obviously struggling and have mentioned some concerning things to us in the past few weeks. These things go beyond our ability to help. Normally I like to think I can offer some solid advice but neither my friends nor myself have ever dealt with these issues. 

Without giving too much away, they are dealing with things that are serious but do not pose the risk of physical harm to themselves or others. 

We mentioned to one of the program directors that there was a need for a mental health discussion among the participants and thankfully, they were very supportive of that idea. However, my friends and I have been asked (read: told) to share the names of specific people that need more targeted help. 

While I am super in favor of getting people the help they need, I don't think that it is possible for someone to accept help if they are adamantly against seeking it out. 

If we give the program their names, the program lead said they would pull the students in question aside. We don't want to betray our friends' trust so we are very conflicted on what to do.

c3g3tw	2019-06-21 20:39:03	mrcoolnclever	AITA for telling my girlfriend that men are naturally stronger than men?	"My first post here. 

My girlfriend is an avid softball player having been the catcher for her team for several years now. She‚Äôs also very into Major League Baseball and often comments on how players can improve their game. The other day we were at a game when she off-handedly commented that pitching in baseball is much easier than in softball. I told her that softball players need to throw with a different form in order to build up more momentum in order to throw the ball at the same rate as a guy would. This made since to me because women have smaller muscle fibers than men which generally results in men being stronger on average. 

My girlfriend did not agree. She got very made at me and asked why I would say something so sexist. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be offensive. I thought this was an accepted fact. We both are studying biology at university right now and I know I‚Äôve learned extensively about this so I‚Äôm sure she has too. 

She later looked up the rules and showed me that the reason they pitch like that is due to the size of the field. I agreed that I was wrong mostly to avoid pissing her off any more, but she still gave me the silent treatment for a couple more innings. So AITA??"	Asshole	0	0

c3g2cr	2019-06-21 20:35:52	skeletonfucker	WIBTA if I confront my friend about her recent behavior?	"So this is a weirdly specific situation. I'm really at a loss and I'm not sure if I'm just being overly sensitive or if I actually have a case for confronting her about how I'm feeling.

We're relatively new friends (less than one year) and at first we got along amazingly. We're both artists and I double as a writer. I really love writing and enjoy doing it for others, so I ended up creating about 300 pages of content for her over the course of about three months. I did this totally voluntarily because it was fun at first. I would write her something and in return she would draw me something. It was an even exchange and we took turns creating content for our various interests.

But about three months ago it started to get lopsided. She suffers from depression and went into a depressive state. She stopped producing content, but that didn't bother me at first. We continued worldbuilding and roleplaying--but soon it was only with the characters she liked. If I tried to switch things over to something I was more invested in, she'd completely shut down or ignore me. Plus, her demand for more and more written content was getting sort of out of hand. Basically from the minute I woke up to the minute I logged off for the night, it was a non-stop stream of requests. ""What do you think X would do if this happened? Give me more facts about X. I need more content of X. I want X to do this with my new character I made for them."" Needless to say, this stopped being fun really fucking quick. I didn't want to confront her while she was depressed, so I just started backing away. I figured my reluctance and attitude would sort of get the point across. Instead she's just stopped talking to me at all. She made a new friend and is now doing worldbuilding with him, and is drawing him all kinds of content. She sends this content to me and I always give praise. When I send her my own work, she completely shuts it down. I started doing a new style and all she had to say about it was, ""I don't like the style. They're just stickmen."" It hurt me really badly. She's also made fun of my favorite project I've been working on for years and absolutely refuses to acknowledge it anymore. She won't read anything I write if it isn't about her preferred characters and has generally just stopped being supportive at all.

So that's sort of where we're at now. I feel betrayed and really fucking hurt. I want to confront her and tell her that what she did, whether intentional or not, has really shattered my trust in her. I'm depressed whenever I see her name on Discord. But I also know she's not in a great place herself, and I don't want to make things worse for her.

I was a mentally ill child. My room was a mess. I wasn't a bad kid, I was the kind of kid that made breakfast for my class and paid for their bus fair. But i was troubled.

My mother finally had enough when I was fifteen. The argument started when I wouldn't tidy my room or let her borrow my ps3. I know i know, my fault.

She went really weird. Cut the plug off my tv. Said she wished she'd aborted me. That I was a horrible person etc. She belittled me, told me it was no longer her problem what I did to hurt myself.

She told me to leave. Took my key off me. Slammed the door in my face.

I went to my uncles house. A few days later I went back to her . She was willing to take me back, but we argued again and she got nasty, so she threw me out again.

She had to give my uncle ¬£30 every week to pay for me. This only happened for a month before my uncle became my guardian and got child support off the government. She went to my school and told them she relinquished her parental rights and that she'd call social services if my uncle didn't take me. 

My mum got into debt due to the bedroom tax and because she was no longer getting benefits. She worked, but couldn't afford to live and rent a three bedroomed house.

She had to move in with her boyfriend. She was in debt for a while. She eventually moved to quite far away to get away from me.

She lost her home of 13 years because I left. She got into debt because of it. She was forced to move in with a guy she didn't want to love with, and she moved out a year after. Her relationship crumbled for a lot of reasons, but mostly because of how stressed she was over me leaving.

If I had tidied my room she wouldn't of gotten so angry. I feel really guilty. My family no longer bring it up, but for a couple years after my grandparents tried to get me to go back, they were pretty upset when I refused.

If I hadn't been a lazy brat none of this would of happened. I know i was selfish. I think i am the asshole in this situation. What do you think?"		1	0

I am a 25f, my co-worker is a man in his 50's. We work in separate departments on the same floor, but I liaise with everyone as part of my job and have friendly conversations with most of the people here on a daily basis. This man is very nice, very sweet, usually passing by my desk every day to get coffee. I suspect that he has a VERY mild form of aspergers. We share the trait of being introverted. Anyway, recently he approached my desk and mentioned that while he can appreciate that I enjoy quiet weekends, his wife is working an opposite schedule or something, and he invited me to get together with him on a weekend. I was sort of shocked and froze up a bit. I asked him what he does and he mentioned something along the lines of taking a walk somewhere. I said something like ""thank you for thinking of me!"" but was non-committal and he scampered away.

He approached me shortly again thereafter and asked if I was free. I quickly said that I had plans already. Now, I feel terrible putting him off like this without actually communicating my desire to never spend time together outside of work. I feel as though that would be highly inappropriate, and I'm not quite sure how to tell him. I don't want to say anything like ""would your wife be okay with this?"" because I suspect that his intentions are platonic and don't want to cause any embarassment (though I do feel as though he may be attracted to me). Fuck, I'm at a loss.

Is it wrong of me to think his suggestion is inappropriate? Anyone with any suggestions on how to deal with this, if I am the asshole?

c3ft7e	2019-06-21 20:16:06		AITA because I won't help my boyfriend move?	"Hi Reddit! English is not my first languages, so please forgive me for any mistakes.  


So my boyfriend (24M) just called me (22F) an asshole, because I can't help him move. He's going to live with his dad for a few months, and he asked him to help him move together with his parents 2 months ago. I promised him to help back then.  


So last weeks, my boyfriend asked me about my plans. I told him I was meeting with my friend, who I haven't seen in two months, and was really excited about it. I was going to help her out with a tournament. He told me I wasn't, because I promised to help him move. I totally forgot about it!! He said it was okay though, because his parents were going to help him out anyway, so there's probably not much for me to do anyway.   
I still felt really bad about it, so I asked another friend if she could help him out, and promised I still could help in the evening.   


Today he told me he rejected my friend's offer, but still wanted me to help him out. I said I'm sorry, but I'm busy the whole day, and won't be able to help out much at day. I asked why he rejected my friend's offer, and he just said it was going to be 'awkward', and really wanted me to be here, so I could hang out with his parents. That my priorities are not in order and I promised him first, so I could easily leave the tournament a few hours earlier. He said I was lucky that he didn't get very angry with me, because I was so stupid to make plans with my friend on the same day. After that he called me an asshole.  


I apologized many times and know I'm in the wrong for forgetting I would help him out, but it feels like he's rejecting everything I do to try to help him or make it easier for him. This never happened before, since I normally write everything down in my agenda. So reddit, AITA?"		1	0
c3ft4q	2019-06-21 20:15:56		AITA for changing our Wi-fi password until my roommate helped out around the apartment?	"Will try to keep this as brief as possible.  Myself and a friend were sharing an apartment, all costs split evenly.  When he first moved in I was working 12 hours days as a pipe-fitter and everything was going smoothly.  The place wasn't flawless but we each did our own dishes and kept the communal areas in acceptable condition, he wouldn't clean the bathroom but I honestly didn't mind as it wasn't much of a commitment despite the fact I was working literally twice as many hours.    


The problem arose when I was laid off; We were in Northern Canada and I was laid off each winter due to excavation/laying pipe being impossible.  As soon as I began living off of unemployment he suddenly and utterly stopped helping around the apartment.  He wouldn't clean anything, at all.  Even leaving his dirty dishes and garbage wherever he was at the time.  It only took a few days before our common areas were littered with his dishes, garbage, and dirty laundry.  I approached him and asked if there was any reason he was suddenly neglecting to clean up after himself.  ""You're home all day while I'm at work so you should be doing it"" was his response.  I retorted that I had worked my ass off for well over half the year to be in this position and that even when I barely did anything but work and sleep I had managed to uphold my end of the cleaning (as well as bathroom).    


Things didn't improve and he got very agitated and passively aggressive when I brought it up.  So after nearly two weeks of him not lifting a finger and our living quarters decaying in to squalor I changed the Wifi password while he was at work.  I lived there before he moved in so even though he was paying half of the bills everything was solely in my name.  When he returned home from work I had informed him I had changed the password and would give it to him after he at least began to help out again.  He says this is unfair because he had paid his rent and internet bill and it was his right, as such.  I agree with his sentiment in principle but I didn't see any otherr option.  He didn't care about my feelings or about what was right, the only thing he cared about was online gaming/youtube/etc.    


After I was steadfast in my decision he begrudgingly cleaned up after himself and continued to do so to a somewhat acceptable degree.  I gave him the Wi-fi password that night after he spent an hour or so beginning to rectify the situation but he seems to be holding a grudge.  I know this was not the optimal way of going about things but didn't see how else to get through to him.    


So, AITA?"		1	0
c3fsnu	2019-06-21 20:14:54	BurritoEater12	AITA for going back on my word regarding selling our house?	"Short version of what happened - we sold our house, closed last week. During the negotiation process we agreed to credit the buyers $5,000 towards various repairs. During their lending process they somehow screwed up so they only got $4,000 credit and the ‚Äúextra‚Äù $1,000 came to us. Their realtor asked ours if we would split that amount and write them a check for $500 because it was technically ‚Äútheirs.‚Äù 

Since they weren‚Äôt asking for the whole amount, I initially said that would be fine and we‚Äôd figure it out after closing - my realtor conveyed this to theirs.

Now that closing has happened, our realtor says she can‚Äôt be involved in the money changing hands and basically left it at - if we want to we can mail a $500 check to our old address. 

Now I‚Äôm thinking this sounds super sketch and I don‚Äôt want to send the money, TBH, $500 is a large sum of money to us right now. I‚Äôm feeling selfish and like I‚Äôm the asshole here if I go back on my word and don‚Äôt send the check. But I‚Äôm also worried that if we do send the check, they‚Äôll come back and say we agreed to giving them the full amount and ask for another $500.

Well,  I have a habit of replying to spam email. So I see a mail from ""some chick"",  so I initiate a conversation. Usually when I do this,  I pretend that I am absolutely dumb,  and I purposely use bad grammar to make take the point home. Now,  that girl was pretending to be a refugee from Nigeria who had some funds that needed getting out and she needed a loving and caring life partner to see it through. I initiate the talks and slowly make it clear that I am absolutely interested in investing in her scheme. But I add a twist that she has to show me her body,  as a precondition for her having faith in me. 
The conversation goes on and the person actually sends me a few nudes. Then gives me bank details of an account in my own country,  and asks me to send money. 
This is the point where we politely exchange abuses and the conversation stops.

The conversation with my GF:

I was actually proud of what I had accomplished.  So while spending time with my GF I let her read the emails. When she got to the nudes I received,  she was livid and furious. Berating me for fooling around like this. I thought of apologizing but didn't think it was worth apologizing for. It ended up in a few hours of friction between me and her.

Basically my mother is manipulative and she lies about serious stuff.

I am now back both to make an update and to also ask a new question about whether I could be an asshole or not for what I‚Äôll soon explain.

First of all, I am still not able to forgive my mother for what she has done and I most likely never will be. But at the same time I want her to be in my life. She is my mother and I love her. I dislike her though, but I‚Äôm slowly learning to accept how things are and like the good parts about her. I have started to be with her more and talk/do things I know we both like. I‚Äôm trying to move on even though it‚Äôs hard.

Now, to the reason why I‚Äôm making this post.
Sometimes me, my father and stepmother sits down and talk about issues going on. I‚Äôll talk about my mother. I do these talks with them to get advice to help me try and move on from what happened and accept how things are. My father is still clearly hella alot mad at my mother, and he has all the rights too. She ruined his life for a long while, made his friends turn against him which forced him to have to move and basically start up a new life somewhere else. It wasn‚Äôt easy for him, he obviously had it way harder than me. But my dad never misses out on a chance to voice his opinion about my mother. It doesn‚Äôt happen often but when it does it‚Äôs emotionally draining. Because like I said, I‚Äôm trying to move on but it‚Äôs impossible when I can‚Äôt even mention my mother without hearing about how awful she is. I clearly don‚Äôt want him to continue and mentioning the past all the time when I‚Äôm talking about new issues. I can‚Äôt move on when it‚Äôs continuesly thrown into my face. But at the same time my dad is incredibly hurt, and at time (which isn‚Äôt that often) he clearly can‚Äôt hold himself back. I make it obvious that I don‚Äôt want to hear but I‚Äôm wondering if this makes me an asshole.

He needs to be able and get his feelings out too and maybe by doing what he‚Äôs doing is a way for him to move on. But it also doesn‚Äôt help me at all, I‚Äôm not the one who‚Äôs able to listen to these things. I try to shut him down when he starts, show that I can‚Äôt take it. Am I an asshole for not listening to his side of things anymore when he‚Äôs like this?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c3fk6z	2019-06-21 19:56:37		AITA for telling my best friend he‚Äôs not being a good friend	"So to start this off, I want to give a little background. When it comes to friendships,  I usually pour my heart and soul into them because I feel very strongly about what true friendship is and means. Now, I know it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect the same in return, and I do not expect the same in return, but I do hope there is some sort of reciprocation in that friendship is a two way street. 

My best friend of 10 years recently got into a relationship. As any friend would be, I was thrilled for him. And I knew that I would see him less often and I was perfectly OK with that. Granted, I didn‚Äôt think it would go from hanging out pretty much weekly to hanging out once every 5 to 6 months. Either way, fine.

We‚Äôre both fairly busy people, so the best way to make sure we have time to hang out is to book our calendars a few weeks in advance. But recently, on the day of, I‚Äôll get a text saying something like ‚Äúhey sorry, forgot about today. I‚Äôll need to reschedule‚Äù or ‚Äú sorry, I‚Äôm exhausted from a long week. Let‚Äôs try again some other time‚Äù In my head, I said, OK fine--perhaps I caught him on bad days. 

I recently had my birthday dinner, and of course I invited my best friend , and he said he would be there. Lo and behold, he doesn‚Äôt show and I get a text saying something to the effect of ‚Äúsorry, I fell asleep on the couch‚Äú. To make sure I am painting a fair picture, I had several friends at the dinner, so it‚Äôs not like it was just me eating alone. But still, I was excited to see him and he didn‚Äôt come. 

To me, that was kind of the final straw, and I sent him a text saying how it really sucked that he didn‚Äôt make it out for my birthday, of all things. And that I wish he‚Äôd put more effort into our friendship. He hasn‚Äôt replied yet, but now that I have sent it, I feel not great about it.

On the day of his birthday he asked to go hang out with his friends and go camping. It‚Äôs summer so we said yes. 

A little back story before I get into the AITA part: 

My son isn‚Äôt biologically my son. His father died when he was very young (6ish) and his mother was unfit to raise him. My husband and I took him in and have been with him ever since. He was generally an excellent child. He‚Äôs given us endless joy and happiness. Recently though, he‚Äôs started to act out. At first it was small. Breaking curfew, lying, hanging out with questionables. We tried talking, because he is a straight A, chess club, football, beta club all around good kid. 

It didn‚Äôt work. We tried grounding. Screaming. Listening. You name it we‚Äôve tried it. His misbehavior is only escalating though. He was caught smoking weed. (I know weed isn‚Äôt huge and I‚Äôve always been open about that conversation but clear that he was expected to stay away until he was 18 an adult to make that decision.) He was involved in a hit and run. He was caught stealing. 

This catches us up to our story now. In the middle of the night I get a call from the police, again. This time, our son was caught tagging an abandoned house and had taken my husband‚Äôs revolver from the safe. 

He was charged for the gun and released to us. The officers were really great to us but I wish they wouldn‚Äôt have been so cool in front of son. 

I was livid and screamed at him, took away all of his privileges, anything I could think of and he still is treating it as a joke. He told my SIL that he thought it was all funny. 

I‚Äôm really confused and hurt, son and I used to be so close. The three of us all have always been very close. Husband and I feel as if our trust has been completely destroyed and that we‚Äôre losing our son.

He now says he doesn't want her brought up ever again because he wants to move on from that ""terrible part in his life"" and I respect that now just cause I would rather not start a problem, but i also feel hes thinking too deeply about it and should instead of forgetting about it, own it and work to make his current relationship better.

c3fj4p	2019-06-21 19:54:26	Vilachi	AITA for only being in contact with my mother when I need money?	"TLDR at the bottom

Okay so I (22M) have never had a good relationship with my mother, in fact it‚Äôs been a very toxic and rocky life with her. It‚Äôs only been me and my mom, I‚Äôve never had a father figure in my life, and the rest of my family (who I lost contact with when I went into care at the age of 15) have never really been around.

My mother was an alcoholic throughout all of my childhood, she mentally abused me most evenings when she had a drink. (She was
a completely different and kind woman during the day when she didn‚Äôt drink) and we always ended up getting into arguments which I always got the blame for, it‚Äôs really messed me up as a person mentally, and I‚Äôve always found it hard to accept when someone‚Äôs nice to me (always wondering what they want in return for example) 

Last year I had a really bad breakdown, mentally was unstable for awhile, I ended up in the hospital for a few days, my mum wasn‚Äôt anywhere to be seen, I was all alone, confused, angry, and sad, I tried to leave, they ended up sectioning me in the hospital and had security watching me, when they finally let me go I had to walk for an hour all the way home, when I did get back my mother said I couldn‚Äôt stay there anymore, she told me it was because she did want to wake up to me dead one morning. 

She was the cause for my mental health issues, she told me to just go and disappear. 

Anyway, I ended up homeless, luckily my local council put me up in hotels for 6 months (they didn‚Äôt think a hostile would be a good environment for my mental health) I stayed in those hotels by myself, with no contact with my mother or anyone, I did however continue working my part time job where I still work now. Fortunately they found me a flat which is where I‚Äôm living now, i was so happy, to begin with.

I didn‚Äôt realise how many bills I‚Äôd have to pay, or how expensive it is to live by myself, my part time job only just about pays for my bills and the debts I‚Äôm paying off.

I can barely afford food or electric, I currently have my electric on ‚Äúemergency‚Äù (¬£3 left to last me, hooorah?) and I have no food, only a few cans of vegetables left. 

I‚Äôve been in contact with my mother recently,  things aren‚Äôt working out so great, she thinks I don‚Äôt know how to live and keeps on reminding me that there is no way I can live with her again (not that I would want too, lol) but she helps me out with money, money that I need for food and electric.

As much as I hate speaking to the woman I really need the help sometimes and I just have no one else to approach, I did start escorting just to make ends meet during the times we weren‚Äôt speaking, in fact I‚Äôm escorting Sunday just so I can afford to buy some food for once lol. I hate doing it, it makes me feel physically sick.

so, AITA for only being in contact with my mother for money? 


TLDR: Abusive mother ruined my childhood and pretty much abandoned me when I was struggling mentally,  only staying in contact for when I need money, desperately."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"When our son was just over a year old, my husband at the time announced he was leaving me for someone he met online and moved to another state. Our son is now almost 4 and has seen his dad on about 10 different occasions, most for less than 2 hours. He doesn't call him daddy and doesn't really know who he is other than someone to play with. When we got divorced, we agreed I could have sole custody in exchange for him not having to pay child support, and the only visitation schedule is that he can request visitation but it has to be at least 24 hours in advance. There's nothing in the agreement about me having to agree to it. 

A few months ago, ex wanted to come see our son and bring his new girlfriend, who he had only been with for about a week (thanks, facebook). I didn't like the idea, but to keep the peace I said sure. She came, it went fine, they broke up the next day. He got another girlfriend the day after, they dated for a week, broke up. Now he's with another woman and he asked if he could bring her to meet son. I said no, it's inappropriate, stay with her for about another 2 months at least and then they can meet. He...lost his shit. Started threatening me, saying he'd take son and run and never let me see him again, calling me names, etc. She sent me threatening messages as well, about taking my son and name-calling. I actually got the police involved on that but was advised to just block her. 

All of that had started to die down again, but 2 weeks ago he wanted to see son and take him to the park. I said sure. He came to pick son up and surprise, his girlfriend was with him. Son was super excited to go to the park and I knew it would cause a fight, so against my better judgement I said he could go with them but after that ex was not seeing/taking kiddo anywhere without me present. After he dropped son back off with me, he started sending me more harassing texts, saying I'm keeping son from him and he's going to take me to court for violating our custody agreement and 'parental interference'. He even called the cops on me, but they didn't do anything once I proved I have sole custody and no visitation agreement.

So, my question: AITA for being strict about ex seeing our son? Should I get over it and let this potentially violent woman, who has been with ex for less than 2 months, around my son?

"My daughter is 19 and has never bought me a present or taken me out to eat before because she has never had money before. Some years she picks a present that her mom pays for, some years she makes me breakfast, some years we just have a family game day. It's great every time. I guess this year she decided that since she has money from dog sitting she has to pay for things on her own, and she took me out to breakfast in town. Nothing too fancy, but it was pretty great and I wasn't paying so I wasn't complaining. Then we get to the counter to pay and she gives a nearly 50% tip. The bill was just over $31 and she tipped $15. I honestly thought it was a mistake since she's never paid at a restaurant or dealt with tipping before, so I was like ""woah, do you know how much you're tipping?"" She laughed it off and told me she knows, she can handle it. I backed off, and I kinda thought that was it since she was fine the rest of the day. But now she's being a little distant and told her mom that I was rude for calling her out in front of the waitress and it was embarrassing that I said that, and probably insulting to the waitress. I think it's an overreaction, and if she was so upset why would she pretend she's fine all day and then go silent treatment on me?

I took the organizer out of my room and put in the bathroom. I took most of the snacks/candy out except for the chocolate. I think i just forgot to grab it. So the chocolate has been sitting in the bathroom for months. Well today i was at work and my boyfriend was watching my daughter for me. My 11 year old nephew decided to come over and hang out with my boyfriend. My boyfriend said my nephew went in my bathroom and came back with the chocolate. My boyfriend let him eat it but not my daughter since she can't have chocolate. That happened at 9am. Time went on. It's 1p.m Then my boyfriend calls me saying ""Hey your nephew is here and he's not feeling good. He's puking. You need to get here quick!"" I got off from work and came straight home. He's sweating, diarrhea, vomiting and looks like he's in pain. I told my boyfriend he might have food poisoning from what he ate last night. I asked my nephew that he has eaten in the last 24hours. Hamburgers, mac n cheese, green beans, ice cream, pancakes, and the chocolate in your bathroom. As soon he said the chocolate, i immediately called his mom (RN). She screamed at me to take him to the ER since food poisoning can be lethal. So we quickly got him to the ER and so far as I know he was  just resting. My sister screamed at me.

Am I the Asshole in this situation?


UPDATE: 
So it wasn't the chocolate. Thankfully, but my nephew did eat something that didn't agree with him. He was so dehydrated and he is getting somewhat better. He says he's still in lot of pain. We won't know what's going on till later. My sister won't apologize to me, even though the doctor said it wasn't the chocolate. Even though it wasn't the chocolate, i still feel like the asshole."

So I finish work at 12pm and she goes to work for 2, she's working til 6pm.
I chill for a while and wait for her to finish so I can arrive with food and then we can go home and watch a movie, great! It's different from what we usually do and it's nice and easy, no stress.
Now my gf has money rn and I don't (we get paid alternatively so we support each other in turns) so I ask her to send me some money for the food before work. Unfortunately she did not send the money, as she forgot.
So I think about it and decided not to call her at work (she is a barista) and I decide we can get some food together after work, no big deal.
It was a big deal.
As soon as I say we are gonna go get the food after work, her face sours and she refuses to talk to me until she is finished, saying she'll walk home (I usually drive her to work and back).
This upset me so I went to go get the food before she finishes, as she had to stay for longer, and I come back to her work to see if she needs picking up. She takes the lift and we get home.
Now my gf and I have been going through a lil rough patch and we are both really depressed so we have problems sometimes.
As soon as we get home she goes on about how I ""never do anything ever"" and ""all you've done for four hours is fuck all"" and how she ""wants a boyfriend that pretends to care"".

&#x200B;

I was talking to my friend yesterday, just chatting about how our day went etc. and she just randomly asks me ""Do you actually like me lol or do u just think I'm annoying and talk crap abt me in class lol"" (We're both in highschool for context) so I actually genuinely really love her and I think that she's a great friend, and I would literally trust her with anything. I replied, ""Wtf why would u think I hate u, I love you ur so sweet and ur a great friend. I never talk shit about you in class but some times my friends make fun of the LGBT stuff and you post on your story and we laugh but that's the worst it gets"" I didn't think that much of it at the time but that's what I said. For context, she's a really big LGBTQ+ supporter, she isn't gay or anything herself, but she supports them which I don't find a problem in whatsoever. The joke I made with my friends was my friend came up to me and said ""Yo the gay pride theme song goes so hard"" and then played clown music. I'm not homophobic or anything but I just took it lightly and I laughed. She then proceeded to get really upset and angry at me because I laughed and said that ""it isn't anything to laugh about"" and that ""it shows that I'm not in support of the LGBT community, and \*I should be\*"". This just escalated the situation further and I also got mad at the fact that she said ""\*I should be in support of them\*"". I explained to her that we aren't actually edgelords who hate gay people but we were just taking matters lightly, and being humorous rather than taking it seriously. I'm brown myself so I often get jokes that I'm a terrorist or I'm a bomber or things like that and that I never get pressed and get triggered and she shouldn't either. She started calling me close-minded and ignorant and that no matter how ""lightly you take it"" I was being very insensitive. I slept over it and I think I'm going to apologize for what I did but I asked some friends they said that she was in the wrong, so I'm not sure. Reddit, AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

However, last year I asked to do my taxes myself. I felt like I had a better understanding of my employment history and it might be easier for me to do them, rather than an accountant that I had no contact with. My mom insisted that I let her and the accountant do it. This was for the 2017 fiscal year.

Fast forward to 2018 tax time and my mom tells me that her and the accountant messed up my taxes for 2017. They accidentally filed my taxes UNDER THE WRONG NAME, and they included a W-2 form from 2016. So, they had to amend the taxes and they never heard back about the amendment. They never got my refund, nothing. 

This created problems for 2018 tax time, mostly because I didn‚Äôt know the AGI from the previous year and couldn‚Äôt file electronically for 2018.

I blew up on my mom, calling her irresponsible for knowing about a mistake from my 2017 taxes and never fixing it, leaving me the mess to clean up.

"So a little back story here, my cousin and I are fairly close, she was in college just this past year, has the summer off and is going back in the fall. She has a seven year old in grade one and a four year old who stays at home with her since she's not working in the summer and is a single mother. I recently decided to return back to work part-time which is ten days a month, she had thought because she wasn't going to school that she would babysit him and I would pay her for those 10 days a month up front on the first. 

Well today she stopped by to pick him up but he wasnt done eating, so I leave the keys for her to lock up on her way out. I work for a local women's fashion store and it's the slow season right now and they are down sales from last year, I find out on my way to work that I can have the day off if I'd like since I wasn't needed. I say sure no biggie and call my husband, he was supposed to be off work about two hours early but let him know I'm not working. He doesnt have much going on at work and uses a flex day and takes the rest of the day off. I figure hey my cousin has my son, me and hubby can power clean some of the house that has been neglected.

On our way home we meet up at the grocery store get a few things, while I'm there I called my cousin to see if she was still at my house  she said she was just about to head home. I'm like cool I'll just leave it as is, she can take him to her house. We had to quickly stop at Walmart for an item,  when Im there I get a text that one of her friends saw us at the grocery store. I say I was picking up something and she said oh interesting since it was supposed to be half an hour in to my shift. So I decide to call her and let her know I was given the day off and my husband was able to leave early. She's none to pleased and felt me and my husband were having a day date and wanted to drop my son off. I stated that in this situation she is being paid as a babysitter and shouldn't matter if I was at home napping or having a date, she was being paid to watch him ten days a month.

c3f4g9	2019-06-21 19:22:40	LikeAfterSummer	AITA for banning extra desserts and foods from my family birthday party?	"TLDR: I am making cupcakes for my birthday. My family wants me to make a cheesecake in addition since they don‚Äôt like cupcakes. I don‚Äôt want to make extra dessert, as I feel that every party we have has copious amounts of dessert and food and I‚Äôm sick of it.


A bit of background. My family loves to have parties for any occasion- birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, etc. While I don‚Äôt mind the socialization, the thing that bothers me the most is the outrageous amount of food at every event. I‚Äôm talking 4-5 desserts, candy, chips, three options for entrees, alcohol, cakes. It‚Äôs essentially a feast for 50 for the 15 or so people in my family. 

The issue with all of this is that many people in my family are over weight including myself. We all always complain about weight, not being able to lose any, yet every few weeks is another occasion to indulge. My boyfriend and other friends have commented on the crazy amount of food we have at parties and frankly, it‚Äôs a bit embarrassing.

This weekend is my birthday and all I wanted  were hamburgers and chocolate peanut butter cupcakes. I just wanted a chill day with a normal amount of food. Quickly this has spiraled- we now have fruit and veggie trays, a daiquiri bar, onion rings, chips, French fries, in addition to what I requested.

Here‚Äôs the conflict: apparently my family is not a fan of chocolate peanut butter cupcakes. So my aunt is requesting that I make a cheesecake as well. I pushed back saying no, we have enough desserts and if people don‚Äôt like cupcakes, they don‚Äôt have to eat them. 

My mom and aunts are so mad at me, essentially demanding I make the cake. They say I‚Äôm selfish for only making the dessert I like. I feel that since it‚Äôs my party, the dessert should be what I like. I‚Äôm trying to watch my weight as well and I just don‚Äôt want the party to turn into the usual pig out fest. We all are tempted with extra sweets lying around, and I know most of the leftovers will stay at my house where I will likely eat them.

c3f41n	2019-06-21 19:21:46	doople-dongus	AITA for not wanting to go to my girlfriend's friend's birthday bash?	"throw away account

A couple weeks ago my gf made me aware of her friend's birthday party in NYC. I live about 3 hours away, so I said sure let's go that weekend. Then things started to get a bit complicated.

Problem #1: I soon learned that this is more than a birthday party, it's a whole birthday weekend. As a matter of fact for him it's an entire birthday week; he's going to be there with some other friends a week leading up until we're supposed to arrive. He is unemployed and gets all of his money from his parents, so the trip will be fully funded for him and with all his spare time he's built a massive itinerary. I'm expected to go from Friday to Sunday, and I'm encouraged to stay until Monday. I work week days, so I'm simply not staying later than Sunday. In fact I would prefer to just go on Saturday, not stay overnight at all and save myself hundreds on a hotel room for the party of someone I hardly know. This way I can celebrate his birthday on his actual birthday, nice and simple, and not have to abide by the strict and unaccommodating itinerary (i'll get to this next) the rest of the weekend.

Problem #2: the itinerary was very clearly not built to suit anyone but him. I just got the itinerary sent to me yesterday and I'm floored. This guy is gay, which is obviously fine and I have no problems with him personally, but the weekend consists mostly of Pride events, and not the type I'm excited to go to. I would be fine with going to a Pride march or something like that to support my gf who's supporting her friend, but it's not that lowkey. On Saturday night I'm expected to attend ""World Pride Erotika,"" with a $30 entry fee, from 11 PM to 4 AM. I'm not entirely sure what that entails but I think I would rather do something else... The alternative is to hang out somewhere else in NYC and obviously get a hotel room for hundreds of dollars that night. Gf is very opposed to leaving the same day we arrive, so a hotel room seems like a certainty. On top of this the restaurants in the schedule are very high end and will cost hundreds more. Once again, the birthday boy will be paid for entirely by parents.

Maybe I'm boring but if I throw a party I provide for my guests, it will be one event somewhere local with food and drinks. Definitely wouldn't last all day. ""Thanks for coming and have a safe drive home""

This guy wants me to drive 3 hours each way, put up what I'm guessing will come out to be somewhere between $500 and $1000, and attend all of his Pride events on his schedule. I think that's asking too much. By a mile and a half.

Since Bob has ran this restaurant, he has been raking in the money. Eventually it changed him. He became cocky, and put me down at every chance. According to him:

* I don't deserve my 150,000K salary because I type in front of a computer all day (Software developer)
* I don't deserve my salary because I cannot work in a high-stress kitchen
* I am a piece of shit because I pay for public transit

I got tired of this BS, so I cut all contact with him. He apologizes, but those apologies are meaningless as his behavior does not change.

I met up with my friends, who are still good friends with Bob. I talk about the problems with Bob, and a friend, we shall call Mary said something along the lines of ""no, that doesn't sound like the Bob I know"". Understandably I don't expect people to believe me, but its still hurts when people can't see the truth if it was standing in front of them.

Now, last week, I met up with my friends again. Mary tells us that Bob slept with Mary's sister. Her sister and her husband are now filing for divorce. I told her ""really? that doesn't sound like the Bob I know"" and she is no longer talking to me.

So, AITA for reciprocating in the same way? She doesn't believe me when I tell her about Bob, so I tell her that I don't believe her."		1	0
c3f296	2019-06-21 19:17:55		AITA for telling my boyfriend that he is crazy for thinking that he is dying of cancer?	"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Also, english is not my native language, so please apologize for any mistakes in grammar/spelling. 

&#x200B;

So, me (F29) and my boyfriend (M31) have been together for 13 years, living together for the last 4. We have a wonderful and loving relationship which makes me very, very happy in every aspect. We are getting married in a few months and live a happy, very fulfilled life. 

&#x200B;

Today we had a falling out over something that I cannot for the life of me wrap my head around. Today he had the day off  work, but since I was working he went downtown on my lunch break to have lunch with me, which I very much appreciated and had been looking forward to all morning. 

&#x200B;

So we go to a restaurant, sit down and out of the blue he says he has stopped smoking because he has been really worried about something. He said that he had a back ache (he had mentioned in briefly over the last days) but he thought that it could be something very serious with his lungs and had a really bad feeling about what it could be, and as such would be going to the doctor to get tested. I got really scared and asked what was wrong, what symptoms he had and what he thought it could be. He said that his back has been hurting on and off and about a week ago he felt a bit dizzy coming home from work. I snapped and asked if he was hiding something from me, like other symptoms that he didn't want to tell me about so that I would not get worried. He said no, just the back pain. So I said ""so, your back hurts and you immediately think you have cancer or something?"" and he says ""yes, I think I probably have cancer"". 

&#x200B;

At this point I get really annoyed and say that he is acting crazy and got me panicking over nothing. He said that he had googled and that sometimes back pain may be a symptom of lung cancer. I get really annoyed and tell him that he is delusional, acting irrationally and that in all probability he is just getting older and is acting like an insane person. At this point I'm literally screaming in the restaurant and so I insist that we go to the emergency room, tell my boss I'm not going back after lunch and we go to the hospital. Doctor looks at him for 10 seconds, listens to his heart, asks some questions and sends us home with painkillers. 

&#x200B;

Please bear in mind that this back pain is not at all the type of unbearable pain that keeps you from walking, getting around, having sex, doing sports, etc. - he is getting around just fine. His family has a history of being overdramatic over health stuff which annoys me a lot. He did find out when he was about 8 that his mom had lupus and thought she was going to die, and I think that always stuck with him. Nevertheless, he said that I was insensitive and that I should just be supportive in these moments, and that I was only worried about myself and telling him I was acting crazy.

And she just made me sit on a bench and tried to calm me down, I kept crying and saying that we should go to this funfair, but she said that she didn't want me to force myself to go just for her, after an hour of crying and mental breakdown, we go home, she says she doesn't want to talk about it, that even if she knows that I didn't do it on purpose I still ruined our anniversary , she locked herself inside and said that she didn't wanted to talk to me, I am currently alone sitting on the street not really knowing what to think...AITA ?

UPDATE : After reading the first comments I decided to get up and talk to her, I said that there was still time to go to that funfair (as I knew she planned this for months) and I promised I'd stay calm, she cried and said ok, we went back to the funfair, I was a little tense but I kept my cool, I love her, I couldn't make her sad again, we had a blast there, then we went to a party together, we ate, it was awesome, we went home, we hugged and danced as we wished each other a happy birthday.

c3f0gg	2019-06-21 19:14:15	EightBitZero	AITA for going on a date with a girl that my good friend had, or possibly still has, a crush on.	"Nobody really knows my reddit account and honestly I dont think that this is that serious as to warrant a new account 

Anyways about a week or so ago I go to a graduation party at another friend's house I hang out with A, the girl I asked out, and we generally get along pretty well. I wasn't expecting anything but her friend makes me put her number in her phone and I kinda just shrug it off as a joke or prank. 

Then the drama starts the friend in question, B, is compelled into a melodramatic despair. We jokingly call it sad boy hours. It's nothing new for him he gets worked up over girls all the time, I honestly though he was just mad that I got a girls number and he hadn't. Turns out he was mad, but it ran a little deeper than I thought. He had a crush on A for about 2 weeks, and he tells me how hes been hitting on her and felt he had been making progress untill her friend gave me her number. We essentially agree that it was prob just a bad joke, but later I get a text from A and well after a while texting I just ask her out on a date, knowing that B was maybe still hung up on her.

But there's the kicker should I feel bad that I did this even though hes only liked her for 2 weeks. Hes acting as though I've betrayed him when it feels to me he's expecting too much from what a crush gets you. He acts as though I've prevented him from getting a girlfriend but that's just blantly untrue. She doesnt like him and has already let him down easy. I understand that the timing is terrible and that I probably should have waited a bit longer, but I fail to see how I need to pity B for how I ruined his two week crush. And I fail to see how I'm the asshole for going on a date with someone who was interested in me and didn't even like B. 

Some of my friends are saying I'm the asshole and I need to apologize to my friend but apologize for what a hypothetical relationship.

c3exy4	2019-06-21 19:08:55	bowiesbootycall	AITA for cutting off my very depressed (ex) best friend?	"Some context:

This girl, lets call her Terry, and I met last year in our junior year of HS. She was also from a military family, and we clicked. Terry also suffers from extreme depressive episodes that require medication and therapy due to a traumatic car accident a couple years back. 

Terry and I were really close in my mind, we went almost everywhere together and we could bond over ultra feminine things like new makeup trends/brands, clothing, etc. in a way, she made me feel more secure in my girly nature. I felt happy for a long time.

After a while, however, Terry begun to sneak in these little remarks or comments that just really hurt. I should mention she‚Äôs drop dead gorgeous, and meets a lot of conventional beauty standards. We‚Äôd be walking home when she‚Äôd say stuff like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre lucky [for being a medium size], all the XS sizes at [store] get snapped up by skinny people‚Äù or ‚Äúyou just don‚Äôt understand how hard it is being THIS conventionally attractive.‚Äù

Needless to say, it hurt. I would make lighthearted ‚Äúouch‚Äù type jokes so she‚Äôd hopefully notice without me being too sensitive, but they always popped back up again. She eventually would straight up ignore what I was saying, and talk about whatever SHE wanted to. I tried to ask her about this and all she said was ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault you talk so much.‚Äù 

So, the moment of truth. She and I work in the same building, and the night before I had mentioned opening at 9. The next morning I checked my schedule and it turns out I needed to come in at 11. Cue (justified) irritable texts from Terry about how she showed up early and I‚Äôm not there and blah blah blah. I felt really bad, because the manager thought I was coming in at 9 today too, so that means the text that she‚Äôd be late was sent to ME and not Terry.

I show up to work and Terry is PISSED. Irritably she tries to yell at me to go do stuff and I joke about her having no authority over me cause I‚Äôve worked there longer (no serious tone whatsoever). I continue doing my thing until we get into a small argument, and as she‚Äôs cleaning the window she turns to spray it directly in my face and says ‚Äúchoke, bitch.‚Äù When I hit the bottle away, she does it AGAIN.

Needless to say, I haven‚Äôt even looked at her since that happened. She tried to hug me and talk to me in person and all I said was ‚Äúget away from me, don‚Äôt talk to me.‚Äù AITA for doing this, knowing I could be kicking up her depressive tendencies?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Call it teenage angst, but there's just some things I want to myself, if that makes sense? Like I want independence from my parents and family in at least one aspect of my life, especially since I'm too young to move out so currently everything I do revolves around my parents.

But a few months ago my mom requested to follow me, to which I declined. I explained that, while I DONT post anything ""scandalous"" or inappropriate, it's not exactly stuff I want my family interacting with (honestly, it's just an abundance of selfies and shitposts). And I didn't think that'd be an issue either, since she trusts me enough to not search my phone, etc. She got pretty upset and I felt guilty about it. I said I'd happily follow her account and that I just don't want her to follow back, but that didn't make it better. It was a sore subject for a week but she doesn't mention it anymore. Flash forward to now, my dad made an account for his band and requested to follow me, which brings me back to this dilemma. I still stand by wanting to separate family and friends, plus if I accept him my mom will undoubtedly get upset and I can see that spiraling into me having to accept every relative on the app. 

I know this probably seems like a stupid subject, but am I being an asshole?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

c3ews4	2019-06-21 19:06:27	daddyof1princessa	AITA for telling my wife we need a break from traveling?	"My wife and I have been married for 4 years; we also have a nearly 1 year old. She‚Äôs also been an adventurer. We both went to separate colleges so we have friends spread out all over the place that we like to visit. Prior to us having a baby, a lot of weekends were spent doing mini-trips with big ones when we could get the time off work. 

After the baby was born, I thought things were going to slow down, because it‚Äôs a lot harder to pack up her stuff and bring her. Plus, now she‚Äôs teething and gets quite fussy on car trips (and I‚Äôm the one that ends up tending to her on these trips). I was wrong. Most weekends, the wife has some trip planned for us, someone for us to go see. And if we‚Äôre not going somewhere, someone‚Äôs coming to us. I cannot think of the last weekend where we just relaxed. I work from home, so the household duties fall on me-which is fine-but it means that I‚Äôm in charge of getting the house ready for guests and I think she underestimates how much work it is with the baby (she‚Äôs in daycare since I can‚Äôt give her 100% with work, but it‚Äôs mornings only). At the end of the week, I‚Äôm exhausted and I know the wife is too, because she works hard. I know she wants to make memories with our daughter, and she has some guilt because she wants to work. However, sometimes, I just need a break.

This weekend, we have more friends coming. Next weekend, we‚Äôre doing something for the 4th. I asked her if we could take the two weekends following that off from traveling or entertaining.  (Keep in mind we don‚Äôt have anything else planned for July, so it‚Äôs not like I was cancelling plans.) She said she wanted to invited some friends up. I told her that I just need a break and if she wanted to go somewhere, I‚Äôd keep the baby or she could take her, but I‚Äôm done traveling until August, when we‚Äôre going on our big trip with our families. She said I was being a jerk for not wanting to go and I told her that she really underestimates how much work I put into these events (which I have tried before, but she doesn‚Äôt listen). She left for work, upset. Now I‚Äôm even more not in the mood for this weekend.

c3ev3t	2019-06-21 19:02:58	taway190345677	AITA for walking out of a church service after feeling uncomfortable?	"So when I first started college, I met a group of people who were really cool and accepting and made me feel like I belonged. It turned out it was a religious group (Christian), but they were never too pushy about it. There were always religious undertones when we did things and went to events, but we had a blast doing lots of other things. I got pretty close to some of the guys and we eventually all started hanging out almost daily. 

One day, one of the guys invited me to go to church with the rest of the group. The thing is, I‚Äôm not very religious. I was raised catholic, but have never truly believed in any of it or had much interest in pursuing religious activities. However, I was open to going to mass since it meant a lot to them and accepted the offer. 

Once we were there, it wasn‚Äôt so bad. It was actually fun. There was a band playing, the pastor had a lot of jokes, and it was way more chill than the Catholic masses I had grown up attending. However, about 30 minutes in, they introduced a guest speaker. A pastor or something from another church.

When he got up to the mic, he started talking fire and brimstone. The whole ‚Äúyou are all sinners in the eyes of God and must repent lest you burn in Hell for eternity‚Äù spiel. I mean, he was going HARD on that stuff. Before long, he commanded everyone to get on their knees and beg for forgiveness. Everyone around me did it, while I stood there looking like a deer caught in headlights. The speaker called me out and started directing all of his talk at me. I looked to my friend, and he was motioning for me to get down on my knees as well. It was at that moment that I threw my hands up in the air and walked out. 

After that, half of the group Id been hanging out with for the last month completely shunned me. The guy who invited me was apologetic and invited me to another mass, citing this one as a one-off, but I told him no. Then he cut me out too. I lost all the friends I had made in college so far and it took months before I found more people to hang out with. 

Am I the asshole?? I get that they take that stuff very seriously and it was probably a dick move for me to just walk out on something they truly believed in, but I was just very uncomfortable."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3et3n	2019-06-21 18:58:42	minmingii	WIBTA if I told my friend that I think her best friend is a bad person and that she should distance herself?	"We're all 17 year olds who went to the same class for the last 2 years. My friend (Y) and her best friend (X) have known eachother since childhood, and I only knew them both since we went to class together.

Even though Y and X are best friends they're known for fighting at least once every two months. Together in class they're always talking over the teacher or making faces and hand signs at eachother. (Which is very annoying when you have to sit between them)

X is not a good person as far as I've seen. She once payed someone to beat up a guy at school, plays around with guys who actually likes her and then tells people to avoid them, tries to stir up arguments every time she can, throws pencils, pens and scissors at Y, talks behind Y's back, talks shit at Y and probably steals from her (Y said this to me). Her personality isn't the most attractive either.

We're going to other high schools next year and they applied to the same school with only one class. I've been wanting to hint to Y to try to mingle and get new friends at her new class last week with no progress and X hit the nail by saying, in front of the class, ""I hope that I won't get left out in the new class if Y decide to ditch me for new friends"". Which Y replied with ""I wouldn't leave you out, if I actually get new friends"".

 Y is extremely dependant on other people and i feel that it's unhealthy for her to continue depending on X for social support when it comes to joining anything that's new. Whenever X talks about applying for another school Y becomes frantically anxious and asks for verification that X is applying for the same school. Y won't even go to the soda machine alone even though it's at the end of the hall alone and when I'm joking she continues to ask me to validate that i was only joking.

Me and another mutual friend has talked about this and we think the same. We don't think that she'll be able to open up to a bigger and stricter class if she continues like this. I've talked about X to her but she kept telling me to stop badmouthing her. Y is a great friend, but not to the greatest person.

Would I be the asshole if I told her what I felt about their friendship and that she needed to stop depending on X so much?"	Asshole	0	0
c3esyf	2019-06-21 18:58:25	MisterThreeStripes	AITA for not wanting to give away my cats kittens?	"  So last year, my girlfriends friend found a tiny little kitten abandoned in the middle of the road. She was soaking and shivering and we were the closest house to bring her to. Everyone else in the house was immediately ready to dump her into a shelter or something but I didn‚Äôt want to let it happen. I took care of her when everyone else called her ugly and asked me and my gf when we were getting rid of her. 
  Fast forward to a couple months ago. I had just returned from visiting family back home to find that my cat is pregnant! She gave birth not long after I returned but it‚Äôs been a busy few weeks so I‚Äôve been away. She gave birth to four adorable little kittens roughly three weeks ago and only this past week have I been able to be here with her and them. 
  A few days ago I‚Äôm talking with my gf‚Äôs mom and she casually mentions that once the kittens are six weeks old they don‚Äôt need their mother anymore. I stiffened up initially but wrote it off as her just sharing a fact I might not have known. 
  Then yesterday my gf‚Äôs brother mentions to her that while we were away, he and his girlfriend came into our room with their mother and picked out which kitten they‚Äôre going to take. This sparks a conversation in the room about which kitten everyone wants. I stayed silent. I talked to my gf about it and explained that since no one wanted my cat, they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to pick and choose which of her kittens they want to take from her. As far as I am concerned, they‚Äôre all mine. However this leaves me feeling a bit selfish and I don‚Äôt know if I should feel that way or not. AITA?

c3es95	2019-06-21 18:56:57		AITA for leaving my job even after the company invested over $1,000 to help me out?	"I‚Äôm writing this on behalf of my girlfriend because she doesn‚Äôt use Reddit. I tried to post this yesterday and it got denied because I went over the character limit so I‚Äôm just gunna do a real short version here.

We both work st the same company and have for about 9 months. When she first started she had moved from across the state and didn‚Äôt have a place to live. The company offered her a large sum of money to help her obtain an apartment. They even let her use a company vehicle to move all of her stuff. Along with that, some months down the line her tires were very close to being bald and again the company offered to get her new tires.

About six months in it became very clear that she wasn‚Äôt happy at this job. Her working environment was very toxic and her manager was a huge pain to work under (to which I personally agree she‚Äôs a nightmare). Along with that, they were only paying her $13 an hour without any health insurance or PTO. The longer she worked there the better she got her job and the more word they put on her. By the time this all went down she was easily doing twice as much work as her contemporaries and doing many tasks that are usually for upper management.

Multiple times she approached the CEO and asked for a raise and or benefits. Each time she was denied and told that it just simply wasn‚Äôt an option. 

A few days ago she got back from a three day unpaid vacation. Her first day back in the office she had a huge backlog of work because no one took care of it while she was gone and pretty much everything that went wrong while she was gone was blamed on her. This was the final straw for her. She put in her two weeks and in her notice she offered to pay back the owed money at a rate of $100 a month and stay as long as needed to train a replacement for her. She told the CEO she would stay if she got a raise and benefits once again she was denied.

The following afternoon the manager blew up on her. Is will post exactly what she said in a text below.

‚Äú-CEO- screamed at me told me I was disrespectful and asked if I knew how much money I owe the company and that she's gonna take my last paycheck to pay it back and that they did everything I asked for, gave me more hours etc and now I'm just 'stupid' because I'm complaining about it now.‚Äù

At this point she told the CEO that she would be leaving that afternoon and not coming back.

"So I live on the west coast of the US, and I have early shifts at work Tuesday to Saturday. Before I leave for work though, I like to play Michael Jackson at a reasonably loud volume as I'm a huge MJ fan.

However, this has caused problems with others in my apartment complex. I leave for work around 8:30 so I probably get up and get ready around 7:45 or something and that's when MJ goes on. I've had a number of complaints from this middle aged lady and another young couple asking why I'm ""blaring that music at the crack of dawn""

Last time I checked, 7:45 wasn't the crack of dawn. This kind of pissed me off so I told them they're lazy asses should be out of bed anyway and me listening to MJ shouldn't affect them. Nevertheless, they complained again this morning and I'm sick of it

Our city is reeling under severe water scarcity, and getting water is getting difficult by the day. Now, the guard had turned on the pumping motor and left somewhere.

I heard the water pouring out of the tank. I tried calling the security phone at his post for 10 minutes, but no response. Then I went down to switch off the motor on my own. At this point I saw him coming and switching off the motor.

Now I berated him for not being at his post when he switched on the motor, and allowing the water to go waste. He was saying about going to the other gate to open it, still I raised my voice and in fact, shouted at him for allowing water to go waste. The fact is, the water had gone waste for 20 mins.

Normally, I never shout at any one easily, and never at elderly people. But with this pitiful low water scenario, I shouted at him. I feel very bad now. AITA?

So I finish work at 12pm and she goes to work for 2, she's working til 6pm.
I chill for a while and wait for her to finish so I can arrive with food and then we can go home and watch a movie, great! It's different from what we usually do and it's nice and easy, no stress.
Now my gf has money rn and I don't (we get paid alternatively so we support each other in turns) so I ask her to send me some money for the food before work. Unfortunately she did not send the money, as she forgot.
So I think about it and decided not to call her at work (she is a barista) and I decide we can get some food together after work, nbd.
It was a big deal.
As soon as I say we are gonna go get the food after work, her face sours and she refuses to talk to me until she is finished, saying she'll walk home (I usually drive her to work and back).
This upset me so I went to go get the food before she finishes, as she had to stay for longer, and I come back to her work to see if she needs picking up. She takes the lift and we get home.
Now my gf and I have been going through a lil rough patch and we are both really depressed so we have problems sometimes.
As soon as we get home she goes on about how I ""never do anything ever"" and ""all you've done for four hours is fuck all"" and how she ""wants a boyfriend that pretends to care"".

When it came time to critique, I said ""There is a disconnect. \[Female instructor\] is all happy smiley styling but you look bored."" He said ""I don't wanna smile all the time because it would look fake"" and the female instructor said ""His thinking face tends to be a scowl.""

I'm not 100% ready to switch companies but, I wanted to see what they would offer. I have high expectations whenever I go into a situation like this, just as they do of me. Which brings me to the guy who interviewed me today.

1. He did not even know he was interviewing someone until 2 minutes before.
2. He didn't have a copy of my resume so, obviously didn't read it.
3. He was so visibly nervous that I asked him about it (lol). He was just promoted and this was the first time he ever interviewed someone.
4. Again, lack of preparation: he had no idea how to relate his questions to my specific experiences or the role.
5. He didn't know the answer to one of the technical questions he asked. I had to explain it to him.
6. He asked a couple of personal questions which I found to be unnecessary and a little inappropriate. Nothing crazy but, they shouldn't have been asked.

c3eo30	2019-06-21 18:48:04	touch_my_gucci_snake	AITA for letting a bridge burn in the name of Rent Money & Responsibility?	"Yo, first time poster here. 

There are currently 3 people living in my house, my good friend, eh, I guess we‚Äôll call him Mike. Mike and I live with his Brother, one of my best friends, Matt. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Mike is still one of my greatest and most loyal friends I just don‚Äôt really vibe like I used to with Mike.  

 Mike has a girlfriend, Katy. Katy and Mike spend a lot of time together on the weekends. It‚Äôs pretty normal, they do their thing, I do mine. Now, I do not understand what Katy‚Äôs situation is. Mike tells me Katy has gone, and is going, through some shit. We used to be friends but I don‚Äôt know Katy very well anymore. Katy has been staying here for about a week, maybe a little over a week. It sparked my curiosity So, I texted Mike and asked if she had moved in, he said no. I then stated that if she were to move in, we need to split up rent equally between the 4 of us. He didn‚Äôt like that idea. He claims he will be paying for half the cost of rent (his and her portion) whilst Matt and I pay 1/4 the cost. I told him if he wants it that way the so be it, her rent is going to be paid by someone other than me. I then told him I would speak with him when I got home. As I can‚Äôt spend all of my morning texting back and forth. I got home and brought up the situation, and we instantly got into it. I cannot remember the conversation word for word, but Mike made arguments like:
- ‚Äúhow would Katy effect you if she lived here‚Äù  
- ‚Äúshe would just have my room, nothing else so why does she have to pay‚Äù 
- ‚Äúyou seem like a true friend for trying to do this‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI hope you realize you‚Äôre fucking me over‚Äù
- and the classic, ‚Äúif you had a girlfriend living here I wouldn‚Äôt make you pay for her‚Äù

My arguments were things like: 
- ‚ÄúKaty‚Äôs another person in the house, so it makes sense that she has to pay‚Äù
- ‚Äúwere all adults here, we must take responsibility‚Äù
- ‚Äúwere renting the entire condo, not just individual rooms‚Äù 
- ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to let someone else live here for free at my (and Matt‚Äôs) expense‚Äù 

Matt has done his best to remain neutral on the subject, kinda ridiculous in my opinion, but that‚Äôs his choice.

My compromise: 

I‚Äôm not sure of the situation that Katy is in. I understand that sometimes people need time to get back up on their feet after going through tough times. So I am willing to make a compromise that could benefit/better all of us in ways that are seen and ways that are not. I will pay the extra $117, i.e., My part of the 4th share of rent for the first month that Katy is living here. I‚Äôm willing to give her 1 month (July) 31 Days, to get on her feet so she is able pay her equal amount of rent. If she cannot pay that, You must pay it. She is part of you, and you must carry your weight. If you are unable to do that, I will move out.  Mike, I am not trying to burn a bridge here. I‚Äôm trying to treat everyone equally. This world is harsh, I‚Äôm willing to ease up and show some light for a month. After that, we pull our own weight."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So I am 18 years old and currently on a gap year. During my gap year I wanted to work, get some casual retail experience and get some money, and to also not be lazy and sit around at home lol. So I managed to get a job as a Christmas temp at a retail store. I was aware the job was only for Christmas but the manager constantly spoke about the ‚Äòopportunity to join the team full time after Christmas‚Äô. I formed a nice friendly bond with my boss even though she‚Äôs about 45 years older and we really got to know each other. A month into the job she said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to train you to so well and make you my little store protege‚Äô (I was the youngest member of staff). It was nearing the end of December and she offered me a 21 hour a week contract for January and beyond, which I accepted. She created the rota and gave me shifts for the whole of January. I felt happy and secure. 

January comes, I did 2 cover shifts in another store. I checked the work app one morning and I see all my shifts were cancelled (without me even knowing it or being informed by any senior member of staff). My boss made me wait 4 whole days for a meeting where they said I ‚Äòhad to be let go‚Äô because there were too many staff (probably a BS excuse lol) I was really annoyed. I was fully aware my role was only meant to be until Christmas, but then she shouldn‚Äôt have given me false promises and given me shifts for January if she knew she wanted to get rid of me. I thought about if I had done anything wrong for them to end my contract. Occasionally I was 5 minutes (or less) late (once I was less than a minute late to work and she called me and very strictly asked where I was). She also once asked me if I could do a cover shift and I said ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt want to‚Äô since I‚Äôd already done 6 working days (42 hours) in a row that week and I was so exhausted and she was so secretly pissed lol. I think that cost me the job. They also sent out an email to the ENTIRE COMPANY saying not to give me any more shifts because I was desperately trying to get some.

"My fiance got out of work late last night and stopped at her aunts house on her way home. She used her moms credit card and placed an order for food to be delivered to our house where I was home. The total came to $26 and some change. She told me not to tip more than $3. When the food got here I tipped 5 (from her card) and figured I would just reimburse her mom for the extra $2 since I didn't want to not tip the delivery driver decent. She got really upset at me for that which after explaining to me I could of over drafted her moms account I told her Im sorry I didn't think about that. But she wouldn't see where I was coming from when I said I didn't want to tip the poor guy just $3. (I told her this on the phone before the delivery and she got annoyed and said $3 is fine). 

&#x200B;

I was wrong to add the extra money to the tip on her moms card even though I was going to reimburse her. My issue is that 1.

He can be a very sweet boy at times, but he is also very disrespectful and rude to adults. My friend thinks it‚Äôs hilarious, until he does it to her (for example, the other day he told her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to be my mom!‚Äù and then 5 seconds later was demanding a new toy). He‚Äôll yell at strangers, me, our other friends, pretty much everyone but his father (because he won‚Äôt take it). He doesn‚Äôt listen and talks back constantly. She thinks it‚Äôs cute, like I said, and says he‚Äôs just ‚Äústubborn‚Äù. There are times she‚Äôll punish him, but only when it affects her.

I am probably the only one who will watch him, outside her mom. Recently, even her mom has decided he is too ill behaved for her, and said she couldn‚Äôt watch him when we all had plans to go out. Our other friends and certain babysitters

My friend keeps saying she has no clue why she can‚Äôt keep childcare. She complains that she has no free time or gets to do what she wants. She‚Äôs lost babysitters because he‚Äôs yelled at them and they‚Äôve been unable to control them. Her mom says she doesn‚Äôt want to tell her, but thinks someone should. One of our other friends said that when he starts kindergarten in the fall, she'll get a reality check from one of his teachers that he's a terribly misbehaved kid. Otherwise it'll just start drama for no reason.

c3eix4	2019-06-21 18:37:12	booleanck	AITA for wanting a wedding date in the same season as my fianc√©‚Äôs brother‚Äôs girlfriend?	"My fianc√© and I got engaged in December 2018, and have always planned on doing a long engagement since he was applying for graduate school at the time of proposal. 

Soon after our engagement, his brother‚Äôs girlfriend reached out to him to tell him that Fall 2020 was off limits for our wedding since she was targeting that date - specifically October 2020 (10/10/2020), and that it would be too much to expect the family to fly to two weddings in the same season. Her‚Äôs would most likely be in Alabama and our‚Äôs in California. They aren‚Äôt engaged, and his brother has not confirmed that he plans to propose anytime soon, though she did give him an ultimatum to propose by the end of the year or they‚Äôre done leaving them 10 months to plan if he proposed by December 2019. 

I didn‚Äôt think much of her ask since we were slow rolling our planning regardless, but now that we‚Äôve started venue shopping... fall 2020 would actually be the ideal time for an outdoor ceremony and it would align with my fianc√©‚Äôs graduation.

c3eie4	2019-06-21 18:36:00	TabbyLab	AITA because I want my husbands family to make a vegetarian / vegan option when they invite us for dinner?	"\-------   Thanks guys for your input. You have been helpful. I'm going to change my approach to this.  -----

&#x200B;

My husband and I became vegetarian in April last year. We both eat all dairy products. We do eat fish when we are invited out to eat, but we want to¬†cut that away too.¬†I don't eat eggs.

A month ago my brother in law and his wife invited us for lunch. They didn't do anything to make sure that there would be any vegetarian food, so I offered to bring a glass of spread for bread. They do know that we don't eat meat.

&#x200B;

We are invited to their daughters baptizing party. My husband¬† is going to be her godfather. The food is going to be smorgasbord from a caterer. It's traditional Danish food of fine dining open sandwiches.  There is a seating plan, so it's not just a casual dinner. I asked them about dinner at the baptizing, if there would be a vegetarian option, and they said that they didn't know.

&#x200B;

So I texted my sister in law the other day to ask if there would be something vegetarian for us, and also mentioned again that I don't eat eggs. If this was not the case I would bring something.

¬†She replied that she didn't think there would be vegetarian food.

So I write her back saying that in that case I would bring some sandwiches ( subway style)¬† for my husband and I.¬†

She replied that she had assumed that my husband could eat eggs.

And that's where the conversation ended.¬†

&#x200B;

I'm really annoyed at her, and partly also my brother in law. It pisses me off that they don't take in consideration that we don't eat meat. It seems to me that they are stubborn or passive aggressive. It's really difficult for me to say to her face that I'm not happy that they won't make sure that there will be something that we can eat. We have been vegetarian for over a year !

&#x200B;

EDIT:

The food is individual pieces of bread with something on top of it.

&#x200B;

The reason for me to mention that we would bring our own sandwiches was my attempt to ""pressure"" her to consider how weird it would be if my husband and I were to sit there with a subway sandwich.

My husband back me up on this. He's the quiet type.

I myself think that it will be weird to sit there with a sub, but I feel stubborn too. The dinner is in two days from now. I'm thinking about what I'm gonna say when people will start asking why we brought these ""lousy"" sandwiches. Should I just say that they didn't supply a veg option? It will be so embarrassing for me, but dammit I don't want to sit there and be hungry.¬†"	Asshole	0	0

When I came back from a trip, I decided to turn my house upside down looking for my earphones and of course, I didn't find them. Not even under my bed. Now, I use an iPhone 5s and my mother uses an Oppo. The earphones between both phones are drastically different (Oppo having those rubber things at the end, and iPhones do not).  


I wanted a pair of earphones kinda desperately only because I was annoying everyone around me by just listening to music on speakers. So I asked my mom if she could get a pair for me. Of course she said no, so I had to use my own money that's supposed to be saved for something else. I found my iPhone earphones in my mother's bag about a week ago. When I did, I jokingly asked if she had taken my earphones. She got defensive and told me she didn't want to talk to me anymore (she was sending me to school), basically making the whole car ride awkward and quiet. 

&#x200B;

I honestly don't really know how to bring up this issue to her because I'm not as close to my mother as I am to my father. If I'm NTA, what should I do? I really want my earphones back.

"I am a woman in my 30‚Äôs, living in the states, and have dreamt of visiting Europe since I was a little girl, specifically Ireland. Opportunities to travel have come up over the years, but I was never financially stable enough to go. 

Last summer, I had some colleagues approach me about an unbelievable opportunity to travel to Denmark and present our research at a conference this coming August. I immediately began saving everything I could to make this happen, got my passport, and registered for the conference. The conference is only four days, so I decided to make a vacation out of it and travel around Europe for a bit before going to the conference. In all, I will be gone for two weeks. I originally asked my husband to join me, but he is unable to go. I then asked a couple of friends if they would like to go, but they are also unable to go. No worries, I‚Äôll go solo and then meet my colleagues in Denmark for the conference. 

About two months ago, we were at a family dinner and the topic of my trip came up. I mentioned I was going solo and my mom immediately started going on about how she would go with me and she‚Äôs always wanted to go, etc. I just kept reiterating I would be going alone. My mom seemed kind of hurt that I didn‚Äôt want her to go and has mentioned/joked about going with me every time I see or talk to her. 

But, I honestly don‚Äôt want her to go with me. We‚Äôve traveled together in the past (for shorter amounts of time) and it‚Äôs always a disaster. I like my quiet time and exploring on my own and on my own time. My mom....talks constantly about everything and nothing. It‚Äôs draining. I walk quickly and with a purpose, my mom is disabled and has to stop and rest frequently. We would be walking a lot and traveling frequently. She also has problems sitting for long periods of time without being in pain. I want to explore the countries and meet locals, she gets nervous in unfamiliar situations and stresses out about being safe. I think she would add stress to my vacation and I would just rather go by myself. 

I know she‚Äôs worried about my safety. Also, my dad would NEVER go on a trip to Europe, so she may view this as her ‚Äúonly‚Äù chance to go. I know I would be miserable most of the time with her there and I don‚Äôt really want to share this opportunity. I‚Äôve talked to her about my concerns for her health, like chronic pain, long periods of walking, etc. She just brushes me off and says she can bring her pain pills. AITA for not wanting her to go?"

c3e5v8	2019-06-21 18:09:55	Lizzard-Rambles	AITA for cutting off my mom?	"TL;DR My mom and I had a toxic relationship and I finally blocked her. AITA?

My mom (54) and I (26F) always had a somewhat toxic relationship. She was verbally & physically abusive. She would do things like throw bowls of chips at us (though this only happened once), get into our faces and scream at us if their house wasn't clean enough, would often tell us how much we cost to take care of, tell us how much more productive and self-sufficient she was when she was our age, when I told her I wanted to die she told me that God grants all wishes in time, things like that. 

A few days before my 26th birthday, I cut her off, blocked her on all social media and have tried to move on with my life. 

Here's the thing though, my mom had a really tough life herself. Between being constantly pushed aside and abused by her parents, who favored her brothers, three abusive marriages and a somewhat dysfunctional relationship with my father, medical troubles, and a toxic work ethic (she's going to work herself to death one day) she's suffered a lot. Towards the end of my grandma's life, I watched my mom desperately try to have a civil relationship with her, and they never could.

Several times, I asked my mom to come to therapy with me so that we could work through our problems. She always said that she didn't need to because I was the only one with a problem in our relationship. The final straw came not long after she got sick. I'm the only one of her kids who lives in the same state as her, so my then husband picked up a rental car and I took the trip to go stay with her for a week. The first night I cried because it was the first time my husband and I had been apart for 4 years. My mom told me that if I was going to be that emotional that I should just leave, and the next morning, my husband came back to pick me up. She then called my brother and told him that I had just left her, because I was too emotional. He believed me though. Finally, after texting her back and forth for a few days, with her getting upset that I didn't visit her more often. ( she lived three hours away and my husband and I didn't have a car, and couldn't often afford the rental car to get down there) I told her that she needed to treat me with more respect, and if she didn't I was going to remove myself from her life. She told me that if I left it would be my choice and I would have to live with it. It hurt that she never tried to work it out with me.

Even though I blocked her I can still see the messages she sends me, she's told me that she doesn't understand why I left, that I overreacted, and that she misses me and loves me, but she hasn't said she treat me any better, apologized, or accepted any part of blame for our relationship.

We would see her at my other aunt's events but my two aunts would sit together and my family was always put at another table usually at a distance. One time at my cousins wedding my aunt put a napkin in front of her face when my mom went to her table to say hi to other people. I also was afraid of my aunt when I was little. She made fun of me for not talking and for going wherever my mom went (like if my mom left the room I would go with her). My mom would try to reach out to her, but she never wanted anything to do with her. It turns out she got cancer in January but no one told us. But I also found out my uncle didn't know either. My one aunt did know.  But it kind of bothers me that we had no warning that she was going to die. It was like one day we just found out she was dead. So naturally, my family just assumed no one would want us at the funeral. Well two days later the son called my mom and asked her to go. So my mom, dad and brother all went. I didn't go. I realize now that I really should have just went for my mom and for the family aspect of it all. I have been feeling bad about it and beating myself up.

The last time she asked was today just a few minutes ago, and after I explained to her for what feels like the hundredth time that the weather is bad and I'm generally just not interested, she got up out of her chair and stormed off to put the car away in the garage.  She has coworkers who have expressed interest in going with her and she still persists that we two go anyway.  She says things like, ""Well the weather isn't going to be too bad today,"" ""I don't understand why you're saying no,"" and other things to make me feel bad when I tell her I'm simply not interested in going anymore.

I‚Äôll keep this as concise as I can. Basically growing up I was severely mentally abused by my parents, mainly my mom. I have never understood what I did to make her hate me so much, but I grew up being mentally abused by her and knowing she hated me and didn‚Äôt love me. 

My dad didn‚Äôt want to be in the middle of it all, so he just shut down on the subject. He just ignored me my entire childhood. All I wanted was him to stand up for me, and showed he cared, but he didn‚Äôt. I knew he didn‚Äôt love me either. 

By the time I was a teen, I was wrecked. I never did drugs or partied, but I was showing obvious signs of mental issues stemming from it. When I was 16 I was hospitalized for a serious mental illness. After this, I guess my parents realized they made mistakes, so they changed. Today if you saw us, you‚Äôd think we have a decent relationship. 

In truth, I HATE them. I can never forgive nor forget how I grew up. I can not form any meaningful attachments with people. I can‚Äôt even talk to a woman because of the main female role model in my life treating me like utter trash. I‚Äôm crippled by self doubt, anxiety, and depression. It all stems from my upbringing.

I bought a dishwasher a year ago, (we both suck at dishes), but I'm not allowed to put the tupperware in there because it will apparently damage them, but she never takes the initiative to wash herself for whatever reason.

He and I hooked up once before, at least a year before the two began dating. It might be general knowledge to her since everyone in this friend group has hooked up amongst each other. I think that‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt initially feel weird to me that we started kissing. Unfortunately, now that I‚Äôm sober I don‚Äôt know how to feel about this.


I plan on texting her (since I am leaving town soon and she previously expressed she wouldn‚Äôt get to see me before I left again) to let her know what happened and that I respect her friendship more than I am interested in hooking up with her ex. He also told me that he would never hide anything from her so if she found out he would fully tell her because honest communication is super important to them.


So...AITA? Should I tell her?

UPDATE: I texted her, because I think she deserves to know. It seems to me that not addressing it would be a bigger slight to her than if I did it and tried to protect her feelings by hiding it. As I thought, she took it really well. She said it does feel a little weird but that it‚Äôs to be expected for a little while, but that she appreciated my candidness and that we‚Äôre still cool. 


I‚Äôm genuinely so lucky to have her as a friend and though she is justified in feeling any way towards me, especially negatively, I think her response is a testament to why I wanted preserve a friendship with her."	Asshole	0	0
c3e0li	2019-06-21 17:59:02	thunder_turtle07	AITA because I didn't meet my Uncle when he came to travel my city.	"My uncle lives very far from my city. He is in his 40s and planned the trip with his wife (have children but didn't bring them along, ""cause airfare is expensive""). He called me one month ago and asked me to plan his tour (4 cities). I did some research and told him about the places he should visit and where should he go first and he asked me to book hotel for which again I agreed, that I will do it before he will be coming here. Day before I called him and he told me places that he is interested to visit, so I booked his hotel accordingly, but now his place is far away from my place. Today he landed in my city and left me a message, Can I send him location of this hotel. I sent it and called him to tell him what Bus he should be picking in order to reach hotel and suggested what place they should be site seeing first. I was also working from home so couldn't go to receive him and thought we can meet if I can finish my work earlier. I called back after two hours, they said they just reached the place and checking-in. I said alright and then he asked me how to go to their first site. I said IDK you can ask someone from hotel, he said okay. After 5 hours later I called him again he said ""when are you coming to meet me and pick some food with you in your way"" and also asked me to book his bus again, I said ""when you are at hotel let me know. I will come to meet you and I am booking your bus and we can eat at restaurant together."" He said there aren't any restaurant near by and said even hotel didn't have any food. I said ""when I will at your place I will order food via food delivery app"". He said alright. Now time is around 6:45 he called to know what should he do, he's not able to any taxi. I asked him to download Uber and then he cut the phone. I called him back after 20 mins if he got any cab. He said he managed to get taxi at last and will be reaching hotel in an hour then we can have dinner together. I said let me know when you reach there and I will order at your place. Now he messages me where am I and I said I coming and checked Uber, it was showing 1 hour 40 minutes for destination (18 km). I told him about it and then I said I won't be coming as they have to catch Bus early around 6 am and I will reach hotel around 10 pm, they are tired for whole day and it's fine if we don't meet here. We will meet when I am back at my home town i.e after 2 months and asked what I need to order for food. He said he will manage. I called him up, if he really wants me to meet I can still come. I will order food in the mean time. He said he will call back as his stomach is upset. He is in toilet and then he messages me back after an hour that they are having food and they will saying good bye to city in the morning. I replied okay and goodnight and now he is putting his WhatsApp story. ""Great city, awesome weather. Things could be better if you were here"".

"So basically my parents do this kind of thing where once one of their kids (my brother/sister) turned 18, they purchased a condo in their name with a mortgage on said kid. the catch is that in our country there is a special discount for first home purchased for every citizen.

So my parents purchased a condo on my name and took a mortgage in my name, I'm pretty sure that by renting it they make profit (lets say mortgage is 1000$ and then rent for 1200$)
Also im still living with them and obviously they have spent way more than i can ever repay.
WIBTA for asking for that profit? seeing as i wouldn't have the cash up front to even get a mortgage and that was their money, but still i feel like i have been blocked from making this move my self.

I was invited to my friends bachelor party.  The guys were to go deep sea fishing for a day trip.  The women are to go on a boat at the lake for a day trip. We are all meeting up at a friends place to party and hang out in the evening as a joint party.

My wife isn‚Äôt close to the bride to be, so she wasn‚Äôt invited to the lake trip, but was 100% invited to the after party. My wife didn‚Äôt seem bothered by that and told me to have a good time.

The trip is tmw....the guy planning the trip had work schedule issues and bailed.  So the girl planning the bachelorette party suggested we just get a big house boat and merge the bachelor party with the bachelorette party (which were all cool with because we weren‚Äôt gonna do the stripper/typical party).

I didn‚Äôt learn about this change until a few days ago when my buddy (who‚Äôs also going) mentioned it to me.  My wife was standing there with us as we talked about the change.  I did ask, I believe I said, ‚ÄúI forgot to ask but since it‚Äôs all merging together is (wife‚Äôs name) invited?‚Äù
My buddy, (his GF planned the party and is friends with my wife) said yes.

My wife is now feeling left out and hurt because she feels like she wasn‚Äôt invited.  I think she had an idea in her head that the after party plans changed. I told her that the after party is still happening.
I mentioned to her how she didn‚Äôt care when the two trips were separate but she now cares a lot about not going.  I know it‚Äôs not a distrust that I‚Äôll be on a boat with women.  I can understand how being left out hurts, but this has me baffled and I feel like I‚Äôm TA.

I was with a customer who is an older black gentleman with an accent (can‚Äôt tell which accent but I‚Äôm going to guess African as he later said he‚Äôs fluent in French and Arabic and someone languages. Those are primary languages spoken in Africa). And I was helping him with a suitcase lock. He wanted to know how to set it and asked if I could open the box. 

I did, since I do this for other customers, and we set the lock like it said but it was broken or we made a mistake and couldn‚Äôt unlock it. 

Then Bob (fake name) came in. He saw me attempting to correct my mistake on the lock and was grumbling. I told him that the managers usually didn‚Äôt care if I opened the boxes as I can tape it back up and he was still upset. 

He turned to my customer after getting upset by the open box and said ‚Äúin *this* country you can‚Äôt do that!‚Äù 

I was shocked and said ‚ÄúBob!‚Äù 

And the customer though was having none of that so he said ‚Äúthis country, this is *my* country. I‚Äôm an American citizen. Do you want to know why I have an accent? Because I am fluent in French, English, Arabic...‚Äù (he listed off at least seven languages) he mentioned something a lot money too I forget exactly but basically implying he‚Äôs successful and highly educated ‚ÄúI   am 70 years old, what you said doesn‚Äôt bother me but many other people would be offended.‚Äù 

Bob was trying to back track and shook his hand when he said he was a citizen and then said he had ‚Äúhim beat‚Äù when he listed off the languages and said he too was 70 etc etc. 

While this was happening I just was trying to fix the lock, trying to avoid confrontation and feeling a bit shaken. 

Eventually I couldn‚Äôt fix and lock was getting visibly flustered at my mistake and this confrontation so my customer just smiles and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay for it sweetheart‚Äù when I asked if he wanted a new one and he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a few dollars.‚Äù He left and Bob was upset again and said 

‚ÄúI hate it when people open the boxes‚Äù 

I said ‚Äúhe told me he was going to pay for it that‚Äôs why I let him open it,‚Äù and just walked away. 

Should I have said more? Bob is just a visiting associate and my customer seemed very capable of handling the situation and I figured if he wanted to complain he would but now I don‚Äôt know if I handled the situation correctly."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c3dwb8	2019-06-21 17:50:19	Pinetrees1990	AITA for not letting somone leave early from work.	"So i am a manger in a call centre.

I have a agent james who works in the same operation as me i am not his line manager but the same level.

James has worned for the company for the last 2 years and has overall been a decent member of staff. Turned up on time a bit of an under performer but not bad.

This was until he handed his 30 day notice in. Since then he has been very lazy caught texting while on the phone to a customer blatantly not listening.  Taking extra breaks and in general just letting his standards slip.

So two days before he is due to finsh his computer access was revoked early. His manager is on holiday and It takes 48 to get it back so he is now unable to do work. 

I offer him the chance to leave 2 days early ( without pay). He declines explaining he needs the money as  doesnt get paid from his new job straight away. 

Fair enough one day paid leave and one day unpaid again he refuses. So i ask him to tidy the call center get people drinks and generally just find things for him to do. 

The next morning he rings up and asks can he move his shift to an earlier one since he is doing nothing of worth. He explains hes organsied  leaving drinks and it allows him to ""get on it early"".

I offer him him again to take the day unpaid. He declines so i decided that hst he has to come fo his shift at the planned time. Keeping him at work  till 8pm. 

The other Manager my level ( not his line manager) said i was being harsh qnd they would have let him go but wouldnt overrule me. 

My point is he has been lazy for the last 30 days so why should i do him a favour. Also it sets a precedent for people who leave in the future thst they have to work hard till theor last day.

I followed the rules and waited on the side, leaving room for cars to leave in front of me since someone already blocked anyone from going in the lot.

"My mother has always been one to bend the truth, but this particular incident made me pissed beyond belief. All throughout my life she‚Äôd do something that only she so obviously did and completely deny responsibility. No one else in my household watches The Nanny so it‚Äôs completely impossible it‚Äôs anyone else. She watches it almost every night. 

I come home one day to find my status changed with comments that think I‚Äôm a huge fan of a show that I barely ever watch. The idea of me liking this show enough to make people sign a petition was honestly very embarrassing. I‚Äôm also a male which I doubt is the shows typical demographic.

I want her to admit she did it, which I already know will be near impossible knowing the kind of person she is. She of course denies it and acts completely surprised. I tell her it‚Äôs an infringement of my privacy and she should put it on her own FB but she continues to deny it. I express how embarrassed I am she says if this really happened to me I should play it off as a joke.  Not the answer I was looking for at all.

c3dp16	2019-06-21 17:35:03		WIBTA for becoming distant with my mother because of pressure from her?	"Some background first. My (M28) wife (F27) and I got married in October of last year. My wife and I have talked about us and kids extensively. She has recently passed grad school and is starting her career. We are planning on waiting \~4 years before having kids so we can do some things that we would like to do that having kids would make more difficult (buy a house, travel, etc). 

&#x200B;

Since the wedding, my mother has been making comments (both subtle and blatant) about us having kids. I am an only child so we are her only option to have blood related grandkids. Lately when she brings kids up, I have been reminding her that we are years away. The past 2 or 3 times she has been more stern about them I have told her that having kids is our decision only and that it is unfair for her to put pressure on us by bring it up multiple times. I told her that she needs to stop bringing it up because the pressure upsets me and my wife. She has countered by saying that at our age, waiting 4 or 5 years is too long and my wife will no longer have many eggs. My understanding is that this is false in general but I have also told her that if the choice was between no kids now or never having kids, that we would just not have kids. This upsets her to the point of tears. 

&#x200B;

Last weekend my father told me that my mother was complaining to him about us not wanting kids now and that if we wait any longer we will not be able to have kids and that she was going to tell my wife this. Luckily my father talked her down some from saying that directly to my wife for now but if I know my mother at all, she is very thick headed and if she wants to say something to someone, it will come out eventually. 

&#x200B;

In preparation of this and the fact that I have had multiple conversations with my mom about this, if she says something like this to my wife, I plan on becoming very distance with her. I do not wish to 100% cut her out of our lives but I would want to only talk to her a few times a year. She needs to understand how overbearing she is being. 

&#x200B;

My mother has always been needy with me. I think it is because I'm a only child. She will call me every day to try and talk (which leads to the kid conversation almost every time), will stop by our house without permission, and demands to know things that she has no business needing to know. 

&#x200B;

I completely understand her desire to be a grandmom and I do not want to make her cry over and over again when she brings up kids to us. At the same time, having kids is completely our decision and in my mind she should not be involved in the conversation unless we pull her into it for advice. My mother will claim she is bringing it up to help us and so that we do not miss out on having kids because of biology but I know she is bringing it up because she wants grandkids and to me that is selfish.

"My grandfather lost his battle with prostate cancer about two days ago, and it went as well as a death can go ‚Äî my family was anticipating it, we were all there to say goodbye, he went peacefully. My entire family had and still has each other to grieve with. 

My boyfriend of about a year and a half was unfortunately not able to make it; he was competing in a very prestigious-type tournament that he‚Äôs worked for months and months preparing for. (Side note: even if he hadn‚Äôt been at said competition, he likely wouldn‚Äôt have come to say goodbye with us, as he isn‚Äôt very close with any of my extended family and has never met my grandfather. If it matters, we‚Äôre a gay couple living in the South so we‚Äôre still sort of walking on eggshells when it comes to meeting extended family, even after a year and a half.) By the time my grandpa had passed (around 6pm), BF was very far into elimination rounds and was under a lot of pressure to perform well. I thought about how I would never be able to forgive myself if I told him the news and it caused him to choke and get himself eliminated. Because of this, my heart told me to hold off breaking the news to him until he got knocked out of competition, and I listened.

I told him the next day at around noon, as soon as I heard he was finished with competition. He took it well and was quick to comfort me and let me know time and time again that he was there for me, God love him. 

But just last night he confronted me about it, asking me why I hadn‚Äôt told him right away. He was confused as to why I chose to wait because:

1. It‚Äôs his job to comfort me in times like this, he is my boyfriend after all

2. He feels that a life event like that is something you immediately share with a long-ish term partner

I was stunned. I was most definitely still grieving and wasn‚Äôt expecting this confrontation at all, so I did my best to offer my own explanations:

1. I had so so many family members by my side that night to comfort me, so if he was worried about my mental health/well-being during that period, I was in good hands. On top of that, still just talking to him that night helped me through the pain enormously, even if he wasn‚Äôt aware of what had happened

2. I agreed with this to a certain extent, but something in the way he spoke gave me an entitlement vibe, as if he deserved to hear this news right away. I chose to hold of telling him because I didn‚Äôt want to psych him out and make him choke at his competition. I told him my take on the entitlement issue, but he was almost twisting my words to say that I didn‚Äôt tell him because I didn‚Äôt deem him ‚Äúimportant‚Äù enough to know the news right away.

On top of this, something feels wrong about him bringing this up while I am very obviously still grieving. Right now, I‚Äôm standing by my decision to wait ‚Äî I was more comfortable doing so, and I did it for both his and my own good. I‚Äôm really not sure about this one ‚Äî Reddit, AITA?"

"Hello everyone, I just got on board, been lurking for quite a while but I really have to know your opinions on this matter... English is not my native language so please bear with me and my mistakes

My husband and I received a house that used to be my parents', they still have A TON of things here and we can't throw them away or give them away either because even if it's slow, they're coming to pick them up every once in a while. They also have a big dog in the patio (Its not a backyard by any means, since its a very small place that was originally planned to wash clothes and hang them to dry, only.)

The dog loves to play, it's always barking and full of energy. My mother didn't want to take him to their new house because she was afraid he would ruin the grass and glass of their new patio (that, again, isn't big. Most Mexicans don't have huge backyards), so she said my brother would pick up the dog and take him to his place. That was around three months ago, before even my parents moved out of this house.

My husband and I work, and while we have the time and energy to take care of this dog are completely unwilling to do so, mostly because we don't have the money to pay for his food and also the patio is very small for his needs. My brother and his wife who recently gave birth to a baby, seem uninterested to come pick the dog, or even say anything to us who are taking care of him. My parents just keep me asking to keep him for ""a while"", extending the period every week or so, because my brother is supposed to get a wall built on his house to put the dog in (ps. this space WON'T be big, and he will probably just stand in the sun ALL DAY long).

My husband is FED UP with their shit, and is telling me he wants to give the dog to someone who actually cares about him and who owns enough land so he can run away and be happy. I'm stuck between the sword and the wall, because I know if I tell my husband to do so, everyone will get on my toes about why I gave the dog away if I didn't pay for him, as if he was an object.

My husband and I bought a washing machine and we can't even set it up because the patio is so small for Doggo to play that he chews on junk my parents left and used to jump on their washing machine. Ours has a glass on the top, and don't want to risk it breaking and/or hurting the dog.

I can already hear them nagging me about not being grateful about the house, or anything they've done for me, or my brother saying it was HIS dog, or that I'm not even wasting money since they buy Doggo's food.... So... AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Basically, there‚Äôs an enclosed area called a pit. In the pit, there‚Äôs the players and a ball. You‚Äôre trying to be the last one still in the pit. If you hit the ball out of the pit, you‚Äôre out, meaning you get out of the pit until the next game. If the ball touches anywhere below your knees/hips (depends on which one your group wants to do), you‚Äôre out. You can only hit the ball with your hands or wrists. There are more rules, but you only need to understand these ones for the judgement. 

So I was playing one day, and someone hits the ball. It hits me on my shoulder, then goes out. People automatically say to me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre out, you were the last one to touch it‚Äù but I just say ‚ÄúNo, it hit me in the shoulder, and the ball was going to go out anyways, even if it didn‚Äôt hit me.‚Äù They keep telling me to get out, but I refuse to get out because I don‚Äôt think I should be out.

c3dmab	2019-06-21 17:29:35	Eggsaladterror	AITA for refusing to give my supervisor the name of a coworker who broke the rules	"I work at a small cafeteria on a college campus that has a few stations where people can order food. One of these stations is salads. A full time employee (John) who is ""in charge"" of salads always brings many different pans that he takes from the back (for communal use) and moves into his station. These pans are used to restock and whatnot.

&#x200B;

The coworker (Brandon) has complained about John ""hoarding pans."" Several times I have seen him take the pans from salad station and move them to the back, including yesterday. This doesnt sound like much of an issue, but John is a soft spoken person and the supervisors dont want people ""walking over him.""

&#x200B;

If I had known that John likes them to be kept there in the station I probably would have stopped him and explained to leave them there. But John works mornings and I usually work nights, so I thought it was fine, it is pretty common for students to use the pans in the back because they do go there. John is the only one who likes them in his station. I didnt think much of it.

&#x200B;

But today, one of my supervisors (Daniel) came up to me and asked if I had worked salad yesterday (I did) and if I had moved the pans (I didnt). I told him the this, and he asked who moved them. I told him I wasnt comfortable saying. There was a short exchange, him saying ""you know I'm a supervisor right?""

&#x200B;

He also asked if I would tell this other supervisor. And I told the truth that I would reluctantly tell them, but not Daniel (I'll explain why that is later). In hindsight I shouldnt have been so blunt. Daniel was upset, and said ""let me sit down with Doug and Chase about \[my 'insubordination'\]"". Doug and Chase are the managers of the facility.

&#x200B;

Now, Doug and Chase have spoken to the students before about ""it's okay to talk to supervisors you're comfortable with,"" etc. But I was still pretty anxious. I feel like I'm well liked among my supervisors, and I really try to be nice to everyone and stay out of drama (as cliche as that sounds).

&#x200B;

Later I sat down with Chase and Doug and talked to them about it, they mentioned pretty much exactly what I expected. But I know Daniel is still very upset with me. I went up to him and tried to explain myself but he just shook his head and walked away saying ""forget about it it's just water under the bridge,"" but knowing Daniel I know he doesnt see it that way.

&#x200B;

Opinions of my coworkers are conflicted.

&#x200B;

I didnt give his name generally is because I am confident others have also moved pans and I dont want him singled out, and I know Brandon wasnt thinking ""I'm going to walk over John by moving these pans back"" and was just putting them back where they belong. I didnt want to tell Daniel specifically because he would exaggerate the situation (he is a pretty harsh supervisor), and he has been known to put students on some personal shit list, which I know Brandon is on and I didnt want to worsen things.

The other thing is that they and also some chinese coworkers smack their lips while eating and since we eat together it really puts me off.

He then goes into a 5 plus minubecausete rant, raising his voice , saying I should have just banged on the door , or called him, and I can‚Äôt be mad at him for getting ready for work, and that I should have used another bathroom, (the only other working bathroom I know of is in his grandparents bedroom that I don‚Äôt go in and have never used in the two years we have been together).  I change the subject because I feel like I‚Äôm being yelled at for just being frustrated  I needed to pee and change my mental products (also something I can‚Äôt do in his grandparents bathroom).

c3dh4p	2019-06-21 17:18:48	LBog123456	AITA for not being worried about hepatitis?	"A longtime friend of ours asked us to watch her son over night and we agreed. She then ended up taking temporary custody of a kid who's mom is an addict and has Hep C. She asked if we could watch him as well. I said yes, but when I told my husband that this kid would be staying over as well, he completely lost it and said that he didn't want the other kid to stay here because he's afraid that he might have contracted Hep C from his mom (not confirmed as he hasn't been tested), and he doesn't want our kids to be exposed to it. In my opinion, as long as we clean everything that he uses, wipe down the bathroom after he uses it, make sure there's no food/drink sharing, there will be almost no chance of anyone in our house contracting it (assuming he has it). My husband says that we are not going to watch them now which puts our friend in a real jam. He also says that we can't have our kids around them at all until he is tested and cleared! I just wanted to help out a friend.  My husband says he really doesn't care about helping out a friend if it means possible exposure to a disease, and he says I'm the asshole for possibly putting our family at risk. Who's the asshole here, me or my husband?

Edit- Just to clarify a few things: this is a kid who we have been around on multiple occasions although it has been a while. It didn't occur to me that my husband was worried about this.

c3dh2r	2019-06-21 17:18:42	swando18	AITA for demanding my friend pay rent	"Back story: I have been best friends with a guy, we‚Äôll call him John, since we were about 10. When we were 17, John‚Äôs dad got a job in a town about an hour and a half away from from a major city, so John decided to go to university in the major city. John made a whole new group of friends while at school, many of them living in dorms, student houses etc. in the city. John would often couch surf for a few nights a week and then would go back to his parents house on weekends or when he had a few days off school. I still lived in our hometown about 4 hours away and would often take the train to visit and when I would do this, we would stay with his friends, and they were always very inviting and I soon became good friends with them. 

Fast forward a couple years and I land a job in the city and plan to move there. Two of John‚Äôs friends have an apartment together, and one of them had a summer internship away from the city so agreed to sublet his room to me for the summer. By this point, John sleeps on their couch practically every night, has friends over as if it‚Äôs his own place, and apart from buying groceries for the apartment here and there, doesn‚Äôt contribute anything towards rent. His two friends‚Äô parents both pay their rent which is likely why they aren‚Äôt too upset that he stays their but I always thought John was taking advantage of them. Now that I am subletting I‚Äôm not as accepting of John doing this, and I am paying for rent myself (not my parents), and I start suggesting that he pays a portion of rent, or covers our utilities or something of this nature. He agrees, and for the past few months has agreed to pay our utilities each month. Even though he continued to contribute he has expressed on multiple occasions that he thinks it‚Äôs unfair since our friends had let him do this for so long, that I shouldn‚Äôt come and change the dynamics or the rules. His argument as to why he shouldn‚Äôt have to pay is that he doesn‚Äôt have a room or a bed there (he sleeps on the couch), doesn‚Äôt have a key, and lastly he introduced these people to me and I should be lucky that I found such a good summer sublet for a good deal (I pay $750) whereas the friend I‚Äôm subletting to pays $1100. I kinda understand his points, but at the same time, if I pay rent there, I should be entitled to some rules there. AITA for demanding he pays something?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

She's mentioned to me in the past that someday she wants to have a kid. However, I think this is a bad idea until she learns how to keep her house clean. . I moved to a new city with my dad well over a year ago, and every time I come to visit for family events, I stay with her. My mom refuses to step foot in that house half the time because it's always a huge mess, and she complains that my sisters finance is ""fucking useless"" because when he's not at work, he's gaming. 

 My dad feels bad for her because he knows she works a lot and it's often tired, stressed, and in a bitchy mood after work (she's the manager at a grocery store) so he tries to help her by hiring a cleaning lady to clean her place every other Thursday. I know it does make her a little less stressed, but I'm at her place right now, it's pretty bad, and the cleaning lady was just here last week. 

The messes include things such as piles of dishes in the sink and on the counters, (her fianc√©'s bong is on the counter), mountains of clean and dirty clothes in their room, my guest room smells a bit like litter, has litter on the floor, and is also used as storage. Empty Starbucks cups, empty snack boxes and used tissues on the tables in the living room.

Anyway I have been atending college for about 2 years and since about a month or two I have been picking up a female friend because her car broke down.

So I told her it was alright despite the fact I had to take a slight detour as a result resulting in having to get up earlier and of course spending extra money on gas under the impression that this would be a one or two week thing. 

Now it has been a little under two months and I told her I was no longer going to take the time out of my day to take her primarily because I felt a bit annoyed because she never even made the offer to as an example paying for gas or something I mean it adds up after 55ish days taking 5 or so extra kilometers twice a day so now she is pissed at me and no longer talks to me.

c3dcn3	2019-06-21 17:09:38	leakinglego	WIBTA for telling a family about the father‚Äôs cheating and most likely causing a broken home?	"Ok so I am in a unique position where I know the whole family but am not close with any of them, yet I know their father‚Äôs dirty secret.

So for context last summer I worked at a small club in my town. There‚Äôs boats, a pool, places to tan, fish, etc. There‚Äôs this family with a kid named John(11yo) who was in my sailing classes. His father and mother spend most of the summer at the pool. They also have two younger children that they need babysitters for. 

My close friend(18yo) babysat for them once and said the father was very touchy but she said she chalked it up to him being really friendly. However, she decided to not return. Another acquaintance (17yo) babysat for them and told me while she was playing with the kids once, she could see down the hall where the father was walking around naked in his room with the door wide open. She was unsettled by the experience too and also stopped returning to babysit. This father recruits these girls to babysit by the pool during the summer and chats them up incessantly. I‚Äôve also seen text messages of him trying to start texting conversations with these girls that are not appropriate for a teenage babysitting relationship.

Anyways. Now for the cheating. This guy eventually seduced a different girl by chatting with her everyday (she was an employee of the club) in the summer. They have had sexual intercourse and this guy has driven out to her college area (she‚Äôs 19yo) on supposed business trips and cheated with this girl more. I have a lot of text exchanges between them, and the girl is essentially just doing this because she can with this older man/father. I just find this whole situation gross of a father seducing girls and being sexual to high school babysitters while his wife is tanning at the poolside 30 feet away. I can only assume she is totally oblivious. I don‚Äôt see any reason why this will stop anytime soon.

I just found out that they are still involved with each other and with his babysitting record, I‚Äôm sure there are probably many other young (but still legal I realize) girls out there that I just don‚Äôt know about.

So, is this any of my business and would I be an asshole for letting the wife know or do I need to just keep my mouth shut? I know the club, parents at the club, and the wife would all be horrified and want to know. And if you think I should, what would be the best way?

Note: this guy is on the club board with parents of the children he is seducing/having sex with. This community is pretty tight knit. This would easily cause an outrage if people found out."	Not the A-hole	0	0

She says she has been getting Botox since age 21. Recently, she convinced me to get Botox with her. She said although I don‚Äôt have wrinkles I should get them as a preventative measure.

c3d7x0	2019-06-21 16:59:59	sheotu	WIBTA if i confronted my mum about the disappearance (??) of child support money?? (she's sensitive)	"Little bit of context: my parents divorced when I was 12. It was messy and there were serious criminal charges involved but due to lack of evidence the charges were dropped. In most areas my mum is an amazing mum- an injury at work left her unable to work in that sector and since then she's been a single mum taking up low-paying jobs and working (from home) to support me (18F) and my younger sister (15F), who is also a challenge due to some anger issues etc.

The issue is that I recently found out from my dad that he's been paying my mum ¬£400 a month for child support for me. Also, he's been paying me ¬£80 a month on top of that, ¬£50 of which I put consistently into a savings account for university and then was expected by my mum to use the remaining ¬£30 for any clothes, toiletries, or other things (except food) that I might need. 

Now my mum may be a kind and caring mum but in terms of food and other things that may come from that child support ¬£... we don't see much of it. It's not child abuse level but there's never any food in the fridge or money for us. I've always used my ¬£30 a month for food, clothes, sanitary items/toiletries etc and although I'd love to have a job to supplement that, I have bad tourettes so it's difficult to get hired. I always presumed his child support for me and my sister was that ¬£80 a month.

Thing is, she's probably been using our child support money to pay bills which I get is, in a way, spending it on us. And she's working hard at her job which does pay little and she is earning under ¬£22k a year. And I feel like she's probably suffering from some level of depression, as she can be very erratic sometimes: if I were to confront her about this she would probably break down crying and tell me I'm making her mentally unwell and more drastic stuff down that route. She's also very proud about her finances/money situation. 

WIBTA if I confronted her about this? I feel like it's not fair that I've been doing, e.g. my A levels/did my GCSEs on an empty stomach... but I'd probably make her very upset and I'm going to university with a maintenance loan soon so it's not a permanent problem....


TLDR: mum gets ¬£400 child support but never bought food or supplies for me when I was younger, but probs spent it on bills instead, WIBTA for confronting her

c3d771	2019-06-21 16:58:32	LodenH16	WIBTA For reporting a co-worker for killing a bird	"     A few hours ago we found an injured bird in the street.  I'll change the names for privacy.  Bill was riding in the work truck with Jared  when they saw a bird standing in the street.  It started with Jared trying to run the bird over saying ""I need to purge"" as a stupid joke.  After he failed, they stopped and put the bird in a bucket.  It was clearly hurt somehow because it couldn't fly away and Bill was able to pick it up with his hand.

     Shortly after that I arrived and they showed me the bird in the bucket asking what to do.  I called another co-worker, Justine, over and we all decided the best thing to do was to set the bird under a tree where it wouldn't be hurt by us working.  After lovingly naming the bird Chest Bennigan the 3rd, we left it there and got back to work.

     About 40 minutes after that, Bill sent a message to our personal group chat (which Jared was not a part of) that Jared had killed the bird.  I was with Justine and they were very upset, I was upset as well, and Bill said it made him angry.  I'll share the conversation.

    It's also worth mentioning that Jared once almost hit me with a truck and it makes me think maybe he has some sadistic tendencies.

I‚Äôm a pretty professional person and I believe that religion shouldn‚Äôt be brought into the workplace.

So I started this job about a year ago, kinda fell into to it through my SO's family member who used to work there. It's an okay job, pays fine but no progression opportunities etc. A few months after starting I expressed an interest in a training opportunity and the company was happy to fund it but I'm coming towards the end of that course now and I'm feeling a little dissatisfied with the job, like I said it's an okay job, not very hard but really not engaging at all and I find myself frequently distracted. I feel a bit stuck, because I know I'm not getting everything I want out of this current job, which means the company isn't getting what they want out of me, but I feel inclined to stay because of the opportunity they funded.

I asked her last week what she wanted for her birthday, and she said she really wanted a new phone. She had an iPhone 6+ which was a hand me down from my wife. It stopped working a while ago.

So I bought a new iPhone X from the store and gave it to her at her bday party yesterday. My wife and I were present, as were her parents and some friends. 

My SIL loved it, and thanked me. She was really overjoyed. Then her mom pulled me aside afterwards and said she wished I had let her know beforehand. She says its a much too expensive phone for a 11 year old kid. I said its no big deal and I just hope she enjoys it. Besides, it‚Äôs good to have a phone in case of emergencies. Her mom says she will let her have it for now, but will think about taking it away if it interferes with her studies or something. She said in the future, she would like it if I gave her a heads up before I gave her expensive presents. 

My wife was also annoyed. She said I should have at least told her. I don‚Äôt really even think it‚Äôs that big of a deal, it‚Äôs not like this was my SIL‚Äôs first phone or anything. AITA here?"	Asshole	0	0

I work away, anywhere between 3-8 hours drive from home at least once per month- but mostly more like every 2-3 weeks.

(Earlier this month (for the Queens birthday long weekend, I took the whole family with me-including my husband, two sons (17 & 19) plus their girlfriends to the beachside for five days (resort accommodation etc paid by me fyi/btw-nbd) while I worked fourteen hour+ days)

In between this both my husband (whom works full time) and I working (me the two jobs- one part time & this one-of which involves travelling, obv) a hellish few years with my eldest (who has since come good btw), family tragedies and marital disagreements..

I‚Äôm mostly relied upon (about a 70/30 split) to pay the bills, as a cleaner and a taxi service for my youngest-who still is an L plater & soon to get his licence (I‚Äôm teaching him)  which I‚Äôm happy to do anytime (legit, between school, sports training & working part time/split shifts-plus his social life)  it‚Äôs easily 200km/week but, again, that‚Äôs no problem.  

-also, I get to spend time with him (while he hasn‚Äôt got his license ) so I‚Äôm blessed/grateful to have that time which I won‚Äôt have forever..
& Plus sometimes he adds me to his Snapchat story (?!) - apparently that means that I‚Äôm not that embarrassing lol

My sons are growing up fast & im happy to spend this time with them both..but I‚Äôm burned out. 

I‚Äôve let my health and fitness suffer recently, drink more than I should, put on weight and can say that I‚Äôm neither feeling fulfilled, nor happy for the last twelve months, at least- mostly due to a failed property investment, that has left me over $100k in debt, not including my mortgage-Manageable but it  still sucks.

So.. my next assignment away is from this Monday 25/6 until Friday, and is over 5 hours travel (by car) away from home. 

I feel like I need to tell the family that I‚Äôm taking an extra few days & extending my time away (after I get there) without lying or implying that I‚Äôm working, so wibta if I just take time out? 

I want to book a hotel for two- three nights along my way home, walk on the beach, drink, cry & be alone to contemplate & be myself, without having to be anything for anyone else (and force my youngest and his father to bond/spend time together, which they seldom do)
until I return to work on Tuesday 2/7/19 -or am I being selfish?


I don‚Äôt want to tell them before I go that I have this plan-I fully intend on letting them know as it happens, but is it selfish of me -or am I an asshole?

I feel like I‚Äôm a shell of a person, a fraud. 
I‚Äôm hoping to get it out of my system & come back happier, determined & positive.

Thanks for reading. 
I‚Äôve told you all more then I‚Äôve told my best friend recently & I‚Äôm ashamed that this is how I‚Äôm feeling, I can‚Äôt help but realise it might be exactly what I need. 
How embarrassing.

Some background info: I‚Äôve been with my girl since we were both in 8th grade (yes we still love each other) and we both decided that if we got married, she would pay for the wedding and I‚Äôd pay the honeymoon. The reason is that she wants a huge wedding and I want a huge honeymoon - a month around Europe with her.  
  
Recently I graduated from my masters and got a job that pays 70k a year and she‚Äôs in her last year of her masters. She decided that she wanted to get married right now and actually proposed to me about a month ago (I‚Äôm a dude btw). Obviously I said yes and couldn‚Äôt be more excited about it.  
  
That‚Äôs until she told me that she only saved 5k and the she needs around 25k more to pay for her dream wedding. Wtf why does a wedding have to be more expensive than a car? I told her that she should just do a ‚Äònormal‚Äô wedding or wait until she can pay for it.  I‚Äôm willing to help pay but not 25k. I‚Äôm expecting to pay around 15k for our trip in Europe which I consider to be waaay more valuable than a fancy dinner party.
  
Was I an asshole?


EDIT: I just wanted to add some details so people can give opinions that are accurate to my situation.

- We‚Äôre both 24 and made our agreement when we were both 21. 
  
- I‚Äôm from Mexico but all prices are in USD.  
  
- We haven‚Äôt actually talked about this yet. She just mentioned that she needs me to chip in some money since she still doesn‚Äôt have a full time job due to her classes. I know that I obviously need to help since I gain considerably more money than her but I just think that our money is better spent on ourselves or on a new house rather than a fancy party.   
  
- Wedding costs in my area tend to vary a lot, but 25k is waaaaay up there. That‚Äôs a Kardashians style wedding lol"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c3cv2y	2019-06-21 16:33:16		WIBTA for dating an alcoholic coworkers ex	"Sorry for my broken english. 

It goes like this. Me, Girl and coworker worked together at the same resturant for 4 years. We + two other colleuges used to hang in group from time to time. Coworker and girl started dating for half a year, she broke up and he was devestated. During this time I became severly depressed due to a life situation and started talking with girl. She turned out to be depressed aswell and we became good friend, talking everday on facebook. **1 year** passed since we started talking, and **almost 2 years** since they broke up. My coworker told me that he still has feelings for her. 

I have always viewed Girl as a friend only, since when we first started talking I was in a relationship and after that wasn't interested in dating for a while. We both decided to get our lives together and try being more positive. And as it happened, we started hanging out and doing fun activities together. Suddenly I started getting feelings for her and I also noticed how she acted like she did too. 

Now here's the twist:

I felt okay with dating this girl since it was 2 years since she and my coworker broke up.

But then my coworker called out of the blue. He told me that he actually had a drinking problem and did some bad, bad decisions the day before calling. I don't know why he called me, but I'm glad he called someone. We met up and talked, and he's going to AA meetings now. But he's so broken right now and at the bottom.

So now I stand here with a girl I like, who I think likes me back, and a coworker who still likes her and is really depressed. 

If I get accepted to my school I will quit my job in 3 months, so I'm probably not gonna see that coworker again.

Back in December she got pulled over for not having valid registration on her car. Turns out she can‚Äôt register because she hasn‚Äôt paid for insurance in over 18 months! 
She had an argument about a double payment with insurance & stopped paying them in response. 
Sister says she didn‚Äôt know it was cancelled just because she didn‚Äôt pay it. Assumed they decided to stop charging her. Wtf. 

Her car is impounded and she can‚Äôt afford to take it out. She hasn‚Äôt paid the last 2 months rent and can‚Äôt afford Jan. Where the money went? She went on leave for 6 months, didn‚Äôt tell anyone, and spent all her sick benefits on gaming and a trip to Vegas in a month she couldn‚Äôt even pay rent!

So at this point she‚Äôs about to lose her home, her job (vacay on sick leave is a huge no no),  already lost her car and penalty for driving without insurance and registration as long as she did is a $20,000 fine and 3 months prison. 

My family is very kindhearted so they take the car out of impound and sell it to pay the fees. Around this time my mother discovers parking tickets on sis‚Äôs table. Slightly under 40 in all. She hasn‚Äôt paid any & her excuse is she assumed if she ignored them they‚Äôd go away. Wtf again.

While selling the car we also discovered collections notices & mail from lawyers saying she hadn‚Äôt paid other bills in so long she‚Äôs being sued. 

So during all this time she‚Äôs been fucking up by the way my mom and our aunt and to a lesser extend me, have been supporting her. Groceries, rent money, etc

My mother has now gone into crazy debt hiring a lawyer to keep her out of prison, which in short, worked. She‚Äôs so stressed about the whole thing it breaks my heart. Sister is in credit counselling who thankfully got the lawsuits to stop & consolidated everything. 

I feel like she‚Äôs had nearly no repercussions for her very stupid actions & I‚Äôm angry as heck at her for taking the whole family for a ride financially, legally, and emotionally. 

I‚Äôm now being asked to help her move closer to work so the bus doesn‚Äôt take so long. This is already requiring my mother paying off her landlord for remaining missed rent plus the damage deposit. Supposedly she‚Äôll pay her back. 

Am I an asshole for not wanting to help her? Of everyone in the family I‚Äôm probably the one who least deserves to feel this angry as I‚Äôm the one she messed with least but I just feel like I can‚Äôt even look at her right now. 

If I‚Äôm the asshole I‚Äôll admit it apologize and help her move and maybe try to forgive her."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3cmt8	2019-06-21 16:16:23	ExceedinglyGayBlueJ	AITA for expecting my siblings to follow the rules?	"... and be given the established punishment if they don't?

&#x200B;

So: I'm 16, siblings are 15 and 12, now. It's been clearly stated that if we don't complete our daily chores by noon each day, we aren't allowed to use electronics for the rest of the day.

It's also a rule that we each have a specific time that we have to go to bed by, and again if we don't we don't, no electronics the next day.

I follow these rules to the letter, almost every time. They're reasonable, and it takes almost no effort to follow them. Yet, my sister (15) breaks the first rule more often than she follows it, and has gotten away scot free every time. My brother never goes to bed on time, going 30 minutes or more past the designated time regularly. Still, he just claims it's an accident (despite the fact that he has an alarm set at 10 PM every night to remind him) and never gets in trouble. I'm not exaggerating; they have not been punished once in the multiple months these rules have existed.

Today, I broke rule one. It almost makes my blood boil that my parents just shrugged it off. By all rights, I should have been punished. I knew the rule, and I broke it. Whether I intentionally did so or not doesn't matter; I messed up and was just let off the hook. Why do I even follow the rules if there's no compelling reason to? Because all I want is an ounce of order, something that's apparently too much for otherwise, to their credit, excellent parents.

Every time I bring this up to my parents, they tell me not to tell them how to parent. I'm not; I am only asking them to keep their word and enforce their own rules. I feel like a fully justified pillar of lawfulness, but I recognize that such is rarely the case and I need a second opinion before I bring it up again. They keep telling me not to be in their business, so there's obviously *some* source of ambiguity. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

Recently he was able to buy an upgrade he has wanted for a while for his car from a small local fabrication company that is well known in our city and semi known nationally. Since we are locals and we have a truck we  decided to head to the shop to pick up the parts rather than pay extra to have it shipped.

While we were loading everything up the guy working told us about how they had recently sent some free parts to a tv show in exchange for exposure, but when the show aired the parts were featured without the shop being mentioned at all. We all agreed that was pretty fucked up and let him know we would tag the shop if we got good pictures featuring the parts so people would know where we got them.

When we got home, the first thing my boyfriend did was take a picture of everything laid out next to his car for Instagram.  When he posted that picture, he made sure to tag the shop because of the story the employee had told us earlier. 

This was about two months ago. Last night my boyfriend was shopping for car parts again on the website of that same shop when he saw the picture he had taken of those parts next to his car. The picture had been heavily cropped so most of the car was obscured but we clearly recognized the driveway, the wheels, and the destinctive diamond plating at the bottom of his doors. It isn't like this picture was in the reviews section either, this picture was what came up with the product info when you searched that part. They had even watermarked the cropped picture with their logo. Some people have been telling me we should be glad they decided to ""feature"" us, but there is no credit given to us for the pic and it is clear to me they are trying to pass it off as their own. After the employee told us that story about what happened with the tv show, it is ridiculous to me that they would turn around and do this to someone else. The worst part is that the owner of the shop actually knows my boyfriend personally and couldn't be bothered to reach out and ask if they could use the picture.

Agatha naturally got angry, and then stopped replying to my messages. For the next two months, she completely ignored my attempts to apologize and make up for things. I wasn't pestering her every day- sending her a message or giving her a call maybe once a week, to see if she had forgiven me yet.

Yesterday, I got an invite to a party that she's hosting, to celebrate winning this huge award. It's clear that Agatha intentionally invited me. I took this to assume she's forgiven me, and is willing to make up with me at the party. I tried to call for clarification, but she's still not answering.

The problem is, Betty and I are still together, and going strong. I really, really like this girl, and see a future with her. I told her about the situation with Agatha, and she got very angry- not because Agatha is my ex, but because Agatha has been ignoring me for months, and just wants to 'pick up where we left off' as Betty put it. I don't agree. I think I did something wrong in my scheduling error, and Agatha took time to forgive me for that. Betty doesn't want me to go to the party, but I wanted to bring her with me so that she could meet Agatha. She's willing to come with me to support me, as she is very important to me and I very much want her to come but has made it very clear that she's not too comfortable with it. She told me that she'll go with me to the party if I go since I asked her, and if I decide to stay home, she'll stay with me- no matter what, we'll be together. :)

Final point: I think Agatha might still be interested in me, because I've had scheduling issues before, with my work, but the only time she's ever gotten angry about it is this time, and the only thing that makes it different is that this time it was a date that caused the issue.

Friends of the internet, am I the asshole here, or is Agatha the asshole, or is Betty the asshole, or are we all assholes?

c3chl8	2019-06-21 16:05:43		AITA for refusing to go on a vacation with my mom?	"So for context, I'm a 16yo girl and I'm supposed to go on a """"""vacation"""""" with my mother, aunt, and her 8yo daugter this summer. The 4 of us have been going on such vacations every summer for a few years now. However, the last 2 or 3 years have just been....bad. I don't really wanna get into it but the main point is, for the past 2 years I really haven't been enjoying the vacations. In fact, last year I felt so bad I just felt like crying most of the time and couldn't wait to go home. Meanwhile it's supposed to be a ""vacation"". The thing is, even now while comfortably sitting in my room I feel bad, empty. But I'd rather feel this way at the comfort of my own home than at some hotel in a whole another country, where I'd feel even worse. So I told my mom I didn't want to go anywhere this year. However she didn't really like that.... I told her they can all go on a vacation without me and I'll be fine by myself, but she insisted that it wouldn't feel right for her to go without me, and she really wants to go. I told her how I've felt for the past 2 years and how I'm sure I'll feel terrible and even more anxious this year too, but she's basically telling me to just endure it because she really wants to go. I really don't know. I've endured it for past few years so maybe I can go this year too? I really don't want to but eh..... 
AITA for just refusing to go?

Edit: I guess I didn't provide enough info. (kinda rushed this post and didn't want to make it too long) So I actually don't have any specific reason for disliking these vacations, I simply don't really enjoy any activities anymore, for whatever reason. I know it sounds bad but I can deal with it, however I just feel even worse and even more anxious and empty when I'm away from the comfort of my home. Also, if they did go on a vacation without me I wouldn't be completely alone at home, since we live at my grandparents' house and they could be with me for those few weeks."	Not enough info	0	0

Years ago I bought both of my sons homes. I told them both the same budget, go find a house you like and let me see it, and I'll buy it for you. It was college graduation gifts sort of. I promised the same to my stepdaughter: graduate college, get a home wherever you want with a $200,000 budget. I firmly believe you can't get far in life with the current apartment rental rates, so this takes a major load off of shoulders.

Well, she graduated this past April and my girlfriend is bugging me to get the ball into motion on getting her a house. The thing is that when I made that promise years ago, I assumed we'd be married by now. I want to get married, but she doesn't want to. I told her I don't feel comfortable buying a house for someone ""not officially in the family"" if that makes sense.

Now the promise is if we get married, she can have a house, but I did make a compromise I could buy her a house but it remains in my name. My fear is I buy a house for someone, my girlfriend and I don't work out and split, then I've basically bought a house for a stranger.

Am I being an asshole here? If it makes a difference, my girlfriend is a SAHM, stepdaughter lives with us. Stepdaughter works in a hospital right now but it's relatively far (city over, 40\~min drive). I'm retired but have large savings, so I'm the only one with the money to make it happen."	Asshole	0	0
c3ccte	2019-06-21 15:55:56	durrdevil	AITA for wanting to distance myself from my new friend	"Didn‚Äôt expect to write an essay. TLDR at the bottom!

I had a conversation with friend A the other day about how I treasured friend B because he was low maintenance. Friend A then proudly said something like ‚ÄúI love people like that because I‚Äôm high maintenance so I NEED low maintenance friends.‚Äù This kind of made it seem like we weren‚Äôt friends, but subordinates. I get that feeling a lot because as much as he has his good days, I find myself being dragged into doing things just because he wants to do them, and gets super pushy when said no to. 

Another example of this self-important behavior is when I had plans with a different group of friends, and he said ‚ÄúDo you have any hot friends?‚Äù After I said they might not be his type lowkey because I knew female friends wouldn‚Äôt vibe with him, he douchily said, ‚ÄúYeah, nevermind, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll find anyone there.‚Äù First of all, my friend group is not a buffet of girls you can just select from. Secondly, he said it in such a way as if to say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be up to par anyway.‚Äù Lastly, no one invited him to the hangout, and he never considered that.

Besides that, I‚Äôve also found myself being happier when I‚Äôm with other friends and when I‚Äôm alone. In fact, I realized that I do enjoy my own company a lot, and  he deprives me of this by always wanting to meet up saying he‚Äôs got something important to tell me, but by the time I get there, the only stories he has to share are about the lives of people I don‚Äôt know or care about or something super irrelevant like this other model complimenting him and him feeling good about it. Basically bragging.

To be fair, he has his moments, and there was a time I really did like him. But I don‚Äôt know why all his flaws suddenly seem worse now and more noticeable, and I‚Äôve always just been the type of person to cut off people when they start to get on my nerves which is why I wanna know if I‚Äôm the asshole for giving up on something immediately after seeing a few red flags that could be just minor red flaglets that I‚Äôm blowing out of proportion.

TLDR; Friend is narcissistic and I think I‚Äôm better off without, but he is nice most times, it‚Äôs just that vanity is one of the things I hate most which makes me wanna cut him off asap."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3cc22	2019-06-21 15:54:21	bobso11	WIBTA If i told my Wife I want her parents to treat our kids a certain way?	"A little backstory; My wife and her brother were raised in a classic ""spoiled"" household. Everything they did was amazing, and they were rarely told no. And on the flipside, they are pretty rude in public.

Fast forward to today, my wife (whom i love dearly) is very fragile, and highly dependant on me to do everything. Easily stressed, highly anxious etc. She's miles better than where she was when we first met though. 

Her brother; never held a real job for more than 6 months, approaching 30 and not working, still living at home and probably never going to leave the house.

To top it off they can be extremely judemental and rude (talking ill about other people when they are just feet away, condescending to waitstaff when we go out, things like that). I've had to have numerous conversations with my wife about this and she has finally started to understand how saying/doing certain things come across as rude. 

I should mention; they have always been generous and good towards me, so this isn't some personal beef I have with them. I generally just think they can be way over the top in praise (""ohhhhhhhhhhhh that's greaaaaaaaaat you were wooooooooonderful!"") and very condescending and nasty when dealing with strangers, be it waitstaff or cashiers etc.

Basically, I don't think they did a good job raising their kids and i'm afraid it's going to rub off on mine because they will be watching her 3-4 days a week while we work. I get it, no parent is perfect and I don't expect to be either. I just have a picture of how a child should be raised and certain things I don't want to see.

P.S. I have discussed at length with my wife about how *we* want to raise our child and we agree on 99%, this concerns her parents specifically.

I'd ask the father for permission, However these circumstances aren't normal. On my GF's 14th birthday her father decided that would be the perfect time to walk out of her life. He left in the evening telling her ""It's not your fault"" and then left, like a leaf in the wind. He still attempts to maintain some contact with her and the rest of her siblings. Arguably the rest of the siblings all seem to enjoy the time they spend with their Ex Father.   


Fast Forward about two years and I start dating this Girl. I like her a lot, but her dad is almost nowhere to be seen in her life, save for some holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving. Eventually the mother and father make it official and sign the divorce papers. The dad starts dating other women now, and the Mother resigns to being both dad and mom, raising 3 of her kids that are still living at home.  


I've been dating this girl for three years. I'm going to ask her to marry me in the next few months, however I need to see, Would I Be The Asshole if I didn't ask her Ex Father for permission to marry her?

c3ca49	2019-06-21 15:50:02	SeriousMood	WIBTA if I didn't go to my fathers funeral?	"Quick backstory up until January of this year I had an OK relationship with my Dad. He wasn‚Äôt overly loving but he pushed and motivated me to get to my goals and helped me out in times of trouble. He was very manipulative and found ways of directing my life towards the things he wanted me to do and ignoring what I wanted. I kept telling myself that is what normal parents do, and kept striving to make him proud.

&#x200B;

In January of this year, my father found out I was gay. And as much as I knew he wouldn‚Äôt approve, I didn‚Äôt expect his reaction. He did everything he could to try and tell me it‚Äôs ‚Äúa phase‚Äù or I‚Äôd be disowned. He offered to pay me to not be gay. He tried to get my Mother against me and ultimately continued to destroy my relationship with my boyfriend. He would even threaten me and threaten my boyfriend.

&#x200B;

My father unexpectedly passed, and my family is not handling it well. I am the oldest boy in a family of 6 kids and I spent most of my life taking care of my younger siblings. I have spent the last week sucking up my emotions and helping out my family as best I can. I have sacrificed aspects of my relationship and my job to make sure my family is taken care of.

&#x200B;

Because of the last 6 months of my fathers life and the horrible things he has said and done to me because I am gay, I feel like I don‚Äôt want to go to his funeral. Even in his last final weeks he found ways to torture me or try to get me to ""change my mind"". I am upset he is gone, because it breaks my heart I will never change his mind and gain his love and respect back‚Ä¶ but at the same time the guy treated me worse than anyone ever has in my entire life.

&#x200B;

The only person I have told besides my boyfriend that I am not going to his funeral is my younger brother. My brother says I am an asshole for not attending. It‚Äôs supposed to be for the family, not my father. He thinks I should be there for my Mom and our sisters.. and him. He practically took out all his emotions in one conversation on me and Idk what to do now.

&#x200B;

I agree that funerals are supposed to be for the family. But I am included in that, and the discomfort and hurt I feel thinking about attending this is really effecting me even before I am even there. I feel like I have done so much for my family during this awful time of our lives, that I need to do something for me‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

I have been having a lot of dreams recently of losing the rest of my family, and trying to save them and not being able to and it‚Äôs really bothering me. I can‚Äôt figure out the right decision‚Ä¶ and honestly I really don‚Äôt want to go. My family is important to me but the pain I have felt since the first moment my Dad changed, I think the whole thing would just overwhelm me and it would be better for everyone if I wasn‚Äôt there. As I am writing this I can hear the selfishness in my thoughts... but it doesn't change how I feel.

c3c93g	2019-06-21 15:47:44	ButtPudding2016	AITA for having a questionably offensive Snapchat name, even though the ‚Äúslur‚Äù secretly applies to me?	"Snapchat became popular while I was in high school, but it was largely perceived to be a joke at first. After all, it was the ‚Äúsending nudes‚Äù social media. Like many social media platforms, it was never going to survive more than a few months. So, I gave my buddy my phone, and he made my Snapchat for me. That‚Äôs why my name is [last name]+‚Äùqueer‚Äù. 

The simple solution would be to change it right? Wrong. Snapchat does not allow users to change usernames. I have emailed Snapchat pleading them to let me change my name because it may be offensive to others but they said no. 

I should add that while many perceive me to be a standard-issue heterosexual [M], my sexual preferences are pretty fluid. At times, I‚Äôll be far more interested in men. Others, I‚Äôll be more interested in women. Only a few very close friends know this. 

So, am I the asshole? Do I need to delete my Snapchat and create a new one?

EDIT: It seems like the general consensus is that it‚Äôs not offensive if I‚Äôm owning the label of being queer. But what if I‚Äôm not ready to admit that to the world yet?

She is very conservative and religious. Her eldest son N is 13 and has Asperger‚Äôs. She asked me to watch her children for a few hours after practice one day and I agreed. This is the most time I ever spent with any of them. We were in a public location and I heard a commotion. Turns out N was describing various gruesome things (gory, not sexual) from the internet to a group of 6 year olds.

"Despite an almost six year age gap, my cousin, M, and I are very close being that until recently we were the only granddaughters on our mothers‚Äô side of the family. We talk nearly everyday, sending each other memes and telling each other secrets that we wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone else.

M‚Äôs dad has been in and out of jail and on drugs pretty much all of her (and her brother‚Äôs) life. It‚Äôs a struggle watching M try to have a relationship with her father, only for it to fail every time. She really thought that his last time in jail was another chance for them to start over. That was until he went through her phone, finding out personal information that ended in him calling her a ‚Äúdyke‚Äù and ‚Äúfag‚Äù and him screaming that both M and her brother weren‚Äôt his children anyways. 

M ended up shaking it off as him being high and on drugs when he told her that. Her father can‚Äôt deny her brother, due to her brother being a splitting image of her father. The thing is, M doesn‚Äôt know that there is a very high chance that her father isn‚Äôt her biological father. I was made aware of this fact when my mother (M‚Äôs Aunt) and later M‚Äôs own mother told me that a man named Chris was probably M‚Äôs father. Chris is in the Army, and is, according to my mom, an amazing man. He knows that there is a high chance that M is his daughter, as she also resembles his own children from his previous marriage. Despite knowing M is his daughter, he has told my mother and M‚Äôs mother that he doesn‚Äôt want to disrupt M‚Äôs life as he knows that it could end up changing her life significantly. 

I want to tell M the truth as I believe she is mature enough to handle it. However, she thinks the world of her grandmother on her father‚Äôs side. I know that if it was to turn out that M was not her son‚Äôs daughter by blood, M‚Äôs grandmother would probably end up no longer associating with M. 

While I feel guilt over not telling M the truth, I‚Äôm able to feel some relief over the fact that I‚Äôm ultimately protecting her from getting her whole life torn apart. My mother and aunt have agreed to wait until M‚Äôs grandmother has passed away to tell her, even going as far to say that ‚Äú[M‚Äôs grandmother] won‚Äôt live forever.‚Äù I find that real shitty and I‚Äôve already told myself that if M still doesn‚Äôt know by the time she turns 16, I will tell her myself.

c3bylj	2019-06-21 15:24:56	ShoddyBiscotti1	AITA for defending a coworker who recently picked her smoking habit back up	" 

Quick background here. I work in an office with a ten person department. I have one coworker (We'll call her Martha) who is 73 years old, and recently started smoking again after quitting years ago.

I'm (30M) a smoker, and I've cut back from two packs a day to just having two cigarettes a day. We have one other person who smokes, but very rarely smokes during work hours.

I came into work the other day and two of my coworkers had Martha cornered at her desk, and were putting her on blast for smoking again. Going on about how bad it is (which is true, but I've never met a smoker who wasn't already aware) and just generally being annoying about it AFTER being asked by Martha to drop the subject. A day later, they went into Martha's desk and hid her pack of smokes.

I eventually got tired of hearing them go on about it, and pointed out that Martha is an adult, she is fully aware of what she's doing, and that while I understand their concerns, they were crossing lines by going into her desk and harassing her whenever she walked out to smoke.

I was summarily put on blast by them, and was told I was only defending her because I also smoke, that I didn't care about her health, etc.

In my opinion, it's not our business what she does as an adult.

So because of my work overseas I live in an apartment complex with my coworkers and we generally get along and have fun together. I was talking to one of my neighbours and I mentioned how I had never tried pad thai before and she told me she could cook it for me since she loves it so I agreed. She knocked on my door after work and gave me a massive glass container with pad thai and told me to enjoy and give the container back tomorrow at work. So i ate it all and very much enjoyed it. Heres the thing I gave it back to her the next day and without cleaning the container there was still some stuff left in it and it smelled pretty bad. I told her it was good but she just gave me a blank stare when i handed it back almost like she couldnt believe it. She stormed off immediately and went into the break room and im guessing told my coworkers. I was supposed to play DnD with them tonight but they wouldnt respond to my texts so now I dunno might just play switch with my gf's son. AITA because I didnt clean it? I mean i didnt really ask for it and she gave it to me. Its not mine and its not like I kept the glass container it looked expensive. I asked my gf but she was to busy tonight at her friends apartment to respond. The pad thai was pretty good though.	Asshole	0	0
c3bxu0	2019-06-21 15:23:08	leenoonbi	AITA for wanting my stepdad out of my life?	"(This is my first post in this subreddit, so pardon any errors. I just joined recently.) 

So this is a complicated situation. I'm 15 and my parents divorced when I was 6 because my dad USED to have patterns of neglect and immaturity. I was always a daddy's girl because I got his sense of humour, one that nobody else I've met has really even understood. I always had a strong bond with my dad.

About 4 years ago, my dad moved half way across the country and re-married. It crushed me. 2 years ago, my mom re-married and we moved to the other side of the state, which crushed me more since at the time I was attending the school of my dreams where I actually had friends. 

I obviously was depressed. I didn't go to school there for a while. I lost contact with almost all my friends right away. Plus, my mom has almost nothing in common with me, and she married someone like her, so you can guess.

For a while, the relationship I had with my stepdad was fine. He was just kind of leaving me alone unless I wanted to talk. It was good, until my mom told him more about my experiences growing up, and my stepdad related to some. 

Suddenly about 8 months ago, he became super pushy, trying to literally take my dad's place. He started saying things like ""If I had a daughter, it'd be you"" and ""We just have so much in common"". My sense of humour can adjust depending on who I'm with, so it has when I'm around him, but I have almost nothing in common with him.

He started trying to joke more (with about 2% of what he says being funny) and introducing me to people as HIS. DAUGHTER. He even got the rest of his family saying how much I'm like him. He does things that completely annoy me, I assume to be funny, but he doesn't really regard my feelings. For example, waving his hand in my face whenever he passes by me (which can trigger a panic attack for me, I have anxiety), jumpscaring me from behind (another panic trigger), etc, even though he knows well of my anxiety and panic disorder. 

He's nothing like my dad, and I'm still way too attached to my dad and I always will be. What he's doing is making me dread being around him. He talks poorly of my dad, but brags when he does something somewhat good, like throwing away his own trash (he usually throws stuff on the floor).

He's been inserting himself into my life when I don't want him to. When I try to spend time with my mom, he always joins whatever we're doing so I never get to spend time with her. And whenever I talk to him about how he's upsetting me, he either gets angry, sad, or he's just a stump. 

I know he means well because he heard how my dad used to treat me and wants to help, but he's not and I've told him that, yet he continues all of this. At this point, I often ignore my stepdad, and I don't laugh at his jokes much. I know it hurts his feelings, but he's been crushing mine so..

c3buua	2019-06-21 15:16:49	maia_leticia	AITA for not talking to my mom for weeks after she sent a curse on me?	"So, this story takes place some time ago, around 2 and a half years. My parents were divorced for 3 years at the time and my mom never accepted the divorce. 

She liked to complain about life and stay at home crying that she didn't have any friends or a boyfriend (when she wasn't working).

I was alone with her and she used to put it all over me when she was depressed or stressed. I just took it silently and pretended it never happened, she liked it that way.

One day, when I started dating my boyfriend, she noticed that I wasn't spending much time at home and was very upset about it as she liked to complain to me about life. So she came to me and said I couldn't go. And I said he was coming to pick me up so I was going either way. She said I wasn't allowed to go. I said that I was as I am an adult and make my decisions. 

She then said ""Well, you're going to be all alone and unwanted just like me. This boyfriend of yours is going to leave you in no time and you're going to suffer a lot.""

I couldn't say a word, I just walked away and left. This made me so sad that this time I wouldn't pretend nothing happened until she apologized. 
She just did it almost a month after that.

I know my mom was depressed and I know that we should always support people with depression and understand that mental illness but I just couldn't take it anymore.

Nowadays I do therapy and so does my mom so we're good.

c3bs1n	2019-06-21 15:10:51		AITA for telling my Sister not to walk around the house half-naked?	"I'm back at my parents' house for a few weeks over the summer, so I guess it's not really my place to dictate household habits but the way my sister dresses really irks me.   


Whenever she gets home from school or a social event with her friends, she likes to get in her uber comfort zone and switch off - and rightly so, what else is a home for? Thing is, she likes to walk around in just a shirt, like a really long shirt that covers the top 20% of her legs. A bit like in those films where two people have slept with each other and the girl wears the guy's much larger shirt like a one-piece item of clothing.   


I just really don't like it. If I were a father, I'd feel the same way with my children - it's indecent. I know you should be able to relax 100% around your family but I would never spend the whole day in just boxers, or walk around shirtless with just shorts on. Other times she'll wear just a robe (like a really fluffy spa/shower robe) with only underwear underneath, not even a shirt or anything - i dont know why but it really annoys me. This isn't an everyday occurrence though, she'll dress like this maybe four days out of seven.  


Well anyways, today my sister wore just an oversized shirt again. I politely said to her ""you shouldn't be walking around in just a shirt"" and we got into an argument from there. She pointed out how I sometimes walk around with no shirt on - but that's only temporary, literally when I'm going from my room to the shower, or if I've just woken up and someone's at the door (I'll wear a t-shirt on my way to the door). She then said I shouldn't make such a big deal out of it, to which I replied ""why are you so defensive"" and I suggested we leave it at that.

c3bp7f	2019-06-21 15:04:50	bingoflaps	AITA for taking up a full parking spot with my motorcycle?	"I used to live in a midsized condo building (50-100 units) in Center City Philly. Parking was limited due to population density. Parking was also coveted because Philly‚Äôs public transport isn‚Äôt comprehensive enough to fully eliminate car ownership in a practical way like in NYC. The vast majority of the people in my building owned a car.

When the developer built the building, they installed [car lifts](https://imgur.com/a/Cx1W3GF) in all the spots in order to double the garage capacity. Parking spots were purchased for $25k and written into condo deeds. I was a renter, but my landlord purchased a spot and told me we were entitled to a parking spot in the garage. Parking was guaranteed, but specific spaces were not assigned. It was a first come first serve free for all.  

Problems arose when the condo HOA decided car lifts were too much of a liability, so the lifts sat there collecting dust. People parked under the car lifts and the upper portions were unused. Problem with that is the garage did not have enough spots to accommodate everyone who purchased a spot. A valet company was hired to quadruple park cars and play musical chairs when a blocked car was needed. This was really only necessary in the morning and evening rushes. Otherwise, it was self-park when open spots were available. The system was not ideal, but I never had a problem handing my keys over when all the spots were taken. 

I bought a motorcycle about a year into my 2 year lease. Since our landlord only owned one parking spot, I needed to find a spot for my bike.   My original plan was to park it at work and leave it there indefinitely. However, I decided to ask the HOA about parking the bike in the dead space *between* the car lifts first, because why not? The HOA responded saying parking is not allowed between the lifts and implied that I cannot have 2 vehicles in the garage when my landlord only owned 1 spot. Fair enough. So I started leaving my car at work and parking my motorcycle in the garage at home. I took up an entire space with my motorcycle because my landlord paid $25k for it. It was pretty obnoxious to see a tiny motorcycle take up an entire parking spot while the valet driver was quadruple blocking cars in to make all of the cars fit. I guess enough people took notice and complained, because I was eventually allowed to park my bike in the dead space between the car lifts.

c3blsw	2019-06-21 14:57:41	ThrowawayMooose	WIBTA If I Told My Sister She Fell For A Scam?	"Throwaway because my sister follows my regular account. 

(TLDR at the bottom)

My sister and I are both in high school and very close with each other. She is more academic than I am, and gets better grades. However, she is also the type to need validation from others, and can be very sensitive to criticism or failure.

 She received a letter in the mail from a foundation/company that told her she won an award for outstanding performance in school. (She gets Bs and Cs, but still higher than mine). It did not mention her grades or what she won it for specifically.  I started to get suspicious, but I didn't say anything because, hey, it was my sister and I was proud of her. 

Then it mentioned that for the low price of $75, she would receive an official membership card. That was the straw on the camel's back for me, and I did a little research about this foundation. The college board forums say not to waste your money/colleges don't care about ""bought"" awards, and that overall, this had nothing to do with her academic performance. Most of them say that these ""awards"" don't have anything to do with grades, they just get your info from the PSAT and SAT.

I was about to gently tell her that she might not want to waste her money, but she had already PAID the $75, and was about to pay more for a T shirt and a ""platinum membership"". I was able to convince her not to buy those 2 just yet, but I haven't been able to tell her how much of a scam it really is...

I feel awful letting her waste her hard earned money on something that won't help her, and I feel awful crushing her spirit and bringing her self esteem down by telling her she didn't really ""win""...

TLDR: My sister paid for a scam out of her own pocket and she's really excited about it. I don't know of I should tell her.

Long story short, we ending things on a good note and remain friends. She was unhappy with certain aspects, and I later realized I was unhappy in certain aspects as well, in hindsight. 

Fast-forward, I find out about one to one and a half months after the breakup that my now ex and best friend are dating. My ex told me they went on one date, but not in a relationship. The worst part was my best friend never told me or asked me. Years prior, my best friend didn‚Äôt want to ask out a girl because one of his close friends dated her... 2 years prior... and this friend was already engaged to another girl. Yet he had no problem asking out my ex without even bringing it up.

I texted both my friend and ex and wished them well, but in all honesty it felt more of a ‚Äúlet me text them so we are all on the same page and there is no awkwardness‚Äù type of thing.

I haven‚Äôt done anything outwardly due to being upset about it, but I feel as if I‚Äôve been thrown in a ditch with my friend almost going behind my back (yes, I know my ex is my ex, but I still feel it would be nice to be told by my friend) and my ex probably having feelings for this guy during our 5 year relationship.

In a week my partner and I are going on a short vacation with a few of his friends. Everyone need to contribute some money. Not a problem, we all work and can save up for it as we knew weeks in advance. However there is one friend that probably won‚Äôt have the money and will need to be covered. 

You see, this friend had a history of not having enough money for anything and needing someone else to pay for him. For example, we go to a fair every year and plan in a month or two in advance. But every year he fails to get money to pay for his ticket and his food. What could he be spending his money on? Alcohol. He works a part time job with barely any hours and spends all his income on alcohol. 

For this trip, we all discussed (without the alcoholic), who would pay for him when he shows up with no money? My partner said he could pay a little bit, but he would need to be paid back. There‚Äôs been one friends constantly paying for this guys way and I feel for him, but I‚Äôm not about to spend my money on someone who can‚Äôt save up for plans we‚Äôve had for months in advance especially when this is a reoccurring issue.

"This is about a 4 year lasting friendship with a classmate (lets call him Bas) and we both have the same friends groups. We used to hang out every now and then and game alot after school times. However we started to hang out less and game less together, we still are friends. also we go out to parties with the same people in our spare time.

We both go to the same gym and on occasions other mutual friends join to same gym. One time I asked if he wanted to join me to the gym and he said he was already going with another mutual friend so we met at the gym. Bas didn't want to go as a group of 3, but the mutual friend said its a social matter to not just ignore another or avoid one in such space. 

A few days later we spoke on school and I asked if he wanted to join me and another friend, he replied that he dislikes going as 3 alot and rather goes alone. However I insisted him to join us and said from my one time experience it was not all to bad. Eventually he went later that day and I saw him on my way home. We just spoke a little and he seemed very irritated and thought I only wanted to gym with the other dude and when I said I was heading home he cut me off saying good luck and turned his back. I let this slide and didn't do much with it at the time.

When I was at the gym with this same mutual friend again I didn't bother to ask him to join since his previous statements. However he was there aswell and we started talking. He seemed pretty short and ignoring us doing his own workout. giving it a tense fibe. I really tried to engage and communicate.

The next day he asked me to join him and I said I didn't know when I would be home yet and probably rather go the day after. To which he responded ""I bet because the other friend wants to go then"" I wasn't sure how to repons to this so i said I did not know.

&#x200B;

I think no one is obligated to hang out with people if they dont want to. And going to a place as the gym with 3 people could be a pain when its busy. I don't dissagree, but it seems he is jealous with the last response.

In order to not feeling guilty or having to explain myself to him everytime I want to ask him to stop asking me to gym if he is going to send negative responses. since alot of time he gives me the feeling I have to defend my decisions when I do or don't do things.

I also have two kids, a 17-year old daughter and 15-year old son. I massage both of them regularly. On special occasions (customary they always get one on their birthday), when they're feeling stressed or going through tough times, when they report any stiffness in their body, etc. They love it, and I absolutely love my kids, so I'm glad that I can make them feel good in the best way I can.

Recently when my neighbor was visiting she overheard me talking to my daughter about this briefly, and seemed a little weirded out by it, then asking ""You massage your kids?!"" I explained yes, and then she asked (once my daughter left the room) if it's an actual full massage with them naked except for a towel. I thought it honestly wasn't her business but I told her yes, I give the exact same massage I give to my clients. (One a side note unless it's one of those quick ones you can get at the mall in a chair I believe you should always take all your clothes off for a massage, otherwise you're only cheating yourself. The buttocks has the largest concentration of nerves on your body, and thus is frequently the highlight of the massage. I wouldn't ever get a massage myself that didn't include that area unless it was specifically to address one part of the body that needed work.) My ""style"" is also based over long interrupted strokes, and having underwear or a bra in the way doesn't go well with it, I just move the towel to the side I'm currently not working and then move it back doing the other side. I've given literally thousands of massages this way. That said once my kids started developing I gave them the option of leaving any clothes on if they weren't comfortable...and both declined, saying my massages were perfect as is. She then made some comment about how weird it is that a teenage girl would be OK with her mother seeing her breasts that I thought was pretty weird. I offer to drape the breasts of female clients, but do not if they decline (this is not legally required in my state), and always decline it when getting a massage myself. My daughter also has declined. I massage the area around the breasts, but not the nipples.

While I can see out of context that someone would see a mother rubbing her kids naked except for a single towel would be weird, it's still entirely desexualized, it's a legitimate therapeutic practice that they enjoy, and that I enjoy, and seeing the smiles on their faces and feeling the happiness and relief of my loved ones is always a big pick me up to me as well.

c3bddo	2019-06-21 14:38:46		AITA for being upset that my sister sold a family heirloom for a lot of money and didn't share it?	"TLDR: My sister inherited a ¬£95,000 necklace while me and my sibling got nothing. I'm upset she sold it in the first place and didn't share the money she got. 

My (23F) grandmother gave my sister (F29) a diamond necklace a few years ago when she got married, she got it because she was the oldest grandchild. To be honest, I don't think my grandma ever realised it was worth that much. 

My wonderful grandmother passed and nothing else was given to any of the grandchildren (me and my brother) other than an old chest of draws my great-great Grandad made. This was given to me because I needed some furniture for my uni room so my grandma just gave it to me a couple of years back. These draws are very sentimental but old and need refurbishing now because it's only a matter of time before they collapse. 

My sister asked me last year if she could have the draws for her daughter. I said no because I'm still using them and wanted to refurbish it this year as a little project to make me feel close to my grandma. 

I had the best relationship with my grandma, I miss her so dearly. I always made an effort with her and visited often (unlike the other two who lived further away), I took care for her and used to take her out and about. I'm way more family orientated and centimental than my siblings though to be fair.  

Anyway... My sister sold the necklace she got for ¬£95,000 and kept the entire lot for herself. She used it to put towards a house. I'm upset about this mostly because in the future if I was lucky enough to get married I wanted to borrow it. She even said on her wedding day that she couldn't wait for ""my little sister to wear something so special too"".

When I heard she sold it I asked her about it. She said that it was given to her so she can decide what to do with it. She said it was the only way she would ever be able to afford a house so couldn't pass up on the opportunity.

She then made a snide comment about how I didn't let her have the drawers.

I said to her that I didn't think it was fair that she got all that money just because she is older than me, especially when my relationship with my grandma was better and it's not exactly like I can afford a house either, I literally live pay cheque to pay cheque. 

I sound really selfish thinking that it's unfair that I don't have the necklace or money when really it's not mine at all. But I still think it's entirely unfair what she did with it and we aren't talking now. We used to be very close and it's a shame really. 


So AITA for being annoyed at my sister for selling it and not sharing the money?"		1	0
c3bcis	2019-06-21 14:36:56	Belligerent_ice_cube	AITA for completely going off on my BFF for who had unprotected sex after I specifically warned her about the consequences?	"So my BFF, who I am extremely close to (we speak at least once a day for over 15 years now) just told me that she's afraid she has an STD because of unprotected sex she's been having with a guy who isn't even her bf or committed to her in any way.

Problem is, she already went through this situation about 2 years ago, where she was FWB with a complete and total asshole guy who kept pressuring her to have unprotected sex with him, even though he told her *blantantly to her face* that if she got pregnant or had health consequences because of the sex, that ""was \[her\] problem."" (Because he was a complete and total asshole.) 

So of course she relented and had the sex without a condom, and was constantly paranoid about pregnancy and STD's (which thankfully, she did NOT get). I basically read her the riot act because of that. Because TBH she has a lot of financial issues and who would mostly likely end up bailing her out emotionally and financially if she got into trouble? ME (the guy had already said he would not be helping her out with any of those kinds of issues).

Now she's in the same situation with another guy who is not her bf and has not committed to her (not even a FWB really, since they aren't really friends at all but only see eachother for sex) whom she admits she can't trust. She said he came over the other day and neither of them had a condom but still wanted to have sex, so they did. Now she's having symptoms that she's afraid are from an STD.

I FLIPPED on her, basically yelling at her that she's a complete fucking moron for this and that she almost deserves to get an STD this time, because maybe that would teach her a lesson about not acting like an idiot and taking chances with her finances and body. Note that due to her current situation, at least 70% of all our conversations are monopolized by 1.) her money troubles, and 2.) her issues with this guy, who won't ever even text/ message her back when it's not about sex (so of course she tries to make waves as little as possible, to avoid pissing him off and losing what interaction they do have).

Now she isn't talking to me and I feel bad and maybe like I should apologize for being so harsh. I'm just so frustrated with her dumb mistakes, because that means hours and hours of her on the phone crying and needing emotional support and possibly money. AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3b9zg	2019-06-21 14:31:15	Educational_Lettuce	AITA for asking the best man at my wedding to do anything with the maid of honor, which happened to be his ex?	"  

To preface this, I have ADD and tend to bounce all over the place due to writing in stream of consciousness, so I apologize ahead of time if things are out of order.

I've been happily married for five years, but one thing has continued to bug me about my wedding. 

The best man was my best friend (at the time). We'd been through everything, been friends for about 18-20 years since grade school. I met my wife Freshman year of college, we started dating spring semester. Blah blah, a bunch of years later and we get engaged, she asks her best friend to be the maid of honor, and I ask mine to be the best man.

Legend of main characters for clarity sake:

Me: duh

W: My wife

MoH: Maid of Honor/wife's best friend

BM: Best Man/My best friend

Let's backtrack a little here. During our time at college, W meets MoH and they start a great friendship. Fast forward a year or two, W, MoH and a couple other girls (some of which happened to be bridesmaids) rent a house together, because that's a thing college kids do. BM meets MoH through Me and W, they end up dating shortly thereafter.

I'm not going to go into great detail about their relationship, as its not completely relevant to the story. What you need to know is BM was pretty clingy (white knight for no reason jobby) and, for reasons I don't know, MoH ended up cheating on him.

It was a bitter breakup, but graduation happened and the drama died with distance and time. That is, until I proposed and we started planning. Long story short, W wanted MoH to be the Maid of Honor, and I wanted my brother to be best man, but he told me flat out, ""If BM isn't your best man, I'm boycotting your wedding."" BM and I had grown distant after graduation, had seen each other maybe two or three times since graduation two years prior. 

So our plan was to have each of the bridesmaids walk out of the ceremony and into the reception with one of the groomsmen, so obviously BM and MoH would have to walk together. BM was NOT having it. It was ""how could you do this to me, after everything she put me through,"" or "" If you make me do anything with her, You'll have to find a new best man."" He genuinely refused to do ANYTHING with her. Don't get me wrong, I understand why he wanted nothing to do with her, and I really tried to get W to change the MoH because of their history, but no one would budge.

To his questions, I simply replied, ""Bro, it's my wedding and the only thing I'm asking of you is to walk with her for 30 seconds of the entire day."" I'm the kind of person that will die choking on my pride to make someone's special day as drama free as possible, he apparently is not.

We ended up changing some of the procession things, like bridesmaids and groomsmen walked out of the ceremony one by one and BM walked into the reception with a different bridesmaid (clearly same with MoH), and our wedding was the best day ever.

All that being said, AITA for asking my best man to swallow his pride for a couple minutes for our wedding?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3b999	2019-06-21 14:29:45	Rusty_Shcklford	AITA for cutting my mother out of my life for letting me be homeless?	"Back in 2009 when the economy tanked I lost my job, my car, my apartment, my girlfriend. Basically everything. At first I didn‚Äôt want anyone to know what had happened so I stayed at a friends house for a week while I looked for a new job. But his landlord told me guests couldn‚Äôt stay for more than 7 days at a time in a 30 day period. So I asked my mother if I could stay with her while I looked for a job. I told her I‚Äôd be on the street homeless if she didn‚Äôt help me and she still decided to refuse to help me. Fast forward 2 months, I‚Äôve been sleeping on the streets for every night still unable to secure a job. Even something like Safeway or McDonald‚Äôs. My dad finds out that I‚Äôm homeless and sends me a ticket to come live with him in NJ and I accept. Within a week I have a job and in 3 months I‚Äôm in my own place again. It‚Äôs been 10 years since then and I haven‚Äôt spoken to my mother because of what I perceive to be a betrayal. She attempts to contact me frequently and I ignore it. AITA for cutting her out of my life? 

TL;DR mother let me be homeless and I never forgive her.

Edit: I have already cut ties. I haven‚Äôt spoken to her in 10 years. It‚Äôs my siblings telling me that I am the asshole that prompted this post.

Edit: people keep asking for her reasoning and all I can say is what she said to me. She said she couldn‚Äôt afford to let me stay. But all I was asking for was a place to sleep. Not money, or food. I was getting a small unemployment check and eventually I got food stamps. I could have contributed. 

Edit: I guess I also have to say that I never asked my parents for anything. I‚Äôve earned everything I have. I am not a drug user and I have never been. I don‚Äôt drink and I‚Äôve been the most responsible of all the children. Oh and my post should probably be she let me STAY homeless instead of let me be homeless."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm petty, I‚Äôm from the deeep north living in the mideastern/southern US and I love the cold. So I always get my hair washed in the coldest possible water. My barber hates this with a passion because she hates the cold to put it simply.

c3b8nw	2019-06-21 14:28:31	Alexander45327	WIBTA for rekindling a relationship and having her come over	"To give some background, my friend was married and they bought a house together a couple years ago.


Unfortunately they ended up getting divorced back in April, she moved out and he kept the house. For almost a month he slept at his families house and never went home due to it being painful. Around the same time my most recent girlfriend and I were going through difficulties and ended up breaking up. She and the ex wife are good friends.


He saw this as an opportunity to ask me to move in so he wouldn't be alone in the house. I agreed, moved in for the start of June. Up until this point my ex and I have not been talking.


My ex wanted to meet and talk about what happened since we ended on really bad terms (turned out to be a combination of both of our stresses and long distance mixed with a touch of a catfishing account using her photos). Long story short, we ended up talking about everything on a few different occasions and decided we would like to try and work things out. Now my roommate/friend has been up to date on this and today he told me that she would not be welcome in the house. From what he has told me it's because her and his ex wife are good friends. Yet I dont think it's fair for him to say who I can and cannot have over since I am also living there. The thing is, he works nights and I work days so he would rarely see her if anything.

So reddit, would I be the asshole, if i was to say that's not fair and have her over occasionally?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3b7d6	2019-06-21 14:25:39	tyfothrow	AITA for keeping the dog from my dad just to spite him?	"My family consists of dad, mum, big bro J (22), little bro A (14) and me (20 F). Ever since J was born my dad has been acting like we took his freedom away. When we were very young (0-9 for me) he continued to act like a uni student, coming home drunk, going out diving with friends on weekdays etc. His body language is very passive aggressive and you always feel like you have to keep one eye on him to assess what kind of mood he‚Äôs in because he can change quickly, without warning and without explanation.


While my dad was studying his PhD my mum kept us afloat by working full time as a vet. My dad didn‚Äôt help with the house, with the children and complained when our home wasn‚Äôt spotless. Eventually it became too much for my mum and when dad completed his PhD he moved to Norway for a job while my mum stayed in the UK with us.


Dad would visit every other weekend and eventually starting going on about how he‚Äôs sad and lonely and is a changed person. After 6 months of separation mum believes him and we move over to Norway, things are good for a couple of years and he‚Äôs able to act like a decent person. Then J reaches puberty, becomes a bit of a dick, my dad reacts by bullying and becoming an even bigger dick towards J. 


J ends up moving out at 16, cutting ties with my whole family and moves to the UK to study. It takes 2 years for my mum to get back into a healthy relationship with J. Then my dad and I go over to see J without my mum for the first time since he moved out, we get drunk and my dad is the biggest dick I‚Äôve ever seen, truly awful and it was really upsetting to see. 


At this point my mum considers leaving dad again, but we were in a difficult position so we couldn‚Äôt at that time. Recently however my dad started bullying A, my little brother in the same way that he had bullied J when he started puberty and my mum didn‚Äôt want to see the same thing happen to A and so worked hard to get us into a position where we could leave our dad.


Also, we recently got a dog and while my dad doesn‚Äôt help with the boring stuff (cleaning, poo duty) he still loves the dog very much, I feel quite jealous of how well he treats the dog compared to how he treated me and my brothers during our childhood. The dog belongs to my mum legally so we took him with us when we left.


We moved out about 2 weeks ago when he went to a work conference. He called my mum for an explanation when he got back, was speechless most of the time, but managed to ask if he would still be able to see the dog, he asked about the dog twice during that conversation and about me and my brothers 0 times. 


Since then he has asked me several times about seeing the dog, I want to keep him from the dog just to spite him. I know the dog would like to see my dad, but I don‚Äôt want to give my dad that pleasure. 


This might seem clear cut, but I also feel like I‚Äôm keeping the dog from him for no reason other than to make him sad.

We have a D&D group together, that I DM,  with his roommates and my brother that we've had for 2 years now. About 6 months ago, Wade started dating Penny. Penny just like her namesake is NOT into nerdy stuff. She plays video games but only like three and she readily admits she is not a gamer, she just likes the handful that she enjoys. Wade's been trying to teach her Magic and some of the boardgames we all play. She tries, but I can tell she's not into it. She spends a lot of time on her phone ""looking up rules"" trying to learn.

Anyway so one of Wade's roommates had to drop out of our D&D campaign and Penny joined us. She doesn't know anything. Wade constantly has to walk her through her character sheet, which she totally changed from top to bottom except doesn't know what any of the stats mean. It's a constant slog when it's her turn because Wade has to hold her hand through what she can and can't do. 

Nobody else has said anything but I imagine since they live with Wade they can't. I want her to leave the group. We don't need 5 spots, we can manage with 4, and she just slows everything down.

c3b15p	2019-06-21 14:11:15	GunsAndCoffee1911	AITA for asking my wife to get rid of her prom dress?	"FINAL UPDATE: She vacuum sealed the dress and it is out of my closet. I am no longer asking her to get rid of it. I still think it's a little weird but I'm resigned to the fact that it's just something I can't understand. I'll admit I'm salty that my closet space pretty much got cut in half. I don't think it's very fair but then again we're planning on moving into a bigger house eventually so I guess it's temporary. Thanks for all your responses and support. I did read every reply and I appreciate everyone's honesty!

ORIGINAL: My wife refuses to get rid of hers. It's huge and poofy and it's taking up space in my closet (which isn't even in our bedroom because her clothes take up that whole closet). Now she's asking me to make space in my closet to fit a dresser, but I countered by asking her to get rid of her prom dress first. She hasn't worn it in over a decade. I asked her why is so important to her to keep it. She says she loves it because it's her favorite color and her parents spent a lot of money on it. She also wants to keep it to play dress-up when our daughter is older (she is currently pregnant with said daughter so that will be a while). Every time I suggest she get rid of it she makes me feel guilty about it because she loves that dress. Obviously I don't want to MAKE her get rid of it but it's literally just taking up space which directly affects me. Am I the asshole here or is this weird?

EDIT for clarification: Our attic is one of those where you have to climb over trusses and insulation so the attic is out. We have a finished basement and a small-ish utility room with a washer, dryer, treadmill, etc. We have one kid already so that room is filling up. The reason I'm having to put my dresser in the closet is because our son moved into that room so the new baby can have his old room, and his new dresser is going where mine was. We're kind of running out of space so my dresser has to go in the closet. We only have a three bedroom house. Things are getting kind of cramped.

EDIT #2: Sorry I have ADHD so I keep forgetting things. Well the dresser has been moved into my closet. As you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/L8GzTSF) it takes up like half the closet. I included her closet and dresser for comparison. I think I'm also still a little salty about an incident from a year ago or so. I had two PE shirts from high school that I loved. They were so broken in and comfortable, and they were perfect for wearing around the house or at the gym. She hated them because, naturally, they had sweat stains. But they are some of my last t-shirts from high school. One day I noticed both of them missing. My wife claimed they got burned in the dryer. Weird because she never told me about it and how does that even happen? I later confronted her about it and she admitted she threw them away. So there's that."	Not the A-hole	0	0

A few months later in November, my company was shut down and all of the employees were laid off, too. Obviously we were panicked and scrambling around for jobs ASAP.  My husband went right into IT out of high school 20 years ago so finding a new job without a degree proved difficult and we decided going back to school would be the best shortish term option. This meant I was the sole breadwinner for the time being. 

An acquaintance from high school had been actively recruiting me to take on a new position at her company, and I had declined a few times and offered to help her find a good candidate instead, but when I got laid off I asked her if the position was available. The job paid slightly more than my old one and had the added bonus of remote work, and she was excited to have me join her team so I turned down a couple other job offers and took hers without hesitation.  

Six months into the job, and I absolutely hate it. I‚Äôm not using my skill set at all, and I‚Äôve basically turned into an assistant for her team. I make presentations prettier and do whatever work no one else wants to do. The team, my boss, and the company as a whole is disorganized and relies on outdated communication and project management methods so nothing ever really gets done. The company also engages in some pretty shady business practices despite positioning themselves as a service organization and I feel really gross about that. 

One day when I was feeling particularly low about everything, I did a cursory search for my job title on Indeed and found a ton of openings for much more prestigious companies that pay way better and actually are what I‚Äôve trained to do.  I filled out a couple applications expecting to hear nothing back but both have offered me interviews so far. 

I‚Äôm excited, but I also have misgivings about quitting a job I‚Äôve just started. I‚Äôve always been a loyal employee and have never job hopped so I feel like a giant asshole for leaving a position after six months just because I‚Äôm not happy.

So a little background...My partner is the best man. We have been together for 10 years. The groom is his best friend. I have met the happy couple a handful of times. 
We all initially lived together (my partner & his friend lived together, then we met and his friend met his now soon to be wife. They both moved us in for a couple months before the lease was due to finish. When it did we went our separate ways). 

His best friend has never liked me. I am not sure why. As far as I am aware, it was because I'm ""the female version of [my partner]. This means that as I, a single woman in the 21st century, was enjoying my sexual freedom. I was always honest about this, I never lied and i was always careful. I never did anything to this man other than complain about his hygiene. I can attach photos if needs be as evidence, but before I moved in and regularly stayed over if my partner was not at my place, we would arrive back to the most filthiest of houses. There is no way no describe it. I had to do dishes in the bath (every single utensil etc dirty), the bins would be overflowing and the flies and maggots would be growing. This explained why we moved as quick as we did when the lease finished. Of course I complained and stated if there are 4 adults living together, there should be a mutual respect for communal living areas. 

Going forward, this girl who my partners friend ended up with, has been born into money. This money has then been gifted to them as couple repeatedly by her father. He has helped him set up a business, he has paid for them to purchase a house, she is having roads closed for the wedding and a helicopter for her arrival. They also have a 'fort'. This is basically an empty summer house which is for use throughout the year for them and their friends. They regularly use this, and have done over the last 10 years. My partner, his best friend and many others are a close group and have been since school. I have never been invited. I have never been. And since we lived separately, I have seen this couple once. 

My partner, wants to gift the happy couple ¬£500. This had initially been ¬£1000. Of course i said no. His reasoning is that a wedding is costly and may be around ¬£150 per head. My reasoning is that they dont need the money, their honeymoon is paid for, and they have not been supportive of us as a couple and I have been ostracized from the group for nearly a decade. I have compromised and said ¬£200 is my maximum. I am not saying give them nothing. My partner and I combine finances, we live together, pay bills etc. I believe if this was the other way round (my partner doesnt want him as best man when we marry), then they would not be as generous - I know you dont give to receive but the point is that.

c3avfx	2019-06-21 13:58:00	cherr0s	WIBTA if I don‚Äôt apologise to my mum?	"For context, I‚Äôm 15.

My parents are the type of parents who believe parents/adults can never be wrong. I almost always apologise for unreasonable things I don‚Äôt even feel sorry for just because I don‚Äôt want bad blood between us. I somewhat value our relationship because of course, they‚Äôre my parents.

Earlier today me and my mum has an argument about something silly and I raised my voice at her. She told me it was rude to do so, which by the way I wholeheartedly agree with. I think kids should respect their parents. But I‚Äôm a bit fed up with how I have to put up with her talking over me every single time I‚Äôm defending something I said or even simply giving reasons for why I have a certain view on something. So I told her exactly that. I‚Äôm only raising my voice because that‚Äôs the only way I could get her to listen to me.

Honestly, she always goes on about how I should respect her and my dad more but why should I respect them if they can‚Äôt even respect me? I‚Äôve tried countless times to explain to them that same exact concept but they never seem to get it. This time I chose not to apologise because well, I don‚Äôt exactly feel I did anything wrong?

The catch is, I feel bad.

I love my parents. I really do. I like to see them happy and they can be really nice and loving when they want to be. It just feels so wrong of me not to apologise and I feel like I should apologise just because I hurt my mum‚Äôs feelings or something like that. But I just hate it. I just want her to listen to me on why I disagree with her without attacking me. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm saying her opinion isn‚Äôt valid. I‚Äôm just telling her why I have a different opinion.

But I feel like I‚Äôve offended her. And even though I think I have a point, I just feel like, well, an asshole.

c3av9t	2019-06-21 13:57:28		AITA for being upset that my SO wants to attend a wedding without me?	"Boyfriend of 2 yrs (don‚Äôt live together but it is a serious relationship) was invited to a wedding of a college friend that requires cross country travel (5+hour flight). They are not super close but a couple of his good friends will also be attending. They were surprised my bf was invited given that he‚Äôs not that tight with the groom. 

When he got the save the date several months ago he suggested we make a trip out of it and go for the whole week and we assumed I would be included on the invite bc I have met the couple before and it‚Äôs well known that we are together. Plus, in my experience any time someone is invited to a wedding that far away a plus one is usually given. 

Flash forward to the formal invite and I‚Äôm not on it nor does he have a plus 1. I honestly did not expect that to even be a possibility but I get that it‚Äôs not my wedding and I don‚Äôt know the details around how they decided the invite list. However, I feel like given this new information, he should either call the groom and try to figure out if it was an oversight (my guess is it was) OR we should use the time we already have blocked off from work to do our own trip wherever we want since we haven‚Äôt booked our flights or hotels yet (vs specifically going to the city that this wedding will be in). 

He told me a few days ago he would call the groom but then after talking to his friend who is also going decided that he didn‚Äôt feel comfortable asking and RSVP‚Äôd just for himself BEFORE telling me that he was not going to ask the groom after all.  This has really upset me because I feel like he went behind my back in doing this. 

My bf is insistent on going to the wedding despite this not being a very close friend and wants to keep our original plans to go a week early for a mini vacation, but I would be left back at the hotel on the wedding night. He thinks that I‚Äôm being selfish to ask him not to go just because I wasn‚Äôt invited. I on the other hand think he is being selfish for being ok with us spending our time/money on a trip for a wedding where he likely would not be missed. If it was a local wedding, I don‚Äôt think it would be an issue (we have gone solo to those before) but given how far it is I feel differently. I also feel that if he isn‚Äôt close enough with the groom to explain the situation and get clarity on why the invite didn‚Äôt include me, he shouldn‚Äôt be putting in all this effort to attend the wedding. To clarify, I‚Äôm frustrated w/ my bf‚Äôs actions, not the couple. 

Am I the asshole for being hurt by this & wanting him to not go/ do our own trip, or do I have a valid case?"		1	0
c3aulz	2019-06-21 13:55:47	undergroundsounds	AITA for talking back to a rude TSA woman?	I had just gone through the X-ray machine and was retrieving my things from the plastic bins. The table was crowded and there were probably 8 other people also getting their stuff. All the while a TSA woman was robotically repeating ‚Äúput the trays on the cart‚Äù (there was a cart of trays next to the table.) I happened to be the last one there grabbing my things, and there was a stack of about 10 trays on the table. I finished getting my stuff, stacked my tray neatly in the pile on the table, and turned to leave. Just then, the TSA woman shouts at me ‚ÄúPUT THE TRAYS ON THE CART! SIR‚Äù. Offended that I had just been screamed at while the numerous people before me left their trays exactly where I did with no reproach, I stated ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt work here, you do.‚Äù At this point, my girlfriend is looking at me like I‚Äôm a serial killer, and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll get detained and strip searched or something, so I walked back and put the stack of everyone‚Äôs trays on the cart. According to my girlfriend I am the asshole of the century for talking back and not sheepishly heeding the rude woman‚Äôs orders, and now we‚Äôre fighting. AITA?	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3anlg	2019-06-21 13:37:27		AITA for refusing to take cake from friend's birthday party?	"Last night I was at a gathering with friends that was a birthday party/cake making celebration for E's birthday. I almost didn't go‚Äì I'd had a bad day at work and the get together had been delayed by an hour and a half then suddenly rescheduled to the original time. People were supposed to carpool from my place but instead went straight to E's without telling me, which only further served to irritate me (these particular friends have a history of flakiness so I wasn't surprised as much as disappointed.)

Here is where I'm wondering if I'm TA. E and I used to date. It was a short-lived thing, about 2 months or so late last year, but all of our mutual friends know about it. E and I have since reconciled and are on friendly terms again, but we used to be the talking every day sort of best friends, and just Tuesday I texted them asking if we were on good terms and received ""Of course!"" as a response.

Well, I arrive at the party just as E is being goaded by E's best friend Jay into FacetTiming his new girlfriend. This comes as a shock to me for several reasons‚Äì a) we'd been talking semi regularly like we used to and he had never mentioned anyone (and for the record I'm very happy that he found someone!) but this was a big surprise to hear that they'd been together for \~3 months.

b) I had just (less than a month ago) road tripped back from California (2000 miles/ 30 hours) with Jay, and despite our jokes about when E and I were a couple Jay never mentioned that E was seeing someone new. Idk if it was his place to, but I feel like I could've been informed about this prior to last night.

Which brings me to the cake incident.

They baked a vegan cake. I am not a vegan. The cake looks pretty ugly but I ate 5 (large) bites of it to be a team player, and I'll be honest, vegan cake just isn't for me. 

Fast forward a few minutes and I'm put into a group chat between Jay and another mutual friend, where Jay texts us ""Will yall do me a favor and ask for a tupperware of this and just throw it away if you don‚Äôt want it, E's a lil hurt.""

Mutual friend refused because she'd been loudly voicing her dislike of vegan food all night & claims E would know that she was full of shit.

Jay then states that I will be taking one home. I refuse (I don't want to throw away food, didn't like the cake, and have plenty of better dessert at home), and Jay gets pissy at me.

My reasoning is where I'm wondering if I'm TA‚Äì they didn't spare my feelings and inform me about E's new girlfriend, so I think that I have no obligation to take some cake that I don't want and would've thrown away to spare E's feelings.

TL;DR‚Äì‚Äì Went to ex boyfriend's birthday party, was informed there that he is seeing someone new and feel like due to our friendship I was someone who should have been informed, refuse to take home vegan cake to spare Ex's feelings because he didn't spare mine.

I was in line at a grocery store, when I noticed a man waiting around the end of the check out lines. He was looking around observing folks, and was probably around my age; I'm 25.  
  
As I went to pay for my things, he approached my clerk and said he'd pay for my items. I firmly said ""No thank you."" I told him I know what he was doing, and that may be good and all for certain people, but I didn't need it in particular. I have a well-paying job and I work for my stuff. I assumed he was making one of those feel-good videos, and started looking around for a camera person.  
  
He said, ""Man, I'm just trying to pay it forward."" I repeated myself, ""No thank you."" Further explaining, that it's fine to do that, but I didn't need it. Everyone started looking at me like I was in the wrong. I just looked at the clerk and handed then my card.  
  
I kinda felt insulted, like, do I look like someone who needs help? I'm a person of color, but come on, you don't know me.
  
Personally, I just don't like hand outs for *myself when I don't need it*, especially from people I don't know and could be making some self-boasting video. I don't even like those kinds of videos, but I didn't explain all of that in the store, I'm there to buy groceries.

Once a week I drive to a neighbouring town to train with my sports team. This is quite a high priority to me at the moment as we have an upcoming tournament and I need to attend as much as possible. 


However my partner and son are flying in at the time I am required to be at training. When he booked these tickets he did not ask me, and has made the assumption that I will be there to collect them, however when I said that I wanted to be at training and that we could ask another family member to pick them up he has gotten upset, and doesn't understand why I can't just miss one training and he's disappointed with my priorities. 


I am genuinely torn about what I should do here. I have missed them and am excited to have them back, but I am also extremely nervous about my upcoming games and want to practice as much as possible. If there were no one else to pick them up then I certainly would, but luckily enough we have a family member than can. Please take into account that I do feel somewhat bitter that he's just made the assumption that I'd miss training and didn't consider asking me when booking the tickets. WIBTA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

Now she ‚Äúkinda likes him.‚Äù That on its own is problematic but at the moment it‚Äôs not what is hurting me. 


I‚Äôve always seen that romantic relationships and platonic relationships should have around that same amount of importance (in different ways). And obviously, she doesn‚Äôt think this way.

But it kinda hurt me last night. We‚Äôve had plans for 2 weeks, Im super depressed (it‚Äôs pretty bad) and honestly us hanging out for the first time in awhile  was one of the few things keeping me going. It‚Äôs dumb but we were gonna watch the Matrix outside late at night and we were gonna order pizza and it was going to be so fun. Anyways I texted her last night to remind her and she was like ‚Äúme and (him) are hanging out all day tomorrow.‚Äù And so I replied, being a bit upset and told her that we‚Äôve had these plans for weeks and I haven‚Äôt been able to see her in awhile.

I‚Äôm not mad, I‚Äôm just kinda hurt. I mean on Wednesday she had no problem with it. I blocked off tonight from my work schedule 2 weeks ago for this, and Friday nights are the busiest(I work at a bar/restaurant so that means hella $$$$ and I can‚Äôt work at ALL next week).

c3ai8x	2019-06-21 13:23:03		WIBTA if I attempted to only pre-order lunch for myself and not my SO for a group-outdoor-activity outing?	"This activity is associated with his social circle, not mine. I know only two of the people that are going, and not very well and I still don't feel comfortable around them yet. There is a facebook event detailing all the stuff we have to do. A few weeks after the event was created, we were mentioned in the group and asked if we were going. My SO said he didn't know and will check with his friend. Dawdled on that and turns out his friend put in the money for us (full disclosure, my SO doesn't know all the people going to this event). 

I feel kind of embarassed that someone had to pay for us. I tell my SO about emotional/social labor and use this as example. He's not confident in the theory but I try to point out another example or two over the coming weeks. 

Tomorrow is the event. There (weeks ago) had been a post on the facebook group about lunch, which I knew he was told about because I heard his friend disclosing that info to him as well. The friend was saying that it was probably way easier to get lunch based on the parameters of the day, then trying to bring our own. Well, today I messaged my SO while he's at work asking if we're squared away for lunch tomorrow. His response? ""Honestly I don't know I'm not very good at planning ahead"". Then two minutes later changing the subject.

I have half a mind to just order my own lunch and let him deal with the consequences of not having lunch to prove this emotional labor thing. I think it should be his responsibility since it's an event with HIS friends that I don't really know anyone. And for the record, I put in my fair share of other sorts of labor in the relationship."

c3ahlh	2019-06-21 13:21:20	givinger112	AITA for confessing flirting with my friends crush	"**Title is confusing, but let me explain...**

&#x200B;

I was into a girl months ago we were literally flirting. I was holding her hands excusing palmistry etc. she was asking me questions about my character in relationships... everyone was aware that we were loving each other childishly innocent. Unforunately I am very secret person so I dont like talking about my feelings even with my best friends...

&#x200B;

One day I learned my close friend likes my crush and he will be trying to flirt her from a social media platform (yeah snapchat) . I decided to make a sacrifice and say nothing about my emotions and let him try his chance. I would bury my emotions if his attempt got succesful.

meanwhile I stopped talking with her because I would be guilty to my friend because my intentions with her was romantic, she replied my friend friendly and I continued flirting her. while we were studying in the same library she gave me a poem with my name in it, and she told me that this is a message. We started messaging till mornings and she was into me and i was into her. I was sure *we were flirting.* she posted a picture of us on instagram etc.

&#x200B;

one day my friend called me and asked if i was flirting with her...(he saw us on instagram and outside at a restaurant)

&#x200B;

I owed truth to him and i was hoping to prevent him from trying to chat her ( he told me he would try again, after he got rejected friendly)  I told him :

>**Yes, We're Flirting**  
>  
>but, I am flirting her way before you tried to talk to her so dont get me wrong.

He said ok and he was sounding he accepted this situation.

&#x200B;

But he faced with girl and told her that she was seperating two friends and she gave him hope etc.

it was a mistake in every aspect because she had an important exam after that day and I havent confessed her yet. they fought furiously and meanwhile I was sleeping at home. 

&#x200B;

then she faced me with tears spilling from her cheers and she yelled me 

>**Are we Flirting????**

she was angry and she was thinking her name would be slut because she was seen, she gave hope to two best friends.

She said it would be different beetween us. she hates me. I disgust her. I should told this firstly her. I am pig etc.

&#x200B;

It was very heart breaking that i screwed everything and hearing those things from girl i like but, i told her that i love her and she is right. but i was right because we were flirting but i just didnt want to make her sad because she had exam after that day. so I embraced everything she said. my friend is asshole for doing this, but i forgived him but what about us?

Pardon my french i am not native speaker...

My friends told me i was right and she was exaggrating and denying, I am thinking i am not asshole but I am lifting weight of my friends mistake... AITA? and any suggestions what should i do next."	No A-holes here	0	0

She said this to my niece, who is 12, about my daughter, who is 9. My knee-jerk reaction is to confront her about this, however, I'm conflicted because my mil told me in confidence & I don't want to cause anymore stress in her life. My mil is not well, she is on dialysis 3 days a week & is already living in a stressful environment, I don't want to add to that, but she said this about my child & I am livid & want to confront her.

c3acq8	2019-06-21 13:08:21	GetPsycht	WIBTA for asking my friend to refund me for a concert ticket?	"So I have this friend (let's call him MK). About 4 weeks ago, MK decided he wants to go with me to see a particular band, so MK went ahead and bought us both tickets for the concert. Not wanting to be an asshole, I quickly paid MK for my ticket (about $150 total).

Fast forward to last night...MK comes over to my place to chill before we decide to go out for dinner. We head out to dinner and everything seems o.k...until the alcohol starts flowing. It's important to mention that I've struggled with drugs and alcohol-use problems in the past; but after a lot of hard work, I have managed to stay sober for the past 127 days. (It felt humbling and surreal to finally get my first 90-day sobriety chip). MK knows I don't drink or smoke anymore...but I'm also not the kinda guy to stop him from ordering a drink or two for himself. 

After drinking his second mixed drink, MK starts getting...bold. MK starts off innocently enough--taking about why he (MK) is the best friend I could ask for and how if I lost him as a friend, I should be devestated (but not the other way around) because MK has ""so many more good friends than you, OP."" Now, after his third drink, MK is getting a tad louder and angrier than usual. I have spent my fair share of time around the inebriated and learned it generally a good idea not to needlessly provoke them. So I just sit silently as he goes off ranting about everything: MK says I'm fat and mentally ill, MK thinks my parents are stupid for being religious (Christian), MK repeatedly makes fun of my brother (my brother left yesterday for a very long international program) and MK says he's ""glad [OP's bro] is gone...I'm better company for you anyways"". 

Soon, MK decides to shit-talk my sobriety. MK says I'm ""no fun"" and that he ""will change that."" He starts pressuring me to drink. When the server came around to check on us, MK started talking with the server about why I should order a few drinks and how I am ""too uptight."" The server asks if I want a drink and I say no.

At this point, I'm getting pissed and I want to leave. On the way home (we drove together) MK straight-up tells me ""I will get you to drink with me again...I just need to bully you harder"" and starts laughing. I tell him he's a mean drunk and then I get out of the car to go to my place.

I realized this morning that we have plans to go to this concert in 2 weeks. I really do not want to go...especially if it will put my sobriety at risk. I am currently debating asking MK to give me back my money for the ticket and telling him I do not want to go with him (i.e. MK will then have 2 tickets). Normally I wouldn't make a big deal over finances, but I'm a recent college graduate thinking of going back for grad school...and $150 is like the price of a (cheap) textbook.

She complains that it's wrong that I'm charging her more than my old roommates since they used to be 750 and that she's getting a girlfriend tax. I try to explain that it's because instead of having 2 roommates for 750 each I only have 1 now and that if we were both renting it wouldn't be an issue to split everything up.

While they would attend to question 2 together, without my involvement but based on the info I supplied them (as question 2 follows-on from Q1)   


***their side***: They feel I was lazy and was trying to avoid doing my share of the work. They expected me to complete my part in the form of PowerPoint slide, not a rough word document with quotes/sources.   


***my side:*** when delegating in person, I thought we agreed on this. They told me to email them my part and they will put it into cohesive group slideshow, I didn't realise they meant a PowerPoint slide. I thought the word document would suffice as it directly answers Q1 and it gives them a foundation to base their part on.   


We had a argument last night on whatsapp, so they complained about me to the course co-ordinator. we realised we weren't on the same page but instead of directly addressing it with me in person they complained about me behind my back. As a result, I was ejected from the group by the teacher and relegated to doing it another time.   


they presented together day and I think they used the references/sources I provided but they only addressed Q2.   


I think the language barrier was to blame and I'm angry they didn't have the decency and respect to try to resolve the issue with me in person"	No A-holes here	0	0
c3a4m7	2019-06-21 12:46:45	CamoFaSho	AITA for not caring about my dying mother?	"My parents got divorced when I was too young to remember and my dad won full custody of my older sister and I. So we lived with him on the West coast while my mom moved out to the South. Every year we'd fly out to her for our summer vacations. At around 12 years old, she vanishes. We can't get hold of her, nobody we contact can tell us, and she definitely doesn't reach out to us. I have 2 half sisters on her side, but they are too young (5-6years old) to reach out to for information. About 4 months later she reaches out to us, although I don't remember the details of why she disappeared, but then goes MIA again. This goes on for 2 years, just on-off again phone calls.

&#x200B;

Well when my older sister was 14, she was a terror to my father, and around this time...my mom is reachable again. I wasn't speaking to her but my dad was, and before I knew it, my sister was on a plane to live with our mom. I didn't speak to my sister much while she was with my mom, and never spoke to my mom during that time span either. My sister lived out there for about 2 years, and my dad brought her back. Oh the stories I've heard. Drugs, drugs, and more drugs. She'd shoot up or smoke something while my little sisters watched Disney movies, strip naked and chase a snake around the apartment. My mom even left my older sister alone with my 2 younger sisters for 2 weeks without food or money. Shit like that for 2 years.

&#x200B;

Well once my older sister got back, we lost contact with her again. About 6 years ago, so I start getting in contact with my 2 younger sisters now that they're older, but the contact is inconsistent. We would message each other every now and then and catch up, but nothing more. Then 2 years after I start reaching out to them, my mom calls and contacts me. I'm on my lunch break at work, so we talk for a bit, and I tell her we should talk the next day. I wake up the next morning to see a text from her, asking for money. I refuse, and she disappears again. I don't even care at this point.I keep in touch with my 2 younger sisters as the years go on, and they wound up having to kick our mom our of the house due to drugs. I met up with them last year, and last they heard, our mom was homeless around a gas station still using.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today, and I hear from my younger sisters that our mom is on life support at the hospital, and it doesn't look good. She'll need a new liver if she even starts improving. I feel nothing other than sadness for what my mothers life could have been without drugs, but it feels like a distant relative I've met 3 times before is passing away, not my mother. My older sister and 2 younger sisters feel the same. My brother in law said he thought my older sister and I should try to get out to see her before it's too late since she is still our mother, but I have 0 desire to go see her. It's so hard to put into words, I just, don't care.

c3a1jm	2019-06-21 12:37:52		AITA for making a joke about my GF's mum?	"My girlfriend comes from an asian background and so her mum is very traditional. My girlfriend lives with her parents (she's 20) and she is therefore expected to help around the house, fair enough. Except her mum YELLS all the time at the kids and if some sort of chore isn't done she'll get angry and yell at them to do it, that sort of thing.

My girlfriend and I were talking and the topic somehow changed to housework. My girlfriend joked about how I do absolutely nothing at home (I do the dishes and stuff like that here and there but there's not much to do because it's only my dad and me). I joked back about how she's just as lazy and she doesn't do chores out of wanting to do them but only because ""her mum runs the house on fear"". 

Girlfriend got really serious and annoyed, saying to never say something like that about her mum. At this point I just shut off because I thought it was a massive overreaction and I didn't really want to do with it. The thing is, my girlfriend CONSTANTLY comments on other people, she has even said stuff to me about my brothers girlfriend that I didn't think was too nice but I just took it as a joke. Also, her mum has said a few rude things to me (which I guess she didn't understand it was rude?) such as about how it's weird that my are parents divorced but still friends. 

For this reason I don't really think what I did was that big of a deal and kind of got pissed off that she was snappy about it

We lived together for a long time until she met someone, and moved in with them not long after meeting them. At the time, I was pissed about it but I realise that we all do things like that when we‚Äôre caught up in infatuation. 

Anyway, a few years ago K said she wanted to move out of the home she shared with M. She kept setting deadlines to do it, and was gonna move back in with me. She kept putting it off and making excuses. So she never did it. 

Now, I‚Äôve just spoken to her and she‚Äôs ready to move out, and has asked me if she can move in with me. To be honest, I‚Äôm really used to having my own space now; I‚Äôve been living alone for a good few years and sometimes I hate it but I‚Äôm used to it, now. I don‚Äôt know if I want anyone living with me. I don‚Äôt know if I have any real reason to not have someone live with me, I just don‚Äôt think I want it full time. Plus, I have a one bedroom flat which means K would have to have the living room as her bedroom, and I‚Äôd be stuck in my room all the time. 

On the other hand, it could be fun and we did have fun when we lived together. I just don‚Äôt know if I want to live with someone full time. 

K is asking me to make a decision, she wants to move out of home with M by the 5th August. K is a really good friend, but I don‚Äôt know if that means I should automatically say yes, if I don‚Äôt want to do it? She also has the choice of moving in with her father and step-mother, so I am not her only option.

c39ytb	2019-06-21 12:29:44	lud-umora-njama	WIBTA for telling my ex‚Äôs mom what he did?	"So my now ex BF (25) used to drag me (24) along for months: broke up, wanted to be back together, blocked me again and so on and so forth. All the while, his mother (who lives on another continent and can‚Äôt really assess the situation properly) noticed how stressed he was from this and demonized me for it.

A few weeks ago he broke up again - finally this time. Backstory: He had been another city for some months and was going to do an Erasmus in another country almost immediately after it. In the meantime, he stayed at my place for two weeks before he left. Ate my food etc. He asks me to visit him two weeks in. I did, but I noticed him being weird. A few days into my stay, he broke up with me despite it being great. I suffered a severe panic attack because I was trapped in this tiny room in a foreign country with someone who just broke my heart. He started talking down to me, that I‚Äôm overreacting. Started to film me in case smth happens so he as proof he is not responsible. That made it worse. He called his mother, then my mother. After almost hyperventilating, I calmed down completely exhausted. We talked a little and he said I should have seen it coming when he stayed at my place. He said I knew it the whole time. (Gaslighting me?) Anyways. He takes it back the next morning. Tells me how sorry he is and he doesn‚Äôt want to break up. Guys, I am now aware of how dumb I was, but of course I agreed.

One of the following mornings, he wants to have sex. When he finishes, he says he needs to go to the Uni and if I want to join. After a few min, he stops and starts yelling that he can‚Äôt do it and that he feels uncomfortable walking next to me. I start crying in the street. He gets angry about that. He says he‚Äôs stressed because his mom doesn‚Äôt approve of the relationship anymore because of all the drama. Wants me to apologize to her so we‚Äôre good. I leave a few days later and write her a really long email apologizing for everything. I‚Äôm not sure I my brain convinced itself that I owed her that, but it somehow did.

Fast forward: I have an accident. I call him days later telling him about it and saying I‚Äôm sad he doesn‚Äôt know that because of a lack of contact. He interrupts me mid-sentence and says he didn‚Äôt care to write me because he wants to break up. I asked why. He said he can‚Äôt say and that he would send me an email with explanation. Hung up and blocked me.

I‚Äôm having a hard time being the demon in her eyes and want to clear my name.
I want to write her everything. Prior to this happening, I‚Äôve had a very good relationship with her. He loved the fact that we talked a lot. And he brought her into this whole mess by calling her during the break up and by making me apologize to her.

My mum's taking me, although I didn't ask her to. We're leaving later today, and coming back late on Saturday. I have lots of work at the moment, and my only chance to do it is Sunday. Unfortunately, Sunday is when my mum wants me to help her clean the house.

I brought it up with her, and she started screaming at me for being selfish. She tried to demand I do all my work on the train, which I can't even do since some of it's online and I don't want to take my laptop and lug it round all day on Saturday. She called me selfish and immature, and said I was acting like a 5 year old.

 Eventually, she suggested I do some cleaning today instead, which I agreed to. I offered to clean both the bathrooms, since they're often messy, and I don't mind cleaning them. She told me to do the kitchen too. I don't like cleaning the kitchen. I've had to do it every day for the past 3 or 4 years, so I'm pretty sick of it. She never cleans it anymore. I offered to do a different room instead, and she started yelling at me again, and threatened to cancel my phone contract (she pays for it) and block it from the internet if I didn't clean the exact rooms she demanded. She also threatened to straight up turn the WiFi off so I wouldn't be able to work Sunday anyway.

"We've been together for almost 2 years now, we didn't have the best start to out relationship but for the past year we have been smooth sailing and we love each other so much. At the start of our relationship, he was very wary about committing to me and took him around 6 months of dating for him to actually call me his girlfriend. 

If I'm staying at his and he's going to work in the morning but I'm not, he always - ALWAYS - makes a point to open his laptop, clear his browsing history and then shut the laptop. I've bought it up to him before but he says its because he has a group chat with a bunch of his mates which he doesn't want me to see. Eh. I get that, I wouldn't be comfortable with him looking through my girls group chat. Anyway, today he went to work and I opened the laptop to do some work, but opened facebook for a break only to find that he was still logged on. No, I didn't instantly go through his messages, but I took this as a little chance to facebook stalk some people he was friends with who I wasn't (we all do this right..), but when I clicked the facebook search bar, it was filled with recent searches of beautiful girls - some who he used to work with and wasn't friends with, some he was friends with and had known for a while and one he had just started working with. I didn't click on any of the people, mostly because I knew he fancied them already, but then I did go through his browser history and saw he had been looking at numerous amounts of girls pages, literally going through every picture. I kept clicking on random links of one girl (there were over 100 of the same girl) and it was the messenger link to their chat, and I read it. Last week, he went on a business trip for one night and the time stamps for the messages to this girl were near midnight on the night of the trip. Weird. I checked our messages on my phone and he hadn't replied to my messaged to him on that day at all. Slightly annoying, but I carried on reading their conversation and it was sickeningly flirty - like cringe flirty. She lives in NZ where he lived for a while and he was basically begging her to come back cos he wants to meet up with her. 

&#x200B;

I didn't go through any more of his messages, just scrolled through the browser history and clicked on some of the girls links to their prolfies. Am I the asshole for going through it all? He makes a point to ensure that I don't but what I found is so frustrating and he shouldn't be hiding things from me or talking to other girls like that."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c39wrb	2019-06-21 12:23:23	alloutofcookies	AITA for not forcing my kid to share his toys and making everyone leave the park.	"Today I took my son(2.5y) to the park. Shortly after he woke up, he asked to go to the dirt park and play with his cars. There is a park near us that still has sand. He had the 2 cars he wanted and kept them in his hands all morning. After breakfast we got ready and walked over. 

Surprisingly there were other kids there. 
My son had no interest in the other kids and headed to the back to play with his cars. One kid came over and was just staring at him, I asked him if he wanted to share, he said ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù and continued playing. The kid was still standing there but eventually my son took his hand off one of the cars and the other kid grabbed it and started playing. My son didn‚Äôt say anything then she moved to another area of the playground and put the car down but up top. My son saw this ran up the stairs and grabbed it. The kid got a bit upset that it wasn‚Äôt where she left it, the mom distracted her for a bit but when my son returned to the back she came over the mom asked her to ask to play and so i asked him again to share, I said you guys can race. He said no thanks. I said sorry and explained he had been wanting to do this all morning. She explained to her daughter that sharing is hard to learn, said they had been there for awhile, and left. 
Another kid comes over, waits for an opportunity and grabs one of the cars, my son noticed but continues playing. Few min go by and the kid walks away with the car and is playing with it at another spot. It‚Äôs a table with a hole in the middle he drops it through the hole but can‚Äôt understand where it went, the mom tries to show the kid but he‚Äôs getting frustrated, the mom gives the kid the car back and he puts it through the hole. As the kid tries to look through the table, my kid gets up grabs it from underneath and runs away. The other kid didn‚Äôt even notice so I hear him getting upset that he can‚Äôt find it but I‚Äôve got to run after my kid who‚Äôs decided to run away from the park. 

I get him turned around and he sees the kid who‚Äôs been in the swing the whole time getting out and runs towards it asking to go on it. As the mom is taking the kid out she says oh he really wanted to play with the cars that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs getting out. I say oh I‚Äôm sorry, I haven‚Äôt been able to convince him to put the cars down today, he doesn‚Äôt even want to share with me. Her kid just starts yelling cars at my kid and my kid is asking to go on the swing. I tell my kid you can‚Äôt have everything, swing or the cars. He says cars but the other kid is so focused on the cars he doesn‚Äôt want the swing or anything else and throws a little fit that ended in a timeout. 

My kid comes up and says please daddy, I want to go swing. He‚Äôs got both hands up and just not paying any attention to the havoc we are causing. In my head I‚Äôm well, we‚Äôve come this far might as well. So I put him in the swing, the other kids are still crying as they get ready to leave my son looks at me and says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sad, I‚Äôm happy. Thank you daddy. ‚Äú"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Backstory: my wife and I have owned a dog for the entirety of our marriage (4 years) and for 3 1/2 years she has been asking to get another dog. She would tag me on Facebook, point out puppies, and generally find a way to bring it up at every opportunity. Last year, she got pregnant. We ended up moving when she was 8 months in and living in the new house with no furniture while we waited for it to be delivered she asked again. I felt guilty because of the living condition and said yes.

Before the baby was born everything was fine. Puppy gonna puppy.

After the baby has been born and we both have returned from work... I hate this dog.

The dog isnt bad. It's just a puppy. It pees in the house on occasion, it chews up every friggin thing it can (to include some irreplaceable sentimental items) and it jumps all over myself the baby and the wife. It needs constant attention and constant supervision. Which, so does our child.

I work 72 or more hours a week and when I'm home I want to relax a bit but this dog just swallows up all of my focus. 

My wife thinks it is terrible to consider rehoming the dog. She loves her and wants her to grow up with our daughter. But, frankly, I want to move out to get away from the dog.

we have been together for a year and she still lives with her ex friend in the apartment and even sleeps in the same bed.

Now I have told her to finally move out. Her arguments were that she earns so little money and, if she moves into her own apartment, does not have enough money to live on. I offered her to move in with me, which she skilfully ignored. She doesn't want a ""flat-sharing apartment"", because she pays a lot for little space, etc.

Now I've told her and the way it looks we break up, because I can't carry it anymore and she doesn't see why I think so.

c39hmo	2019-06-21 11:36:23		AITA for revealing the truth about my sisters hair-loss	"I'm scared about the result of this one, as i feel like i'm possibly a MAJOR asshole here even though i thought i was doing the right thing.

My sister (shes 34 now, married, 2 kids) used to be quite a trend jumper during her late teens and most of her 20s. She LOVED to dye her hair crazy colours all the time, she probably spent thousands of pounds getting her hair done, due to this and the fact that hairloss runs in the family anyway, mixed with drugs as well during her early 20s. Her hair started to fall out during her second pregnancy to which it all fell out when she had complications which caused a lot of stress for her (the baby was healthy, it all worked out ok in the end, nothing to worry about). 

My sister is a confident, pretty, independent woman, although this really did step into her confidence, she was wearing her bald head with pride as she felt wigs were ""***lies***"". (THIS IS IMPORTANT)

A year later, my sister started wearing wigs, we were all fine with it, she'd try different ones, fun ones, formal ones, most of them suited her really well. But i noticed she started wearing bandanas too. She gained quite a bit of following on social media.

As i was in my home town for a day to see my family, i saw a few of her friends that i used to know, i said hi to them, we all got talking, i told them what i do now etc... But then one of them asked how my sisters ""chemo"" was going. I was confused and said what do you mean? And she repeated if my sister has been dealing with the cancer ok and if her fundraising is doing ok?

I was very confused and wondered if she thought i was someone else, but it got me thinking more and more. I then saw another one of her friends who i was actually quite close with, she asked how my sisters cancer was going, to which i said she doesnt have cancer? She was shocked and told me that my sister has been saying shes got cancer and showed me this whole instagram profile my sister has made being a fight for cancer. 

I tried searching for it on my instagram but i couldn't see it, i then made a new account and saw it, she has blocked me and my family on it so we couldn't find it. On this instagram page, she makes posts with inspirational quotes and how much shes raising for it. Shes raised over ¬£800 as last seen on a post about 3 weeks ago. I wondered how my sister could pay for all these wigs as they're not cheap, and now i understand. 

I was LIVID and DISGUSTED at all of it. I couldn't believe she'd done this. I called her immediately and confronted her straight away about the instagram profile, hoping she'd explain or at least apologise. She just hung up on me and didn't answer any of my calls. I gave her a chance to explain, but she didn't, so i messaged the friends of hers that i knew she had told she had ""cancer"" to. To which a few of them made big facebook posts about it. My sister since deleted all her social medias. I have not heard anything since."		1	0
c39gzk	2019-06-21 11:34:14	postergirl666	AITA for refusing to take my posters down?	"My boyfriend of 2 years recently moved into my apartment. As long as we've known each other, my livingroom has been papered in fliers for punk shows that my bands played in the 90s and early 00s. I have a Real Job now (I did then too, but like at a coffee shop so I still had the luxury of looking like shit) so I don't dress weird or look particularly 'punk,' but a huge part of my history was playing music, touring, etc. and I'm extremely proud of it.

So, now that my boyfriend moved in, he apparently thinks we're going to take all of those fliers down. We'd never talked about it before, but he thinks it makes our livingroom look 'juvenile' because a lot of the band names are profane or the art is (mayor of the city we live in c. 1995) in a guillotine. He suggested I take them down and put them in the basement in my practice area, but no one would ever see them down there.

I understand that he's going to be paying half the rent, and I told him he can redecorate anything else, but this is important to me. He thinks that I'm not treating our apartment like it's his space too, but I don't think 'compromise' is for me to just do what he wants."	Asshole	0	0

c39gi7	2019-06-21 11:32:30	FabioAbdilla	AITA for how I dealt with this minor situation?	"I come to my workplace building like any other work day and sit at the side of the building near the basement. Basement is sometimes open for our handyman to get whatever he needs etc. And then I see two women walking up the street and start to peer into the basement. Keep in mind I have never seen them before. They peer inside and start to go down the steps. I get up, knowing that my boss would kill me if he found out I let some people tresspass.

And so I politely confront them and say they're not allowed in there because they don't have permission. We have a few seconds of getting lost in translation because we speak different languages, and also because these women didn't want to believe what I was saying, but they finally get it. The older woman, offended that I'm telling them they're not allowed in there says: ""Buy my husband has permission!"" She then calls her husband in the basement, the handyman and starts ranting about the employee who says she in actuality doesn't have permission to enter the basement. She rants a bit more, saying it's from someone who works at the building.

At this point I'm mortified, and I also have a lot of anxieties around people. So I apologise as much as I can and just enter the building for work, ignoring her continuing to rant to her husband. I never saw those women, never saw them again, did not know who they were, and never got confronted about any of it from the handyman. In my opinion the older one who took the lead acted a bit too entitled, got needlessly offended, and ranted more than necessary. Kind of like a Karen. Not exactly an asshole, but very terrifying to someone like me who hates any kind of trouble."	Asshole	0	0

c39b7v	2019-06-21 11:15:00		AITA for cutting off a friend?	"A few years ago, I became very good friends with a classmate (both of us M16 at the time). We chatted a lot and often, hanged out a lot, and had lots of fun. However, throughout the couple of years our good friendship lasted, I often felt like I was the one initiating stuff and putting most of the effort in. Immaturely, I tested this by not initiating conversations with him for a week, and albeit he did see something was wrong, he did not come to talk about it. I explained my frustrations and he was understanding, saying he would change.

&#x200B;

He did not change. One time he was supposed to come over, for which I decided not to see my father that weekend, and due to my father's work I would have seen him in a month (my parents are divorced, I lived with my mother and saw my father every other weekend). The day came, and I asked my friend in the morning which time he would show up at. To my surprise, he basically said that he did not feel like it and flaked. I explained to him that I had made arrangements with my father because of him coming over to no avail. I was quite upset about his choice.

&#x200B;

Another thing I did not like about him was that, in a group chat we had with some other friends, he constantly acted dumb and immature to me. I pointed this out and he (maybe rightly) got frustrated, so I decided to leave the group chat. Consequently, I decided to distance myself from the friend and let him try to initiate something. 

&#x200B;

Even though we were not that distant, we certainly were not close anymore. We talked and went out with a third guy every now and then, but that was all. He did invite me to his high school graduation, though, but I declined as I did not feel close enough to him and already had two graduations to attend. 

&#x200B;

Now I study abroad so I cannot really meet him other than during vacations, but around Christmas I chose not to. He wanted to go to a bar with the third friend, but I did not want to consume overpriced alcohol and suggested e.g. going to eat, to which he replied that there is (expensive and poor-quality) food at the bar. A couple of weeks later, on New Year's Eve, his girlfriend messaged me at 10pm to join her, the friend,  and another couple of mutual friends at the opposite side of the city, 45 minutes away by bus. I declined as I felt disrespected, and had no intentions of taking a bus through the city at night to hang out with them for an hour. 

&#x200B;

I have not seen the friend since last August, and I really do not mind it. I do feel regret about losing a friendship, and sometimes I wonder if I should have handled things much differently.

c39b29	2019-06-21 11:14:27		AITA for cheering myself up by remembering that I‚Äôm attractive?	"I have battled self esteem issues my whole life. When I was in my early 20s I decided to do something about it. I started grooming better, dressing better, eating better, and exercising. As a result, my appearance improved and I became comfortable with who I am. 

The thing about major depression and anxiety is that they try to challenge that. I like to describe these uninvited guests as, ‚ÄúWhen everything is great and you‚Äôre still not happy.‚Äù For instance, I can always count on my anxiety and stomach knots to wake me every morning.

Fast forward to last week. I‚Äôm a mental health nurse, and I worked a stretch of overnights (I rarely do this). The topic got on personal mental health and the question was posed: how do you cheer yourself up during our state‚Äôs especially long winters? I mentioned that I sometimes look in the mirror and feel better because my brain can convince me I‚Äôm worthless or hideous and shouldn‚Äôt get out of bed.

I went to work yesterday, and a support staff (CNA) coworker told me the overnight people are saying I‚Äôm self-centered because of the comment I made.

I was given my own TA (Trade Assistant) in the 2nd week and I'm feeling like there are some teething issues and I can't decide if I'm being unreasonable because he is a keen worker with good ethic.

&#x200B;

Basically, he's like a puppy dog. He is always there whenever the machine stops. There are lots of tasks that require only one person (me) to do. I understand my foreman has probably told him to make sure he's there for his tradesmen incase I ever need a hand. A lot of the time, I feel like I'm crowded, he's always watching me and makes an attempt to get involved with things that just don't need his involvement. Two people engaging in one activity can more often than not lead to it being slower than one person doing it.

&#x200B;

I have been told by my ex I can be quite moody and I make a conscious effort everyday to make sure that I'm consistent in my personality. I don't want to be happy one minute then snappy  the next. I feel like the best way for me to combat this is to talk about things the moment they enter my mind and not dwell on things. I don't want to depress my emotions any more. At the same time I don't want to be seen as an asshole because what I'm getting angry about with my TA are trivial, let's be honest. It could be much worse and I could have a TA that doesn't do anything. I've tried saying little things without being passive-aggressive and in a light-hearted tone, like, ‚ÄúYou're bored out of your mind, aren't you?‚Äù

&#x200B;

I just don't know how to approach the situation. It feels very awkward because he's such a nice guy who just wants to help out. Do I just carry on as usual and hope I adjust in a couple of weeks to his constant shadowing? Do I just be blunt with him and tell him that if I need his help, I'll come and get him? I'm still the new guy at my work, I don't want to poke the hornets nest already. Can other people understand where I'm coming from?

c398sw	2019-06-21 11:06:53		WIBTA if I were to leave an entire rotisserie chicken in my flatmate's room?	"So basically I'm in a flat with 5 other students, we are all 19. I have one flatmate who I actually get along pretty well with and I like him but there's this one really odd thing about him: he has this weird obsession with throwing raw pieces of chicken skin at the window. Yeah, that's right. 

Literally he'll be using chicken thighs or something and then once he's done *he will throw the leftover chicken skin at the window and it will stick there overnight*. I'll wake up in the morning and come through to the living room and there'll be 5 or 6 chicken skins just stuck to the window like one of those suction cup things you had as a kid.

I've told him on multiple occasions how fucking repulsive it is and how it's legitimately a biohazard but he just carries on doing it over, and over, and over, and over. So basically I had a plan where I was going to buy an entire rotisserie chicken from the supermarket and place it somewhere in his room where he'll never look and just let it rot as revenge for this whole chicken skin fiasco. I've pitched the idea to the rest of my flatmates and the response has been... mixed to say the least.

I figured I'd come on here as my judge and jury. Basically if I get mostly ESH or NTA I'll do it, if it's mostly YTA then I guess I won't. So what do you think Reddit, WIBTA?"	Asshole	1	0

c3964d	2019-06-21 10:58:25		AITA for distancing myself from my family member?	"So, for context, I am f22, Christian, and gay. My immediate family is made up of me, my brothers, my Mum, and my Godmother. I'll call her... G. She's been a really important person in my life and a good friend to me. She was an objective confidant and always had my back but also called me out if I needed it. Eccentric, always spoke her mind uncompromisingly, but I like that about her. 

Everyone in my family has been judgmental in the past about LGBT+ people, but G was the most objective. She leaves the judging to God. She was the first person I came out to. She told me didn‚Äôt care but if I was looking for someone to tell me whether it was right or wrong I should go to God and not her. I wasn‚Äôt looking for her blessing, I just needed someone to understand ‚Äì but she also talked a lot of bull about how I just hadn‚Äôt found the right man yet and I was being too close minded and I didn‚Äôt trust men but I was so needy I would settle for women. I think she just wanted the best for me, and I figured in time she‚Äôd see that I was happy and maybe accept it more.

Except then she seemed to bring it up all the time. She laughed about how she always asked her gay friends how they have sex. She thought it was funny to call my non-binary friend ‚Äúit‚Äù instead of ‚Äúthey‚Äù after I asked her not to. The last straw was when she argued that it was unfair to ban conversion therapy because it was taking away free speech. She said she had several friends who had chosen to go through it and who were now straight and happy, and by saying it was harmful and should be banned I was not only being judgmental of them but also condoning the violation of free speech, without which we would have no gay rights in the first place. This was all in front of my mother, whom she knew I was afraid to come out to because of her strict religious background.

Since then I‚Äôve been distancing myself from her; we exchange small talk but that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt hate her, I love her, I just need some space. She‚Äôs sent me long messages about how I judge anything that‚Äôs outside my worldview and make anyone who disagrees with me into an enemy, and that she loves me but I want to reject her so I‚Äôm using this as an excuse, and I‚Äôm upset because of my own issues but I‚Äôm taking it out on her, and if I walk away from her I should know that I‚Äôm walking away from the rest of my family as well. 

I‚Äôve since come out to my Mum, and she accepts me (yay!) but she thinks I‚Äôve misunderstood everything with G and that I‚Äôm tearing the family apart because I‚Äôm too over sensitive to handle someone with a different opinion. I don‚Äôt like the distance either, I feel like I‚Äôm mourning a really important relationship, but she won‚Äôt listen when I say it‚Äôs what I need right now. She‚Äôs tried every trick in the book to get me to go talk to her. Once she drove me to her house on an ‚Äúerrand‚Äù while I was visiting, and G came out and tried to keep me there and said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt run away like you always do.‚Äù I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy."

c3930m	2019-06-21 10:47:28		AITA for not going to any of my little nieces or nephews birthday parties?	"So I have been pretty vocal my entire life about not liking kids. It's just not my thing, but the girl I have been talking to for the better part of ten years finally came into my life in a way that we were able to have children. The pregnancy was totally unplanned but we did end up having a little girl and we do love her very much, despite me not particularly liking children.

Before I had my daughter, most of my family wanted nothing to do with me, I was invited to the odd family reunions here and there, but that was about it. But once my baby was born, I was getting invited to everything. Birthday parties, family reunions, cook outs, little family vacations. I'm pretty antisocial because I was always seen as the black sheep, I wasn't the criminal or anything, just didn't really want to do the traditional family things. So never getting invited to anything in the first place kind of made me retreat into my own little world.

But now that I have a kid, I'm suddenly interesting. People want to spend time with ""me"". But I don't go to these little kids birthday parties, especially if they're super young. My daughter is only 6 months old and both me and my wife are nearing our 30s oh, that would be nothing for any of us at one of these birthday parties. We don't like to socialize, our daughter is still a mobile, and I'm still afraid of her getting sick from all of these germy kids.

On Father's Day, during our most recent to get together with the family, my stepmother asked me why I wasn't attending any of the baby's birthday parties. I told her why, and that maybe in a year or two, we will start going. The baby was just too young right now to enjoy these parties. After about an hour or two at one of these parties, she would just get fussy, tired, or cranky and I didn't feel like dealing with that far from home. She didn't like that, she said you're going to have to start coming to these parties if you want anyone to show up at your baby's birthdays. Honestly, I see no point in having a birthday party for a one or two you're old. Presents are fine, but they're not going to remember any of that. In my opinion, those are mainly for the parents the show off their kids.

So I have to ask, AITA for not wanting to go to any small children's birthday parties?"	No A-holes here	1	0

She‚Äôs married and has three kids, two of whom will graduate high school in the next two years. About 5 years ago, we made an arrangement that she would rent a condo I own in an area with really good schools so that I could move further out of the city. I have rented it to her at cost the whole time. I‚Äôve never made a penny and she‚Äôs gotten super cheap rent, especially considering the area it‚Äôs in. When we originally made these arrangements, I told her that if she later wanted to buy it, I‚Äôd sell it to her for what I owed on the loan. At the time, the property value had dropped because of foreclosures in the area. In the past few years though, the value has skyrocketed due to demand for housing and a boom in population. 

But monetary gains are not why I‚Äôm asking this question. I‚Äôm in the middle of a divorce and I have two young kids. In order to keep my current residence, I need to sell the condo I‚Äôm renting to my friend. My dad has told me that he would help me out, down to buying my current house, renting it to me and then selling it back to me when I‚Äôm able. But I‚Äôm a grown ass woman and I don‚Äôt want to go that route unless it‚Äôs my only option. 

Also keep in mind that my friend has recently expressed interest in buying the condo, but she‚Äôs about to file for bankruptcy meaning I‚Äôd have to wait at least another two years to sell it to her. By then, I will have lost my own house. 

I‚Äôve been honest about the goings on, but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm about to be an asshole. I found a couple that wants to buy it from me as an investment property and keep renting it to my friend. Her rent would go up 100 a month, but it would still be cheaper than 90% of the rentals in the area. They would also be able to do things for my friend that I never could. Like replace the furnace. Meanwhile, I‚Äôd walk away with a decent amount of cash and the ability to keep my house and do it all on my own."		1	0

I did however bring up the first statement due to the severity and damaging consequences it could of had on my life.

My boyfriend and I religiously play black ops 4. My partner is more interested in zombies, and worked hard to complete Easter eggs and prestiged god knows how many times. He‚Äôs passionate about it, weird for some, sure, but it‚Äôs what he enjoys the most and everybody knows that. 

Our friend came over and we were all chatting when he said ‚ÄúDo you want to crack an egg over my head on the balcony?‚Äù And obviously, we jumped to the opportunity. 

The friend backed out of going on the balcony but instead, he said we could if we did it on our bed. So he ran to our bedroom and sat on the bed. I put the egg I had away as I didn‚Äôt really want the mess but my boyfriend didn‚Äôt care and after a little bit of hesitation, he cracked the egg on our friends head. 

I‚Äôd like to point out there was at no point where this friend seemed to second guess his decision, meaning he didn‚Äôt give us any sign that HE was joking about having the egg cracked on his head. 

He didn‚Äôt react for about 5 seconds whilst we were both laughing, but then he switched from my account on the PS4 to my partners and wiped his entire zombies account.  He left straight after. It was all so dramatic. 

Now I know this all sounds childish, and we‚Äôre adults, but does my boyfriend deserve to be upset? Would you be mad? He doesn‚Äôt want to play it anymore because he‚Äôs lost absolutely everything except his elixirs (which for those who aren‚Äôt familiar with any sort of gaming, it‚Äôs just these small perks you can use in game or collect).

"So an account on Instagram posted about a giveaway they're hosting for a certain phone by an Internet giant. My girlfriend is an avid photographer, but she has a crap phone and she definitely deserves a phone with a good camera. 

The conditions of the giveaway were that you were supposed to follow said account and comment why the person you tag deserves the phone. I wrote a whole ass paragraph about her love for photography. 

My only stipulations were that she can also post a comment tagging me, it wouldn't take much time or effort. I don't do a lot of photography, but I do take some occasionally. I have a new phone - but it's really cheap and the camera is not good. I sideloaded the google camera apk so the results look good. She said that I don't take photos anyway, and that I already have a new phone. She didn't comment. I asked her if she could, she's saying that nothings coming to her mind and that she can't write anything. 

Well, I guess that's true. I didn't say much, because I realize that this is such a small issue. A friend sent me that post asking me to tag him, and I asked him to tag me back. He didn't do it either. 

I don't understand why this is making me upset, it's such a trivial thing. My feed was suddenly flooded with pictures from that account so I unfollowed it fully knowing that it would void the giveaway. But now I feel asshole-ish."		1	0
c38wgd	2019-06-21 10:23:51		AITA for not forgiving a girl who badly wronged me (19m)	"I really don't know where else to post this. I'm kind of looking to see whether or not I should forgive this girl because it is preventing me from going to a lot of social gatherings with my friends as she is close to our group.

This girl, let's call her X, asked a while ago whether she could take my girlfriend out for dinner. I didn't outright say no but expressed apprehension to both X and my girlfriend because X has been a bit creepy and overly involved with our relationship in the past. X got really angry and weird, and then did it anyway.

A few days later, X kept badgering me about what she needed to wear to my dad's funeral (we were historically quite close). I told her formal, black, etc. and she said she didn't have any that looked nice. This pissed me off because it isn't about looking nice it's about paying respect.

My girlfriend then opened up about the dinner they went to. Turns out X had made up a pack of lies about me, that I had been sexually bragging, bitching about my girlfriend ... and worse X had convinced my girlfriend that it was true. This caused a massive argument for the two of us that lasted days.

Finally when all was resolved I confronted X about it, it got very heated, and I haven't talked to her since (I blocked her so idk if she's tried to message me). My girlfriend agreed to do the same.

Fast forward to now and it's starting to get in the way of doing things with my friends. As parties/gatherings now tend to involve larger or extended groups, she will always be there, so I'm starting to miss out due to trying to avoid her.

c38ugk	2019-06-21 10:16:19	Throwaway482959	AITA for saying yes to a guy asking me out but then ignore/avoid him ?	"It happened last year, I heard it is annoying when women don't outright refuse when a guy asked them out and then cancel it. I did something similar but to be fair he scared me...but I may have overreacted.



It was during a summer job. I was 20, this coworker was mid 30's.



I was going to work by public transport, 25 miles from my place. By car, it was a busy highway and took minimum one hour. I took a train, then a bus. Work was around 5 miles from the station.¬†


My last week there, my usual bus was canceled, which would make me have to take a train later, and my coworker offered to drop me off to the station. He lived in the area, and this would have been maybe a 5-10 minutes detour for him, but I did not think much of it, I thought it was a small favor. I was very grateful though and made sure he did not mind.¬†


On the ride there, as we were in the highway, he asked me out, which was instantly very awkward. Like, we are stuck in his car driving in the highway and he tells me ""I would like to take you out for a drink one day"". I am taken aback since I was not expecting it and, not thinking straight, just answer ""Yes, one day maybe, why not ?"". It was an awkward first response to avoid more awkwardness, but instantly regretted it, and started to wonder if there is a way to politely turn him down. I felt a bit sorry to mislead him.¬†



But then, he told me ""Hey, I can drive you directly home"".¬†



So, a ten minutes detour is one thing, but a TWO HOURS detour is something else. I declined, saying it was a long way, a very busy road, and a long detour for him. He insisted, saying he did not mind the long ride. He was driving and I felt completely stuck. There was nothing I could physically do to stop him and there was no way I could leave the situation. Maybe, probably, I was actually in no danger at all, but I totally lacked agency and it scared me.



I told him again that it would probably be faster by train anyway, because of trafic, but still, he insisted, until I told him that anyway, my mother would be waiting at me at the station to go shopping (a lie, but I was practically begging him at that point).¬†



I practically jumped out of his car once at the station, gave him a lukewarm thank. Next day, I ignored him. Said I had a lot of things to do, since it was my last day, told him I would speak to him later before I left to exchange contacts (he asked). We were sharing an open office. I went to say goodbye to everybody, and then, back to my office for a couple of last minute things. At that point, I would have been alone with him at the end of the day. So, when he absented himself a while...I basically bolted out. Grabbed my stuff, and left without so much of a goodbye.¬†



I wonder if I maybe overeacted, but the situation really did not sit well with me. Maybe he was just clueless. Still, the way he insisted on driving me home while I repeatedly refused really made my skin crawl, and I chosed to trust my instinct. So, AITA ?¬†"	No A-holes here	0	0

I'd taken the day off to do this today which worked well because I was out last night at a gig and had quite a few drinks. I was also planning on tidying the garden, going to the gym and getting a haircut.

I get a message from my sister 'hey we (partner and kids) can make it for lunch at 12 and we should go somewhere outside'. 

I said sorry I've got plans so we're going to stick to 2pm at the place we were planning to go (somewhere inside) but that you're welcome to come.

I then get a message saying how incredibly selfish I am, that if I ever have kids she will be unsympathetic to me, I'm a horrible uncle etc. 

I like spending time with my sister's family but today I just wanted to see my dad and gran today as they've both been unwell recently and i know if they came the kids would be screaming their heads off. We all go out for meals regularly and on this occasion I felt it was unfair that they demand to switch times and location.

c38mis	2019-06-21 09:47:43		AITA for being upset that a customer I personally knew didn‚Äôt tip me?	"I‚Äôm a pizza delivery driver and earlier today I ended up delivering 2 pizzas to the house of people I knew: 2 teenage girls who I helped train at the hospital we volunteer at (they just started and I‚Äôve been there a while). One of the girls is nice, but I got bad vibes from her friend the moment I met her. You‚Äôre not allowed to be on your phone in the halls when you‚Äôre volunteering, but that‚Äôs what she kept doing and loudly discussing her plans with her friend. I told her we‚Äôre not allowed to be on our phones anywhere except for the room we sit in when we‚Äôre waiting for calls to come in. She went on her phone anyway while I showed them around and explained to them how we deliver medications to different floors. Then, the two of them had a very loud conversation in the tiny room all the volunteers share as we all sat there annoyed doing quiet activities.

So it ended up being either her house or her friend‚Äôs. We were all really friendly to one another once we realized we knew each other (we had met for the first time 3 days ago). Here‚Äôs when the awkward situation began: the girl who uses her phone in the hospital hallways will be called Mary and her friend will be called Jane.

Mary: *in a really friendly tone* ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs $40!‚Äù

Their order was $30.21: this is important for later.

Jane: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a coincidence that you came here!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI know! That‚Äôs really funny.‚Äù

We exchanged some other small talk as I tried to figure out if they wanted change or not. Customers always tell me how much to keep so I didn‚Äôt know what to ask here and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm wondering if I was the asshole in this situation. Jane then thanked me in a tone that implied the conversation was over and I recognized that tone immediately so I thanked them and turned around to leave.

Mary then said ‚ÄúWait! I gave you $40‚Äù with such attitude that my stomach sank as I realized I fucked up by not asking if they wanted change.

Jane then awkwardly said to her ‚ÄúThe tip.‚Äù

I started stuttering and said in a lighthearted tone that they don‚Äôt have to tip delivery drivers (like it‚Äôs not a rule). I asked how much she wanted back and she said ‚ÄúI gave you $40.‚Äù I could tell she was pissed off. I gave her $10 despite the fact that their order cost $30.21. Not only did I not get a tip despite the fact that I drove my own car to their house , had to pay for my own gas, and add more to my high mileage, but they were short 21 cents (which isn‚Äôt a huge deal, but still).

I left and called my friend. I was humiliated and wanted to change the day I volunteer there so I wouldn‚Äôt have to see them again, but he convinced me not to. He said she should be embarrassed for not even giving me a $1 tip. She literally gave me a negative tip (-21 cents).

AITA for being pissed off about not being tipped? Did I mess up by not asking her immediately if she wanted change and instead thinking they wanted me to keep the money by judging their tones at the end of the conversation?"		1	0

The thing is, I'm currently in University and abroad. It's a 7-hour plane ride to get back home, where the wedding will be. During September... I won't be having any uni breaks which means I would have to skip a few classes and sacrifice some time from doing projects (I'm a design student) just to spend a 2 - 3 days back home and then get back immediately.

c38ivu	2019-06-21 09:35:06	oldladydilemma	AITA for snapping at my neighbor?	"There's an old lady living at the first floor of my building who's most likely got dementia or some other mental/paranoia issues. She terrorizes people by doing stuff like singing at the top of her lungs at 3 a.m., pouring water over the balcony without warning and insulting passers-by. Different tenants have called the police and social services, but for some reason that's beyond me, they can't put her in a home. Maybe it's because some of her family does visit and help her out a few times a week.

The other day I (16f) was coming up the stairs and just taking my earbuds out. Unfortunately that's why I didn't hear the door open as I passed by the old lady's apartment. Just as I did, she basically hollered and called me a filthy criminal. Note: she calls everyone holding any kind of electronic devices criminals, and I suspect the addition of filthy is a racial thing, because being mixed isn't a common thing here and she's called me racial and sexist slurs before. Just to clarify her ""reasoning"".

Well anyhow her screams made me jump out of my skin. When I can expect to get yelled at, I do my best to ignore her and pass by (she's not physically violent) but this time she literally ambushed me. I snapped and insulted her, calling her insane and throwing in some swears about her mother... She only yelled louder and started reciting the names of Nazi generals (yeah this is also occasionally her thing) so after awhile I left for my apartment.

I've been contemplating my actions since calming down. I literally never talked back to this lady, not even when she called me nasty names. The only reason I lashed out the last time was because she appeared out of nowhere to scare me. Oh, and by the way, I know she's got at least enough reason in her to know whom to target, because she never insults physically bigger male tenants or most adults - usually only teenagers and old people.

Given everything, do you think I'm the asshole for swearing at this lady? Cause when I told my parents, they said I should've bitten my tongue back and walked by, because whether she fully understands her surroundings or not she's definitely mentally challenged."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Companies and businesses must follow this strictly or could face penalties.

What the sender clearly didn't realise is that they had copied in everyone's emails instead of blind copying, therefore revealing over 300 personal email addresses including mine. I replied all to this pointing out that they had breached GDPR laws and suggesting in future they blind copy.

c38ejo	2019-06-21 09:19:11		AITA for wanting to know who my ex-wife is dating?	"Hey reddit, can you give me a sanity check? 

I'm a dad in the process of divorce. My ex and I have an almost two year old daughter together and share custody.  She watches my daughter during the say while I work as a component of our agreement.  

Ever since she got her own place,  I recognized a truck there pretty regularly, but not always. At one point I asked her and she implied it was the lower unit neighbor.  Fast forward and to spare a lot of needless details, I found out that the truck in fact belongs to her new boyfriend. 

I want to make it very clear that I am no longer emotionally invested in her and I don't give a crap who she dates, sleeps with, or what. I really don't. My only concern is who is around my daughter, especially since she's not old enough to articulate if someone is being mean to her or inappropriate with her. If it was not for the fact that this dude is there pretty commonly when I am dropping off or picking up my daughter, I wouldn't care. Since he is though, I wanted to know who he was.  

The conversation with my ex, to her credit, was relatively civil. She told me who he was after a bit of prodding but made it clear she felt I was overstepping and I should simply trust that she's making good choices in who she brings around. She also said that if they were living together, at that point she would have told me. My contention was that at the point either of us is exposing the child to a new SO, the other parent should at least get the courtesy of a name. It's my job as dad to protect my daughter and I wouldn't begrudge my ex for wanting to know if I was exposing her to a new woman. 

I suppose its important context to note that we have very different friend groups and she's aware that I am skeptical of her's for what I feel are valid reasons. She thinks I'm needlessly judgemental, but especially now that we're divorcing that topic doesn't come up anymore.  It may, however, be coloring this situation.

c38e53	2019-06-21 09:17:47	HowToDealWithDivorce	AITA if I force my father to pay too much alimony?	"Five years ago, my father caused a divorce in a terrible way. He was unhappy with his marriage, but didn't tell my mother so. He just cheated with an employee. The employee was invited to my mother's birthday. My mother caught my father embracing and kissing her in the kitchen. It seems he had been having inappropriate contact with her for months. 

A week later, he was living with her in a rented house. I didn't want to have contact with him for nearly a year. The divorce procedure took a very long time, and the negotiations were pretty hard. There were multiple situations where my father seemed to act harsh and unfair. 

Since the divorce, there have been periods where contact between me and my father has been relatively good. Last year, I had a pretty big conflict with him when he tried to lower alimony for a silly reason. I got angry at him and he didn't bring up alimony again. 

A couple of months ago, my mother got a better job. She earns a bit more now, but she definitely isn't rich. My dad does earn quite a lot. 

Last Sunday, I had planned a day trip for me and my father, for Father's Day. It's the first time since the divorce I had organized something like this for him. He was really excited and thanked me for it. During the day, he told me about all the expensive fun he has been having. He bought a new and expensive car, he has already enjoyed two holidays to exotic foreign locations this year and is planning a third in a couple of months, and he's thinking about buying a second house in a beautiful and expensive area. I was glad that he was enjoying life. 

Literally less than 24 hours later, on Monday, he sent a message to my mom that he wants to lower her alimony because she earns more with a new job, and that she should hand over information about her new salary. In the same message, he said that he regrets the fact that this can't be discussed casually and amicably while seated at the kitchen table. 

At first, my mother claimed that the divorce agreement contained a clause that allowed her to earn more without having to worry about alimony getting lowered. I've inspected the agreement, and it doesn't look like that's true. 

Legally, it seems he's right. But on a moral, personal and emotional level, I'm so sick and tired of it. It has been five years now and it seems like the drama never ends. I don't want to be forced to be my mother's lawyer, and I cannot have fun with my father while he's threatening to take my mother to court. And when I think about the divorce, I think about the way he caused it, with the cheating and inviting her to my mother's birthday. That's just so morally wrong that I don't ever want to be reminded of it. And fighting about alimony does remind me of it, strongly. 

Am I the asshole if I tell my father that he should keep paying the full alimony without drama if he wants to keep seeing me?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c38bwu	2019-06-21 09:09:19	LumpyGenitals	AITA for telling children to stop playing on a memorial?	"Hey guys, this happened yesterday and I've just been mulling it over in my mind.

For the last 3 weeks I've been travelling through Europe, currently in London. I live in Canada, so I thought I'd go see the Canada Memorial by Buckingham Palace on the way over to my next stop. 

So I get there, and there's about 5 kids playing on it. Running on it, throwing leaves, spraying each other with the water, etc. Their mom was sitting on one of the steps on her phone (tuned out). I was really pissed, and in the heat of the moment, I told them that they can't be playing on it. Didn't yell, just told them. The one older kid said sorry, and that was it. They kept playing on it. Mom didn't even look up. I walked away embarrassed. 

My moral quandry is that I don't think that was my place to say that, it's the moms. They're also just kids, they don't know any better. I still feel like if I didn't tell them, no one would've. 

So...AITA?

Edit: Not that I want any attention on this, but just for clarity's sake. There was a sign right in front of the memorial stating to not play or stand on it. It's not very noticeable though (off to the side, kind of small).

"Last Saturday a close friend‚Äôs brother was turning 18 and we planned to take him to a local club to celebrate. I invited my best friend (S from now on) to come with us. For reference I am 20, S is 19, my close friend is 20 and my other friend is 21.

When I invited S I made it very clear that while my friend who is 21 may buy me a drink or two that he would not be comfortable buying them for her or anyone else as he really is only acquaintances with them. I also informed her that we may need a second driver because of the amount of people coming. She acknowledged all of this and stated she was very excited for our night out.

Come to the day of and everyone is discussing plans, it was asked if she would be okay with driving since she owns an SUV and can fit more people in her car. Her response was ‚ÄúUgh fine I guess. I‚Äôm not staying with you if I don‚Äôt drink though.‚Äù Which honestly hurt my feelings as I didn‚Äôt invite her so she could drink. I invited her to enjoy a night out together.

1. I'm from Venezuela so English is my second language and I might make some grammar mistakes.

3. I live with my family (mother, sister, cousin and partner) in a three story house with plenty of space and historically we all provide from our wages to keep things running

I'll give a bit of background and will try to make it short. It all started with the 2017 constituent assembly election, I lost my job as consequence of not wanting to participate out of principle (won't get on politics here). Because of that I had to find means to survive in an increasingly hostile economic environment and keep providing to the household.

I'm good with computers and editing software (aufition, premier, photoshop) and almost immediately started reaching into those markets, my partner is a voice talent and locally is a really underpaid job, but internationally is a decent income. I figured that if we combined our talents we could make something out of it and I started focusing on that particular area. 

At first, as with everything, things were slow and the rest of people in the house started to see me as a lazy ass who did nothing while in reality I was reaching for clients and preparing the ground for a two person recording studio (this being explained several times). 

Things became really hostile against me and my partner and after two months they cut us off of the grocerys, they won't let us eat the food that was bought, use the detergents to wash our clothes, etc. Things got hard, we were only eating bread most of the time I went from 147 pounds to 110, but we endured.

At the end all the effort and suffering payed off, everything is better now we have several clients and have a constant and healthy influx of work. Now we're our respective home's economic muscle and we're heavily working on moving out.

Now I don't stop myself from buying me and my girlfriend the things we need or want and when family finances are brought up I make it clear to the rest that as long as we can afford it we will get it as some sort of get back for the lack of faith. I can see that those comments are causing some sting eyes and I've been told that my attitude is offensive and that's the source of my dilemma.

Him and I met back in September and had falling out in late October. 

I'm in a rough place mentally and he's aware of it. On this particular day I told him that *""I'm not good company""* which is a code for *""I feel like shit so maybe we should reschedule""*. He didn't mind and I was like fuck it, lets hang.

We were having a pleasant time for like two hours up until he decided to give me advice about University we attend (as he is two years above me). It started with him making few assumptions about me and I was trying to explain that he got it wrong as in - you can't give me advice that don't apply to my situation so let me explain and you can give me advice that actually can help. He got more mad the more I interrupted. I got more irritated with every wrong assumption, his derogatory tone and overall acting as if he knows how my mind works better than I do.

It ended up with full on yelling at me while I tried to hold back tears. He told me *""My job is to yell at people""* and that I can leave any time. Yes, I did end up crying and went home.

Few hours later I sent him a message telling him he crossed the line and that I don't want to talk about details, just don't want to be friends.

His response came few days later and was mocking me in a way. He accused me of not wanting to talk it out because then I would need to admit I was wrong, that I was insulting him, his career and it's stupid because I don't have one, that I'm blaming him for my bad mood instead of my poor mental health, that my triggers are over exaggerated as if I was a victim of XYZ crime and that my message was for sole purpose of guilt tripping him.

I was dumbfound. In my eyes I didn't want to talk about it because he was yelling at me after we had multiple conversations about how my ex husband was emotionally and verbally abusive, he knew that, obviously didn't find it important so why repeat it? My ""insults"" were jokes. Same as he sends ""meirl"" memes. His career is being a cop. I don't remember insulting *his* career but I may have talked about cops in a bad light, still... I was pretty sure he knew I wasn't talking about *all cops* rather just experience with some that are a disgrace to their calling. He also, after I proudly said my brother finished his degree in Sociology, had a mini rant about how Sociology isn't a real science and it shouldn't even exist because it's pointless. I disagreed and let him rant it out. My mental health is a problem, I hate how it affects me and I did warn him on that particular day I'm not a good company. 

I apologised for my stupid jokes, for insulting his career and for getting triggered to the point of not being comfortable with talking to him anymore. He didn't apologise to me.

They're all smaller than me .We all stay at grandma's house for summer , which is a society. We all play together with other kids who are also small(around 9 years old).Now I am an animal lover. And there's this family of cats which are fed by a woman because of which they are somewhat friendly with humans. I observed them and decided to try and be their friend. So I sat some feet away from them to make them accustomed to my presence. But my cousins and all the other kids ran towards me and the cats , who backed away. Even worse, my sister traumatized them by making really loud noise. I left the cats  as I didn't want to distress them . The next day I again wanted to go to the cats and hence told the others that I'm not playing. Just as I had earned the kittens trust , all of the kids ran and scared them. I got really annoyed as this had happened for the 4th time . I told my sister to stop following me all the time and get a life  . I really don't think I'm the asshole here.

What's your opinion?

c385km	2019-06-21 08:45:28		AITA for asking my mom to cut ties with her side of the family over me?	"A little background: I‚Äôm an Indian female in my mid 20s born and raised in Canada. 

I sent my now ex boyfriend a sexually explicit snaps with my face, and since breaking up he posted them to different porn sites. I wasn‚Äôt aware of this until my cousins (my moms‚Äô nieces) told my mom, to which my mom then told me. By the time the video was taken down, it had already been on the porn site for a month with 25k views.

My mom and I found out through another relative that my cousins aka my moms nieces knew about this video since Mother‚Äôs Day of this year which is around the time the video was initially posted. But they made no effort to have it removed and didn‚Äôt inform me about this until this past Sunday, which was coincidentally fathers‚Äô day. 

My cousins mom (my aunt and my moms sister in law) had every incentive to hurt me because a couple years ago, my cousin and I had a falling out because my cousin asked me wshy our moms hated each other, to which I said ‚Äúbecause your mom had a habit of sticking her nose in our family affiars.‚Äù But this was only the half truth. The real reason my mom hates her sister in laws guts is because she cheated on her husband, got caught and my uncle (aka my moms brother aka my cousins dad) killed himself because of this. We know this is true because we saw videos of my aunt walking in and out of hotels with random men at night (and much more) while my uncle was still alive.

It‚Äôs been almost 7 years since my uncle took his life. And my mom only tolerated my aunt because of her nieces. She loves them a lot and feels a lot of sympathy for them because their dad is no longer with them. My cousins are 27, 24, and 18. 

Here‚Äôs the thing. I know that my cousins had vindictive motives because they didn‚Äôt get the video taken down or inform me that my naked face and body is plastered on a porn site for a month. They were also born and raised in Canada and understand how the internet works. The longer something sits on the internet, the more views and attention it gets.

I feel so hurt and have cut these people out of my life. But am I the asshole to expect and ask my mom to do the same? My mom is still emotionally attached to my cousins because she feels bad their father is no longer with them. But am I the asshole to expect and ask my mom to also cut ties with my cousins?"		1	0

c384ix	2019-06-21 08:41:22		WIBTA if i leave my 16 year old daughet behind whils the rest of us go on holiday?	"I have a 16-year-old daughter who recently went to the doctors complaining that she got headaches every day. the doctor ordered an MRI scan for her which she will be taking later today. the problem is we live on a small island in norway where the waiting list for the results is 5weeks. the doctor has said she can't leave the country until the scan has been seen by a specialist. the problem is we are supposed to be leaving for America in 10 days and there's a good chance the results won't be in by then.  seeing as the doctor has put on her on a travel ban, if something was to happen whilst on holiday in America our travel insurance won't pay for it. so WIBTA if I left her behind if the results don't come in on time and we all just leave without her? my husband wants her to stay with his parents whilst we are gone but they are old and don't really handle her very well (she has Tourettes and Aspergers) the other thing is that her birthday was supposed to be while we are in America so she will basically be celebrating by herself. am I being unfair?

&#x200B;

(edit) my daughter herself told me she wanted us all to go and leave her behind and we thought at 16 soon 17 she would be able to cope. i realise she was probably just saying that to make us feel better. like i said in the comments, the trip will either be rescheduled/cancelled or one of us stay behind until we are sure she is 100% healthy. we will just get back on insurance and go when everything is smoothed out.

&#x200B;

(edit 2) the mri is just to rule out tumors and that kind of thing. the doctor says he only put her on a travel ban because he will lose his job if something happens and she wasn't given an MRI. she has only been having headaches and no other symptoms apart from feeling a bit sick. she most likely has inherited my migraines."

c382dw	2019-06-21 08:32:45	LIsForLeaveMeAlone	WIBTA if I didn't visit my mother in the hospital?	"Throwaway because yikes.

My mother (55F) and I (22F) have a turbulent past. Ever since she had her first stroke a couple of years ago, her personality has become abusive. 

Prior to that, though, she was an amazing mother to me who supported me through really hard times, both emotionally and financially. She was reasonable and had a level head. I respected and loved her.

She has continued to support me financially, but constantly holds it against me as a means of control. When I finally moved out, she demanded I pay her $300 for all expenses she continued to pay including car insurance, phone bill, and stuff like that. I agreed but told her I was finding my own plan/insurance which she did not like. She has constantly been bombarding me with messages saying I could never achieve a future without her help and such. I told her I was no longer going to speak with her and I meant it. I didn't respond to her messages or phone calls.

Fast forward to today, I received a phone call from my grandmother saying my mom is in the hospital suffering a massive stroke. Out of panic, I came to visit and my mom looked terrible. My heart hurt for her and I cried the entire time. 

We waited hours in ER hoping to get a room but finally my grandmother and uncle left, saying for me to text them her room number because they expected me to stay the night with her.

I guess my question is, would I be the asshole if I said I didn't want to visit her? I only came out of panic because I thought I was going to lose her because I still love her, but I can't start being around her negativity again."	Asshole	0	0
c38189	2019-06-21 08:28:04	GroundbreakingJelly3	WIBTA if I break the deal I made with my wife that she gets to name our male children, because she wants to name our son Lannister of the GoT Lannisters?	"When we got married, my wife and I made a deal that she gets to name our male children while I get to name the females. Our first child is a girl and I named her. Our second child is a boy, so my wife should be the one to name him. However, when she told me that she wanted to name our son Lannister after her favorite Game of Thrones family, I put my foot down.

I'd have no problem if she wanted to name our dog Lannister, but this is our son. I asked her if she really wanted him to be named after a family of villains, but she just reminded me of our deal. She said she liked the Lannisters and it was her turn to name our child, so he would be named Lannister. We've had this conversation countless times and she refuses to budge.

The birth will be a C-section and I'm seriously considering filling in the paper work myself while she's still out. I know this might sound unfair to my wife given our deal, but wouldn't it be more unfair to my son if he was named after a family of power grabbing incestuous wine guzzling villains?

Edit: She does not want a middle name. She wants his name to be just Lannister Ourlastname.

Edit 2: The Lannister motto is 'Hear me roar'. The line 'A Lannister always pays his debts' is just a common saying.

Edit 3: No, our daughter's name is not Daenerys. It's Margaery.

I kid, it's Margaret.

Edit 4: To those who are saying they have to know if my son will be named Lannister. He is due to be born in September. I will try to post an update then."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c37zej	2019-06-21 08:20:18	mintegrals	AITA for refusing to sleep with my sick girlfriend?	"I (22F) have lived with my girlfriend (23F) for about a year now, and we've shared a bed that entire time. She's talked before about how it's hard for her to sleep without me cuddling her now, but usually in a jokey romantic context.

She's been really sick this whole week, so I took her to Urgent Care today, and she was diagnosed with pneumonia. They put her on strong antibiotics, so I assume they verified it was caused by a bacterial infection.

That's the backstory. Just now, we finished up playing video games and went to get ready for bed, and I told her that I was gonna sleep on the couch for one night, to give the antibiotics time to work, just to be safe.

She immediately started acting like I'd just shot her dog. She said ""so I guess I'll just stay up and play more games then"" and when I said she needed sleep because she's sick, she responded ""well I actually can't fall asleep when you're not there so it's pointless to try."" And then went into the room with her computer and shut the door. 

I tried to come in and say I'd just suck it up and sleep with her, but she said ""Nope. You've made your choice."" And grabbed my pillow and went and threw it on the couch. 

So, she's obviously really upset with me. My guess is that she's hurt that I'm not being there to care for her and cuddle, but I think my concerns are completely legitimate, seeing as I have extraneous expenses she doesn't have (like a car), and I actually cannot afford to miss work if I get sick. I feel like she's being unreasonable by holding the ""I can't sleep without you"" thing over my head. Am I just being an insensitive asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Here are a couple key bits of info that are relevant to the story. 1) I have really bad social anxiety and sensory sensitivity stuff. Flashing lights and crowds of  people or people being aggressive triggers panic attacks for me. Basically really bad anxiety if you don‚Äôt know what those are. 2) my mom is aware of my anxiety but I don‚Äôt talk about it to her because we don‚Äôt have a good relationship. 3) our hotel rooms and the elevator require a key card to use. Ok, onto the story

My mother, brother, and I were going out to eat dinner. Brother and I had both been feeling really sick most of the day and stayed in but our mom made us go out to eat dinner with her. I hooked in my earbuds to help tune out the noise of the city at night (helps with my anxiety) I got the usual ‚Äúyou never talk to me! Take those out‚Äù from my mom. Luckily for her my earbuds died (they‚Äôre wireless) and I said a couple words before she and my brother started looking for the restaurant we were supposed to eat at. It was around then I really started noticing the people moving and shoving and all the lights flashing. I started feeling panicky but we were about to eat dinner so I pushed it down. The doorman said we couldn‚Äôt go in because my brother was wearing flip flops. At that point I zoned out because people were getting to be a lot and I walked over into this one shop that didn‚Äôt have many people so I could look around and take my mind off things. When I looked around to rejoin the group I saw my mom and she was letting my brother go back to the room. I asked if I could go with him and she pressured me to stay with her even though I said I really wasn‚Äôt feeling good and wanted to go back. She dragged me around with a lot of people pushing around and she was raising her voice because I wasn‚Äôt being ‚Äúgood‚Äù I guess? She kept just asking me where I wanted to eat and I was shutting down so I said this place we‚Äôd gone to a couple days ago. I asked for a drink and she said no which is fair but then I asked to go back to the hotel because she knew what I was ordering. She flipped out and said she wouldn‚Äôt be able to get back and that she had to walk me back. Her aggression combined with the people and the lights pushed me over the edge and when she turned around I walked away. When I got back to the hotel room I got to lay down for ten minutes until she got back from getting food. When she got back she said ‚ÄúI really shouldn‚Äôt of gotten you anything but here‚Äù and threw a sandwich at me. I noticed she made sure to get my brother who also left a soda and desert. She just left to get a drink because I guess I‚Äôm such a problem child that she needs alcohol to cope.

c37xsy	2019-06-21 08:14:15	SoloKip	AITA for refusing to visit my friend in Qatar, insulting the country and by proxy one of his best friends who lives there.	"So a group of friends and I were debating where we want to go on holiday. One of my friends has been posted in Qatar for work and really wanted us to come and visit him there. Even offering money for flights and a place to crash. 

After some beating around the bush, I told him I would never visit such a shit hole country which could not only imprison or execute me for who I love but has a virulently homophobic stance on most issues. Furthermore, the general human rights abuses and modern day slavery* issues are the final nail in the coffin. Doubly so for a holiday where I am meant to be enjoying myself. 

Turns out that one of his best friends is now a rich Qatari. Whilst my friend is ""unsure"" how his friend feels about homosexuality, he admits that his friend does have a bunch of house slaves. He insisted that his Qatari friend is still a nice guy citing him giving him Arabic lessons, helping him out with police issues and showing him all around the country. They even share tips on what condom brand to purchase. 

I responded by saying that though his Qatari friend is a shitty person, I wouldn't expect much more given the circumstances that he was brought up in. What I meant was that people are very much a product of their environment, so if you grow up under state-sanctioned slavery is it a surprise that you would hold such a shitty opinion. But I accept that might not have been clear. 

My friend got upset hearing this saying that I hadn't even met the guy and barely knew anything about him. He told me that it was possible for me to visit countries and ""refrain from fucking or discussing his sex life"" like he does. I dislike upsetting people so I let it slide there but our conversations have been a little frosty since. 

Am I the asshole here?

c37xgn	2019-06-21 08:13:02	raspberrykiss12	AITA for blocking my mom out of my life for making sexual comments to the guy I‚Äôm dating and potentially causing us to break up?	"To preface this, I am 20, my boyfriend is 21, and my mother is 53. 

My mother has always been one to seek validation from others. She‚Äôll bring up pictures of her female classmates and ask me or my dad or my 24 year old sister how old they look or she‚Äôll compare herself to her sister (my aunt) and get my dad to say that my mom is prettier and skinnier than her sister. When pretty actresses are on tv she‚Äôll make comments to my dad like ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your woman. She‚Äôs a redhead. You can go ahead and leave me for her‚Äù and such. I‚Äôm sure you get the idea. 

I (barely) tolerated her desperation for approval and validation up until Sunday when she did something awful. 

I am in college and met a great guy friend early last year when we were taking a few classes together. His dad owns a limousine company in my area for special events (weddings, prom, birthdays etc) but his dad was sick so he allowed my boyfriend, his son, to use the limousine to take us to the airport. My sister is in the military and is coming home for the first time in several months so we wanted to surprise her by picking her up in a limousine since she‚Äôs always wanted to ride in one but has never gotten the chance to do so.

I asked everyone to please be nice to him because he and I had a few classes together and we are friendly. I didn‚Äôt mention that he and I have started dating. I didn‚Äôt want to tell them about us dating because I didn‚Äôt want anyone making jokes or teasing us about it. He and I are seemingly very compatible and I wanted to get him comfortable with my family if it ever gets serious. We have only been dating around 7 months and date each other exclusively. We are boyfriend and girlfriend.

We (myself, my parents, my 21 year old brother, and boyfriend) leave and everything is fine for a few minutes until my mom starts making awful sex jokes. I can‚Äôt even remember them all, but I do recall her saying something to him about paying ‚Äúanother way‚Äù and implied sex and blow jobs. She started talking about how her kneecaps are red (she got them from getting on them and cleaning the house) and she said she was going to do it again tonight for my dad when we got home. Even my brother (who is the SAME AGE as my boyfriend) and dad were not feeling it after a while. I apologized to my boyfriend and asked my mom to stop. She didn‚Äôt. If you thought it stopped when we picked my sister up, you‚Äôd be wrong.

After we got back home, I refused to get out and asked him to take me to my apartment. I was **SO** embarrassed and my boyfriend was visibly uncomfortable. I have since blocked my mom‚Äôs phone number and got my sister to bring the spare key I had given my parents so they no longer have access to my apartment. My sister comes here to visit with me because I can‚Äôt stand to be around my mother. I have apologized so much to my boyfriend for my family and he told me that he‚Äôs sorry, but he isn‚Äôt sure if the relationship will go further and needs time to think.

"Due to a change of work, I'll now be working from home and won't be able to park my car in front of my house anymore (parking is reserved for clients throughout the day) In my area, it takes (not exaggerating) an INCREDIBLE amount of luck to find parking after 5PM. I didn't use to have to experience this often because I got to park in front of my house, but I know my tenant who gets home around 11PM after work does not physically get into the house until 11:30 - 12:30 AM on most nights. 

&#x200B;

I told her in a nonchalant way that I won't be able to pick her up often after work on the weekdays anymore and she called me selfish and said I prioritized a parking spot above her. Looking at it from my angle, it seems like she's more of the selfish one than me because the only way I can make it work is if:  


1) I give up the parking for my cilents in the day time

2) I wake up early to find parking (not really possible, as I am a night owl and don't hit the sack until 5-6AM and during the day, I have employees taking care of the business-side) 

3) Spend an additional 30 minutes - 1 hour and a half every night looking for parking. Maybe I need to look at it from another angle but in addition to a waste of time, I also have to shell out for my 6-10mpg in the city car looking for this parking when she can easily call an UBER and be home in 10 - 15 minutes tops.

He‚Äôs a medical student, I‚Äôm a social work student and our approaches to arguments differ in that he is more logical/reasoning-based whereas I am more emotional/intrinsically-motivated. Tonight I confided in him about an insecurity of our relationship. I mentioned a previous disagreement where I had playfully drawn his attention to my unshaven arms (was trying it out although I typically shave) and he made a negative comment about how I‚Äôm neglecting my physical appearance now that we are in a more committed relationship. I was hurt at the time but shrugged it off. Tonight, however, I decided to discuss the intricacies of my feelings‚Äîspecifically how I felt unnerved/insecure about maintaining external semblances to make him happy. I said that if I woke up in the morning with an itch to shave my head he would not support me and my decisions over my body. His response was that he fell in love with this version of me‚Äîfull head of hair, externally groomed‚Äîand that he asks me first what I prefer in regards to his ball hair lol (EDIT: I have no preference‚Äîalthough this is grounded in personal indifference).

Three weeks later he finds it on FB Marketplace, knows it's his because it has a distinct scratch mark on the back or formatted it as it was still on the same lock screen. Saw a chance to get it back so he had me message them and arrange a collection somewhere local.

On the day we pick up it's by the shops, he's sat on a bench with my mate's bag that obviously has the laptop in it. While he's talking to me my mate comes up from behind and grabs the bag, begins to walk off - thief tries to get up until I push back against him to sit him back down and tell him we know where he got it and he'd best stay where he was unless he didn't mind getting bummed in prison. He was quite scared of me when he realised what was happening, looked like he was barely out of school/college so maybe not even 18. 

Anyway, got home and when we opened the bag we've found that the idiot left some personal belongings in it, their wallet, a phone and some keys. We actually have their address now because of it and my mate and I have been debating over what to do with the things.

He is a good kid most of the time and clearly doesn't have any trouble learning how things work but he throws tantrums quite a lot when things aren't going how he wants it to go. His parents gives him whatever he wants in order to make him stop and it bothers me by how easy they give in and not give him any discipline for what he does. His father tells my cousin to get him to stop, doesn't matter how she does it just as long as he stops. Those are literally his words.

Today I went to the amusement park with some relatives, including Little Cousin, everything was going fine until he wasn't allowed to go on a ride, he cried and ran acroos the whole park, someone ran after him but as soon as he caught him, Little Cousin grabbed and threw his Iphone 9 on the ground, severely cracking the screen.

The person just walked away, obviously angry about his phone because Little Cousin knows what he did as he tends to aim for phones on purpose. I've seen it happen many times and he broke *way too many phones and devices.* My cousin got angry but she didn't do much and joked about it. Now I normally wouldn't say anything because its not my business but the whole thing just made me angry about his actions.

Me: I don't like it when he gets like that.

C: I know but what can I say? Anger runs in the family

Me: . . .If I'm gonna be honest, I feel like if your family didn't spoil him as much, I feel like he would behave better than he does right now.

C: Yeah well he's deaf.

Me: But he's turning 7 soon. I feel like he would know to control himself a bit more than he does now even *if* hes deaf.

C: All deaf kids are like this when they're young though because they can't hear.

Me: But wouldn't he know by now though? 

C: Well my mom didn't put him in deaf school until he turned four.

It was just going back and forth the whole time so I just gave up on it and continued on with my day. My auntie later came up to me.

Auntie: What have to been saying about my baby?

Me: What? Oh, I-

A: He makes mistakes. He is a kid.

I didn't reply because I felt like she would just get more angry, not to mention that I was scared of my Uncle.

A: Don't say those things anymore.


She scolded me and let me go after ten minutes and then I walked off angry because they wouldn't give me a chance to explain myself. My cousin's family was angry at me and acted like I did something wrong, though I soon apologized because I felt guilty for talking about someones disability. He is the only deaf kid I know so I don't know if his behaviour is normal or not but I still think that him being deaf isn't the problem here.

AITA?

Edit: I forgot to add these points: 

¬∑I think he knows what he is doing but doesn't see it as wrong as it actually is since his parents doesn't really interfere unless it's actually hurting somebody, my main problem is his parents.

¬∑Like I said, he is a nice kid but he knows that the tantrums get his parents to do what he wants.

¬∑By ""spoiling"" I meant the fact that they have an easy way of calming him down by buying him either a new toy or game.

¬∑*I have a sister in special needs who is now 18 but her mental age is years younger* I know that the parenting is different. 

¬∑The father doesn't help as much and leaves the responsibilty to the mom.

¬∑By ""doesn't matter how, just as long as he stops"", they went through my stuff and violated my privacy while I slept just so they can give him my switch.

¬∑I live with them so I know what's going on behind doors.

¬∑I babysit as a job. I know that kids are difficult but they are even worse when they aren't disciplined."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c37p98	2019-06-21 07:42:15		AITA for calling someone out on what I believed to be a lie?	"A coworker Jason (M25) and I (F24) made plans to grab drinks after our shift. We‚Äôve hung out a few times prior and everything went well.  

After work I went to the grocery store directly across the street from (this is relevant I promise) and called my mom to talk about the usual antics at work. About 15 minutes into our conversation I clearly see the rest of the staff  get in their cars and leave from work (including Jason‚Äôs car). 

I finish my conversation with my mom and end up going to Taco Bell as well as doing some grocery shopping at Walmart. I text Jason and said ‚ÄúHey what time were you thinking about hanging out? It‚Äôs getting late and I have to work a double tomorrow‚Äù 

He replies ‚ÄúGo ahead and go home get some sleep‚Äù  I jokingly said ‚ÄúLol yeah yeah it‚Äôs cool I didn‚Äôt want to hang out with you anyways‚Äù. He apologized and said ‚ÄúYeah I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd be leaving this late but it won‚Äôt happen again‚Äù. 

This is where I confronted him and said ‚ÄúYeah loI homie I saw you leave work about 30mins ago sooo no lying.‚Äù He responded with ‚ÄúYou saw me leave? Haha. Oookay.‚Äù 

I told him the truth (that I was sitting in the parking lot and I saw his car leave with the rest of staff). I also told him that when I drove past the parking garage (about 20mins later on my way home) that his car wasn‚Äôt there. He replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not about to do this with you.  I don‚Äôt even have to explain anything to you since you have all the answers. Alright.‚Äù 

Looking for some clarity here. AITA for accusing Jason of lying when I saw his car leave nearly an hour before he told me he was just leaving and cancelled our plans? If I am TA, how should I handle this situation differently in the future?"		1	0

Me=Me
OF=Old Friend
HM=Her Mom
HF=Her Friend 
MD=My Date

Ok, Backstory
I‚Äòm a young male, I don‚Äôt wish to disclose age. I met this girl in my health class and immediately hit it off. She was laughing, I was laughing, all was well. Or was it?

Eventually we started texting and calling, basically everyday for months. HM, who regularly snooped in her phone, noticed this. From OF‚Äòs story, HM hated me. I did nothing.

OF‚Äòs Mother wanted me dead. She made this very clear when I was around her. Glaring at me and indirectly insulting me and my instrument as OF and i were in a jazz band together. But of course this didn‚Äôt stop OF having a crush on me and me having a crush on her.

Onto the story:

Eventually I asked OF to the dance, and she said yes. We then talked through the night about it. First mistake. HM snooped through her phone the next day, found the texts and banned her from texting me for a month. 

During this month I talked to her at school and we were both understandably angry at HM. My second mistake pertaining to my relationship with her. Playing Sims 4 with OF. HM learned of this and thought it was porn. I was pissed at HM, so was OF. 

A week later because of snow, the dance was canceled. My relationship with OF starts to fail. This is where it gets bad.

The next week I meet her in the library and tell her I no longer had a wanted to date her.  I was fed up with  OF and HMs antics. All was fine and we stopped talking for a while as post break ups are. But we stayed as friends, only after the entire thing did I learn she was never over it. 

About 3 weeks later I met MD, and man it‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve felt in the past 7 months. She made he me happy, unlike OF who made me unhappy. This is where HF is introduced. She pretends to be my friend, only to betray me and insult me and MD after she learns of MD.

I understandably angry, message OF and HF explaining my point of view and how I felt. Turns out, OF gas told HF to do all of what she did, befriending me and then betraying me.

After a massive argument and me stating i didn‚Äôt want to be friends, she broke the news. She made it so a lot  of my ""friends‚Äú, unfriended me, after being lied to by OF.

She was controlling, obsessive and overall a terrible person. Something is wrong with her. because of OF,  MD broke up with me, a lot of my friends left me and I became an outcast in my grade level.

c37nqn	2019-06-21 07:36:38	tubofcloroxwipes	AITA for continuing to message with someone I'm attracted to when he has a girlfriend?	"Guilt about this has been keeping me up at night for the past few months and then I recently discovered AITA so here we go:

&#x200B;

I met this guy a little under a year ago, at which point he was single. But I didn't know him well and he wasn't my type so I wasn't attracted (I'm an opposites attract kind of person and we were both extroverts). Surprisingly, over the first few months, I got to know him and got curious about him because we were TOO similar - same thoughts on things, same personality type, same love languages, and too many random coincidences. I guess I started wondering ""oh wow, is this what it's like to meet a soulmate?"" Totally corny, I know. Right when I realized I was interested, I found out that he had just started dating someone a few months prior (basically a month after when I first met him). Timing's shit, but it is what it is so I took a step back and tried to keep my distance. But right about then, he started messaging me casually. Nothing inappropriate, just friend stuff - random questions or confirming group plans... sometime over text, sometime over Messenger, sometime over DM.. it started because we had similar interests, hobbies, and social circles and mind you, I rarely initiated. He's a nice friendly guy who liked to keep me in the loop so he would reach out. But I've come to realize that we've talked at least once every week for the past half year since then. Unfortunately, because of that constant communication, I couldn't execute the whole 'out of mind out of sight' strategy and my interest continued to grow. Keeping in touch every week is normal for how I communicate with girlfriends, but I'm normally terrible and unresponsive over text to guy friends. Obviously he is a special case. That damning evidence, in combination with imagining how I would feel if I found out that a girl that was interested in my boyfriend was texting with him every week.. it's been building my guilt. I've talked to a few friends, and they've looked over some of our threads. Some have pointed out that I've done nothing wrong, that our conversations were very appropriate and casual, and others have suggested that if I feel guilty, I could phase out and be curt or stop responding to him whenever he reaches out. The problem is, I don't want to stop responding to him, and I've begun wanting to kinda reach out to him first sometimes - even if it's as friends. Honestly, I know I don't want to stop and I want to continue communicating with him because I like him. But even if our conversations are not inappropriate, how I'm feeling definitely is. Am I an asshole for wanting to keep this up?

c37ni1	2019-06-21 07:35:51	pepperandpicklerats	AITA for getting mad at my friend for making jokes about my stutter?	"(First time poster on this sub)

So this happened a few days ago and I basically have a speech problem, a stutter to be exact. It's quite bad and I sometimes pull these faces when i'm trying to speak.

So I was sitting with my friend (lets call him L). I was trying to tell a joke when those weird faces came out. Keep in mind he's normally very patient and I get it was probably a joke but it really set me off, and he completley mimicked my voice and that (and the face). I screamed at him fairly loud, I cant exactly remember what I said but this was kinda it:

""You know I find it hard, and I dont see why you would make that comment, I seriously thought you were kinder than that L!""

My stutter has been a constant struggle for me and I get very down about it. But when someone I know and trust makes a comment like that, it really irks me.

c37mwg	2019-06-21 07:33:50		AITA for wanting to know more about his work?	"My bf and I recently became long distance, and before that we were at college. At college, since we were together a lot, and because there was so much that we could do, I felt that we could talk or hang out for hours without running out of things to say. 

&#x200B;

However, ever since we graduated, I am unable to speak easily with him as our interests are so different. I would like to ask questions about his job, but every time I ask something, he says it is confidential to the company...which is fine but it hurts a little bit when he says its confidential, who would I tell?? Feels as though he does not trust me.  It also ends up causing the conversation to cease, to which I ask him to bring up other things about his life or ask me questions which also leads nowhere. I just feel like it will be hard to be part of his life, when I do not almost anything about the majority of his day...

&#x200B;

When I asked my friend, she says its understandable because he could risk being fired. But how can he even be fired if I do not tell anyone? I just want to be able to talk to him about his life, and get to know more about what he does, and I have a hard time coming up with other questions as we lead such different lives.

I confirmed both location and time (3pm) the night before because next morning I was planning to check out some place and I knew he wasn't waking up before me.

So before I left I confirmed the location again, (but not time because I already knew and confirmed last night).

So as I left, checked the place I wanted to visit this morning and rushed to the train station, according to Google maps I was going to be around 15 min late so I took a snap and said sorry.

Around half way till destination I received a snap saying they're meeting some where near the place we were staying at 3pm.

c37ka2	2019-06-21 07:23:50	fiedelcatstro	AITA for thinking my roommate is not taking good care of our pet?	"Together with my housemate, after good consultation, we decided to take a kitten six months ago. This was a dream we had for some time, but we didn't have a suitable house for it first. We were moving to a bigger house and thought it was a good time to get a kitten. 

 The cat we chose was found on the street in Romania. She had no parents and only a brother. Her brother died of flu. We chose her because she has a great personality. She is very people-oriented. She always wants to play or hug people. 

My roommate indicated to be home a lot. She also has a boyfriend, he is doing an internship at a company in our area. She said that's why it would all be perfect.  I also do an internship five days a week from February to July, so I have indicated in advance that I cannot be there during the day. Fortunately, my boyfriend is often at my place with the kitten.  

In the beginning, everything went well, but after a while, my roommate was increasingly away from home. Of the 7 days a week she is now 3 (sometimes 4 days) here. The other days she's gone. Three months ago I mentioned that I thought this was a shame. We chose to take a cat together so I think it's normal that you just spend a lot of time at home. It is a responsibility that you have. Her boyfriend is never with us and she doesn't ask him to do this either. 

Yesterday I had another conversation with her, because it started to irritate me a lot.  Her opinion is that she is home enough and thinks a cat can be alone a lot (she says the cat sleeps all day so why bother). I have indicated that I think that if you choose to take a pet, you just have to be home for more than three days. She does not agree with this and neither does her boyfriend. 

Now no solution has been found and I am still faced with the same problem. I indicated that if I had known in advance that she would handle it this way, I would not have taken a cat with her. I love this cat and I would never get rid of her. I am very attached to the animal and it is really like my child. 

I would like your opinion on this subject.

Important: it was early in the morning (around 3am) hence why I was really tired and fell asleep almost immediately after posting it and forgetting to give credits. A couple days later the original creator of it goes all out on me for stealing her art and how what I did was ‚Äúheartbreaking‚Äù and that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúscumbag‚Äù for stealing it. This was followed up with a post on r/tameimpala of her own which screenshotted my post and stated how it was her art. Some commenter called me a ‚Äúthief fuck trumpet‚Äù which honestly I found more funny than insulting. This extended on to the artists Instagram story where she showed how I was ‚Äústealing‚Äù her art (‚Äúfuck you for stealing my artwork‚Äù) etc. In my opinion she‚Äôs just overreacting to something which could easily been solved and talked out in a calm and collective order especially since I had no malicious intent on ‚Äústealing‚Äù for any kinds of personal benefits. It was a simple accident caused by fatigue. I replied to her saying I was sorry and had no malicious intent behind this and explained why it happened in the way I did here.		1	0

So then he started saying I should do it again, and I denied his request for a few days, then when he gave me back his computer, turns out he just wanted a different operating system, but he never told me that.

So I did, changed it and gave it back then he asked me:
- How much do I owe you?
- 20 bucks
He asked why and I replied ""cause I charge 10 bucks per check"" specially cause he didn't like the work I did.

At the end of that my grandparents, gave me a lecture of how I'd never charge a family member for a favor, cause he went and told them that, without trying to talk it out.

So Reddit AITA?
This is my first time here and even unsure if the post should even be here, sorry in advance.

For context: My dad died when I was 4 and I had no male influence/role-model for my entire upbringing.

This might sound like a silly post, but its an ongoing issue. Last night it ending in me saying that i dont want to fight for his attention anymore and then trying to sleep even though i was feeling very sad.

Like a lot of people we mess around on our phones before we go to sleep, and the majority of nights i will put mine down first. i will ask him for a hug (im not expecting him to put his phone away for the night, just a minute or 2 to say goodnight and for a little bit of affection) and the response is always 'in a minute' or 'this is my time for reading, you know that' or something along those lines. 

Last night he was on his phone and giving me one of those one armed/my head on his chest hugs and i asked him for 'both arms' as the glare from the phone was a bit much and to be honest i just needed it to be me and him for a moment. i got told that it was his time for reading and that he is fed up of repeating himself, which is what then led to my negative reaction about not wanting to fight for his attention.

So I get called into my boss' office about this, and he started telling me that the way I ate was inhuman.

‚ÄúMark‚Äù and I both started our new job a year ago around the same time. As time went on we got closer and became loose friends, as you do. We still don‚Äôt see each-other outside of work, mainly because Mark is busy with children, but we do talk about our personal lives a fair bit at work. Over the last year I‚Äôve lost a fair amount of respect for Mark, I‚Äôve caught him out lying a few times, and he can be downright nasty to, and behind colleagues backs. Hence I have been trying to distance myself whilst remaining friendly and professional. 

Mark lives with his mum, girlfriend and two kids age 8 and 10. They recently all moved into a two bedroom house so Mark, his partner and the kids all sleep in a small room together. They‚Äôve been trying to save up forever (hard on one income) to move out, but since they got crammed into one room its become more urgent. 

Recently they saved up enough money and found a place they like, but needed to put down three references. So Mark asked me to be a personal reference for his application and I declined telling him I didn‚Äôt think I was a good choice because I only knew him through work. Mark has also asked our boss, who he is close with, to be a reference.

I know Mark is in debt, and struggles with money. He also has a dog and the listing on this house says no pets. He has said nothing about if he plans on rehoming (another subject in itself) or smuggling the dog in. Technically I had nothing to lose by being a reference but I hate lying and it makes me feel sick inside. 

I‚Äôm now worried that both Mark and my boss will think ITA for declining, and that it will be my fault if he misses out on this house.

Im a 21 year old Brasilian and I have been the boyfriend of a 20yo brasilian woman for about 2 months now, we used to have an active sex life and in general a open view on most aspects of life. About 3 weeks ago she started studying different religions to try and find her ""spiritual calling"" and I was supporting her like a good boyfriend should and yesterday she finally found her calling, she decided to convert to Sunni Islam and was all pumped up by it while I was confused, I questioned her on why convert to Islam and she told me that she agreed with everything she read about it, them I asked about Ramadan and she told me she couldnt wait to try it for herself and them she started becoming really conservative in topics about the ""modern vestiments of woman"" and how she never liked ""western culture"".

I was really confused, like I was talking to someone I didnt knew simply because it was the first time ever she spoke about any of this in such extreme way. When I met her she described herself as a liberal agnostic, but suddenly after a 3 week religious discovery she became a conservative muslim woman. Them she explained to me that islamic relationships work differently from ""western standards"" and that we werent supposed to touch each other no more, that touching is reserve for after the marriage.

At first I thought it was a joke, but she got offended by my initial reaction and I explained to her that Im a 21 year old man and I wasant going to let go of my sex life for years until we married (neither that I was ready to marry or wanted to marry someone I knew for a few months), she got even more offended saying that I dont respect her choice and that she never complained about my atheism. I told her that I was respecting her choice by breaking up with her since she would be better of dating someone that follows her religion and is ready to make those sacrifices. Her friends called me an asshole for hurting her feelings (since becoming a muslim was making she really happy and I was supposed to support it and be there with her during this important part of her life).

My boyfriend and I are long distance so we text alot and call not so often. Not long ago he told me how upset he was that his friend had played ahead in a game they were playing together or somthing. I dont play games so I didnt think it was a big deal but to him it is. Okay yeah its crappy. But I was pretty mad(I didnt day anything because I don't know if Im in the wrong for being mad or being the crazy girlfriend type sk I'm staying quiet while I gather my thoughts) my reasons for being mad are my boyfriend and I havent called in 2 months or so and from my understanding he skyped/ called  his friend to play this game every day or at least almost every day to play. I'm salty about that yeah but also because he never finishes anything with me. My Netflix account is filled shows that he wanted to start watching and got really excited to watch then he lost interest. Same with movies and books so I'm left to finish them on my own. It's to the point that I just refuse to start anything together with him because he cant follow through and finish it! So am I an asshole for being mad that my boyfirend can find the dedicated to play something with a friend every day but not to finish a book for even a normal length movie with me? To add I dont think I'm a bad movie watcher, I dont talk too much, not glued to my phone,not picky. He just wont ever finish one with me and honestly its disheartening and makes me feel bad almost. Thanks for tour opinion on the situation!"		1	0
c37ahb	2019-06-21 06:50:22	ladyphantomofmusic	AITA ~ My arm isn't a pin cushion, or is it?	"This is my first story on Reddit,but not my first time posting I had a comment sorta suggesting I post here, feel free to share this on YouTube. If so please link it so I can see.

Backstory, I have hard to find veins. When I was 9, I ended up with a bone infection, and was given medication through an IV in my hand. Well, the IV slipped out of the vein. I had to get a new IV in and it took 7 tries to find a vein that worked in the crook of my elbow. I eventually got an broviac (Internal IV), but needed blood tests weekly for months. I had more issues, so repeat. This went on from when I was in grade 5, until I was in grade 7, this meant I'm used to needles and know golden spot for a vein.

Fast forward to a few years ago when I was early 30's. Because of my hard to find veins, I was given a picc line in my upper arm (pronounced pick, its like a broviac, meant to last longer then an IV, but not as long as the broviac's I had as a child), this is the second one I had gotten within a months time.

Anyway, I was grateful that I didn't have to deal with needles too much as the picc line allowed daily blood tests and IV antibiotics. That is until one day I was told a MRI was requested, I was already getting daily x-rays at this point too for my lungs. This kind of MRI needed to use a dye. Then the nurse looked at my picc line and announced it wasn't' the right kind, I needed an IV. So another nurse came, they tried to find a vein. Remember when I said I had hard to find veins, where my golden spot for a vein is? I mentioned they use the crook of my elbow, because its always a go on the first try. They didn't try, said it wouldn't do. They kept trying in different spots, even hitting to get the veins to work (its something that needs to be done, it hurt but I knew why they did it). Eventually they said they would need to get an Anesthesiologist (for those that don't know, those that put you to sleep for operations if I got the words right) to find a vein. This was in the middle of the day.

When he eventually showed up hours later, like late at night hours later, with a small ultra sound machine, he looked for a vein, I suggested he try my golden IV spot, and sure enough it worked. So eventually I was able to go and get the MRI, and guess what, the picc line was the right one and would have worked, but they used the IV line as I had it now. By the time I got back to my room it was around 11 pm, I mentioned what the MRI person had said about the picc line being the right one, and asked that the IV line in the crook of my elbow be taken out, and I was told no, incase I needed an IV again the next day. I explained even if I need another IV apart from my Picc line, in the same spot, I was fine with it. Again, no. I tried to sleep it hurt with the IV there. It finally took 2 hours of me arguing with the night nurses, trying to convince them to take it out before they actually did.

I did apologize after."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c379ia	2019-06-21 06:46:45	blue_rainshoes	WIBTA if I bought earplugs for myself and my domestic helper so that we won't be awakened by my grandfather at night?	"The situation is that I'm living with my parents and disabled grandfather, as well as a live in domestic helper whom we hired mostly to take care of my grandfather, who needs assistance walking, eating, sitting up, showering, etc. It's a pretty demanding job. My parents also help with this but they work, so it's mostly her doing stuff for him.

The trouble is that my grandfather is a huge huge arsehole. His wife (my grandma) used to take care of him (also with domestic help) but he was so verbally abusive, unhelpful and generally inconsiderate and demanding that they gave up on him and that's why my mom took him in. (He used to be physically abusive to his wife when he was still able to walk, that's how bad it was).

Anyway, he's been living with us for 5 years now. In that time 2 domestic helpers quit on us because they're running on very little sleep every night, because my grandfather keeps demanding their attention all night with minor stuff (to adjust his pillow, check the time(???)) and also frequently pretending to be sick because he's afraid of the dark (really I'm not joking). He also likes to clear his throat VERY LOUDLY and do what I call a yawn-shout (it's also VERY LOUD). 

When he's actually sick he's also unnecessarily a dickhead by continuing to call even after we've done everything we can: demanding more meds when we've already given them, etc. Before you say he's legitimately in pain or whatever, I've had a talk with him about this and he expressed a view along the lines of ""I'm entitled to domestic helper's attention any time of the day 24/7 as often as I like and I don't care if she gets to sleep"" like wtf. He really doesn't care about anyone else. In fact I fucked up one of my A level final exam papers because I got zero sleep the night before because of his shenanigans. 

My parents say ""oh it's fine you're moving to uni soon just close the door and you can't hear him"" which works for their room and not mine bc I share a wall with him, and also the domestic helper. So my solution is to get myself earmuffs and also a pair for her if they work so we can get some sleep. 

The part where I may be an arsehole if my grandfather is really actually sick in the middle of the night and no one hears him. I think we're entitled to sleep though. What do you guys think?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c377gy	2019-06-21 06:40:12	RKO-Cutter	WIBTA for being the 'bad guy' and pushing for my wife to lose weight?	"My wife and I have been married for about 4 months now, but dating for about 6 years before that. At the time we were both much thinner. While I've hit a general point where I've evened out and just have it as a natural weight now, she continues to slowly gain weight. I want to make it clear I love her and find her beautiful and tell her that every day, but she's the one unhappy about her appearance. Every so often she tells me ""you need to stop letting me eat so-and-so"" or ""you need to help me start exercising again,"" and I think of it as a simple ""okay, we're going to help each other, that's great!"" but when the time comes to tell her not to eat so-and-so or to tell her we should go for a jog or something she gets defensive and accuses me of shaming her. I put my hands up, apologize, move on and we're good until a couple weeks later and she once again is on the ""You really need to stop me from eating like this.""

&#x200B;

So part of me is thinking ""well next time I'll just do it and power through it and make her follow through, she'll be mad but it's what she wants."" but obviously I'm conflicted because it's basically resigning myself to the fact that she's going to get her feelings hurt by it. I also want to make clear I'd never say anything derogatory, never call her fat or anything.  Just remind her this is what she wants me to do so I'm going to do it this time. I've tried what I can to help her be happy in the body she's in but she rejects that.

 It hasn‚Äôt been easy, we‚Äôve had our fair share of arguments, tears, and make ups. Recently we‚Äôve experienced our worst issue yet that in truth involved both us and our families.  After the issue she decided she wanted some space to which I responded: okay, take what you need.

Today is our first day back together in person after about a 10 day break. We started rough but managed to resolve the prior issues. 

It was then that we were laying in bed watching videos on her phone. She happened to receive a Snapchat from a friend which she opened. After having opened it I noticed she had been talking with (for 5 consecutive days) her ex. I was completely confused, taken aback, and hurt. 

She responded that It shouldn‚Äôt be a problem, that I‚Äôm overreacting, overthinking, and more. 

I completely understand that she has every right to speak to him and to whoever she wants, but I find it so extremely hurtful that she engaged in conversation with him and maintained it during our break and now. She told me she even planned on deleting the messages so I wouldn‚Äôt see them.

I work away from home and am gone for 3 weeks at a time, the girl whom i‚Äôve been seeing was really into me, it was a nice feeling having someone to talk to everyday. The first couple weeks was good, when i was home on my turn around we went to the beach, got some drinks, and watched the sunset it was perfect. We hung out for the entire week i was gone.

I told her that I haven‚Äôt been in a relationship in years and don‚Äôt know if i was ready yet (my ex really fucked me up mentally through abuse and what not) she was that was ok and that love comes with time.

When i got home the second time she needed a place to stay so she stayed with me, I wasn‚Äôt charging her anything, it was just the kind thing to do when someone was in need. She had to leave when i had to go back to work and she accused me of leaving her abandoned on the streets, i got to talk to her mother for the first time and asked if she could stay at her mothers (her mother didn‚Äôt know that she got kicked out of her old place) i drove her to her mothers and flew back to work.

One day during work she called me in a fit of rage saying how I was lying about flying to work and I was just having sex with random women for 3 weeks. I just said that she was crazy, turned off my phone and went back to work. On my break I turned my phone back on to hundreds of texts saying how it‚Äôs all my fault (a lot of the same shit my ex was doing to me before that really fucked me up) i called her and told her that i never want to see her again, and to never contact me again.

This was a week ago, I fly home tonight and i‚Äôm fairly positive she‚Äôll be at my door when i arrive at home (she said she‚Äôs going to be there regardless of what i say)

c36yz2	2019-06-21 06:10:22	philleotardo50	AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are?	"I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. 

I've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.

What I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.

On a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.

Edit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill."	Asshole	0	0

I was talking to my friend a couple days ago and she mentioned being excited because she found a way to reduce her student loan payments. I immediately asked what it was, and she explained some company ""contracted"" by her servicer called her and let her know of a forgiveness program. I immediately got a sinking feeling in my stomach. I asked her how it worked and she told me that she would make a $200 payment for three months, and then her payments would be reduced to $20/month for ten years and the loan would then be forgiven. This is all the markings of a VERY blatant scam. Shady companies sign people up for these, use free programs to defer the loan and then pocket the money paid to them and go running while the borrower is still stuck with the loan.

I got very upset. I started screaming at her to go contact the bank and cancel any payments IMMEDIATELY. I pulled up my phone and started showing her articles on these scams. I started saying things like ""Did you seriously think it's that easy to get rid of student loans?!"" pretty intensely.

She seemed pretty upset and then told me she'd go contact her bank and cancel it. She thanked me but seemed a little sarcastic. I think she was upset at how in her face I was and implying she was foolish to fall for it.

There are four urinals at my place of work. Convention dictates that if there is no one at the urinals then you take one of the corner ones. If there is someone at a urinal then it is likely that they are at one of the corner ones, so logic dictates that I should take the other corner one.   

  

  

If there is no one at the urinals then I stand at either of two urinals IN THE MIDDLE. Especially when I know someone is coming up to take a piss. There's just some tiny level of power that I get knowing that I am forcing someone to a particular corner urinal. It's like checkmating someone. I haven't yet had a situation when they piss in the urinal right next to me.

c36tj8	2019-06-21 05:51:48	Savv1998	AITA for not giving my ‚Äúdad‚Äù a ~20th chance?	"On mobile, first time poster, long time lurker, yadda yadda. TLDR at bottom. 
Posting because half of my friend group is trying to get me to forgive again and go to his wedding. 

So my father abandoned my family when I was ~3 and my sister was just barely born. He was in and out of our lives since then, always on drugs and drinking. A majority of the biggest traumas in my life came from him, like when he kidnapped us and brainwashed my sister. Like I have legitimate mental health issues I blame him for. 

I was always a daddy‚Äôs girl when I was little, and have vague memories of my time with him before it went bad. So it was hard for me to get over him. I‚Äôve given him chance after chance after chance and it always ended in heartbreak. He has made my cry in every conversation I‚Äôve had with him in the last ten years. He‚Äôs verbally abusive to my family, and to his family, who are amazing people who still do so much for us even though my dad left. 

Well he got married last weekend to some woman he‚Äôs knows for 3 months and tried to get me to come 4 states away to his wedding. Said he‚Äôd pay for it. I have just recently in the last couple years gotten over missing him, no longer cry when I talk or think about him, and decided I was forever done because he can‚Äôt change. 
Well a few of my friends think I‚Äôm an asshole for not giving him another chance, even though I explained that I‚Äôm just barely healing from all his trauma and abuse. 

TLDR; my dads an abusive asshole, wouldn‚Äôt give him a 20th chance or go to his wedding, friends think I‚Äôm an asshole.

Well I bought my son an IPad Gen 3 a case a screen protector for his birthday some Apps $20 Thomas the Engine app KidToppia subscription loaded it with all his favorite pictures and puzzle games and movies....
She decided instead of giving our youngest son a birthday next week she decided to buy the oldest a new Nintendo Switch SuperSmash Bros Nintendo Direct Subscription and psn gift card 

And I decided I don‚Äôt get shit for my birthday or Christmas and her oldest son gets two birthday parties a year and $100 of shit on my Father‚Äôs Day sure I‚Äôm ok with that

c36q3r	2019-06-21 05:40:27		WIBTA if I asked my boyfriend to take down something in his room related to his ex-girlfriend?	"Context: We're both in college and have been together for about 6 months. He broke up with his ex a year before we met. Their relationship lasted several years and she was his first true love, in his words. He says he's completely over her, and I can tell from his actions that he's not lying about that. However, she was a significant part of his life and he can't just erase the memory of her, so he still speaks of her fondly sometimes.

The issue: He has a big hand crafted sign in his room that is part of the promposal he did for his ex in high school. It's very obviously a promposal sign, and it's also beautifully made. I complimented him on it when I first saw it, becsuse it's just that beautiful. However, it's right above his bed and when we're cuddling or having sex it's very noticeable. It's basically impossible to not see.

Not gonna lie, it makes me insecure sometimes. I know that's on me and not on him, but I'm also not sure what the etiquette is on keeping things like that from past relationships. I have no issue with him keeping gifts from her and things like that, but this sign is just staring me right in the face when we're intimate and frankly, that kinda ruins the mood for me sometimes. WIBTA if I asked him to take it down or put it somewhere less obvious? I wouldn't be asking him to get rid of it completely. I know that part of his life was important to him, and I know he can't just erase it, nor would I want him to, but it sucks to have this reminder of his ex staring me in the face during intimate moments."		1	0

I might be the asshole and I just want to know honest opinions. My amazing fianc√© and I are in the process of planning a wedding and have finally figured out a number. I‚Äôve compromised on a bigger wedding because that‚Äôs what he wanted, despite me wanting a smaller wedding. I understand though because he just has a much larger social circle than I do. My one request with having big wedding was one girl not being invited. The problem was that the girl was one of my fianc√©‚Äôs very good friends girlfriend. 

I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being unreasonable with that request. For context, not a single person on my fianc√©‚Äôs side of the guest list has anything nice to say about her, including me. She is an absolutely horrible person, who has cut down every person and every relationship around her boyfriend because their own relationship is completely toxic. She also cannot hold her alcohol for the life of her (becomes incoherent, mean, and just awful to be around) and we are having an open bar for the whole reception because most of our guests are adults. I don‚Äôt want this drama around our wedding. Especially when I do not trust her not to start something with the other guests around (or them with her for that matter. It‚Äôs that bad). 

My fianc√© is on the other spectrum though, because he thinks it would be very disrespectful to pull his friend aside and tell him that his girlfriend is unwelcome to the wedding. He believes his friend will not be there otherwise. Honestly, at this point, I feel like it might be for the best. I‚Äôve compromised on the size of the wedding as well as other things and this is the one hill I‚Äôm willing to die on. I don‚Äôt like her for our own reasons and do not want her at our wedding. 

I just need to know if I am the asshole here? Am I being too stubborn? 

In addition, WIBTA if he refuses this compromise with the size, I decide they can come, as long as we can cut the guest list down and have a smaller wedding like we originally planned?"		1	0

Before I left I had a conversation with my boyfriend. A few months back I bought a Disney World ticket package, and the tickets expire at the end of the month. I told my boyfriend I wanted to nail down the dates to go so the tickets won't expire. We agreed on a week that we were both free and he told me he'd figure out the exact days and book the hotel while I'm gone. I'm glad, conversation over.
A few days ago I returned from my trip on my birthday.  I had a long day and a very delayed flight. I was looking forward to going out to dinner for my birthday,  which ended up not happening and put me in a bad mood. My boyfriend decided I wouldn't want to go to dinner since I had a long day, so we didn't go. An honest misunderstanding, since he acted based on how he would feel in my situation, but at the time I was upset about it.  That evening, he tells me he booked the hotel for Disney and I show some enthusiasm but move on quickly as it was just a box checked off the list. As we are going to bed, I realize he didn't give me the gift he said he got, so I put two and two together and ask if the hotel is my gift. 
His feelings got hurt, because he did spend a lot of money booking this. My feelings are hurt because I was expecting him to pick something out or come up with something thoughtful. I was not upset about the amount of money spent. That doesn't matter to me. I was just surprised that my gift was a thing he said he'd do while I was gone.
So, AITA for questioning his gift or  being upset by it? Was I overreacting because I was already in a bad mood?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

First of all, Drug Church is a hardcore punk band. I've seen them twice.

Let me also emphasize I go to a VERY progressive church that is majority Millennials. Still I met my parents for lunch last Sunday before that, (I go to church in the evening) and was wearing that shirt. They asked if I was going to wear that shirt to church since I mentioned I was greeting and I was like ""Uh, yeah?"" I was shocked they even thought it was a big deal since they know my church is progressive and young. I had one person compliment me on it in fact. Because of my church's orientation and youth many people there like the same bands I do and know what my shirts refer to.

I work at a park time retail store, and there‚Äôs only one other cashier that I could ask to cover my shift on our only busy day, Saturday, next week. It‚Äôs the summer and we‚Äôre super dead since I‚Äôm in a college town but it‚Äôs also Saturday when we do the sale tags so usually it‚Äôs important for 2-3 people to be there (this includes a manager). I don‚Äôt ever call out but next Saturday is a big event I want to go to since I don‚Äôt see my family much. We normally get the physical print out of the next week‚Äôs schedule at work on Thursdays, but I‚Äôve found out I can see the ‚Äúpossible‚Äù schedule online about 2 weeks, sometimes 3, in advance.

I already made plans and I guess in hindsight I should have put in a request anyways but it‚Äôs never changed before so I didn‚Äôt think about it. I‚Äôm worried because I‚Äôve been wanting more hours over the summer and this next week and the one after seem to actually give me the hours I‚Äôve been wanting, so what if calling out pisses my manager off and she takes the hours away again...

c36oml	2019-06-21 05:35:36	antwan_benjamin	AITA for using a handicapped parking space even though I am not handicapped, and a handicapped person wanted it?	"My sister has a physical handicap. She needed to go to the mall today, so I picked her up and drove her there, she hung her handicap placard in my rear-view mirror. I just dropped her off and went to Starbucks. I have to physically help her get in/out of the car, so I did that. She can get around fine on her own so its not like I abandoned her, she doesn't need a 24/7 aide. As long as the building is fully handicap accessible she's fine.

When I was ready to go I called her to see if she was also ready. She had 1 more store to go to.  I'll park and go inside to make sure everything is OK and she was able to take care of everything she needed to, plus the store she was going to is a brand that I wear so I wanted to take a look around.  

There is this idea that handicapped spaces only exist so handicapped people can get the closest spaces to the entrance, and they're guaranteed to be open.  For our specific situation, its the fact that [handicap spaces provide more parking room and easier access to the handicap ramps that are free of obstructions (see the striped line)](https://www.catospaving.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/handicap-parking-stalls-upgrade.jpg).  I will need this space so she is able to get to the car easy and safely, and I am able to help load her in the passenger seat.

I pull up to the main entrance and see someone pulling out of a handicap space, so I stop and put my turn signal on.  I park in the space and while I'm parking I notice the guy behind me stop right behind my car, blocking me in.  I get out of the car and start walking towards the door.  He honks, then flips me off.  I'm not the one. I see him park 5 spaces down from me, and I walk over there to see what the issue is.  I thought he was mad because I waited to let someone else pull out of their space, which means he also had to wait.  

I walk within shouting distance of him as he's exiting his vehicle using a cane and say, ""Is your horn broken?  Whats the problem?""  He says, ""No.  Is your hip broken?  Cause mine is.  I needed that handicap spot.""  No, my hip is fine.  But I need that spot too.  I don't owe you an explanation as to why, but I'm picking up someone who uses a wheelchair.  Also, people may have handicaps that aren't visually apparent.  You don't know what someone else needs because you're not their fucking doctor, so don't honk at them or try to belittle their physical issues.  

He tells me these spaces are prioritized for the actual drivers that need them.  If I'm just picking someone up, I can pick them up by the door in the unloading area.  I'm obviously not just picking someone up because I'm going into the mall so I must be there to do some shopping as well, therefore I'm using a handicapped space for my own benefit.

So a week ago my friend/ex lover or whatever suggested that I start looking for girls in my area using a dating app because I haven‚Äôt been really going out there much lately because of work and after a couple of silent days of nothing I‚Äôm finally messaged by a pretty attractive looking girl who immediately is smooth as fuck and essentially hitting me with every pick up line in the book like she was picking up a bar slut and alas her charm and humor and puns finally pulled me in and we exchanged numbers and throughout the next few days she starts to talk about her life and her job and she tells me she can get me a job there too because even though I‚Äôm already working I am always open for more work or better pay. 

Well this is when things go horribly wrong if this was the movie the butterfly effect this would be one of those TINY things that happened that threw everything into disarray. She tells me and I quote ‚ÄúThe job is packing and labeling rolls to be shipped out‚Äù and me being the (dumbass or asshole) that I am thought she meant bakery rolls. 

Fast forward to just a few hours ago and we‚Äôre texting and she starts going into more work details and she‚Äôs talking about Canon the camera company and I say ‚ÄúOh you ship film rolls? I thought you meant bakery rolls‚Äù 

Yep thats the nail in that coffin. Because right after that I was hit with ‚ÄúWhat you think I can‚Äôt work in manufacturing because I‚Äôm a woman?‚Äù And ‚ÄúOh you thought it was some pussy baking job because I‚Äôm a girl?‚Äù With no matter what I say or apologize or try to explain that my assumption was purely based on her loose use of the phrase ‚Äúrolls‚Äù she digs deeper and starts to get extremely defensive ‚ÄúJust so you know, all 3 top of the line workers are women. And all the line workers are men.  Okay?‚Äù And then ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I kind of got really defensive it‚Äôs a sensitive subject because I‚Äôm a strong powerful woman and everyone always assumes I‚Äôm doing some useless job when I‚Äôm making a living‚Äù 

Well I guess I could have left it there and continued on our normal conversations and meet up for nice old gross tinder sex where you immediately evaluate your life choices while scrubbing your wang with bleach and a Brillo pad.

This isn‚Äôt the 30s anymore I never said anything like that so don‚Äôt assume that‚Äôs what I meant and explode on me because you‚Äôre sensitive about what other people said to you before‚Äù

The back story:
 My sister (25) has been officially together with this guy (21) for about 1 year now. They got engaged about 4 months ago and the wedding is in a matter of weeks.

To begin with I am not a huge fan of her fiance, not because he is a bad guy, but because I feel he exudes false humility and lacks enough life experience to fully be a participating member of the marriage.

When she asked me I promptly told her no as explained above in a less concentrated form and with a bit more tact. 

I will be attending but as no more then a guest.

c36mny	2019-06-21 05:29:21	thesaws	AITA for telling off my best girl's BF for calling me bitch?	"So, the gist is my best friend and I insult each other like assholes. Ever since sophomore year of high school our favorite pet name/insult has been 'bitch'. It's basically a greeting at this point, and we throw around 'dike' and 'cunt' and just about any other awful name we want. But that's always been kind of an *us* thing because we're so close. She was there for me when I struggled with my sexual identity and supported me coming out when some of my family didn't, and I was there for her through some rocky and abusive family troubles. She can call me any name under the sun because she's proven she loves me.

Her boyfriend, on the under hand, I've barely known a few months. We have never hung out alone, and I guess the times we have he picked up on our insult-endearments. At a party/get-together this last weekend he left with my best friend early and, as they were heading out, said ""see you later, bitch"". I immediately told him not to call me that, because it seems demeaning from him. I don't think he's earned the right. He laughed, so I told him no, back up, I need you to know this isn't going to work. He said I was overreacting, I said he was an ass and needs to *listen linda.* He started getting angry and my friend made a tactical retreat. Later, she apologized but said I should have been more polite and I need to apologize too.

I don't think I did anything wrong. This guy called me a word I wasn't comfortable with from him, I told him to stop, he didn't, I got mad. He hasn't even apologized to me himself and is starting to bug my friend for hanging out with me because he's decided he can't engage with me anymore since he's ""clearly not wanted"". She just wants some peace and thinks we both need to apologize and move on.

c36kzq	2019-06-21 05:23:48		AITA for telling my Father to leave me alone?	"Hello fellow redditors. This is my first time posting here so just hang in there.

Quick rundown. Last April, my mother left state to go screw another man while shes still married to my father. Now I was the one to find out, and had to break it to my dad. So months later down the line, he found someone to talk to and date since my parents decided to split. The day before Thanksgiving, they were km the phone when her ex husband broke into house and starting beating her. He left state (after consulting with me and my older sister, and asking us if it's alright. I said yes) she lives in Kansas however. He said he would comeback beginning of December. He never did.


So, just over 5 months later, my Father has texted me  EVERY day. Whether it was to have an actual conversation with me or if it was just to say hi and end it there. For a good majority of the time I cut him some slack, he missed his kids and wanted to make sure he some kind influence. However, this doesn't mean I enjoyed him texting. I dont like texting at all. I like to be busy and then spend some time here on reddit when I relax. I'm 16yo Male (almost 17) and I get Good morning texts every day, which I found severely annoying, and it got to the point where I dreaded seeing his name pop on my phone. Just yesterday I snapped. I told him I dont want him texting me EVERY single day. I want space, I want to just be by myself without hearing the vibrations of my phone to see my 42 year old father texting me for the 72nd time that day. I feel guilty, but relieved. I'm still adjusting to living with my mother in the same house she left a year ago to fuck another man. I've always liked my father more- but with the constant nagging he gives every hour the the waking days, it gets in the way of my work, and school.

So here‚Äôs what happened: my Dungeons and Dragons group consisted of me (DM), my now ex-boyfriend, and two of our friends. We‚Äôd play weekly-ish whenever our schedules lined up and had a grand old time. My boyfriend recently broke up with me (and not nicely either) but neither of our two friends supported the idea of me kicking the ex out and either playing with just the two of them or finding another person to play in his place.

I said, fine, I‚Äôll leave then, but friends wouldn‚Äôt have that either, they said they wanted to just finish the campaign and didn‚Äôt want to find a new DM (we live in a small city/large town and there‚Äôs not a ton of D&D action around, all DMs that we know of have their own games).

I basically made it clear, either the ex leaves or I do, they said neither option worked, so I just decided not to schedule any more meetings (I used to be the one coordinating the schedule) because it‚Äôs not like they can MAKE me DM right?

(I should add that the ex was on their side, saying we should all play together as normal and not let our breakup affect things.)

Now both friends and my ex are texting me asking when we‚Äôre going to have the next session. I told them never and they‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm an asshole for ruining their fun, breaking up the gaming group, etc. and that it‚Äôs unfair of me to ask them to pick sides.

My ex is a complete douche who was emotionally abusive, got physical with me, and continues to gaslight me to this day (long story as to why he‚Äôs still in my life, we live on a small campus and have many mutual friends. I‚Äôm finally putting my foot down now though). The problem is that he hides it so damn well and is actually a fun guy to be around when you‚Äôre not the subject of his abuse. Therefore he has many friends and hosts many fun parties/hangouts. 

I met my friends through him. Post breakup they came to me bc they were tired of his shit. He‚Äôs real charming to acquaintances but his true colors start to show when you become close to him, and he definitely wasn‚Äôt treating my friends well at all. Between what they already knew and what I told them he said behind their backs about them (and what he did to me), they seem pretty set on not talking to him for the time being. We always say what a dick he is, how annoying and manipulative he can be, etc. 

I guess he misses his old friends because he‚Äôs been reaching out to them to hang out again. They‚Äôve either ignored him so far or brush him off. But he‚Äôs insanely persistent, and he even recently asked me to ‚Äúclarify what I lied about to them‚Äù so they wouldn‚Äôt hate him (hint: I didn‚Äôt lie at all) and said we should ‚Äúall hang out as long as you [me] aren‚Äôt weird.‚Äù I showed my friends and they still showed no indication of wanting to hang out with him. 

However, I‚Äôm wondering if in a few months they won‚Äôt care so much about how shitty he was and might want to hang out. After all, they were his friends before I came into the picture and he is fun to be around. We all miss the fun times we had and he‚Äôs a unique guy who was genuinely exciting and enjoyable to talk to when he‚Äôs not being a complete ass, or if you‚Äôre blissfully ignorant to his asshole-ness. 

I‚Äôll never really heal from how he hurt me but for them he just lied a little and talked some shit, in time that will seem so trivial. I consider them close friends but I know I‚Äôm in no position to stop them from being friends with whoever they want, and they experienced him differently than I did. I don‚Äôt want to say anything because I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs my place, but I definitely have an expectation that they wouldn‚Äôt hang out with him or even be friendly. Am I an asshole for having this expectation?

c36jak	2019-06-21 05:18:15		AITA for 'manipulating' my date to have sex with me?	"Okay hear me out, the title sounds bad but it's not I swear. (I hope)

So I met this guy on Tinder and we've been hanging out for about 2 months. 

So last week I saw him and it was after a particularly rough day of work for him. So I suggested going somewhere near his place so he wouldn't have to travel far to get back. Then I remembered that his family was out of town, so it was just him and his place, and a lightbulb went off in my head.  If I get him close to home maybe there'd be a chance that I could be alone with him and maybe something would happen. This guy is attractive, like 69/10 type shit. So obviously I would be down to hook up as well.

So I wore a great outfit and picked a place 2 blocks down from his place. He shows up, looking amazing as usual, and we had dinner. Then afterwards, as we were walking down Ave 5, he goes 'hey do you wanna come over to my place? it's just around the corner', and i, having expected this, say yes, obviously.

We go to his place and long story short yes we had a great time hooking up.

I told my friend about this the other day and she called me a 'manipulative asshole'.  AITA?????? it's been troubling me now because I'm a strong advocate for consent and safety and all that, and it didn't really looked apparent to me how it might be shitty?"		1	0

Also English is my second language, so I am sorry for any inconvenience.

So me (16m - straight) is friends with J (17m). We are friends from school but we haven't talked in a while. J has came out as gay about a year ago and so far everyone has been accepting. 

So recently me and J started talking on Snapchat. And about 3 days ago, J told me that he had a  crush on me back when I was dating my ex-girlfriend. And I felt like it was no big deal and here is where I have fucked up.

 I was occasionaly making fun of him for it ( not in person but through Snapchat ). 
And he was just saying that I should stop, unless I want that J develops feelings again. With making fun of him I mean that I would say things like maybe I am bi curious and stuff like that. Well turns out that was a major mistake. 

Yesterday I was making fun of him again. And I got a Snapchat from J saying that the girls from my class were right and that I am a huge piece of shit.  It was pretty late at night so I just didn't care and went to sleep.

Well today I woke up to a shitstorm from all the girls at our school saying that I am fucked up and that I don't have any feelings and that I am childish.

For the whole time I felt like I did the best thing of them all. That I didn't stop talking to him and that I didn't tell the whole school about it.

I have just finished my first year of university (UK) and met a lot of people there, some of which I am in a house share with for next year. Every time someone I knew or one of my class had a birthday I, along with the rest of my class would say happy birthday to them.

However, on my birthday 3 people I met from uni said happy birthday. 2 weren‚Äôt even in my class. I felt really left out and under appreciated compared with everyone else. One of those people I‚Äôm quite close to knows some other people with birthdays 1 day after mine and another 2 days after mine. And on his snapchat story was the usual ‚Äúhappy birthday to X‚Äù which people do. I never got one. I did for him, but I didn‚Äôt get one. One of the people who did a snapchat story for me knew he looked at it and when I told her, she said he would‚Äôve seen it so would‚Äôve knew. Meaning it‚Äôs not like it was just forgot. Also 2 friends I knew from primary school never said happy birthday, we have a group chat and I always said happy birthday to them in it, and a few days before this was another friend of mines birthday, where in the group chat everyone said it to him. I didn‚Äôt get that. I have a problem with feeling left out and isolated but I‚Äôm left wondering if it‚Äôs just down to being a horrible person. I‚Äôm not asking for a card or presents.

c36dnr	2019-06-21 05:01:17	jon_jemima	WIBTA if I did not let my landlord show off my apartment?	"Writing this on behalf of a friend.

For background the lease is structured as such: 12 Months fixed term and fixed rent, with a second 12 months where either party may cancel with notice. It is currently the end of the fixed term and the landlord has requested to raise the rent under threat of termination. My friend‚Äôs ideal situation is to finish the contract and pay the current rental rate. We have tried to disincentivize the landlord by stating that if they elect to terminate and find another tenant they would need to pay agency fees, deep cleaning services, and importantly, there would be an opportunity cost where the place is left unrented. 

The landlord is considering to move forward with the termination and in the meantime has requested access to the apartment to show prospective tenants. Now, under local tenancy laws as well as our tenancy agreement, there is no obligation to allow him to do so. As doing this would shorten the period in which the apartment is left unrented as he could negotiate an agreement in that time, this is against our interests in maintaining the current situation. The landlord is if course incredibly upset. 

On one hand, we have been told we have been unnecessarily hostile and are just making things difficult for the landlord, costing him income. Our perspective, however, is maintaining our bargaining position such that the landlord would have no incentive to evict us and raise rental prices.

Up until now, we have had no issues with the landlord, have paid rent on time, etc

So WIBTA if we didn‚Äôt entertain the landlord‚Äôs request to raise rent?

Edit: everyone seems to have questions on legality so I thought I would address this. The apartment is not rented in the US. We have what is called ‚Äúquiet enjoyment‚Äù here. That means so long as rent is paid on time, the landlord has no right to interfere with our living. This extends to entry which is granted only in an emergency basis. If the landlord wanted to reserve the right to show the apartment with notice, it would be in the tenancy agreement which it is not. We legally have a right to refuse entry which is why the landlord is upset. Sorry to derail onto a legal discussion, but in terms of the law, we are above board.

c369o8	2019-06-21 04:48:50		AITA for telling my younger sibling this?	"This still bothers me today, and I really need answers on this: 

*before you assume I am a ‚Äúspoiled brat‚Äù, read all of this before you comment. 
Last year in 2018, my mother(s) both told me about how I should pay for the cable bill this month. I declined because:
1. I have been working since I was 15, paid for my own things, even got groceries for my family, and helped provided for them for a long time. Most of the time when I gave my mother money, it seemed like it ended up going elsewhere because of how they spent their money.
2. I am 19 at this time, I go to college, I spend almost $60 a week going back and forth to school. $240 for phone bill/car insurance. I get paid bi-weekly at $11 an hour in Alabama for 32 hours a week. 
3. I was trying to save money for once to build my own PC. 
4. Both of my parents spent money on things we DID NOT need for the house that week(but they do this a lot) and telling me they had no money to pay for bills. 

BG:
I was staying with my dad at the time after telling my mom I couldn‚Äôt pay for it (politely). I told my 12 year old sister in the car that I was tired of them not having enough money for things they NEED and not what they WANT. (Ex: This year they bought a truck. A 3rd car, while one of them isn‚Äôt being used. So the other just sits in the driveway. There is nothing wrong with it. It‚Äôs a Jeep). So I vented to her about that.
She told my mom this, but in a way that made it seem like I wasn‚Äôt grateful for the things she does for me. 

Anyways, I get home and my dad tells me my mom was coming over and she‚Äôs mad. I sat outside patiently and waited. She gets out of the car and tells me to give her the keys to my car. I said why? I have no idea what I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôm confused. Then my mom goes inside pissed and gets my keys instead. My other mom tells me that I shouldn‚Äôt tell them what they should/shouldn‚Äôt spend their money on. I said, ‚Äúwhat are you talking about‚Äù? She said ‚Äúwe know what you said to your sister‚Äù. I said nothing after that, still confused, and they leave. She also takes my house key and kicks me out of the house for the time being. 
For the next 4 weeks I lived with my dad, who was in the hospital, ICU, with stage 4 cancer and my mom still would not let me have the car to go see my father. I had no ride to school. I had to drop a class that year. My best friend took his life.
Through all of that, and she wouldn‚Äôt spare enough time just to talk to me about what I did wrong, but let herself explode and make me seem like the enemy. 

I never wanted to go to college either. I felt I wasn‚Äôt ready, I had no idea what I wanted to do and I wanted to figure myself out because I wanted to be a TATTOO ARTIST. 
So I never got to do that because she said if I didn‚Äôt go, I would be homeless at 17 with no car, and I would be worthless all the while working at Walmart or some shit factory the rest of my life. 
But I went. For her.

Was I the asshole for that?

c369nu	2019-06-21 04:48:48		AITA for telling my parents that they are being shitty parents ?	"So recently I stopped going to school due to personal reasons. I will be going back and I plan to by next year. When I told them what I was going to do my mom started saying that i was stupid, that I NEED a career or else I am no one. I stopped going due to it getting very expensive for me. I have a car and insurance that I pay by myself. 

Basically i started doing things that i felt were right for me. I'm going through a dark time and I wasnt motivated to going to school. 

My parents do help me here and there with paying my car or insurance. I dont like asking them for help due to fact that they use that against. 

Another recent thing that happened is that I got into a car accident. The other person was at fault. The other insurance was going to pay for the damages but once they saw how much everything was going to be, they said that they cant cover it so that left me with going through my insurance but I have to pay the deductible which is $1000. 

I dont have the money and so my parents have stepped in again in helping me BUT their only condition is that I HAVE to do back to school or else they're not helping me. I told them my plan of going back to school and they didnt like it and so by the time it comes to paying my car they want to see that I have enrolled in class. It's less than a week. If I dont do it, they're not helping me. 

I've told multiple times on why I stopped and its because it got expensive for me and because I'm currently depressed. They don't care at all. All they care about is that I go back to school. 

My relationship with my parents isnt amazing. They are the people that have contributed to my depression. They believe that I am only meant to only go to school and work. I get yelled out for staying out late and late to them is 12am. I'm 22f, middle child. Im the black sheep of this family. 

Let me also mention that my mother went through my purse once and found my birth control called me crying saying how could I do such a thing. A month later she told my dad and I get a message from him saying how because I'm on birth control, I wasnt his daughter and wasnt going to care what happened to me. 

So am I being an asshole by saying that they are being shitty parents by forcing me to go back to school even when I'm not happy?"		1	0
c3695t	2019-06-21 04:47:15	coulditbeme1	AITA for angrily texting my brother the night his daughter was born?	"I'd say the first real tensions began when brother joined the army. Brother and SIL have a quick secret marriage since he is leaving. SIL LOSES it after he leaves. 

Eventually my brother decides to quit army. SIL helps sneak him out of basic training, so he was officially AWOL. I was FURIOUS. It was very shameful for my family. I was getting calls from the army telling me it would be legal for them to shoot brother on sight. 

Bro now devotes all free time to SIL. Example: My father who visits once or twice a year came in for a Christmas and stayed at bros home. Christmas morning, bro asked my dad and me to leave so SIL and him could ""spend their first Christmas as H+W alone together."" 

Another example of this is the official wedding reception they did later. Our dad is driving 10+ hours to the wedding cabin that he paid for with around 15 bedrooms. After the ceremony, bro kicks everyone out because he wants to ""be able to use every room with his new wife"". 

One time, they came to where I live for a concert (hour away). I only got them to stop by by saying I'd pay for dinner. I start to feel used. I pretty much give up.

But then they get pregnant! Cool, I want to be in nieces life. Surprisingly, brother invites me to hospital for birth. A c section is needed so it goes late. I wait in the waiting room with husband and SILs mother with no news until about 3 am.  Nurse comes to tell us baby is born and invites us back. SILs mother closes the door in my face. When Mom gets back, she tells me SIL and bro need to be alone. I have to work at 8am so I leave. My brother texts me to ask where I am, and I vent about out how excluded and used I feel in our relationship.

After that night, I think brother and I are good. SIL texts me to apologize. Life goes on as normal.

It's now almost niece's 1st birthday. I've only seen her once, so I ask about visiting sometime around her birthday. Brother says ""We're just doing the 3 of us."" I admittedly overreact, telling him the 3 of them can go to hell for not trying to make time.

Months later, SIL sends a huge text novel to me saying I ruined daughters birth, and that's why they didn't invite me for birthday. That they needed to reclaim it since I made the birth about me. Says Ive never tried to make an effort to be in her life, and that if I really want to see brother or baby I should text her because brother is too busy. She calls my dog disgusting and says she's glad I won't be around anymore. 

This results in a year or so of no contact. But then they start needing things. Bro gets arrested for the AWOL charges. We all apologize and I'm there with financial/legal help. But once brother gets out of jail, the coldness returns. 

This month, brother reached out in a crisis. It's revealed SIL still hates me for texting my brother the night daughter was born. He wants me to apologize (again?)

"So to cut a long story short, I‚Äôm a Sysop Engineer at one of the Top Ten IT companies in the world. I‚Äôve been working in IT for almost 10 years and started pretty much when I was a kid. So anyway, I met with a few friends recently, both who are currently at Harvard studying Data Science. We were all chatting when my GF suggested that they could both easily be my boss and do my job without any effort. I said ‚ÄúWell in all fairness, my job is not exactly covering the same fields as what they‚Äôre studying‚Äù. My GF laughed at me, and pretty much made me look like a moron suggesting I had no idea what I was talking about for the next 10 minutes. Both of my friends also laughing at me. At this point I was feeling really quite down and humiliated. Here‚Äôs me, having studied for years different aspects of IT, Windows, Linux, DBs, various languages, networking, etc. ( As anyone in the Systems side knows, there‚Äôs a huge breadth of knowledge that comes with doing this job ) and here‚Äôs 3 people, 1 having no idea about IT, and the other 2 studying IT for 2 years at the very least and with just one subject.  So I looked over to my fiends and started listing different technologies, none of them had a clue what I was talking about. I said ‚ÄúSee, they don‚Äôt know, they have no idea‚Äù. In a tongue in cheek way obviously, I‚Äôm not arrogant in the slightest but I‚Äôm not going down without a fight. So I asked them what they studying specifically, they said (paraphrasing) ‚ÄúHow to create joins without a schema‚Äù. I understood, I asked a few questions naturally, and left it at the that. I don‚Äôt know a lot about DBs, but I understood the gist of what they were trying to achieve. I don‚Äôt pretend to understand that which I don‚Äôt understand. 

Shortly after, when they had both gone the toilet, my GF looked to me and said ‚ÄúYou know no one likes arrogance, you think that you‚Äôre better than your mates studying at Harvard??‚Äù I replied back ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm better at all. I never started this dumb conversation! I‚Äôve been humiliated by you, making me look dumb in front of my friends, with them agreeing with you!‚Äù 

She later said I‚Äôm a big head and reiterated that she thinks that I think I‚Äôm better than anyone else. SIGH. I said ‚ÄúLook, I never started this conversation. I never suggested I was better than them, I never suggested I could do what they‚Äôre doing. You suggested they could replace me in my job, something that requires a whole different skill set to what they have!‚Äù. Am I an asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c366ts	2019-06-21 04:40:05	hewdewpew	AITA for telling someone they're really short?	"There's this girl in my group of friends... Let's call her Amy because why not. We're both 18f. She's only been hanging out with us since dating another friend's cousin, so we're not super close or besties or anything like that.

Anyway Amy's 157 cm tall (5 feet 1 inch) while I'm 188 cm (6 feet 2 inches). Yes, I know I'm tall. Been tall all my life, everyone in my family's tall, it was sort of inevitable. No, I don't generally care if people bring it up or ask questions, but repeatedly treating me like a freak-show irks me.

Well Amy was like that. Her first reaction upon meeting me was to literally jump up and exclaim, ""Wow, you're like a giant!"" I laughed that off because I thought it was funny, but then she never stopped awkwardly glancing at me. Every time we saw each other, she'd make multiple remarks referencing my height. Like... fine. I get it. I know I'm tall. Can we talk about something else now, please?

And that was pretty much what I told her the last time we hung out in group. Instead of getting off my case, she looked caught off-guard and said something along the lines of, ""But it's just so weird. You're not only tall, you're like a whole another category."" That set off my temper and I became spiteful. The next time Amy faked surprise about how big I am standing up, I looked down at her and said, ""Wow, and you're super short!"" She seemed shocked, though my other friends got a laugh out of it. Probably because I'm normally timid and don't like provoking conflict, but she was really crossing the line.

The good thing is, Amy hasn't mentioned anything about my height since. The bad thing is, well I've been feeling like an asshole for being passive-agressive and hurting Amy's feelings. Do you think the guilt is justified?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c366ps	2019-06-21 04:39:46	rub_me_long_time	"AITA for ""lying"" to a friend"	"My friend and I have known each other since high school, and frequently (nearly everyday) play online games with each other. I am currently in graduate school, and live in an apartment managed by the school. The internet here can be pretty hit or miss, and occasionally leads to me lagging. I would say this happens maybe twice a week while playing with my friend. In this living situation, I have no control over the internet. I cannot get a new ISP, and do not even know where/have access to the router/modem. My friend and I have tried a few different things to fix the internet, and determine if the issue is on my PC's end or not. Through this, my friend has semi-regularly told me I should contact my landlord and complain. I have consistantly replied saying that I don't even have a landlord, and contact with anyone responsible for housing through the school generally takes a week at least to get a response. Because of this, I have always said it would be useless and pointless and that I did not want to. Recently, he has been more vocal saying I should contact them, and I would respond with something along the lines of ""Yeah okay whatever"" or ""Okay dude"" because I was sick of hearing about it. Finally, one month ago, he got upset and told me to stop complaining and email them. I said fine, I will. The next day he asked me if I had emailed them, and I said yes, despite having not done so. He then asked for proof, so I quickly wrote an email to the IT department at the school and screenshoted it, while intentionally leaving out the date and time. In my mind, it was an obvious joke in that the screenshot was badly cropped, and that at least I had sent one then. He pointed out that I cropped the time and date, and I said ""fuck off"". We generally joke around like this with each other, being slightly mean to each other, and that is how I meant it. He then told me I shouldn't lie to a friend thats trying to help. I maintained that I wasn't lying intentionally or out of malice, I thought I was making a clear joke. He then accused me of lying about this repeatedly. I am not sure exactly what events he is talking about, but I swear I have never told him that I did send anything. I told him this, and he simply said I don't believe you. We have talked only VERY briefly since, with him ghosting me for about 3 weeks before saying he still thinks I was lying. After I called him an asshole, he suggested I post here to see. I maintain that I was making a joke, and while looking back I can admit it wasn't a good joke, did not try to intentionally mislead him, and that his reaction is unreasonable. He maintains that I lied this time, and lied in the past. Who is the asshole?

Note: I think part of this hinges on whether or not I lied about this in the past. Unless you would consider me saying ""Yeah okay whatever"" or ""okay dude"", I did not ever make any committment or promise to do anything about it. Thanks for your time."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c365n5	2019-06-21 04:36:25	Tobikens	WIBTA if I told my friend that her wife is on a dating app?	"I was really good friends with my friend when I was a senior in high school. She‚Äôs a few years older than me and had been dating her girlfriend for at least a year if not longer. I did both of their makeup for the wedding and I was a bridesmaid. I absolutely love them. 

A few months ago, they announced they were moving out of state. Plans stalled for a while with their work situations, but it‚Äôs happening soon.

Here‚Äôs the problem. I found my friends wife on Bumble. She didn‚Äôt have anything in her bio and she updated her pictures recently, so I know she‚Äôs been on the account. (We hung out at Pride and I saw a selfie she took at Pride.) I don‚Äôt know if they have an open relationship or anything, which for all I know they could. It wouldn‚Äôt be out of character for them in my opinion, but they would‚Äôve talked about it 100%, they‚Äôre very open on Facebook with their queer life and how they‚Äôve faced prejudice from their families (hooray for living in the south!) 

So what do I do? We aren‚Äôt as close anymore so I don‚Äôt know if it would be weird or not, but I would feel awful if she uprooted her life and something happened after they move. I think I talked myself into telling her, but just want to check. WIBTA?

c364lh	2019-06-21 04:33:17	lau58	AITA for doing this on the train	"i was taking the train earlier today and this happened. might be hard to explain, but right next to the doors is a set of three seats parallel to the wall. in between the doors and the seat (but attached right to the seat) there is a pole for people to hold onto and at the end of the pole is a sort of arm rest and then like a solid piece for you to lean against. -- after writing all this i found a [picture](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=inside+new+york+subway&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH4_L72_niAhUniOAKHU3WA0oQrNwCCEIoBA&biw=1420&bih=711&dpr=2#imgrc=4JojmfsxWKlhmM:) lol 

i was sitting in one of these seats right next to the pole/arm rest thing and i was leaning my shoulder into it. the arm rest is kinda high, so the person sitting in the seat can use it but a person standing next to it can also use it. when im sitting down though my shoulder is like directly in line with the arm rest.

so im on the train for about 15 minutes with my headphones in. this group of younger girls gets on the train, probably 5 -6 of them. the train isnt that packed, there are open seats and no one standing up, but these girls just get on and stand directly in front of the doors without moving in. this is a no no in train etiquette lol (at least in nyc)

one of them leans her arm onto the arm rest that im sitting directly next to. kinda rude because shes all up in my personal space (like she is 2 inches away from my face) when the train is not packed at all but whatever

after a few seconds i guess she rested all of her weight onto her arm or just shifted it bc her arm moved and it was now fully digging into my shoulder. 

i thought maybe her arm slipped but no, she was keeping it there on purpose. so i kinda rolled my shoulder back and shook it out so she would get the message, like,  dude wtf are you doing 

she immediately turns to glare at me. her friends all noticed and made some comment about how you can put your arm anywhere on public transportation. i had my headphones in so i just ignored them but AITA"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3645m	2019-06-21 04:32:01	WIBTA_throwaway_acc	WIBTA if I told my dad about the cost of my mum's shopping spree?	"For some background: My mother has never had any sense of money or how to save it. She tends to think the family has endless amounts of money and that we can afford everything she wants. On the other hand, my dad is a realist and deals with all of the finances. He never asks for much and always tries to make budgets for the family.

Firstly, my parents like to rant to me about the other parents spending habits/financial sense. My mother is constantly annoyed at my father for telling her that we need to save more than we spend as she believes she can do whatever she wants with it. However, my dad is always frustrated with her and tells me that she is terrible at saving money. As much as I try not to take sides, I tend to lean more towards my father's side. When it was my mum's birthday, this cost me as I always try to make sure that my respective parent's gifts come to roughly the same cost. My mum loves expensive gifts and wanted an IPad for her birthday as well as other presents too. I talked to my dad and we came to the conclusion that we would get some of the gifts she wanted but not all. My mum was not pleased as she thought I crossed a line as it wasn't my money and she felt that my dad and I didn't treasure her enough. After this, I had to apologize countless times before she forgave me.

Now, for the actual story. The other day my mum went shopping for clothes. She shows me them and I start to become a bit concerned. I checked the receipt and it came to a total of $1100! She then tells me that ""they were expensive, but they're good quality!"". She is ecstatic but when my dad asks her if he can see the clothes she bought, she said they are already in the closet and she'll show him another time. Bear in mind, the clothes still had price tags on them and I'm sure she didn't want him to see. My dad knows she likes expensive clothes as she once bought a dress totaling to $800, which she only ended up wearing twice.

I know it isn't my place to care what she spends as it is her money but I know that her spending spree will cause an argument. I just want to give my dad a heads up and try to calm him down before he notices a -$1100 in his bank account so that he doesn't blow up at my mum because she didn't let him know. Then again, if my mum found out she'd be furious at me for telling him as well as hurt. I love both my parents but I can't help but feel angry at mum for being selfish, especially since my dad just started chemotherapy and radiation to treat his cancer which is already putting a financial strain on the family. On top of this, my dad has been really grumpy from the medication and I fear that when he checks the bank accounts, he will freak out and the whole family will split apart.

So Reddit, please help me, would I be the asshole if I told him?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c363cy	2019-06-21 04:29:34		AITA for telling my parents to come back later instead of bothering me in the middle of a game	"I‚Äôm 23, living at home while I save money and moving into an apartment in two weeks. I mostly stick to my room with the door closed. When I‚Äôm awake, I‚Äôm either at work, running errands or playing video games in my room. I‚Äôve worked a solid job since before I moved back in and playing video games has been a hobby since middle school with outdoors stuff as an occasional weekend escape.

So tonight I hopped online after coming home and was playing risk of rain with friends from work when my mother knocks on the door for all of 5 minutes and when I notice, I mute my microphone and ask what she needs. She can‚Äôt find an app on her phone to move to her home screen and wanted help. I tell her this is the worst time. Risk of rain cannot be paused and you are one of four people on a team that needs to work together. To add to it, the work group I‚Äôm playing with are regulars and since I‚Äôm still new to the group, I‚Äôm trying my best to be a good teammate. So while I‚Äôm trying to help defeat the boss on the level, I‚Äôm telling my mom to check again, look for the app in her folders and she says it‚Äôs not installed. I tell her to look again since she can open it. 

We bicker back and fourth until I die in the game and toss my headset onto the desk and snap at her to ‚Äúgive me the fucking phone‚Äù and I say ‚Äùlook, this is the absolute worst fucking time to do this, you could have asked if I had a minute or ‚Äòcan I have some help when you have a second‚Äô‚Äù I snatch her phone, move the app on to her phone screen and tell her to hold the app, wait till it jiggles then move it around. She‚Äôs taken aback and runs out while I‚Äôm sitting there livid that I‚Äôm dead and the whole team dies a few minutes after me. Everything was absolutely perfect up to that point. When I put my headset back on, everyone was asking if I‚Äôm back.

I thought about apologizing but her room door was locked and this keeps happening. They‚Äôve seen me play video games for years, I‚Äôve said that these games cannot be paused and I don‚Äôt think either of my parents have ever taken an interest in anything other than shaming it. I‚Äôm counting down the days to moving into my new place and I think after tonight, they are too.

So I just went to a college orientation and parked my car in a parking garage nearby. The spots were all just big enough, so not much space in between cars like other spots in the city where I‚Äôm from are. When I got there, the car next to me was parked pretty badly (the back wheel facing mine was literally on the line). And when I was about to leave, that car had already gone but my car got some scratches and some other evidences that mine had been hit. He didn‚Äôt leave any note so pretty much it was a hit-and-run case.
My problem is, they are probably just as excited as I am about going to college. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd feel so good making a move against them and destroy their dream, even though I don‚Äôt know them. But it is also my car that is in pretty bad shape. So WIBTA if I turned them in?"		1	0
c362ez	2019-06-21 04:26:44	hsymy	AITA for agreeing to a divorce that he asked for?	"My husband and I have been together for 10 years. In the last couple of years, he has asked for divorce multiple times, citing the fact that I haven't been working on some personal characteristics of myself that we mutually agreed I need to work on (things like communicating well, being able to prioritize tasks, or being a self-starter). In every one of the arguments that lead up to him asking for a divorce, we've both agreed that: 

1. my inability to follow through on things I've promised breaks his trust. 
2. we've spent a lot of time, money, and emotional energy arguing. He quit his job because he was burnt out from dealing with the stress of trying to help me deal with my issues, and his high-pressured job at the same time (software engineer at a big company).
3. I'm incapable or unwilling to change my ways.

I see that we're not in a healthy state, and that who I am right now is just not able to work with him. So lately whenever he's brought up divorce, I've agreed to it. But when I do, he says I'm a cold-hearted bitch for throwing away everything we've had together, and not holding on to us, and that I've never cared for him. I know that emotionally, he's given more to our relationship and marriage than I have, and so I've always felt like the asshole for asking him to stay when I can't seem to give him the emotional connection he needs.

c35z73	2019-06-21 04:17:05	mmmlovinit	AITA for interrupting a guy with a stutter?	"So, we're in college. We're both towards the tail end of our degrees, and when you get that far in a scientific degree class sizes get smaller and you start seeing a lot of familiar faces. For the last year I've had at least one class a semester with this guy who has a stutter and we've been paired up for projects, classwork, and labs now and then. Now, maybe I run a bit fast, but I definitely don't have time to go at this guy's speed all the time-I take the bus, and if I miss it I'm late for work. And since there's so much work and projects, especially close to finals, I start feeling pressure to get it done.

So if he gets out enough of a question that I can understand what he's trying to say, I'll usually interrupt him with the answer instead of waiting. If I'm recording his observations for a slide show or lab, I'll write ahead what I know he's going to say-I don't interrupt statements, though, just questions that I don't need to wait to answer. We're doing a big, semester-long project right now with two other people and after class today they both told me I was being rude and insensitive and I need to stop interrupting and be respectful.

The guy himself, in all the time we've known each other and all the work we've done together, has never said anything to me about this or indicated in any way that I can remember that he was uncomfortable or upset. I think they're trying to pick a fight that doesn't need to be fought because I don't mean disrespect and this guy has never shown any negative reaction.

"So, the title may sweep up opinions on this already, and I know I'm an asshole for how I immediately reacted (maybe not for the reasons you are assuming).
This involves Me, J (my GF), and D (my friend)

While at work, J messages me and says: ""D ISNT A GUY"", followed by nothing else. 

I respond with ""wait what?"" and when I don't receive a reply and  due to being caught in the moment, I message D and say: ""J said you aren't a guy"" ""is that true?""
I get a response from them where they say:""You got me"" ""Ive been a gamer girl for years now""

My imidiate reply is a few laughing emojis and ""it's good to see you being true with yourself"" to which D responds with ""thank you for being so supportive"" and eventually leans into a conversation about how Im here for them and then about how gamers are oppressed and all just general joking around. 

J finally responds and is furious with me after I told her I talked to D about it. I then realized that I screwed up and shouldnt have said anything untill D said something to me first (this is why I'm saying im an asset), so I quickly message them saying that Im sorry and that they should have messaged me first telling me and that it's my fault and I'd stay supportive so if their was anything I could do to let me know. D responded with ""no worries"" and we started talking about what's happened in the last few months and video games that we play.

I message J telling her I'm sorry for saying anything and that I apologized to D and would support them. J continued to stay mad and said that I most likely damaged her friendship with D and that they never wanted me to know because D was worried I'd be stupid and unsupportive and they would lose a friend and that they didn't want to put the time and effort in at the moment to help me understand gender and sexuality. I told her that I may not understand all of that or what D is going through, but I'd never stop someone from expressing themselves in any way and I'd always support my friends through hard times, which we an argument ensues. I, not wanting to deal with an argument at work, end with this:

""I apologized to D and he said no worries, I told him I'd do anything he needs me to do as a friend and left it at that""
""I'm sorry I may have harmed your own friendship with D.  That wasn't my intention in the slightest. I wanted to show D he had another friend to support him, and I did that without tact""
""That's my fault""
""I'll message you when I get off work""

As of now, I've asked J if there's anything I can do to fix it and she isn't responding at all. So my question isn't necessarily if I'm the asshole for telling D I was told he wasn't ""a guy"" anymore, I know I'm an asshole for that. 

My question is more, am I the only asshole in this situation? Did I try to fix it in a way that makes me not the asshole or not as big of one?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Husband grew up in the system for the most part. His mother left at an early age and his dad is an abusive alcoholic. He was separated from his sister around middle school age because he was moved to a higher level group home so for a good portion of his life he didnt feel he had anyone. This has directly affected the way he treats our relationship. 

When i was in high school i had a boyfriend who sexually and physically assaulted me for the duration of our relationship. I also have depression and anxiety. Husband knows of my past with him.

Anytime we fight he demands a hug directly after the argument. Not 10 minutes later. Not an hour later, no. He wants a hug minutes after the argument is over, resolved, dropped, whatever. I am one of the types of people who dont want to be touched at all when im in a mood. The hug makes me feel trapped and sends me into a full blown panic attack. He feels i am denying him what he needs to calm down and wants to feel reassured that i still love him. No matter how many times i tell him one fight isnt gonna make me walk away from 6 years. It makes me feel extremely guilty after it is all said and done but i physically cant force myself to do it.

c35xk3	2019-06-21 04:12:09		AITA for wanting to talk to my ex about his impending marriage.	"My boyfriend is extremely insecure about my exs. For the record, my bf is an (ex?) addict whom had been cheated on a bunch. It's a major fear of his and I respect his concerns to the utmost degree. 

There are many reasons my ex and I didn't work - distance, kinks, priorities. And that's okay, and that's something that's open and established with all parties. We have talked about it. There is no secret yearning. 

He's been going out with a new guy for years, and yes, I do have issues with him (No job, cheated on him multiple times before the relationship was opened, does things without asking or checking.. there are other things.). But that's not really my concern or deal. Up until now, their baggage their problem. I'm still friends with them. I hosted a D&D campaign and my ex's boyfriend was part of it. It honestly went great! there are many things I don't respect about my ex's BF, but I can still put that aside and not burden myself with the problems of others... Mostly. 

I got a postcard in the mail about their impending marriage and messaged my ex with a ""Congratulations!"" message and he replied:

""Did they send it to you too?""

Turns out, he wasn't involved with the planning of the wedding, the guests of the wedding, and additionally the boyfriend sent messages to people whom he hadn't of even come out to yet. 

This is extremely, extremely concerning to me. Not as an ex - As a friend. I have my own shit going on and I'm not about to fuck that up - but still, That's fucked up right? (I'm seriously asking). 

Turns out my ex was coming to town today to a bar event in the gay district. I offered to meet up with him and to let him vent. I feel like he dosen't have a voice sometimes and by letting him speak freely without judgement he might have a better understanding of either A) what's required to make his relationship work, or at the very least B) It's okay to feel how you feel.

My best friend happens to be going to the same bar event that the ex was going to, so, I asked my partner if I could go and let him vent and talk about the future for a bit. 

It did not go well.

My bf thinks I'm being shady because I first learned that he was coming to town on tuesday, and I told him thursday that I think it would be a good idea to let him vent. 

I figured because my bestie is someone whom we both know and trust it would be okay. Also, I'm being open an honest about the whole thing. I've offered to show my BF the messages that ex and I sent each other, but he refuses to read.

He thinks I was withholding information from him. It's true. I didn't ask to go until today because I suspected he would react the way he did. If there is going to be an argument, I'd rather it last a day then three. But still, I respect his insecurity and I did not go. 

But I'm still being treated like I'm a prick for even suggesting this. I think I need a different perspective. AITA?"		1	0

My girlfriend is a little chubby, but she‚Äôs gorgeous. I love her body even though she‚Äôs really self conscious about it. No matter how much I try to reassure her, she doesn‚Äôt care for my opinion. As she‚Äôs told me, her opinion of herself is what matters. 

Anyway, whenever we go on vacations she gets depressed when I send her our photos (I‚Äôm the designated photographer). But I noticed that she‚Äôs very happy when she looks ‚Äúthin‚Äù from certain angles or clothing, and thinks more fondly of the memory.

Edit: Okay well.. am I less of an asshole if I note that the photoshopped version of her is how I see her in person? I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs fat at all. Photos just don‚Äôt always do her justice and I think it‚Äôs unfair for her to judge herself based on bad angles."	Asshole	0	0

Anyways, we start talking about how much money the US puts into the DOD and he brings up how much money is put into Medicare. 

He starts this conversation by saying that this isn‚Äôt his view but it‚Äôs interesting to think about: 

He starts to go on about how much money the US would save if people who no longer pay taxes (retired people) and older people who were heavily reliant on any type of health care  to stay alive just died or were sentenced to death. Personally, I had a hard time even debating this or even just thinking about it as it was so morally and ethically wrong. But he started to get louder and louder about the topic, to the point where people around us could hear him (including an old couple sitting next to us). Now I understand he stated this isn‚Äôt his view and that he was just playing devils advocate, but he started to get so loud and passionate about it that I was starting to question what his views really were and whether he has any empathy at all. At one point in the conversation he said VERY loudly ‚ÄúPeople in this world need to die‚Äù.

In addition to this, I told him that he was making me uncomfortable and he lashed out at me for judging him on opinions that aren‚Äôt necessarily his and that he is just trying to have a dinner conversation?

I‚Äôm a female in my late twenties. I work doing patient cares and have been at my job for 2.5 years. I got this job after my sibling took her life and for a long time it helped me tremendously. I became very close with my co workers (big mistake as you‚Äôll see) but I think it was because I missed my sibling so much. We were only a year apart and did everything together. I have diagnosed complex PTSD from the circumstances and trauma surrounding her death.

Last month a movie triggered my PTSD so bad that I have anxiety attacks that keep me up all night, flashbacks, traumatic images, sounds, memory issues, misremembering events. I have been working with my boss to obtain FMLA. 

One of my co workers, well call her Stephanie. Stephanie made up a lie about me that I was tattling on everyone and saying they didn‚Äôt work hard. This caused my work best friend, well call her Susan, to get angry with me and ask me for space for over two weeks. Susan continued to hang out with Stephanie and my anxiety got so bad that I‚Äôve missed even more work. Last night I talked to Susan and thought everything is okay, but then she texted me and said I was selfish and everything was about me, and that she‚Äôs said really mean and personal things about me to multiple people at work and outside of work but that she‚Äôs sorry and won‚Äôt do it again.

As a result, I had an anxiety attack all night and missed work again. I emailed my boss and explained that I was being gossiped about to the point where I feel bullied, at a time in my life where I am seeking serious mental help. I begged to be transferred to another department because I‚Äôm so scared that people will misconstrue and gossip about anything I say or do. 

So, WIBTA for asking to leave the environment? It‚Äôs a smaller company but I‚Äôd be happy to lie about the reason I want to move departments and not tell any co workers the real reason. Also..WIBTA for not feeling like I can trust Susan anymore? She believed a rumor about me and spread personal information about me for two weeks and I don‚Äôt feel mentally well enough to trust her again, even though this is the first time we‚Äôve fought. Thanks.

c35up9	2019-06-21 04:03:50	paytonsglove	AITA for going out of town while putting an offer in on a house that my wife and I both want?	"For  the past 6 months my wife and I have been talking seriously about  looking for another house. Bigger, better, etc. We started  some of the projects around our current house in order to get  to the point where we felt we could buy/sell.

I  have been a firm believer that it is ok for window shop online to get a  feel for what is out there. It seems like a good idea to get to know  the market, right? BUT, I told my wife that I thought it was a bad  idea to go look at these places in person in case we find one  we love and our home isn't ready to sell.

Guess  what? She wanted to go and I reminded her of my feelings, but she  insisted. I agreed, but reminded her that looking doesn't mean  buying because our house needs some things done and  some of those things take time to get lined up.

So,  we start looking at houses with our realtor. We look at 10 or so houses  and we find ""the one."" It's really nice! It's in the price range, it  checks most of the boxes for ""wants"" and all of the ""needs."" However, as  I told her many times, our house wasn't ready. I agreed that this house  was very nice and fit our needs. So, my wife went into another mode.  From shopping - to preparing the house ASAP.  We have been going like  crazy. We took some time off from work and we had family  over to help deep clean, work on the yard, make repairs, etc.  We are  going to put in a contingent offer tomorrow.

We  made a lot of progress on the house projects. However, there are a  couple projects that need completed. One of those projects is mine to  finish. I have been working on it for a week off and on, but our fence  is HUGE and it is taking a long time to get it pressure washed and  painted. The pressure washing is done now, and it needs some boards  replaced and it needs paint. Not a problem. HOWEVER, my best friend is  getting married and I have had his bachelor party on the calendar for a  while. It's this weekend. I'm the best man. But my  wife tells me that I am leaving her with this huge mess and she won't be  able to reach me for part of the weekend due to poor cell coverage in  the area where we are going. What happens if they counter offer and she  can't get to me? I told her that I can be reached 80% of the time and I  will check my texts whenever we get into coverage and I'll call her if  she needs me to. I'll be back Sunday night. The fence can be finished next week. Our house  will be ready to go on the market the following week. She just keeps  mentioning that it would be better if I was staying home and how it will  be hard for her to get anything done (kids) while I'm gone, etc.

She  has made comments about how I am leaving her with this stressful  situation (she partially created it though!) I told her that she is  making me feel really guilty about going on this weekend trip. I told  her that I would stay home and work on the house if that's what she  wants. She told me to go, but I know what she really wants. But I'm  going anyway. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c35uis	2019-06-21 04:03:21	princessnokia_	AITA for scheduling a 6AM appointment at 10PM?	"This might seem dumb, but I‚Äôm trying to figure out if i am justified or not. 

I was searching for someone to do my braids after my hairbraider moved out of town, and finally after a long time of searching I was suggested a stylist that fit my taste. I impulsively booked an appointment for as early as I could and only after I booked the appointment did I realize it was late. Her website only had slots for 6:45AM or 6:50AM. 

Part of me feels bad but the other part of me thinks that she wouldn‚Äôt allow anyone to book that early if she didn‚Äôt want to take any clients."	No A-holes here	0	0
