c7nt0z	2019-07-01 03:57:47	sbtrey23	AITA for wanting to sleep in my bed when I’m my moms house even though I’ve moved out?	"So in August 2018, my fiancée and I bought our first house in South Carolina and each moved out of our parents house. In May or June of 2018 (while living at my mom’s house), I decided to finally upgrade to a full bed after sleeping in a twin for 24 years. The logic was that my fiancée and I were sick of squeezing into a twin. At first I thought it was a waste because I knew we were looking for a house but her logic was we are still going to visit and when we do, it’ll be nice to sleep in a full instead of a twin. 

So anyways, fast forward to this summer. I’m home because we are getting married in Vermont (I grew up in Massachusetts). But while home, my brother has taken my room and my bed. He says that I don’t get the bed because I moved out and have my own house. Also, he said technically it’s not my bed because he took my bed to school and the bed at home is a new one that my mom bought to replace it (my mom bought literally the exact same bed). My logic is that I specifically bought the bed to have a nice bed to sleep in when I came home so I should get to sleep in it. Instead, my mom is siding with my brother and relegating me to the day bed in the den. It’s not the worst but it’s the principle. And now, my fiancée doesn’t even want to visit and stay over because a) the den doesn’t have a door and b) we don’t fit comfortably at all in the day bed. 

So AITA for wanting to use the bed I bought despite the fact I’m a homeowner and live 16 hours away?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c7nrxr	2019-07-01 03:54:26	a_little_violet	AITA for getting annoyed when people speak in another language in a predominately English speaking online group?	"So I'm a part of a little online community - a discord server, to be precise - of maybe about 30-40 people. I wouldn't say everyone there is friends necessarily, but we are all acquaintances at the least. A few people in the server speak Korean - including the person running the server - and from time to time in the middle of discussions they will either speak an entire sentence in Korean or just a couple of words in Korean to each other.

&#x200B;

Just to be clear, these are by no means private discussions between individuals, they are general discussions that oftentimes involve other people who don't know Korean. It's not that I have a problem with other languages besides English, it just bothers me because it kind of feels like I'm missing out on part of the conversation. But so far I've kept my opinion to myself and never complained about it to them.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I can see I'm in the wrong here - I'll try to be more understanding about it in the future. Thanks!"	Asshole	0	0

c7nqgi	2019-07-01 03:49:53	kaiiuchiha	WIBTA for taking a break from a friend who has little to no care about herself?	"My friend, we’ll call her laura, has been throwing up for 2 months straight. She doesn’t have health insurance, she isn’t very good with money because she’s financially irresponsible. I’ve had to cover a few of her hospital bills as it is but now she’s refusing to go to the hospital because she can’t afford it. So instead, she just drinks and parties constantly knowing she’s clearly sick with something. I’ve warned her that if she’s throwing up all the time she needs to not party/drink alcohol because it will only make it worse but she continues to do drugs (and by drugs i mean coke) and drink and then complain about how she’s sick. A few days ago I had enough and I sent the address to a few free clinics and she ignored it. At this point I just feel like I need a break because she’s clearly not going to listen to me but continue to complain and it’s annoying for me. 
The thing is, we’ve been friends for 10 years, so I feel like if i take a break from this friendship it’ll be a shit move because she’s not well and it’ll make me out to be an asshole but it’s something that’s just annoying and intolerable rn, PLUS she got dumped a few weeks ago so she’s going through that as well.

c7npjx	2019-07-01 03:47:07	mydadabortedme	AITA for being pissed about girlfriends sister coming to stay at out apartment while we’re gone?	"So my girlfriend’s sixteen year old sister is coming to stay at me(21M) and GFs(21F) apartment while we are gone to house sit for GFs mother. I’m upset for a few different reason and GFs mom thinks I’m overreacting. 

1.	I didn’t even find out until a week ago. I wasn’t consulted at all by GFs mom on whether how I felt about it.  TBH I would have said sure if maybe someone talked to me about it. However my GF didn’t really get a discussion either, her mom just called her and said that she had bought tickets for her to come. I think that’s pretty unfair that we didn’t even get a choice especially for a place that we live at. 

2.	Sister and mom are getting upset that we aren’t letter sister use the car. First off sister is not on our insurance. Second her sister is very irresponsible with driving, she has had her license less than a year and has totaled two cars, has been in numerous wrecks, and constantly smokes weed and drives. This is due to GFs mom spoiling her (GFs family is pretty wealthy) and letting her kind of do whatever she wants without consequence. I don’t want anything happening to our car due to this past history of recklessness. Sister and Mom are getting really nasty about sister not being able to use the car. We live downtown in a major city and everything is within walking distance and we have decent public transport, but that’s not good enough the sister ***needs*** the car for some reason and it’s really wearing down on my GF and I. 

3.	She’s bringing her other teenage friend with her, and then together is a god damn nightmare. I get it I’m a young guy and I know what it’s like being 16 and wreaking havoc with your friend, we all do. BUT I know better than to trust two 16 year olds in my home. I’m afraid it will be trashed and no one will be held accountable for if anything goes really wrong. We also live in a small apartment complex that has mostly old people and is pretty quiet most nights, I don’t want to have to be responsible for two 16 year olds staying at my apartment and causing trouble. 

So AITA here? GFs mom and sister are really being an ass to me and GF saying that we shouldn’t worry despite us having adequate reason to worry. 

TL;DR found out a week ago GFs sister is coming to stay at our apartment while we are gone. I don’t like the idea especially because me and GF were never asked if it was ok. Mom is being an asshole in turn because of our apprehensiveness."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My girlfriend and I have been dating for several months now, and our friend groups have sort of meshed together. One of the people in our friend group is a girl we’ll call Ellison. Ellison and my girlfriend have been friends for over a year, and are super close.

Before my girlfriend and I got together, she dated a guy who we’ll call Leo. My girlfriend broke up with him after almost a year because they never spent much time together and they were growing apart. She seemed to be completely over him once we started dating.

A couple weeks ago, Leo and Ellison started talking properly, and are now exclusive. Ellison already asked my girlfriend whether she was okay with it (not that she needed her permission), and my girlfriend said she was. 

However, my girlfriend recently started making comments about them such as, “Now she has to deal with *insert friend of Leo*” or “I’m interested to see how this turns out”. My girlfriend is normally a nice person, and I know she loves Ellison more than anything. But for the past week or so, she’s been making odd remarks about her and Leo.

It’s been starting to get on my nerves. I don’t want to seem like a crazy boyfriend, but why does she care so much about Ellison and Leo? She told me she’s completely fine with them being together, but the comments she’d made about them (mostly Leo) to me says otherwise. It’s starting to annoy me, and I don’t know what to say to her. I’ve started taking longer to reply to texts (we’re somewhat in a LDR) and sending back dry replies whenever she brings the two of them up.

Part of me thinks she’s looking out for Ellison, as any friend would, but another part of me thinks she’s not happy to see them together.

I often don't bother to close the curtains while changing my clothes - it takes a few seconds for me to chabge and usually I turn my back towards the window anyway. However, this woman living across me told me (in a polite, but ""fuck you"" manner) that it is indecent for me to flash her kids and family every time I change my clothes and my bra is exposed. 

My bedroom is my own personal space, so I'm wondering if I'm really being indecent here? AITA?

**Edit:**

since there's some confusion, here's a reply I made to a comment:

> Bra is the term she used, but of course I change  out my bra sometimes when I change clothes and I think she might also be implying that. But as I mentioned, if I take off everything, I usually turn my back towards the window. (Side boob not guaranteed)

Basically what she said was ""and sometimes we can even see your whole, you know,... bra... *(does a very big hand sweeping motion around her chest area)* top""

As for what's gonna happen next, I'll see what can be done. I just didn't like being called, in her exact words, ""fairly indecent, I'm sure your parents will not feel happy if they know you're just showing people your body like that, honey"", when I am: 

(1) changing 10 feet away from my window in my room, 

(2) not walking around naked all the time (I don't think you can even see the lower half of my body through the window, and I have long hair so not even a full bare back). It's literally a few seconds of me changing.

c7nn5k	2019-07-01 03:39:57	infamousjelq	AITA For cutting off a close friend?	"TL;DR at bottom

Posting on a fresh account just to be safe. 

Anyway, A few years ago my close friend started dating this girl and they both got into hard drugs. She seemed to be a lot more reliant on them than he did but they effected him enough to where all of our other friends had picked up on the warning signs. He started treating us like shit, acting manic, and owed some of my friends money. 

The girl dumped him, he ended up moving away, got clean and rectified most of the relationships he had abused and taken for granted. After about a year and a half he moved back and though none of us said it (we should have made it clear) we were all under the impression that our rekindled friendship was based on the fact that he wasn’t going to use drugs. 

He got back into drinking and smoking weed which my friends and I thought was fine as long as he could handle it which he seemed to be able to do. Then he started dating the girl he got into hard drugs with again (who had also gotten clean but via suboxone) which all of our friend group supported despite being weary. They started taking psychedelics which worried us but some of my friends including myself would trip from time to time so we didn’t really think we had the moral high ground to say they couldn’t. 

As the months went on he would only be down to meet up and hang when it was convenient for him and get offended when we were busy or didn’t feel like meeting up and when we did hang I started to see the manic behavior resurfacing. Though this behavior worried me I let it go until one day he kind of explodes because me and another friend didn’t want to meet up exactly when he did and basically says he wants nothing to do with us and he’s going to save up money and move again. Despite him acting completely irrational and impulsive I invite him to a bar me and my friends were at the next day to which he ghosts me. 

About a week passes and he apologizes and wants to hang but at this point I’ve got confirmation his girlfriend has been giving him her suboxone to get fucked up on and I don’t want to be friends with someone who can’t control themselves around substances. It’s been about 2 weeks and he’s text me a couple times which I have ignored and I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for not accepting his apology and attempting to cut him off?

TL;DR: my friend dated a girl, got into hard drugs, fucked over his other friends and myself, moved away then moved back and is displaying similar behavior and after confirming he’s using his girlfriends suboxone and an irrational blow out with him I’ve stopped responding to him.

So I, (18f) just heard from someone that my friend (19m) is apparently gay. This surprised me, seeing as we had been in a relationship about three years ago. However it’s actually pretty ironic considering I have since realized I’m a lesbian. 

Our hometown though is a small, solid-red rural little place in Buttfuck, Mississippi. I’m not saying it’d be physically dangerous if he was outed but that would explain why his tires were recently slashed tbh. It would also really damage his reputation and I’m not sure how well his extremely conservative family would take it.

All this to say that apparently said friend has no idea that people know of or are spreading rumors about his orientation. I kinda feel like he should be informed so he could take whatever measures he wishes to either publicly declare his identity or try to hide it for protection as I’m currently doing. 

I feel like it’d be assholish behavior to privately ask him if he is in fact gay. All I know is that if people had started gossiping about my sexuality I’d want to know so I could try and closet myself better, for lack of a more fitting term.

WIBTA if I did this, or should I mind my own business?


Edit: I’ve gotten some really great advice on how best to handle this with more tact and I agree that I shouldn’t just ask him outright. I’ll simply inform him of the rumors and let him know that I’m actually gay too so he can always talk to me if he wants to.

Edit 2: This just got a lot more convoluted. The person I’d heard the rumors from was asking me how I felt about him being gay. I was a bit confused by the question of course and responded by saying how bad I felt that he didn’t even know about the speculation.

That’s when my friend then stopped and told me that I couldn’t tell him anything. Apparently she wasn’t even supposed to tell me about the rumors. Now I’m even more torn than before because she doesn’t know what it’s like to have your life ruined by being forcefully outed or even publicly having your sexuality questioned.

I still want to tell him about the speculation but it’s just a bit more complicated to do now as supposedly no one’s supposed to mention anything to him about it. But damn that just sounds a bit stupid to me. I haven’t even gotten the chance to talk to him yet. WIBTA if I still did tactfully inform him his orientation was being talked about?"

They have even offered on some occasions to pay my way so I wouldn’t have to work so much because they love me and want me to do well in school above all else. 

Since I moved out about a year ago, I’ve been trying to put a little distance between us because a big reason for my moving down the street was to gain a little independence before moving out of state for graduate school. A minor part of this was creating and paying for my own accounts on Netflix and Hulu and all that (I used to use their accounts). 

Well, my mom called the other day and wanted the password for my Hulu account since she couldn’t figure out how to log on to theirs. I lied and told her I couldn’t remember my password, in part because I use the same password for everything and didn’t want her to know it but also because I don’t want them to know what I’m watching or how much. 

I feel bad about lying and worse about not sharing this little thing with them since they have done *so* much for me, but really I like my privacy from them even if this is just a small part of it (the biggest part being not living with them).

&#x200B;

To understand this problem you need to understand the layout of our apartments. My neighbor and I both live in the basement of a real big house. The basement is split into two apartment. When you come down the stairs from the outside, you open a door into a small room, like 4'x4'. On the left and right are both of our respective doors into our apartments. But straight ahead of the outside door is a small window that goes into his apartment.

&#x200B;

So I don't think my neighbor has any outside windows. I think the only one he has is the one that goes into that small space between our doors. Well, the other day he got what I'm pretty sure is an air conditioner but since he can't put one in a window, he's piping out the exhaust into that small window between our doors. It's making my living room really hot and I can't afford to run my AC all the time just to combat this guy heating my apartment. I went out to check the mail earlier and my door handle was extremely hot. It just seems ridiculous.

&#x200B;

For now I'm opening the outer door for a while at night to help the heat escape but that's not really feasible all the time because there are a lot of break-ins around here and that door is our outer security. Both of our apartment doors are essentially a big piece of glass with blinds hung on the inside but you can see right in. So it's just not safe to leave the outer door open all the time, not to mention it helps keep the temperature down inside the apartments.

&#x200B;

As I mentioned, I'm gonna talk to him first but I just don't expect that to go well. He's a nice guy but he's a pretty inconsiderate neighbor. He plays loud ass music all the time and smoke weed out that same window and it smells up my apartment. I've only lived in this city for a month and I love my apartment otherwise so I'm just really apprehensive to start feuding with my neighbor who I can't really avoid.

So WIBTA if I brought this up to my landlady tomorrow when I see her for something else?

But admittedly, I ignored it and let him add me on snap, because the worst that could happen was he sent me a dick pic and I blocked him. Simple enough. All of this happens with minutes.

We chatted a bit. After asking the usual ""wyd?"" he went straight into asking me what I was looking for. I said I was open to pretty much anything except flings/one night stands, and that I appreciated him asking. He then went more specific and asked me if I was looking for a casual relationship/friends-with-benefits type situation. I told him most likely more a casual relationship than friends with benefits. I then explicitly told him, ""I don't put out immediately - just a heads up."" Then I continued with something along the lines of (I don't remember *exactly* what I said here), ""I would want to make sure we're compatible chemistry wise, and you got to earn my bed with a couple dates, man.""

He then says something like, ""Understandable"" before messaging, verbatim, this ""Can I see what I'm working with 👀"".

Ngl, I'd thought he was liable to send me his dick - I did not think he was going to ask for *my* nudes when we barely started messaging that same day, and I had also clearly said I don't put out immediately. So, I hit him back with, ""So let's reference back to when I said I don't put out immediately. Nudes/partial nudes was included in that.""

All he said was, ""Alrighty then"", and I got annoyed, felt slimey and blocked him on snap and tinder.

Here's where I'm wondering if *I'm* the asshole and maybe I was too quick to jump on this dude: part of a casual relationship is having sex. Duh. So did I somehow confuse this guy by saying I was down for a casual relationship, then getting upset when he asked for a nude pic of me on snap?

I honestly want what I say I want and I don't want a repeat of this scenario if I'm the one being confusing or somehow misleading. So, reddit: am I the asshole?

**UPDATE**: Thank you for all the feedback! It seems the general consensus from the comments is YTA, and I have to say, I agree. Not for having boundaries, but for reacting the way I did. It was way too brash and assuming, two things I don't usually consider myself to be. 

Honestly, all this made me realize I wasn't being as clear as I thought I was being in the moment, and that's mostly because I thought I knew what I wanted, and this interaction made me realize I actually *don't.* I was giving him mixed signals, and that had everything to do with me trying to kid myself into believing I was ready to play the field again when I'm not. 

Now I'm just sorry this dude was a sort of collateral damage in my realization. I regret blocking him now, because now I can't even apologize, explain what happened and have us both move on with what we actually want from other people. 

Man, being an asshole sucks. But at least I know I won't make the same mistake twice? Thank you for your input, guys. 

Sidenote: my Tinder has been put on pause until I can get my shit together and figure out what I really want, just to prevent this from happening again. Damn I really want to apologize to that guy. So if he ever comes across this and thinks, ""Hmm, this seems familiar...."" Hey, guy! I'm so so so so sorry, but at least you know for sure now - you're NTA, it was 100% me, and I wish you well."

Today is June 30th and people have decided to have fireworks, fairly common because we each have 4 acres to ourselves all across our street. Also relevant, my dad is disabled. Heavily disabled. Like he has a wheel chair, 2 stump legs, heart issues, lung issues, sugar issues, liver issues. He's repeatedly seen the hospital months at a time, nearly died repeatedly, probably has less than 2 years left. Two of the things we enjoy about our land is our small patch of apple trees and allowing the dogs to get to run. Our neighbors don't like this so much. My dad drove out (he has to drive instead of walking / wheeling 100ft, because disabled) to look at our trees and try to pick some apples. about an hour later the cops roll up, he was back inside at this time and had to talk to them through (split level house) downwards window, because he couldn't get up the stairs. Not long after, we had our dogs in O U R yard, which isn't fence and the dogs will occasionally bark but never cross the border. Hour later. Cops. Should i mention i have ptsd because of a cop, occasionally triggering flashbacks? (it's gotten better, but still). We tell the neighbors to fuck off (more politely). They tell us to fuck off less politely. I went outside to put boxes in my car, and i see them launching fireworks. If they were awesome, i'd either leave them alone or want to join with them. But, they're assholes making it hell for my disabled dad and my ptsd striken ass. I come back inside and tell my mom i wanna call the non emergency number. She says we should be the bigger man.

c7n84l	2019-07-01 02:57:02	kindrevenge	AITA for giving a charity donation as a wedding gift?	"&#x200B;

I was invited to an old high school friend's wedding. She had both a bridal shower and a 'stag and doe' beforehand (which if you don't know is a fundraiser-type party couples throw to raise money for their wedding). 

&#x200B;

Taking the train to another city and buying a bridal shower gift was already rough on my bank account, so it was disappointing when I attended the stag and doe and discovered the entry fee was $35. It was hosted in a basement bingo-hall-type place with DIY carnival games (like throwing coins at a bottle). They charged $5 to play each game, and charged $2 for snacks (which was mostly discount halloween candy). Near the end of the night, her and her mom effectively stopped hosting and were counting the money in front of everyone.  


I was probably being super judgmental, but the whole thing felt greedy and tasteless to me. Plus all the gifts on her registry were expensive as hell.  


That being said, she WAS having a very big wedding. I was even invited and we hadn't spoken in years. I knew she became a devout Christian and conservative since meeting her fiancé because of her posts on Facebook ('why don't we help the homeless instead of migrants', etc). So I decided for a wedding gift to donate $200 to a charity in her and her husband-to-be's names. It was a charity dedicated to resolving homelessness. 

  
I put the donation confirmation in a pretty card and added it to the gifts & money pile at her wedding. 

&#x200B;

Four days later, I get an FB message from her asking for a tax receipt for the donation. I told her that I had asked but unfortunately the charity wasn't able to provide one since the receipt can only be issued to the payer. She just responds 'k.'

&#x200B;

About five minutes pass and one of her bridesmaids messages me a psycho rant on Facebook calling me 'petty' and 'trash', that my gift was an 'insult' and I'm 'lucky i was even invited' to the 'party of the year' (lol).

&#x200B;

Her and I aren't super close anymore, she was in my wedding a few years back and we chat probably once a month or so. We mainly like Instagram Posts. Well I was asked to be in the wedding back in September and I excitedly agreed.



 I am the only one in our group that works a non traditional job - I am a GM of a late night restaurant so I usually work weekends and have Monday/Tuesdays off. Because of this, I was unable to attend the dress shopping trip that was in LA (about 6 hours away from me). I already feel terrible about missing out on that. 



We had been trying for a baby and recently got pregnant - we are due in late December. As the date of the trip gets closer - last week of august - I am getting more and more anxious at the thought of traveling 6 hours one way and taking time off work (Th-Sun) and spending money on this ($180 + gas). I will already have to take the weekend off of the wedding and I only get 8 days of PTO a year and have used 3 for baby appointments. I don't get paid leave - just what CA provides so money will be tight anyway and I planned on using my PTO as well to supplement my time off. 



I would love to go and be a part of this, especially because I feel like I missed so much already, but I feel like it wouldn't be the smart decision. I am also weirdly nervous about being away while pregnant for multiple days. And a little selfishly, sad I can't participate in all the activities as they are planning a bar crawl and jet skis.

c7n5t0	2019-07-01 02:50:20	yqjjqy	AITA for calling out a salesperson who suggested I broke the defective merchandise	"Today I was in a small jewelry store and bought a pair of emerald ear studs.  It was sixty-something dollars. It’s a nice boutique in NYC in a large shopping complex. The ear studs were on the display shelf when I asked to check them out, so the salesperson directly took them from the shelf and put them in a small fabric bag. She then put the fabric bag inside a small paper bag and handed me the paper bag directly. Neither of us inspected it closely. I paid, said bye and walked out with the paper bag. 

When I was on the subway, I threw away the paper bag and just put the fabric bag with the ear studs inside my cross-body purse.  There were just my wallet and my phone in my purse. 

When I got home and took out the ear studs, I noticed one of the posts to which the backing was attached to was noticeably bent. Now I have sensitive ears and they are pierced less than a year ago, so I absolutely cannot use ear studs with a bent post. I thought, ok, this happened, I’ll get an exchange. I put the studs back to the fabric bag and put them in my backpack’s compartment. 

Now I went back to the store a few hours later and the salesperson was still there. She asked what’s wrong to which I replied describing the problem, while taking out the fabric bag from my backpack. Without apologizing or expressing regret that this happened, she said, “well you are supposed to use the paper bag I gave you,”and suggested that things in the backpack might bang against the back of the ear studs. 

At that point I thought it was ridiculous that being inside a compartment of a nice leather bag would cause brass to bend so badly. 

Since only store credit was available, I wanted to exchange it with another bracelet (string bracelet with stones) since I couldn’t trust the store with producing quality metal anyways.  Her manager or coworker was there. She then started wrapping the bracelet in tissue paper. I asked, is the tissue paper necessary, and she replied, “yes, to protect it this time.” I said thank you. 

Before walking out of the store with the bracelet I turned around and said, “I can’t believe you suggested that I broke the ear studs. It’s not your fault this happened but you didn’t even ask how and when I noticed it.” I then pointed out it took me another trip to get it returned and that I was amazed she did not appreciate that and I just assumed I broke it in half a day. Now normally I wouldn’t say this to anyone in front of their manager unless they refuse my return or give me trouble, but I just thought the return was handled in an unprofessional manner so just had to point it out."

"Quick background: my brother in law (wife’s brother), his wife, his infant daughter, and his two dogs moved into my house while an addition is being put on his house. It hasn’t been easy for any of us but generally we all get along really well, and we are making the best of a tough situation. They’ve been living here for about 4 months now, and I have not asked for rent. All I have asked is that they pay the delta in the average monthly bills. So far they have paid a total of $67.

This past weekend they had to go to a funeral out of state and assumed my wife and I would watch the dogs, only informing us on Thursday night. Unfortunately, my wife and I had plans all weekend. We agreed to take the dogs anyway, but were pretty clear that next time they needed to give us more notice (they’ve known about the funeral for two weeks). And this isn’t the first time they've left for over a day and assumed we would feed and take out the dogs. 

Apparently one of them complained to my wife's mom who ended up taking both the dogs (unplanned) and their baby (planned). She seems to think my wife and I are being assholes here. My sister in law is also none too happy with us. My argument is that we’ve done quite enough and don’t owe them anything right now. What do you think Reddit?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7n53h	2019-07-01 02:48:16	UnimpulsiveDesires	AITA when I say no to my little sister A LOT with reason (Warning, not for those that lose interest easily)	"  

After a lot of petty bickering between my 19 year old self and my 12 year old sister im left in thought of if im just a shitty older brother or is my sister just a toxic person at heart, or maybe a hint of both.

There was a point of time when there was only 1 charger in a household of 4 people that used the same phone. Shortly later I bought my own, and everyone that had money bought theirs and the remaining charger went to my little sister. After that there would be a few incidents where she would lose her Power Adapter. Maybe the first 1 or 2 times I would let her use mine but after that I started to feel as if she depended on using my stuff which I didn't appreciate, so I started saying no the next 12 times she asked. What doesn't help is that one time when she asked me and I was curious about what happened to the 3 older ones that were lost months ago so I looked under her bed to find three of them (they weren't even that hidden either), which told me that she didn't even bother to look for her lost one she just went straight to my room to take mine because she didn't see hers in the usual spot.

Fast forward she asks for it again and in a summary, I said no out of annoyance from her asking me for the 13th time, I try to go get one of the three that she was hoarding without her know how, we didn't find it, she asks me one more time, I still say no, and she screams saying im ""a very terrible and mean sibling"" which after the 15th time i start to feel it just a little.

However this is not just me complaining about my little sister, I believe at times I could be an asshole. When she asks if I could watch her and her friends at some amusement park and she does this every 2-3 months. I always decline for reasons that one, I'd rather be playing my games and I'm kind of addicted, but also because I feel as if she doesn't listen to me and respect me at all so watching her could get out of hand (proven when I tried to take her to Walmart but this was before that happened). Also it should be noted that she tends to ask you to do something without giving you the full details until it's too late. With that reason I ended up programming myself to say no to pretty much 75% of the things she asks me to do which may not be the best thing to do. This is all I can think of in my end besides being apathetic at times, but on her end I can't explain the things she done because this post would easily go over 12,000 characters minimum.

With all this being said, maybe I am an asshole because I believe I can be apathetic to my little sister who is still only 12 at times (though I try not to be but sometimes it hard when she bombards me with reasons how I am mom's favorite and I get everything I want and she gets it the worst, when in reality I always did what my mother tells me, got good grades, and be respectful to other people at her age, and she is the opposite in my eyes. I don't want to make this over the limit, so what do you guys/gals/etc think?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Last year I inherited money from my late father, while I'm out of country for the most part of the year studying, I gave a part of that money to my grandfather to pay for medical expenses(8000 us dollar) , as he has heart problems and need to be checked on once in a while. My grandparents lived together and have lived together for around 20 years, and my grandmother is not my biological grandmother.

Sadly my grandfather died of a sudden heart attack this spring while I was abroad and didn't spend the money for medicine. My grandfather has an fairly large saving himself for this country anyway (25k dollars) , and my grandmother got 2/3 of the total money including the money I gave him, which adds to 22k, me and his other grandson each received 1/6 as law permits around 5,5k each. 

Insight in relationship: me and my grandfather are very close, I'm not so close with my grandmother as she is not my biological one, 
For a fact I know my grandfather would've left me more money if he had to write a will. We don't see the other grandson much either.

c7mzjd	2019-07-01 02:32:25		AITA for not being supportive of Mom’s “job”	"My mother has been listless in the working world ever since her career got badly shafted:  let go after 20 years in the district.  She went back to college to get a degree in a new field, but clearly doesn’t enjoy what she does now, and barely works one day a week.  It’s been like pulling teeth to get her to get herself back to working, *years* later.  Imagine losing an entire full time income and benefits.  And she’s older so of course she doesn’t have the drive to start over.

She’s talented at crafts, and I was super supportive of her setting up a booth at market to sell them bc she needs money and what better way than doing something she likes?  But she got discouraged from low sales and bc her workspace became too cluttered to use, so she quit that and moved on to

Mmmmmmary Kay!  Great.  An MLM.  I listen politely, I’ve bought what I need from her full price to support her.  Even let her drag me along to a couple events (though I clearly am not a fan), but I *staunchly* refuse to join her.  She’s IMO very brainwashed, bc she at one point said I should quit *my* full time job to join her selling Mary Kay.  That’s a ludicrous idea, again IMO.

Thing is.  This is the only thing I’ve seen her get excited about in YEARS.  She enjoyed crafts, but she’s not an entrepreneur, it was a hobby.  But this Mary Kay thing is a team environment, which is what she excels in.  She’s perked up, leaving the house, all that.

She’s also putting a lot of her own money into it bc she doesn’t make the crazy sales goals MK has.  And those have ramped up, she’s under a lot of pressure right now.  She’s always asking me to pimp her out to my friends and I keep telling her I don’t *have* friends to sell to.  Everyone is poor.  *I’m* poor.  We poor.

But what I do have is social media.  And here’s the drain that all of the above circles:

Am I a selfish douchebag for not doing one simple thing and tweeting out my Mom’s info?  It might help her out.  I have a very good reason not to:  it’s possible to doxx me based on her contact info.  But even so, the guilt is eating me up.  Bc i wouldn’t have questioned it this hard if it was her crafts she was selling.  But I don’t want an MLM on my social media.  I don’t want to be that guy.  And y’all know how gross people are, sometimes.  I don’t want to tweet something controversial and find a dead animal in my mailbox, or worse, a person emailing my thirst tweets to my boss.

And I see this is making her happy, but it’s also doomed to fail bc she’s just syphoning money into it.  I’m so conflicted.  Am I as big of an asshole as I feel like for not just making some damn MLM posts on twitter?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c7myv4	2019-07-01 02:30:27	BibleQuest	AITA for Yelling at My Sister	"Sis loves to get dogs, but she never raises them properly. The first was a dog we'll call Max. My brother-in-law (Sis's husband) used to basically torment Max by jumping out at him. He thought it was funny until he scared Max so badly once that Max was visibly shaking for a few days after when he saw my brother-in-law. Max had bladder problems before. He would pee from excitement whenever we came home, and he couldn't be around other dogs without snapping at them. When my dad, another sister who eventually moved out, and I moved away, Sis decided we were taking Max with us, and she wouldn't take no for an answer. My dad was never a dog person, but my sister and I convinced him. We are both dog lovers, and we were able to take pretty good care of her.

Flash forward 3 years. Max is making the porch smell like urine, has no obedience training, constantly barks when somebody gets close to the house, and tears up our cords and furniture. My dad had said for the past 3 years that he didn't want Max in the house anymore. I have a health condition that makes it to where I can't get to hot, and I feel like my insides are melting). I about had it with cleaning up after. Today, my dad and I had to get rid of our old furniture, buy all new furniture, and set it up inside. We were on our way to pay the guy were buying from, and we decided to take Max with us for a ride.

Max pissed all over me in the car. Hot. Wet. Piss. From my shirt all the way down to my socks. I had had enough. We took Max back to the house. I took a shower and washed my clothes. When my dad got back, I said I was ready to make Sis take Max in. I called Sis, put her on speaker, and told her that she was taking Max back--end of discussion. Sis tried to make light of what her husband had done to Max, saying it was only one time, and claiming that Max was more of our other sister's dog anyway. (Sis had fought physically with our sister for the title of Max's mother.)

30 minutes later, our dad suddenly said ""I don't think I want Max gone."" I was shocked by this for reasons I said earlier. He called Sis, but she said that she and her husband were about to pull into our driveway. They came in, and my dad said that he had a change of heart and not to take Max.

Sis absolutely went off on me for ""threatening her"" to put it in her words. When I told her that I never threatened her and our dad backed me up because she was on speaker, she changed her argument. She kept saying, ""Do not EVER talk to me like that again. After all that I have done for you, for this family, do not ever talk to me like you just did."" Over and over. She said I demeaned her and implied that she didn't deserve this.

I should also mention that I wasn't mad at Max at all. I was tired of taking care of him. I was angry at my sister and brother-in-law for not training Max and then replacing him as soon as they could. They left empty-handed, and I started crying as soon as they were in their car."

Lines are not organized and can be confusing. I'm helping customers and I notice a commotion. I guess a guy thought it was his turn when it wasn't. Some guy got very angry over being cut. ""Hey you can go ahead of me"" was said but the offer wasn't accepted. The guy just wouldn't let it go. He kept being a huge asshole about it. I don't know what he wanted as he was given the opportunity to go ahead of the other guy. That could have easily ended it.

I guess he just wanted to curse and yell about it. I think the other guy said something back to him after the repeated verbal abuse and passive aggressiveness. It just enraged the other guy. 

The dude who couldn't let it go got in the guy's personal space and face. I thought he was going to hit him. I was about to toss the belligerent guy out but our staff is so quick one of the parties was done with his transaction and left the building.

The asshole angry guy remained. He kept going on and on about it. He started asking customers if he was right. I think they were afraid of him and they said ""yes."" Everyone was trying to avoid eye contact and him. 

I don't know why but I asked the guy if he wanted my opinion and if he wouldn't get mad if I voiced it. He said yes. I told him he was way out of line and over the top. I tried to speak to him in a very respectful manner. The guy got angry at me and asked me if he wasn't allowed to object to being cut in line? I told him not like that, I thought he was going to hit the other guy. The guy told me he'd never do anything like that and I told him everything I observed made me think he was. The guy was glaring at me the whole time. I don't know if he was aware how aggressive he was in his body language. I told him I was just voicing my opinion. 

His argument for what he did was because the guy said something back to him. It was literally a minor remark that I'm sure most people would have said if they had just endured a this guys anger, cursing, and insults. This guy was in his fifties but he sounded like a baby."		1	0

I asked to have a sleepover with her and i had to lie and say I didn’t like her anymore because i know it would make her concerned that I’m having a sleepover with someone i like. We’re not going to do anything like some of you may be thinking, but from personal experience i just feel like she won’t understand even if I tell her that I’m going to remain abstinent.

EDIT: thank you to everyone who gave me good and honest advice. I was a bit confused before but thanks to you guys I’m sure of the right thing to do. I shouldn’t keep secrets like that from my mom and i know we can try to work it out. I don’t think I have the courage to do it now though because she doesn’t really want me dating right now. I mean I’m sure she would be fine but she’s sort of iffy about it and she’s sort of controlling. Some of the rules she makes don’t make sense so I’m worried that she might forbid sleepovers with her or other girls. But, I’m sure I’ll figure it out and I’m sure I’m just overthinking it right now.

My older sister (30F) is a complete attention whore and it has only gotten worse since she gave birth to my niece. She knows I don't like babies or being bombarded with baby pictures yet she keeps flooding my text messages with pictures of my niece.

I get it, this child is of my relation, but I live no where near my family and I simply do not care about getting constant updates on  my niece when its not like she's doing anything other than crapping, drinking formula, and sleeping. 

I've explained this to my sister and she keeps doing it but then crying to our parents that I'm not validating the pictures so they all think I'm being an asshole. I feel like I'm being indifferent and even though I  feel my boundaries are constantly being violated.

The only one who agrees with me is my oldest sister (33F) who also doesn't have or like kids to a lesser degree than me. So reddit, would I be the asshole if I blocked or muted my sisters texts?

c7mvzv	2019-07-01 02:22:27	curtesy	WIBTA If I told my girlfriend I wanted to move out of our shared apartment on my birthday?	"Me (26F) and my gf (20F) currently have been living together for over a year together in an apartment. Since moving in, she has slowly become more and more of a different person, and lately has not been going to work half the of the days shes scheduled and constantly talking about how she wants to get a second bed for the apartment so she can ""sleep well"". This month, I have finally had the last straw and she said she cannot pay rent (due to not going to work last week) and excepts me to shoulder her half ON MY BIRTHDAY until she can come up with the rent in a few weeks time.

&#x200B;

Now, I don't hold my birthday particularly holy or anything, but it's my one special day that I get to celebrate me, so I'd at least like to not have to pay for her laziness to keep my apartment. So my question is: Would I be the asshole if I told her on my birthday that I am actively looking for a new place to live and am planning on moving out ASAP?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just had the conversation with her and she seems excited about the idea. I guess when she had been making complaints like ""the bed is too crowded at night"" she was actually trying to give me hints to make the move so she wouldn't have to."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Apparently it was quite the meet cute and the two could barely finish a sentence in front of each other. It came up that I was a mutual friend and my male friend told the female friend to say hi.

Later today she came to me and told me how she thought she'd really felt a connection with this guy and that she got the feeling when she met him that he very much felt the same way.

Problem is, I know the guy is married...just not happily. I didn't tell her because I didn't think it was my place to share this information. Who knows where he and his wife are at, if they have an open marriage or are on a break or even if he was totally ok with risking an affair.

I recently graduated from college and moved back in with my family to pursue a career and graduate school in my hometown. My room hasn’t changed since high school. So, I’m in the process of redoing it. As I was going through my shelves, I ran across a stack of Stephen King novels that were given to me by one of my dad’s coworkers. I loved reading them in middle/high school and I wanted to keep them since I’m trying to get back into reading for fun and I haven’t read them all. My dad saw this and seemed uncomfortable about it though. He had a long-term affair with this coworker, which obviously drove a wedge in my parents’ marriage when I was about to graduate from high school. My mom chose to stay with him though.

My boyfriend (K) is a very picky eater, but told me that he PROMISED he would try what I make because he knows I want him to try new things. He's 27 and only eats fast food. All. The. Time.

I made stuffed bell peppers, asked him to try and he said he would later because he wasn't hungry. I held him to his promise and saved some for him. Later he told me his brother (P) had some, said that P didn't say if they were good or bad, said he tried a bit of his and that they were ""alright."" I was suspicious just because of the way he answered but gave him the benefit of the doubt because I'm not going to accuse him of lying unless there is proof.

Flash forward to the next day, K has already gone to work, P comes in and says ""hey, I tried the bell peppers, they were really good, thanks!"" then he asked what K thought.I told him what he said, and that K had told me he just tried some of P's. P. Said he never had any of his and just figured that K tried mine, because when P told K that they were good, K agreed as if he tried some of mine. (Also the other lie, because K told me that P didn't say anything about it).

So P and I agreed that I should say something to K because that's a dumb thing to lie about. This is how the texts went

Me: so you liked the bell peppers?
K: M, stop obsessing about it.
M: I was just asking because I planned to make more tonight.
K: no thanks.
M: *realizing I'm not going to get a confession* You lied to me about trying it and I KNEW it.
K: I would much rather you spend your time looking for a job than feeding me. (I am between jobs, trying to find one in the city he lives in)
M: yup. You lied to me and I'm mad at you.
K: I think I understand that you're mad.
M:I think I understand that you don't care that I'm mad or why I'm mad.
K: You're right.

Now we've had some group hangouts with him, his wife, and a couple other friends we know, but it was implied that anyone was welcome. 

But last week we had a chance to catch up again after a month of no talking, since we got ridiculously busy. He asked me if I was available to get dinner sometime so we could catch up in person (never said anything about his wife coming along or other friends), and I said sure let's do it. We make the plans and it's all set. 

When dinner time comes around, he messages me saying ""I'm at the restaurant"", and I let him know I'll be there soon since I just parked, and he replies, ""We'll get seated at the table, see you inside"".

And I'm thinking, we? Maybe it's a typo. 


Nope. 

I go in and his wife is there too!
I was so upset because I wanted to catch up one on one with him. I do not know her very well (despite my attempts to get to know her), and I'm not comfortable with disclosing certain information and events that recently occurred in my life around her. On top of that I felt like a third wheel the whole time, it was so awkward. 

I sat through the dinner politely and such, did the fake catch up conversations since I couldn't actually say what I wanted, left, and haven't spoken to him since (it's only been a few days).

I just wanted to know if I'm the asshole for being upset about this and WIBTA if I let him know to inform me if his wife is coming along, or that I should assume she is always going to be there here on out. It just felt so rude of him to do, like I'm being forced to accept her presence in EVERY hangout.

c7mk1y	2019-07-01 01:49:17	flamingkatana1	WIBTA if I basically forced my new housemates to room with a stinky old roommate (without their knowledge of his unhygienic practices) because I don't want to room with him?	"At the end of this summer, I will be moving into an apartment for college. The apartment is separated into 3 rooms, two doubles and one triple, so 7 people total. I signed up for and reserved the place as a group of 4 including myself; 2 of these, Andrew and Brian, were my roommates last year, and the last one, Pete, was my roommate two years ago. 
The one year with Pete was pretty tough for me because while he was a mostly decent guy, he absolutely refused to shower. He went weeks without showering or even changing clothes, and really stunk up the room and turned off anyone who wanted to get in (mostly my friends; I stopped calling them over after a month or so). I was pretty vocal about my opinions on this, and told him that I found it gross that he wouldn't wash. He would shower after I told him this, but would soon go back to staying unwashed. He didn't really seem to have many friends, so he would spend most of his time with me. Towards the end of the year, he wanted to room with me again, so I told him that I really couldn't deal with how infrequently he showered and if he wanted to room together I needed him to not smell. He promised that he would, and told me he would show me before the end of the year that he could shower at least every other day. This ended up not happening, so I ended up living with Andrew and Brian.
Pete asked me where I was rooming and ended up rooming right across the hall. I really liked living with Andrew and Brian (we had already been friends for a while), so we decided to live together again this year. Around the time housing registration came up again, Pete came up to us and asked if he could live with us. Initially we said no, because Andrew and Brian had come over to my room in my first year and were familiar with Pete's habits. Once again he tells us that he would fix his habits and was adamant that he wanted to room together, despite the three of us consistently rejecting his requests. We caved (which was our fault, and led to this whole situation to begin with) and signed up for this apartment under the condition that we wouldn't under any circumstances share a room with Pete in case he went back on his word.
Now, ideally, me, Andrew and Brian will room together in the triple. So I ask you, WIBTA if I basically split our other 3 housemates (who are friends) up and force one of them to live with Pete in one of the doubles without letting them know about his habits? If I should let them know, how would I do that without there being conflict over who gets the triple (I don't want to start the year off on the wrong foot with bad blood over this)?
By the way, the four of us did sign up for the apartment first, and me, Andrew and Brian formally picked and were assigned to the triple. However, I suspect that this won't really matter if there really is a fight for possession of the triple, and it will instead become more of a first-come-first-serve kind of deal."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

For the longest time I wasn't in contact with the 1 side of the family until recently. Before then I spent my time with the 2 side. Then my dad reconnected with side 1 after grandma 1 got Parkinsons and for a little bit, everyone got along.

Since I was a young teenager I had no interest in what family matters went on then, but according to my mom grandma 2 was posting stuff on Facebook about grandma 1 that really offended my dad (and the whole family for that matter.) We pretty much cut side 2 out of our lives.

He tried convincing me it only has 4 girls out of the 100 photos it went through and we looked at it together and it has more like 30.

It was a track bike and when I paid a couple hundred for a bike I thought was worth well over 1000. When I went to inspect it this bike had a few minor issues that I noticed that could have caused a small price drop but not that much. I suspected it may have been stolen but I was not sure. After I purchased the bike I later checked up on the registry and low and behold the frame at least was registered as stolen, however many of the parts on the registry were different. The person who sold it to me actually is dead now (they were shot) so I would be unable to get my money back. The time I bought this I was a teenager and only had just enough for the bike and it was all my money. I used to ride it everywhere and to school everyday. I still use it from time to time and it is a great bike. But part of me still feels bad for never returning it to the rightful owner even though I was not the thief.

We had a good night together and I thought that was that. She is hot as fuck and really I’m not interested in getting to know any of these chicks on a more personal level. 

Also, when I have one night stands I don’t like to have more than one night together because in my experience this leads to complicated feelings and I just don’t want to deal with that. 

When we woke up I was planning on telling her all this but she started talking about how much fun we had together and how she wanted to go see a movie together and a bunch of other stuff like that. I could barely get two words in. She eventually asked me for my phone number and I just felt that telling her the truth would hurt her too much so I gave her a fake number that I made up on the spot. 

She accepted it happily and left not long after. Obviously I haven’t talked to her since and I’ve blocked her on all social media so she can’t contact me.

Those of you who don’t know it, it is basically hd Minecraft with guns. So were were out doing stuff and a player with good gear saw us and we got into a fight. I killed him with the help of my friends and we took his stuff witch consisted of an AK witch is a very valuable item in rust, and armor, and clothes. The clothes and armor were very valuable because the armor was the best kind in the game and so were the clothes because they offered the most protection. Also they had a matching uniform skin so the person wearing all the gear would look really cool. So I take the loot back to base with my friends and we get ready to go outside again with that gear and they allow me to use it. Then I’m looking for the clothes because I only have the gun and armor and I can not find the clothes at all. Then I ask everyone and no one says they have them until I see one if my friends wearing them. I explained the situation that I needed them and I got other good clothes as a replacement and I explained that I needed those ones because it goes with the matching skin set for my uniform and stuff and that the clothes have good armor value so they should go to the person who has the ak witch again is super valuable.  I asked nicely multiple times and he wouldn’t hand them over and all the other people agreed that I should have them because they go with the set and it would really suck if I died cause I had the most valuable stuff that was most capable of killing other players to get more stuff so it would be best if I had the extra protection. He just did not give them to me so I killed him and took them. I put his stuff on his body along with the replacement clothes and then he respawned and  tried to kill me but after he shot me I quickly killed him. After that I had to leave and he has not talked to me since. I said sorry and that I should’ve been more patient and I tried explaining better my reasoning and why I needed those clothes over him but he hasn’t responded.

But sometimes she wants to go out for dinner or drinks and stuff and at first when I could kind of afford it and intended too she (knowing I was struggling) would wait till I went to the bathroom then cover my bill. Now I really can't afford it so she'll ask me to go places and I say I can't afford it and she'll offer to pay. I've told her I feel bad about her always paying and she says it's fine. But I still feel like an asshole about it. I feel like telling her I can't afford it is like guilting her into paying. Before I met her I'd never been on a date I didn't cover. It might not be too big a deal if it was short term but I don't expect to have money till September. At this point I've bought one pitcher of beer and she's bought multiple dinners and some but not all of my drinks.     AITA.

c7m80j	2019-07-01 01:14:49	Pyro_Pickle	AITA for dismissing plans made haphazardly far in the past?	"Before we start- This issue has already been resolved between my friend and I, there are no disputes currently between us. I am just curious as to if I had made a genuine mistake with this decision.

About a year and a half ago, when I was in school, they had just announced the color run, a running event that was all about, well, running and getting splashed with colored dust on a hot day. This first announcement was mixed in with many, and I did not even fully understand the extent of the event. I didn’t really worry about it, the event was taking place about 2 and a half months from that date.

One of my friends, let’s call her A, had mentioned this to me when I was packing up my stuff to head home at the end of the day, and I was really focusing on trying to put away my big project that I had presented that day. She mentioned it to me and asked me, quote “do you think that you are gonna go to the color run?”

I was obviously focused the the action of packing up my project, so I sad “Probably not” because I tend to skip most school events, and it was just more running in the middle of my cross country season. 

Cut to several months later, I am hanging out with one of my other friends, let’s call him B, right after school. He is in cross country with me, and we start walking towards his place, which is through the back field of the school. We notice that the color run booth is out, and we kinda have a realization moment, like, ‘That’s today?’ So we say fuck it and decide to do it, because we have enough money on us to get in, and we didn’t have any idea what we were gonna do at his place either. 

The past interaction with A doesn’t even cross my mind, and so B and I run it and head home, without much of a second thought. I happened to post a picture of us running midway through on my Snapchat story, and by the time we head home, A had seen the story. She started bombarding me with texts, saying things like “What the hell? I thought you weren’t going to go?” And I finally recalled that small interaction way In the back of my mind. I apologized, and said that we can hang out on the four day weekend that we were entering that day, it being Friday. But no, she didn’t have any of it. She was pretty much full anger texting, spamming me with angry texts saying we never hang out anymore, even though she had never been approaching me asking about things any time that was recent. I said that I didn’t want to argue about this, and put away my phone, not wanting to deal with all that shit right there and then at B’s house. 

Apparently she also ranted about it to another person, let’s call him C, who we are both friends with, but I have developed some very personal bonds with, about this, framing me as an asshole. At first I had known this to be just another angry spurt by her, but this must have been a special one for some reason. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Tradition is to light off fireworks that night.  In my area fireworks are 100% legal.  Right now my work schedule is a bit off for various reasons and I have to work the night of the 4th, so I bought some fireworks and set them off last night for my family.  My neighbor walked over and complained that I was scaring her dog and asked me to stop.  I basically told her that it really isn't my problem and that she can't expect me to change my lifestyle for her choice of owning a pet.  I also told her that as a pet owner it is her responsibility to comfort her pet, not mine.  I finished my fireworks show which went on for another 25 minutes or so after she complained.

c7m6je	2019-07-01 01:10:47		WIBTA for not paying for a bike repair?	So I am doing an exchange year and we have to get a bike to go to school and other stuff. Like many other families(this will be important) I got a bike lended by them to use for 6 months as it was an okay bike and I didn’t have to go through the process of buying one online(you can get them for like 40-100 $ for a decent bike that will survive the 6months and you can even make some money back by selling it. So now when I got the bike they told the tires were new and costs 20$. The bike was used by the student before me and the family told me that he completely obliterated that bike with broken handlebar etc as he used it as a mountain bike. So I guessed they already repaired everything. Well they tires first off didn’t look new as they claimed but the brakes were also broken. Now I have to pay 60$ for the repair as they changed the tire after 6months?! and changed the broken brakes. So this wouldn’t be a problem if my dad wouldn’t have invited them for dinner in a restaurant where he paid 180$ minus our 60$.  And to add to that I didn’t claim a lot of money that I could have claimed over the year which would be around 300-400$. So WIBTA?		1	0

I’m normal weight, dress well, wear decent makeup, exercise, drink water, do my hair etc- I don’t believe that I look sick or dishevelled. I probably have resting bitch face, I’ll admit that. 


It’s starting to get me really cranky as I hear it at least weekly. I’ll put up with it if it is from friends/coworkers who are expressing concern, but from random people as a greeting, I find it really rude. This is my face. I’m not gonna go get Botox so just stop.


Yesterday a cashier greeted me with ‘you look so tired’! My first instinct was to tell her that she looked fat, but I thought that would be a bit too rude. 

Instead i told her ‘that is just my face’, without a smile.

c7m4nb	2019-07-01 01:05:21	gigticketsthrowaway	AITA for wanting my flatmate to pay for gig tickets we couldn't sell?	"This happened years ago but I've always wondered if I was in the right or not.

My flat mates and I tried to buy tickets to a very popular gig. Because it was so popular (we'd tried to get tickets for the same band before and failed) we agreed that two of us would try to buy them at the same time when the tickets went on sale, assuming that only one of us would be successful. We were each trying to buy 4 tickets for the 4 people who wanted to go. That was three flatmates plus one persons mother who wanted to come too. It may be relevant to note that that flatmate was not one of the two buyers.

Turned out the gig was less popular than we'd thought and we each managed to buy four tickets before we'd spoken to each other (went on sale at 9am, by 9.01 we'd both been successful). So we ended up with eight.

We all agreed to try and sell the extras but if we couldn't we would split the cost between us. This would have left the flatmate who wanted a ticket for her mum no less out of pocket than the rest of us, even though she'd been responsible for 2 extra ticket sales.

The flatmate who'd bought the ticket for her mum (well call her L) then decided to go on holiday on the week of the gig so she could no longer go. Which meant we had 6 tickets to sell. The gig had not sold out. She put 2 tickets on eBay but they didn't sell. We also tried offering them to friends etc - we didn't really know about other channels to sell them - but nobody was interested.

L refused to contribute to any of the 6 extra tickets, arguing that we hadn't tried hard enough to sell them. It's true that we could have researched how to sell them more (though imo so could she) but I felt that we had done at least as much as she had to sell them. She never did pay for them and our friendship fell apart soon after (partially because of this but also due to other factors).

"My husband and I recently got married and purchased a four bedroom house (the number of bedrooms is important). My husband and his family are originally from Ohio (we live in Utah) and his family has started moving out here for a fresh start. Almost immediately after buying our house his younger brother moved in with us and has been here for about eight months; he’s a great roommate and pulls his weight around the house. About 2 months ago my SIL decided she needed a new start and she moved in with us (also a great roommate) now that my husband and his two siblings are living here his parents decided to move here also. I work from home and keep my home office for myself to get work done. When my in laws asked about moving down here my whole household was thrilled. When I then asked “Who’s giving up their bedroom?” Everyone just went silent. I unfortunately had to pull rank on everyone and put my foot down and say I was keeping my office as of right now no one is speaking to me.



To make some clarifications since I have been asked. 

Yes BIL and SIL Pay rent. BIL is off a divorce and has been talking about moving out “some time this year” he’s a great guy and finally been getting back on his feet.   SIL hasn’t made the best choices in life and currently working on moving up the ranks at her job she handles most of the cleaning and pays about $200 a month in rent. MIL and FIL want to move in until they can find a house but I don’t think they are going to move quickly on looking for said house. Yes, I am a man.

c7m2c2	2019-07-01 00:58:43		AITA not wanting mom involved in wedding planning and lying about fiance's family's involvement	"Backstory: Fiance and I moved after we graduated years ago, now engaged. My mom has always seemed odd about his mom, not sure specifically why. I asked about this years ago after comments about his family (they're better off than my mom, mid vs. upper class) and complaining after I went on family vacations with them. She confessed she was afraid I liked his mom better than her, I explained that I do like his mom and I'm glad we have a relationship but no one is going to replace my own mom. Yes I'll go on family vacations and spend time with his family but that's not a threat to her. 

Anyhow, we got engaged this lady fall, woo! Recently, I mentioned we're going back to look at venues and she acted like us getting married was brand new news (esp. about the intended wedding date but that's been decided since day 1) and was unhappy. I was surprised bc initially we planned on having the wedding where we live but she advocated against it because everyone would need to fly in so I thought she'd be excited for 1. Her daughter planning her wedding 2. The convenience. She hasn't said a positive thing (has repeatedly complained about the time of year we're planning on, summer in the south yes I know it's hot and mosquitoes exist, and how she's told our family how crazy she thinks it is and how they agree). I've told her that if there's anything at all she cares about, to tell me and I will make sure she is involved and she said there's nothing she can think of.  

AITA part, I don't want her to look at venues with us. She is a negative person generally but her anti enthusiasm and critcism about the wedding itself is really bumming me out. I have lied to her and said that I'm not sure if fiance's mom is looking at venues with us, she is and moreso she has offered to pay for our wedding. Me telling her about the venue hunting visit was a few months ago and I clearly expressed that if she really wanted to be involved then she needed to tell me and I would make it happen. She hasn't said so but her negative comments and digs have ramped up. 

I feel like an asshole for not wanting her there but deep down I know she would criticize and ruin the experience for me and my fiance. Also I feel wrong about not sharing that his mom wants to finance the wedding but honestly idk how to even bring that up, she gave my sister a fair sum a year ago at her wedding but my mom is currently not super well off and I don't want to make her feel like she owes or should give us anything. I feel that she wants be more explicitly invited but could/should say she wants to come and hasn't, but tbh I don't want her to and that makes me feel pretty bad.

TL;DR Mom has expressed worry that I like like fiance's mom more than her, seemingly feels like she left out and is nitpicking details of wedding. I am keeping her out of wedding planning and also hiding that fiance's family wants to pay for wedding."		1	0

c7m0w2	2019-07-01 00:54:28	throwaway2039840	AITA for not wanting to be in my friends wedding?	"One of my friends from college is getting married next spring and wants me to be one of her bridesmaids. I initially accepted (we were having coffee with another one of her friends when she asked back in February so I felt pressured to say yes) but then I declined about a month later and she seemed kind of disappointed. Upon asking me why, I said it was due to financial issues- the bridesmaids dresses she picked average about $200 per dress (also it's an ugly cut and color) and its a destination wedding and while I could probably afford it (I didn't tell her that), I don't feel like driving from Detroit to Montreal, (where the wedding is taking place), dealing with border patrol, paying for gas, paying for lodging (Montreal is freaking expensive and so is the venue she picked because apparently money is no object for her), paying for hair, makeup, mani/pedis, etc.

After I told her this, she told me not to worry about money and that she'd help out, she'd pay for my dress, she'd pay for part of the hotel stay, she'd pay to have my nails done and that she'd do my hair and makeup and that me and my boyfriend could ride with her and her fiance to Montreal (her fiance is from Toronto and they'd be spending one night there and splitting up the driving in 2 days, they said we could stay at his moms apartment in Toronto with them the first night..uh awkward and no thanks, my boyfriend and I don't want to hear them having sex at night in the next room) and then driving to Montreal. I can't even begin to fathom how awkward a car ride would be, not with my friend but with her fiance, although he is nice I've only met him twice because he lives in Toronto at the present moment, where my friend will be moving after they get married. TBH I feel it's kind of pathetic of her that she's going to great lengths just to get me to be in her wedding. She's a nice person and good friend, but I do feel pressured.

In reality, I don't want to go because of money (I'm only going to wear the ugly dress once and don't feel like spending a weekend in Canada or driving for 12+ hrs), and because my boyfriend also doesn't want to go, I have anxiety and I just don't feel like going. I don't like social situations, I don't like weddings, I don't like parties, and I feel like it would be a waste of money and time. Additionally, since my friend is moving to Toronto after getting married, I won't see her again. As much as I like my friend and how close she thinks we are (we were especially close in college and before she got engaged) I just don't feel like putting in the effort to be in her wedding or continuing a long-distance friendship with her. I dont know how to tell her that nicely tho.

TL;DR friend wants me to be in her destination wedding, I don't want to be in it partially because I don't want to spend the money and I don't feel like going, and also because she'll be moving after getting married and I don't see a point in continuing the friendship. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
c7m0mo	2019-07-01 00:53:49	thr0waway000011	AITA if I don't attend her wedding?	"  

A few months ago, Lizzie asked me to be her bridesmaid. Lizzie and I have been close friends since high school. During college, we would see each other during our breaks. For the past year, we have lived in the same city.

We also have another friend, Amanda- and we were always inseparable. 

After graduating high school, my relationship with Lizzie changed. There were instances where she would be pretty mean, for lack of a better term, to me. For ex, when I had to travel alone at night because she said it was too far out of the way to give me a ride, or when she ditched me on a hike because I was going too slow. I also never really felt comfortable going to her with personal life things – good and bad - because she would diminish the importance. I HATE confrontation, so this is my fault, but I didn’t really stand up for myself in these instances (or others) because I didn’t want to start any drama. I will say she had some redeeming qualities, and because I was such good friends with Amanda, I didn’t want to start anything negative and ruin that relationship as well.

I also have anxiety, and sometimes have a hard time in groups. That, paired with the fact that I have felt pretty crappy when we hang out, has caused me to say no to a few invites out lately. I have also found that outtings usually fall when I am working (I have a set schedule). They used to mean so much to me, but it really seems like lately they don't care about me at all so I did retreat a bit. They don't know anything about what is going on in my life or care to ask. I'm moving in less than a month for grad school - so here is where my question comes in.

Lizzie spoke to me a few days ago and said that she doesn’t feel I should be a bridesmaid anymore because I’m not a supportive friend and don’t make enough effort in our relationship. She told me that she was thinking about not speaking to me anymore and letting the friendship go when I moved, but then was like ""she's a bridesmaid, so I have to talk to her"" lol. She said she hopes this ""brings us closer"" because it will take the pressure off. To be honest, I'm actually relieved because I'm no longer going to be living here and will have no money, so I do feel as if she should have someone who is going to be physically there for her in her special time. However, she said a lot of not very nice things during this conversation, and put a lot of blame on me, but ended it by saying that I ""better still be coming to the wedding!"" Just to give you an idea, one of the things she said was ""do you think you'll make any friends in (new state), or do you think you'll keep more to yourself?"".

Her wedding is not for a year. Would I be TA if I did not want to attend at all?

(I did want to add that I had told her when she asked me to be her bridesmaid that even though I would be moving away, I would still do my best to be there for her and support her on her special day.)

Character limit is tough – pls let me know if you need more info.

EDIT: Thank you so much for your responses. Reading them, as well as reading back what I wrote, it really clicked that I don’t have anything to lose with this friendship. It just sucks because this probably means I’m going to lose Amanda too, but I guess if that’s the case then she wasn’t a good friend either."	Not the A-hole	0	0

At first, yes I had told my friend I would stop being friends with the person she didn’t like, but after I learned both stories I had a change of heart.

The situation was mostly resolved, but me and my other friends are still affected and hurt by it. Recently, I asked the friend if I could just have some space and time away from her because the whole situation got very messy. I never intended for it to turn into anything, I just wanted to tell her how I feel. She asked why I wanted space now, said it was unexpected, and said that she didn’t know why I was mad at her. I wasn’t mad, I was just hurt.

After I kept saying that I just wanted time to think, that’s it, she said “guess I know why you’ve been ignoring me.” that was kind of it for me, and I said goodnight and went to bed.

After that, he needed help sorting out some old toys of mine and my brother's (my brother was away with his friends at the time). I went to help him and we found an old mancala marble. I got the mancala set, and when I took it out, I accidentally dropped a single marble into the box of toys. I didn't notice this until my dad pointed it out. I looked for it, but he flipped out and told me the game was ruined because of the one marble that I had dropped. I told him to ""calm down, it's just one piece"" and then he asked me ""how many pieces of your brain are missing?"" So I put down the box of toys and went to my room. Our roomba was in it so I took it out and moved it into the dining room. I went into my room and went to sleep. I woke up to my dad knocking on my door saying ""get up and out or I'll knock your teeth out"" (he makes a lot of empty threats like this, so don't worry, I'm not in danger). I asked him what happened and he told me that I locked the roomba in the bathroom. I told him I hadn't, and asked what benefit I could possibly derive from this. He called me an idiot and left. I could hear him mumbling curses from the other room.

I went back to sleep and woke up a bit later and the roomba was stuck, so I went to get it. I noticed he'd left something cooking on the stove too long, and told him this. Then he yelled at me for not turning it off, even though he said he would come get it.

I wrote him a note. I don't have it, he threw it away, but it basically said this:

""I don't know if you're having a bad day but it hurts that you're taking this out on me. It's ridiculous that you said childish things like ""you're brainless"" because I dropped a marble. Turn off the wifi or whatever (he turns off the wifi whenever he gets mad at me, which is often) but you need to recognize that that's not okay.""

I waited an hour, and then I asked if we could talk. He said ""what do you want to say"" and I told him basically what I said in the note. Then, he started screaming at me about how I didn't help look for the marble at all (kind of true, since I left after he called me brainless) and that I was being disrespectful. He was watching TV so I turned it off because he was ignoring me trying to talk. He told me “get off your high horse, stop acting like a martyr"". When I again asked him why I would put the roomba in the bathroom, he said ""because you're an idiot"". I said that the only real valid thing he'd told me today was asking me why I didn't turn the stove off, and he flipped out at that and started yelling me about that. I just told him ""you're the one on the high horse and you need to get over yourself"". He said ""you need to apologize"" even though that's what I partially came to do until he started yelling at me.

We’re in Canada so today we had a BBQ for the Canada day long weekend, because most people wanted tomorrow to stay home and relax so we hosted a day in advance rather than the day of Canada day. My brother knew we were having people over. Everyone came over around 4. 

Anyways my brother called to get a ride home at 6. My parents had already had too much to drink so they couldn’t go get him. They asked me to. I had much less to drink, but I did have 2 full cocktails. I have a level 2 (out of 3) drivers license so I’m allowed to drive by myself but I’m not supposed to drive with ANY alcohol in my system. 0. I said I wasn’t comfortable driving him since I had alcohol in my system too. Additionally I’m very small (5’4, 100lbs) so I think alcohol has a different affect on me then someone who’s taller and weighs more than me. 

My brother had to take a taxi home and was extremely pissed at all of us, but especially me since I wasn’t drunk at all. I think I made the right decision. He doesn’t pay any rent or expenses so I feel like he can afford to just take a damn taxi once in a while.  I’m curious if other people think I’m TA."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7lvcs	2019-07-01 00:38:37	singinginthestarts	AITA for thinking that the punishment my son got is excessive.	"Pedro historia.

So in the school of my son there is this group of friends ( let’s call her Tom, Will and Jack ). Tom and Will are very close and Tom is very feminine ( big hips, like dancing, etc ) so they often make jokes about them being gay. Sadly, Jack died in an accident a week ago and Tom and Will attended his funeral.

My son was chatting with a friends of his and he made a joke, saying that Tom and Will were having sex at the funeral. I know, this is a very incentive and dark joke, but it was a joke made between friends.

Somehow, that joke strayed spreading until all the school ( including Tom and Will ) had heard about it. They started threatening him, saying they will break their legs or kill him, the fear was soo big that some friends decided to accompany him in his way to home. It all end up with all the classmates of Jack surrounding him at the schoolyard and insulting him until the professors show up.

Now I was call by the School director. She told now that they were going to sanction my son, as well as Tom and Will. I was very shocked by this, sure my son did an incentive joke, but it was between friends, it wasn’t even in the school. And he was getting the same punishment that the guys that threatened my son got. I understand a call, a light punishment, but not a sanction ( wich in the school is very  punishment) for a joke that he made outside of school.

I understand punishing him ( I already made that ) but the scale of the punishment and the fact that the other boys got the same is simply out of my understanding. The rest of the parents hates. Who is wrong? Me, or the director?"	Asshole	0	0
c7luvo	2019-07-01 00:37:13	dontwannaholdurhand	AITA for not wanting to hang out with my stepmom's friend's daughter the week she visits?	"My stepmom has a friend with a daughter my age (18), ""Alyssa"". She's coming to visit for a week sometime in July. Alyssa is really immature for our age - she's not rude but she's very picky about what we do, where we go, where we eat, etc. An example would be, my stepmom asked her what she likes to eat so that she could pick some stuff up at the grocery store for when she comes to visit. Alyssa insisted that we go out or get fast food because that's the only thing she likes. 

I've never met her (I only know about her personality because my stepmom told me about her and showed me texts that they had exchanged). My stepmom volunteered me to hang out with her and I'm extremely irritated about it. Obviously I'm not going to ignore her completely. I'm excited to meet her and say hi! But I just don't want to have to hold her hand for a week. There's really not that much to do around our town unless you work, or have a car (I don't because I've been working to save up the money to get one) and drive to the nearby city. She is under the impression that I'm going to keep her entertained for the majority of her visit, but I'm a little busy with studying, working, and honestly relaxing on my own this summer. 

I understand that this may come off as me being an unfriendly, antisocial bitch, but I like to keep to myself. I enjoy meeting people, which I'm happy to do, but I didn't ask for a girl I don't know to come visit for a week.

c7lucb	2019-07-01 00:35:45	ew032297	AITA for not choosing childhood best friend to be my maid of honor?	"I’ve been best friends with R for 13 years. While I was gone for 18 months on a service mission, she rarely contacted me or did anything to stay in touch. She got engaged 7 months before I came home and asked me to be her maid of honor. I accepted, of course, but wish I hadn’t. When I got home, I had been gone for so long and changed so much that I had no friends left except for her, but she wouldn’t even talk to me. She didn’t make any time for me because she was always with her fiancé.

I soon moved out of state for school. For her wedding planning/parties/pictures, she made me drive 14 hrs round trip on 3 separate occasions and miss work, putting everything I had at stake because I was spending so much money to travel for her. She bought tickets for me, her, and her fiancé to go to a Twenty One Pilots concert to get to know each other, but then made me come up the weekend before the concert to do her hair and makeup, knowing that I couldn’t travel two weekends in a row and made me miss the concert I had been looking forward to so much. She made me drop $300 on a bridesmaids dress I won’t ever wear again, and $1k on the bachelorette party I threw for her (at the end of which, one of her new friends looked me in the eyes and told me that this party I had spent SO MUCH EFFORT CREATING “wasn’t that great.”) After her wedding, I cut her off completely. (Not that she tried to talk to me anyways.)

Fast forward 6 months, and I got engaged to the love of my life. My mom suggested I ask R to be in my wedding party. I felt weird about this, but I went against my better judgement and agreed. I called her up for the first time in months and asked her to be my bridesmaid. She seemed taken aback, and I thought it was because she felt weird about it too, seeing as we hadn’t talked in months, but then she said, “Oh, I’m not your maid of honor?” My jaw dropped and I quickly recovered to tell her that I had asked someone else to do that instead.

The next day, I get a call from her telling me that she talked to her boss and she has no more paid time off, so she won’t even be at my wedding. I was DUMBFOUNDED. She ended the call by saying “have fun at your wedding” and that was it. No apology, nothing.

c7ls0b	2019-07-01 00:29:04	NF889	AITA for not letting my estranged sister back in my life?	"My  oldest sister has always been an angry person. She can be smart and  nice when she wants to be but growing up she was always fighting with my mom and she tried to run away a few times. She was mean to me too  because she was jealous of me. My mom and I always get along well and we're best friends now. My sister hates me because she thinks my mom loves me more than her. Maybe if she was nicer to my mom, they would get along better.

4 years ago, she cut everyone out of her life. She cut my mom out first because she thought that my mom wasn't a good mother to her then she cut me and my siblings out because we defended my mom and told her that she was being immature. We were firm with her and she didn't like it. My mom is not a perfect person. She had my sister when she was very young and she was a little ignorant when it came to parenting. But we all forgave her except my sister.  My mom is a better person now and I love her. My sister won't let go of the past and she kept confronting my mom about things that happened 20 years ago. My mom just ignored her because she was being nasty but it pissed off my sister even more. I wish she would get over it and move on. We all did, but she chose to stay in the past.

My  mom is devastated. She cries all the time over my sister and holidays have been very hard for her. She misses my sister a ton and she always wonders what my sister is doing and what her life is like now. She reached out to my sister last year, but my sister told her that she moved on and she ""felt safe"" without my mom in my life. It's such a cruel and wretched thing to say and it destroyed my mom even more.

Yesterday  I randomly got an email from my sister. It was long-winded and filled with self pity. She claimed that my mom abused her and made her the ""family scapegoat"". She claimed that she took the brunt of the ""abuse"" and my mom  starved her and said mean things to her. I don't really believe her because my mom was never that bad. She was a believer in corporal punishment but she never took it too far. I think my sister was being dramatic and trying to stir up some shit between me and my mom because she's jealous of my relationship with her. My sister also said that she realized that she resented me because I was my mom's favorite and she wanted to start anew with me and get to know my toddler daughter.

I told her that I wouldn't talk to her unless she had more positive things to say about my mom. I won't sit back and let her slander my mom like that. She destroyed my mom and I want her to  apologize and make things right with my mom first. And I'm looking out for my daughter too. I can't have her auntie waltz in and out of her life as she pleases.

I  feel guilty because she's alone without my family in her life but honestly I can't take her negativity and jealousy anymore. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
c7lrgx	2019-07-01 00:27:37	peachnip	AITA for cutting ties with a friend after she started dating my ex?	"So I was dating this guy for a couple months. It wasn’t anything serious, we were kinda just having fun. But then I decided to move back to my home state and we broke up. Long story short, I missed him and moved him out to my apartment and we lived together. That was mistake number one. I was lonely and bored and it seemed like a good idea. Now, this kid literally tested my patience every day. Constantly thought I was cheating on him, would go through my phone, hide my Apple Watch so he can keep tabs of who I was talking to and MORE IMPORTANTLY, literally didn’t pay for a single bill. Anyway, I got fed up and dumped him and kicked him out. NOW, during my relationship with him I would tell one of my friends, who I work with and oh, I’m her manager, all the shitty things he would do and say. She always had my back and thought he was a POS. A week after we broke up, I was sitting at the bar with her and venting and ranting to her about him. She ends up leaving and going to a different bar and texts me, “I just walked in and guess who’s here”. I sent back something along the lines of “lol what a loser”. Fast forward two days, I get a text from my ex saying, “I really like so-and-so and we’re seeing each other, I hope you guys can still be friends”. Instant rage. Why didn’t she text me? Why would she go behind my back? Did she not hear a word I fckn said about this guy? This girl was one of my best friends, my roommate at one point, and like a sister to me. We lost touch a little when I moved away, but I pulled this girl out of so many shitty situations where she could have gotten arrested, fined, etc. The day I saw her at work after it all happened, I saw red. Now, again, I’m also her manager so I had to keep it somewhat professional. I lashed out and said some pretty mean, but true things, such as her not being able to afford to pay her bills because she’s too busy buying drugs and partying. I left it at that and didn’t speak to her unless it was about work. They broke up about a week ago because he cheated on her, and she kinda apologized for it but I told her I don’t trust her and will never want to be her friend again. AITA????

c7lrbd	2019-07-01 00:27:14	sillygirl2011	AITA for not paying for my stepdaughter's BP because of her mentally disabled son?	"Edit: Stepdaughter's **wedding**, I guess I accidentally tried to change it when I was reading over it to BPD or something?

&#x200B;

My stepdaughter (41f) and I (68m) have always had a rough relationship, but I love her just as much as my own daughter and sons. She’s getting married to a questionable guy (45?m) in about two weeks, after a **long** on-and-off relationship with him. I have my doubts about him, but that would be too long for this post. They have a son (23m) together, and he's diagnosed with BPD and low-functioning Autism. Since he was born, his parents have been nonstop enabling him. Whenever he would throw a temper tantrum, which was often, my stepdaughter would just bend over backwards to give him what he wants, even when it's far from financially viable for their household. She's also a loud-and-proud antivaxxer.

&#x200B;

When she approached her mother and I asking for her extravagant wedding to be paid, I was unsure. The wedding cost is in the high 5-figures. My wife (67f) doesn't work so I would be footing the bill. I can pay it, but it would throw a major wrench in my retirement plans. I'm planning on retiring in the next two years but that wouldn't be possible if I paid. Still I accepted, with the caveat that they put their son on a therapy plan. Initially, a few months ago, they agreed, but as the wedding date got closer they did absolutely nothing. In fact, if anything the son has been extra rude to me lately, calling me names when my wife/stepdaughter was around-- some of which were racially charged.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I really don’t want to pay for that wedding anymore. My wife thinks I'm the asshole because I paid for my own daughter's wedding. However I don't think that's a fair comparison. My daughter's wedding cost about $5,000 and was a quite modest event, although we all had fun. My stepdaughter's wedding would cost nearly twenty times that. Let me reiterate that I love my stepdaughter the same, and that I have absolutely nothing against people with Autism, or BPD as long as they seek treatment. But she's booked all the concessions already, so if I'm not paying for it it's likely she'll have to file for bankruptcy. She doesn't know yet. Reddit, am I the asshole?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I’m leaving for a week of vacation next week for a friends birthday and had already gotten approved for time off. Next weeks schedule comes out and my manager has me on for the Saturday I’m away. So I asked her about it. She claims she “lost” my request sheet. And conveniently, we have no hostess for that busy Saturday night. So she expects me to give up a night of vacation and drive almost 2 hours from out of state to work that night and then 2 hours back. To work as a hostess for four or so hours at minimum wage. That wouldn’t quite cover gas and would have me being back really late that night.

She’s also working that night and has no reason that she can’t fill in other then she doesn’t “want to”.

At first, yes I had told my friend I would stop being friends with the person she didn’t like, but after I learned both stories I had a change of heart. 

The situation was mostly resolved, but me and my other friends are still affected and hurt by it. Recently, I asked the friend if I could just have some space and time away from her because the whole situation got very messy. I never intended for it to turn into anything, I just wanted to tell her how I feel. She asked why I wanted space now, said it was unexpected, and said that she didn’t know why I was mad at her. I wasn’t mad, I was just hurt. 

After I kept saying that I just wanted time to think, that’s it, she said “guess I know why you’ve been ignoring me.” that was kind of it for me, and I said goodnight and went to bed.

My dad was having a Canada day party and invited some of his friends over who had kids was younger than me (17) and I think the youngest was starting kindergarten in September. So one of my dad’s friends brought water balloons, to which we had a water balloon fight where everyone gained up on me. Now I know I am to partially to blame for this next part but I just want to say it was the heat of the moment no more no less, in which after I threw my two water balloons I ran to get more and everyone else fled then I just threw a balloon without second thought at a young girls back at point blank range, and my dad got mad at me which made him even more mad because the my brother tattled to him that I didn’t want to put the ladder ball pipes away in the shed because he was being a little bitch about not wanting to set them up earlier and didn’t know how, I even told him to look up a picture but he said “No way too much effort”. So anyway after dodging a few balloons I was holding the last two and all the younger children realized this and ran towards the adults which we explicitly told not to throw the balloons near. Leaving my brother right in front of me so I chased him and he drove himself into a corner, I then thrower the balloons at then he ran into the fence and cut himself on the cheek. To me this just seemed like karmatic justice and a mix with his own stupidity (he can’t tell the difference between server and sewer as a reference and is going into grade 9). My dad now furious says it’s my fault that he drove himself into a corner, sure he had to go into the hospital and get a few stitches but honestly he is kind of an ass when no one is around. AITA?

c7lmdk	2019-07-01 00:13:42	sunshinenrainbows3	AITA for telling my friend I think her boyfriend is fake?	"This happened over a year ago, but I want to know AITA? My friend Ann had a boyfriend named Oscar. I never met Oscar but Ann would talk about him when we hung out. At one point she mentioned that she caught him cheating on her and took him back, but because he cheated she didn’t mention him around her parents because she didn’t want to deal with their opinions. Okay, no problem. Well our other friend Sue has known Ann a lot longer than I have and had lived in the same apartment complex as Ann for a few years. Sue mentions to me one day that she’s never met or even seen Oscar and she’s started to think he’s not real. I thought this was weird so I mentioned it to my boyfriend who has also known Ann for a few years. He mentions that he’s had the same thought because he knows a lot of people who work at the same company and department where Oscar works and none of them have heard of him. I found this all really weird, but whatever, it’s not hurting me so I let it go. Also: Oscar has no social media and doesn’t like pictures. I know some ppl don’t, but just in case anyone mentions this. She does have a few pictures of Oscar, but none of the two of them together. 

Well one day Oscar and Ann break up and after a few months Ann starts dating a new guy named Tim. Now Tim also doesn’t like pictures, she has a few pictures of him by himself, but none with them together and he also doesn’t have any social media. Again, I know this happens, but it seems odd. So after a month or two Tim cheats on Ann. She takes him back, but again she doesn’t want to bring him up around her family because of the drama it may cause. The similarities are starting to add up, but none of this really bothers me. It’s annoying, but she’s not hurting anyone so whatever. 

Then things get complicated.I text Ann one day to see how she’s doing and she proceeds to tell me how she’s been at the hospital because Tim’s sister shot their mom 9 times and the mom is in ICU.So I check in on her the next day and Tim’s mom has died and Tim now has custody of his twin nieces.This is all a lot so I ask if I can send flowers.She tells me thanks, but no, that they aren’t even having a funeral.I don’t remember exactly how this all played out because it was a year ago, but I started looking for an obituary or anything on the news.I couldn’t find any mention of the shooting.When I asked her about it she tells me that the news isn’t going to report one white woman killing another white woman.At this point I was just really tired of all the lies.I just think if we are friends we should be honest with each other.So I text her a while after all this happened that I think it’s all a lie. I wasn’t mean in the text, just said I thought we were better friends than all of this.She did respond, but after that I just let our relationship fizzle.I know she wasn’t hurting anyone, but I just don’t want to be lied to.This still hurts and bothers me so I’m wondering AITA for telling her I think her boyfriend is fake?"

Conversations with him started to become very awkward and unusual; he started to become extremely forgetful, slow, and clumsy; he began to say things that were offensive/inappropriate without even realizing it; and just in general, it was clear there was something “off” with him that wasn’t off before.

A little under a year ago, it came out that Hal was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. He is super private about the whole thing and refuses to talk about it with anyone. He has a very strong work ethic, is very bent on keeping his job and making all the money he can until he’s absolutely unable to work anymore. My manager (who is very close friends with Hal) has been supportive of Hal’s continued employment. Corporate does **not** know about Hal’s condition as far as I’m aware, and he’s tried to keep it as much of a secret as possible.

I respect Hal’s devotion to his job, but in the past year, he has been racking up an unbelievable number of complaints from customers. I know because complaints circulate pretty quickly where I work, and many people have called to complain to me about him. He often won’t be able to answer basic questions or provide information to customers; he’ll forget people’s info and make them repeat it over and over; and just seems slow and out of it in general. Customers have been questioning “what’s wrong with that man” and some have used quite choice words to describe him.

Despite this, my manager has kept Hal on board, and has told my coworkers who question this decision to mind their own business & “worry about themselves and their own performance.” Hal’s performance does affect us though; we have to deal with all the complaints and mad customers, and if our local branch loses business, that’s pretty shitty for all of us too. And while I’m very sympathetic towards Hal, I believe that someone shouldn’t be employed in a position if they can’t do the basic work required for that position.

I sent an anonymous email to our company’s corporate leadership, explaining Hal’s condition and how it’s affected his performance. Soon afterwards, he ended up being terminated (I assume with benefits and a severance package, considering the situation). My manager is furious about the whole thing and has been yearning to know which one of us “ratted him out.” I feel I did the right thing. Was I the asshole to “rat” Hal out?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7lgsx	2019-06-30 23:58:33	MP54AC	AITA for trying to prevent an argument	"This happened in a groupchat with my friends earlier today and they've all said I should apologize, however, I feel as though I was justified in what I said. 

&#x200B;

First, the backstory. There are several of us in the chat, all ages 18-20, we're all in college. During this past school year, two of our friends, Ashley and Nate (names fake), had sex several times throughout the duration of the school year, mostly in the fall 2018 semester. During this, Ashley caught feelings for Nate, but was denied, as Nate didn't want a relationship. They would continue to have sex on and off through-out the school year. In terms of the chat, we could all be having a conversation and anything could set off an argument (this has continued on into the summer). Shade, allusions, unrelated jokes, anything could be a catalyst and there would be an argument and one or both would leave the chat or remove the other from the chat.

&#x200B;

Cue today, we were having a discussion about what the definition of a hoe is and the value of clear communication is a relationship. Another one of our friends, Lauren, while describing what she thought was a hoe, described several behaviors that Ashley has previously accused Nate of having (some of which might actually apply, but beside the point). Cue Ashley commenting ""do you not see what we're talking about here"" to which I reply ""yes but we're avoiding names to stave off another argument"". Shortly afterwards, she left the chat and everyone currently present, including Nate said that I was mean and that there are somethings that should not be said. I countered with the fact that an argument between Nate and Ashley is extremely common and her comment was the exact sort of thing that could've started it and all I was trying to do was prevent another from breaking off that we would all have to suffer through.

&#x200B;

I was asked to apologize, but I said that I stand by what I said and that I think my reason for doing so was justified. No one except presumably Ashley is mad at me, but other members of the chat would later on read through and then voice the same sentiment that I should apologize, and by now it's getting annoying. These arguments happen all the time, at anytime, often for no reason and aren't quick and we all just have to stand by and look/read at it and I'd like to never see it happen again except for valid reasons, of which there never are any!

She can't have anything spicy or acidic so she knows she's not suppose to have any of the food we make without asking. I swung by the room my BF and his mom were in and asked if there was any food left over to which he said yes. I go finish getting ready for work, then find the pot of food we had is not only empty, but was put back into the fridge. I pick up the pot to go show it to my BF, we both know it was her because if it was our roommate, he would have put the pot in the sink, and she's literally blind enough to think there was still something left inside and put it back in hopes we wouldnt notice. I enter the room they are in and find her standing behind his desk chair pulling up a fresh diaper on and flailing her hands around the leg openings trying to adjust it. Already mad, and having no time to argue with her I show the BF the pot and walk out the house while he fusses at her for eating our food that we paid for and text him telling him what I saw her doing. He confronts her about both issues and tells me about it in text and she's in denial like always. When he asks her about the diaper she tells him ""What do you know, you didn't see anything"" he told her I saw it when I showed him the pot and her reply was ""oh of course, it's coming from her"" when he asks her what does she mean by that and why can't she act like an adult she replies ""I can do what I want, I pay rent too"" and ""because she's a bitch"". She did all this with the door fully open with our roommate's bedroom door right across from them so he could potentially see her ass. We've been nothing but nice to her and she treats us like dirt, and thinks it's ok to call me a bitch when I'm not there. So since she can't act like an adult I told him to go ahead and remove internet access to her devices since I'm the only one who pays for the internet which keeps her entertained, we'll also be taking her tablet away before she goes to dialysis since I also bought that for her. She only covers her part of the rent while the BF and I cover both our rent and our part of the utilities which she doesn't pay anything for, she pays for her own food we get for her, and we pay for our own seperately. Some how she thinks that just because she pays for rent means she can do anything she wants, including belittling us when it fits her needs. I'm fuming because it isn't our home, it's our roommate's and I dont want him seeing her do something like this instead of going to the restroom feet away from her. When I get off work I plan on giving her an earful and giving her a peice of my mind. Would I be an AH if I do confront her?"		1	0
c7le0t	2019-06-30 23:50:19	mediocreatbest40	AITA for wanting my brother with autism to stop checking up on me?	"Hi everyone!

Okay, so a little backstory here. 

My brother is a person with autism. Part of his autism is mild OCD, which manifests in constant question-asking. It was triggered when I experienced a series of very serious, somewhat life threatening health issues a few years ago, at age 11 (i think). I’m now 15, which doesn’t make those problems a distant memory, but it also doesn’t make them fresh wounds either, you know?

Anyways, over the past three years, his obsession with my health has grown to a point where he’ll wake me up in the middle of the night, staring at me, and tell me I was breathing weirdly (my room gets incredible stuffy). He used to just ask me, on occasion, how I was doing and if I was sick. Which, granted, got annoying when he would ask it around twenty times a day, but not unbearable, and I managed to brush it off with a simple “yes, I’m fine.” Or “No, I’m not sick.” But, over the past year, it’s become an incredible obsession. If I (TMI) pee too much (by his standards, which is once every five hours. I drink a lot of water so you can see why this is a bit of a crazy standard to uphold), or I eat “too much” or “too little”, or if I take a deep breath, yawn, cough, sneeze. You know. Basic human functions. He’ll get extremely anxious and dump a hundred questions on me. I guess it’s also worth mentioning that I’m in pretty good shape and eat very healthy most of the time, so there’s no current reason to worry. 

Now, here’s the situation I’m fretting about. 

The other day he saw me out of breath after doing an intense HIIT workout and started with his usual questioning. But for some reason, I just couldn’t put up with it this time. I started yelling at him and didn’t stop for like five minutes, which I swear I never do. By the end we were both pretty stunned, and, to my surprise, he hasn’t spoken to be in a few days. When he wants to ask me I can see him stop himself and walk away quietly. I didn’t say anything mean when yelling, only that it was driving me crazy and I couldn’t handle it much longer. I feel awfully, though, as outside of the nonstop questioning he’s a really kind kid. 

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: for reference, although I don’t like the term, he’s rather high functioning and his therapist has mentioned that the questioning is manageable. I didn’t want to silence him, I only wanted the questions to slow down a bit."	No A-holes here	0	0

"So I just came back from a frozen yogurt place and when we walked in there was nobody behind the counter. This was place where you put all the frozen yogurt and toppings on and afterwards they weight it when you're done. We called out, nobody came out. As we were trying the different samples (there are free sample cups to sample all you want) still nobody came out after 4-5 minutes. We called out one more time and still nothing.... we ended up leaving and going somewhere else. 

&#x200B;

Would I have been in the wrong if I did make a cup as if I wanted to pay, and left because I couldn't physically give my money to this business? On one hand I understand it's theft taking something without paying for it. On the other hand, I think I would of been 100% correct on my side of the transaction because I'm supposed to ""help myself"" followed by somebody taking my money after the fact.... and there was nobody there. Also, if I would of made a cup and sat there eating it to wait for somebody the weight would of been off anyway."	Asshole	0	0
c7lbuz	2019-06-30 23:44:17	shannonreadit	AITA for not wanting drugs to be taken in my house?	"Short and sweet: my SO had a younger family member come over for the weekend and, he brought weed. I wasn't upset with that particular drug however, with how presumptuous he was that it would be OK. I know he's going through and experimental phase. I expressed to my SO that I wasn't OK with our house becoming a 'safe space' for him to experiment. Especially with hallucinogens as, his family member has experimented with these and expressed interest in trying more. 

I know my SO has told his family member he would rather him try these drugs under supervision or do them with a friend. My SO told me I was judgy for singling out hallucinogens. He knows I'm not as open minded about drugs but was disappointed that I viewed his family member 'that way'. I replied with the argument that I don't care if someone takes drugs or not but, just not in our house. And if SO and his family member are going to take these drugs in out house then to let me know... because I'll stay away friends house. I explained to SO that I believe people can take drugs all they like but, that doesn't mean I want to be around them whilst they partake in it. I'm not comfortable around people on hallucinogens cause you never know how their experience will turn out. 

So reddit help me out. Am I close minded and unsupportive? Or have I drawn a fair boundary? This has caused some serious tension between us and I'm not sure how to go forward."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Sometimes we don't even have soap. I'm not really sure where to start, so I guess i'll start with this- my dad went to jail a while ago for beating my mom. But I don't know if I should leave that in the past or not. In recent years, my mom became an alcoholic and would drive drunk with me and my older brother. My dad smokes weed in the house despite my pleas to stop (I hate the smell) so I avoid them both. My mom stopped drinking due to getting a DUI and insists she's trying to be a good mom, and that she loves me. My dad makes fun of me in different ways, and my brother joins in. A few times I asked him to get a dead spider or something out of my room, and he shoved it in my face. I screamed because I absolutely hate spiders, and he and my brother laughed at me because of it. My mom talks trash about my brother and my dad to me, and pushes her insecurities onto me. Neither of them ever wash their hands, and they both constantly have their hands down their pants while sitting on the couch. I started getting really upset due to how my parents treat me, and I talked to a school counsler. I thought things would get better, but oh boy was I wrong. They wouldn't let me leave the dinner table even after I expressed that I was uncomfortable talking to them about it. At this point, I don't know if I'm in the wrong for hating them because the counsler said that when she talked to them, they seemed upset at my feelings. She said that I should try getting closer to them, but I really *really* don't want to- they treat everything like an interrogation. I can tell that they're trying to be good parents but they just aren't, they don't respect me and never listen to me. I know I'm not the best kid, so my dad raising his voice at me isn't entirely his fault. I talk back because I don't feel respected, and because I don't want to be yelled at. I get frustrated easily too. So AITA for not wanting to be close to them?

Edit: my mom tried to get help with her drinking at one point, but she quit trying soon afterwards. My dad flat out refuses to stop smoking in the house, and ignores me every time I ask him. I know I'm young and stupid but it doesn't seem like he wants help- my mom might, but he doesn't."	Not the A-hole	0	0

She cheated on her boyfriend (our 3rd roommate) which forced him to move out and for both of us to pay more than planned each month. She decided to stop going to school during finals week and threw acid parties at our place every night until we got a noise complaint. Random tinder guys over all the time and very very loud sex with them all night. She kept inviting this crazy girl that I met through another friend over even after I told her that this girl has problems and I don’t want her over. Her excuse was that she was “dating” crazy girl when I know for a fact my sister isn’t gay. I’m gay, she’s not. Crazy girl ended up getting banned from our apartment complex after she went crazy on acid and banged on numerous neighbors doors at 3am telling them to get out of her house. She almost left with some random dude she met online until I went and told her mom that I thought she was going to be sex trafficked or something by this sketchy dude. She keeps using my sheets even after I told her not to because I think it’s gross. My biggest issue with her however has been how lazy and messy she is and her refusal to clean up anything. I’m constantly telling her to keep the common areas clean, to turn off the lights when she leaves the house, to make sure not to leave the door open when we have the AC on, etc. 

Last night I came home from a night at my gfs house and work to our patio door wide open with the AC on, 2 day old pizza on the counter, a bag of garbage in our living room, weed all over our table, lights on, my sheets on her bed again, and her ex boyfriend asleep on our couch. I was pretty pissed and ended up sending her a video of all the shit on Snapchat telling her that she need to clean up this shit, wash my shits and get her ex out of the house because this shit isn’t cool. She ended up replying back blaming my gf being back in town for me having zero patience with her. I told her that my gf has nothing to do with this and that I’m tired of repeating myself over this shit. She said “I’m just a kid Bella I don’t know any better” I called bull shit and said that she’s a fucking adult now. She has her own place, a job, she pays for her own shit and is making adult decisions. Part of being an adult is to clean up after yourself so your roommate doesn’t have to do it. She came home a few minutes later, called me an asshole for “making her uncomfortable in her own home”, grabbed her ex an left. 

I honestly can’t see how I could possibly be the asshole in this situation. I’m considering telling her to find a new place once our lease is up in a few months."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c7l6h1	2019-06-30 23:29:40		AITA for calling both my little brother and his question stupid?	"I was just out to eat with my mom and my little brother. I'm 21 and he's almost 15. 

For some backstory, my mom almost always takes his side when it comes to things. They've been kind of ganging up on me a lot recently. Nothing he does is wrong. For example, we had a 24 pack of Slim Jims at home and the whole thing was gone in 2 days (I only had a couple). I was pretty mad that he ate the ENTIRE box so fast, but he claims he did nothing wrong because he went shopping with my mom and picked them out (he didn't pay for them). My mom literally didn't care AT ALL, but I know if I had done that, she would be mad at me. She has been mad at me in the past for being a pig, which is why I don't act like that anymore.

Now, back to today. We're out to eat, and my brother is asking me why I would buy the shirt that I am wearing. For context, this is a shirt that I bought for like $40 a few years back. It is a limited edition shirt I ordered for the release of an album, for a musician that I like. 

My brother also knows exactly what the shirt is based off of. He knows how much I got it for, he knows I like the artist's music, and he knows I just generally like the shirt. Naturally, to annoy me, he asks me why I would buy the shirt. I think it's pretty fucking clear why I would buy this shirt, but I answer anyways, ""because I like it."" Well, apparently that answer is not good enough, so he keeps asking me why I would buy the shirt, saying, ""Oh, I could buy 3 shirts for $40! Why would you ever buy that shirt? It doesn't make sense. Why buy a shirt for $40?""

Clearly, I bought the shirt because I like it. Right? I fucking like the shirt, that's why I bought it. Why the FUCK else would I buy a shirt? I like the shirt, so I fucking bought it you babybrained idiot! Why is that so hard to accept? (Oh wait I know why. Because you guys just enjoy pissing me off for your own entertainment)

I didn't say all that. That's just me venting. But I did get pretty angry and respond to him by telling him that question was stupid, and that he is stupid, and that he knows it's stupid. Obviously I bought the shirt because I fucking like it, and you obviously already know the reason. But he just wants to piss me off saying ""Oh I could buy 3 shirts for that. Why would you ever buy that?""

$40 isn't even that expensive for a T shirt, especially considering it has a sentimental value. He's just trying to piss me off for the sake of pissing me off.

So, after I called him stupid and his question stupid, my mom gets all mad at me saying that I'm being an asshole! She said that I'm making him feel stupid by saying that. And was telling me to just ""shutup stop talking"" when I tried to tell her this. The kid is fucking 15 and she's treating him like he's 10! He acts like an entitled brat, and it's because of her!"		1	0

~~My Email on my profile ~~

Ultimately, my birth ended up being 4 hours start to finish and no one would have been able to make it. My husband did ask me if he should make calls and I shook my head no. I birthed at home with my husband, the Midwife and the Birthing Assistant. He waited to call everyone until after I was all taken care down below and he was holding the baby. My husband's family is 3 hours away so they came down a couple weeks later. My mother, father and brother came over immediately. My sister and my neice abs nephew came over a month and a half later.  I knew she was upset but didn't realise she wasn't going to be there at all for me. 

She came over for Christmas at my house,  and we had gotten together a couple other times with family. Everything was so-so. She never really talked to me or if she did she said a couple of words and then left to go do something else or really to someone else. To this day (9 months later) she hasn't held my daughter and recently I haven't seen or heard from her since February untill a couple days ago.

EDIT: for everyone thinking we are close, we arent. Never were. We would be categorized as acquaintances.

"So I feel like I'm going to get a lot of judgement for this but I feel really two sided about this. I'm completely prepared to get a lot of hate comments for my past actions so here goes nothing.

About 5 months ago I began sleeping with my ex bf who I dated back in high school. We are both 19 now and three or four years gave passed since we dated. Here's the really bad part... At the time he was dating a girl. Yeah I know, I'm horrible. I was fully aware of it and I honestly didn't give a shit about her. I pretty much just wanted dick and all he did was complain about her and how much he wanted to dump her. I was never the one to initiate it and each time I asked him if he was sure. He was also sleeping with one other girl at the time. 

Eventually we stopped because I got a bf and things were good. He eventually went off to boot camp and we didn't talk much after that. About a month in, I got a message from him on Snapchat that didn't sound like him at all. I honestly suspected it was her and I was right. He eventually told me that she hacked his account, found out about everything, got pissed, and went and fucked another dude out of spite. I, of course assumed that they're toxic relationship was over but I was wrong. They decided to stay together. Fine. Whatever. I think they're both idiots but it's they're life. Keep. Me. Out. Of.

She works at the only theater in this small ass town and me my bf happen to like to watch movies a lot. Every time I'd see her, I'd avoid her and act nice as if nothing happened. However the last time we went, she confronted me. We go and we buy our tickets, then go to the showroom. I get up before the movie starts to go to the bathroom by myself and as I'm coming out she walks away from the people that she's helping and follows me down the hall. She then proceeds to tell me that I'm a horrible person and she knows everything and that she hates me. She asked me why I did what I did and was crying and talking really fast throughout the whole thing. All I told was that I was sorry and I didn't really know what else to say. Afterwards o went back to the showroom and the second I sat down next to my bf,"		1	0

c7l472	2019-06-30 23:23:31	anonanouse	AITA for telling an employee she can’t come to my yoga class?	"I’m high up in a stressful position in growing company with a team of about 15 under me. I’m 38F btw. 

One of my mid level employees, mid-20s F, has unmm.. shall we say, become a bit clingy?

I started out thinking her motivation was to get ahead by kissing up to me. For instance one time our c-level execs came to town and after a long meeting I took them to have drinks at a beer garden down the block. My employee showed up and instead of politely saying hi and leaving to do her own thing, she sat down at the table and ordered and started drinking with us. It would have been fine except she said a few things during the visit that didn’t sit completely well. Nothing horrendous but one of the execs did bring it up to me after, and definitely stepped outside of her role coming to socialize in a situation none of her peers had been invited to, which did not win her any hearts.

Anyways, this continued in weird ways- like following me on social media and sending me DM comments etc. At one point I ran into her out with my cousin and close friend and she did kind of the same thing as with the execs and just hung out with us- subsequently she has my cousin on social media too!

(And yes I did have a talk about both of these incidents with her after the fact) 

I could go on with examples but I’ll cut to the chase. On the weekends and sometimes evenings on the side I teach yoga at a studio in my neighborhood. It’s something I love, both the practice AND teaching. I find teaching to continuously challenge me in new ways and find it really rewarding, and I’m close with the other women who work there who are all around my age. Anyway my studio has a nice view so Friday I took a pic in front of the windows during sunset and posted it to my story. Within two minutes I get a DM from employee saying how cool the shot was and asking to come take my class. 

I try to make work fun for everyone and am pretty relaxed in my management style. I’m not sure if this has misled her to think we are friends or something. But yoga is my escape and my stress free zone and I wouldn’t want any coworker there because it really is the one time I’m not thinking about the job. This plus the fact I already feel a little like she’s creeping into my personal life has been really bothering me. I’m friends with most of the women at the studio so this does feel like it’s her stepping into my personal space once again. 

After seeking advice from a friend it was pointed out to me that I don’t own the studio and anyone who pays can come to the classes there. I can’t control what my employee does outside of work either. And, that trying to do so may create more problems than it solves. 

But I want to tell her I don’t think it’s appropriate for her to attend my class and my studio. WIBTA??"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7l3s7	2019-06-30 23:22:25	TheMagnificentBean	WIBTA if I called a tow truck on a parked car that is blocking our driveway by only 4ft on a busy day?	"So beach season has started, and since we live on the beach we get a lot of people coming into where I live trying to get access to the beach. Our driveway has street parking on either side of it, and people will park around our driveway all the time. The issue is that on the left side, there is just barely too little parking for two cars. People tend to park blocking our driveway by a foot, which for a two-car driveway is no big deal at all. We’ve considered calling a tow in the past to make a statement about not blocking the driveway, but we normally decide not to.

Today I came home from the gym and found a minivan that is parked blocking the driveway by about 4ft. I was still able to get into the driveway with ease, but it made me squirm my car a little more than I was comfortable with. For this reason I’m considering calling a tow truck, since they are illegally parked and it does have an effect on me.

The reason I’m conflicted is because the van looks a bit run down, and I assume it’s a poorer family that just wanted to bring their kids to the beach. I would hate to have them pay an exorbitant fee to get their car back and cause them hell when they are probably just trying to enjoy a day at the beach, but I also don’t want this to be a regular thing and I want to make sure people don’t block my driveway.

So, WIBTA for calling a tow truck on this car when it only slightly impacts my ability to get into the driveway?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Whenever me (29M) and my partner (27M) get into a fight, which admittedly has been a lot lately, he walks out mid-argument and goes to his parents. Now I feel like we all deserve a 'safe space' in life to which we can go whenever things get rough and I have no problem with that.

I do however have a problem with my mother-in-law always adding fuel to the fire by bashing me behind my back. She ALWAYS sides with him, no matter how extremely inappropriate he behaved. She finds ways to blame everything on me and always finds a way to justify his behavior.

Deep down she feels like ""she and hers"" shouldn't EVER have to ""bow down"" for others, especially their spouses. She's extremely unhappy in her own marriage and is not afraid to expres her resentment towards my father in law, who's a sweetheart really. I feel like she's slowly turning my partner into her which will ultimately turn our relationship into theirs. I've talked to her about this many times, trying not to be disrespectful, but to no real avail. She's nice to my face, but I feel like she's turning her son into a little ass hole, by putting him up against me.

I just don't know how to deal with this stuff anymore. Is her behavior normal? Is she just trying to protect her son whichever way she can? It just makes me so angry all the time. I was raised in a completely different way where we had to own up to  our mistakes instead of always blaming the other party. I'm not sure what's wrong and what's right anymore.

c7l36f	2019-06-30 23:20:47	Auroras_Aura	WIBTA for cutting off contact with my grandma after I start college?	"First post on this sub so I apologise for potential errors. I'm also on mobile and apologize for the horribly long post.
This post has some necessary backstory so bear with me; I'm sorry. I was raised by my mom and my grandmother. My father was never in the picture, so my grandma (or as I call her, Nana) assumed that role. My mom was in college when I was born, so Nana watched me during classes, and then as I aged, Mom would work night shifts and then sleep most of the day, so Nana would care for me then too. Now that I'm older, (17F) it's a pretty shared responsibility, alongside the fact that I can take care of myself if need be. 

I love my Mom with my whole heart, even if she seems more like a cool aunt or an older sister to me. She provides most of the income for our family and she's still there for me. She also understands my personal issues with mental health and sexuality significantly more than Nana does. 

Nana, however, is what could be considered emotionally abusive, she constantly tells me that I forget things because I ""don't want to/care enough to remember"" when I actually have a relatively severe (yet undiagnosed) memory problem. She doesn't understand that anxiety and depression (which I am diagnosed with) can affect my ability to do work/get up in the morning/ clean up after myself. On top of that, she severely misunderstands how college works, and is constantly telling me I'm not good enough or that I'm going to fail because I lack some living skills like laundry. In her mind I'm never good enough. My 3.9 semester GPA in my last year of high school wasnt good enough, my $30,000 scholarship wasn't enough, when I told her in tears that I was accepted to my dream school her first reaction was ""who says you're even going?"".

The past few years have been especially awful when it comes to dealing with her, mostly because I got my license, graduated, and finally realized her ""I'm never wrong and you're never right"" attitude was complete Bullsh*t. It's led to an increased amount of screaming matches in our house about trivial stuff, and lots of threats to keep me home from uni, take my Switch away, just stupid stuff like that. 

Would I be the Asshole if I did my best to avoid her and only contact my mom with my personal problems after I move into college?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7kyp3	2019-06-30 23:09:02	KwitZY	AITA for telling my uncle what I finally think of him?	"Apologies for any spelling errors on phone. 

Basically, it all started in December when my mum unfortunately passed away. My uncles name was the only one left on the mortgage so he was left in charge of sorting out the house, yanno selling it and stuff. About 4 months go by and the house finally sells and I start packing. At this point my step dad moved out in the middle of January so it was mainly up to me and a few others to help pack the whole house. 

Now here’s a little back story on my uncle, he’s around 45, still lives with my pap and for as long as I have known him he’s only worked part time and refuses to move out of my paps home. So the moving date is coming around and my uncle hasn’t been round once to help pack at all, he’s always got other plans and always makes excuses not to help. My dad has to have an operation on his shoulder so that meant that he could no longer help me pack, so begrudgingly my uncle helps me take things to the tip, and at the end of it all says he just can’t be asked with everything. After another week of packing I finally have to move in with my pap and uncle, I’m 19 and really struggling at the min since my job just cut my hours in half. I’m looking to move in with my girlfriend in the next year. 

So I move in, I already knew it wouldn’t end well, small little arguments here and there. I forgot to mention o also have to cats which my pap has decided to take in. So cats need to stay in the house for one to two weeks before the need to be let out, so we always keep the kitchen door shut so we can open the back door. So I come back from the park as it’s hot af atm in the UK, and I see him with the backdoor open, and the kitchen door open. So I told him that he left it open, and all hell breaks loose. Apparently it was my fault it was open, even though I hadn’t even been there. Apparently it’s never his fault. I get angry, as he blamed it on me so I told him it’s never his fault is it. 

This guy proceeds to have a fucking tantrum, starts throwing things and threatens to beat the shit out of me. Now I don’t like being threatened, so I say some things I probably shouldn’t have. I finally told him what I’ve been thinking for such a long time. I told him that he’s a 45 year old kid, worming his way through life as long as he can as he sucks every last penny he can from my pap. How my mum would be fucking disappointed in him for what he’s doing. And that he’s an absolute disgrace to our family. As far as I know, after all of this he’s going to keep all the money he gets from the house aswell after this. I’ve packed up all my things and I’m looking to move in with my dad or my girlfriends parents.

Time skip to a couple of months of him bugging me with questions about the characters and other stuff like “When can I get a stand?” or “If Joseph were still alive blah blah” and i’m at my wits end because I no longer have answers for this stuff and I just want to be done with it, because it’s frankly not funny anymore. So I tell him that it’s not actually real and this dude starts bawling and telling me that he hates me, with a couple of punches of course. Now he’s not talking to me and runs to our older brother (my favorite out of the two) and so now he’s disappointed in me for a stupid joke??

It's important to note that they claim/do (I'm unclear on if a psychiatrist has diagnosed them, but I believe them) suffer from depression.

A while back, they stopped texting me and reading my texts for 9-10 days. I emailed them asking if they were OK? --- they live in a tin-pot country so it is unsurprising for the internet to fail. They replied:
> yo wattup muthafucka? (jk) I hope ur actually fine and good. I'm just rly frustrated and angry and h8 everything and bcuz talking 2 u doesnt help w/ my frustration but actually fuel it, its rly not a gr8 idea for me for now, at this time of my life to talk 2 u. 

After I contacted them, they stopped ghosting me and returned to reading my messages.

After this, a while (month) later (we had exams so) I asked them:
> • Was this some form of test? Like the ghosting period ended right after I contacted you so it's kinda weird.

They were very understanding of my question and said no, and acknowledged it would be forked up if they did that; they also conceded that they forked up by not telling me that they wanted to cut off contact for a bit. Sometimes I have felt overwhelmed by them, so I will message them telling them that I'm going to mute them for a few days.

While there were no hard feelings, I'm wondering if I was an asshole for asking if they were testing me."	Asshole	0	0

For many reasons like; favoritism, screaming for everything and nothing, having no patience whatsoever, wanting  everyone and everything, not caring about my mother's opinion and much more... i could pbly make a full list if someone asks to.

The thing that will lead to this post's title started 2 days ago, after 2 days of being isolated at my grandma's without internet (so being unable to play with my friends and such, which is the only thing that makes me happy) we finally and the first thing i wanted to do is sit and play with my friend and FINALLY not sitting for hours doing nothing which i was not able to do for a long time (for me 2 days without a small amount of fun is hell i easely get bored and it always helps me cope with life).
So i sat and turn on my pc and then my step'father' comes in screaming at me to do something i could totally do tomorrow as it wasnt urgent and was only due to monday (at the time it was saturday) and it would take me like 30 mins maximum to do. But anyways he came literally seconds after we came home and i sit and i just say ""im gonna do it wait"" and he proceeds to say gibberish and simply walks to the net box and takes the cables, in doing so everyone in the house had no more internet.
Of course my mom and my sisters start complaining and my mom started arguing and of course our opinions dont matter.
My mom then just walked away annoyed.

From now on its 2 boring never ending days for everyone, until today in the afternoon my mother really started complaining and said it was unfair and all and he simply didnt cared and ignored her, my sisters complained too and same treatment.
my mom furious comes to me and says something along the lines of ""Anyways everything in this house is like how it pleases him, and because of you rebelling no one will have internet for the whole holidays"" after those words i had a breakdown and I then took my phone and ran away.
My mom didnt give a shit way too angry and tired or me and him and just made some mean commentaries along the way.

I then hid some blocks away in a really hidden spot between 3 walls and nobody could see me from their houses.

Then after 40 mins my mom is calling me and she said : ""Where are you? Come here, we're getting the hell out of here"" after some hesitation i came back and she said : ""tomorrow we're going to my mother's home, but i wont be able to afford everything alone."" I didnt know what to feel at that moment... i felt like i was doing her a favour freeing her from him and she was ways complaining about him but also like an asshole cause they are breaking up cause of me, and he was the one bringing all the money as my mom literally cant work.
We then arrived at home and she told to me and my sisters to go to sleep and after a little bit of arguing with him now is on the sofa planning to sleep there."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I think I'm an asshole in the way that I handle a lot of things. I will yell back, argue and if someone hits me, I will hit back hard. I'm not an easy person to live with for my family, I'm autistic and this means that I have sensory issues. I can't handle loud sudden noises or heavy breathing that well. I have memory issues and forget things nearly instantly. I get frequent panic attacks and I ignore everyone when I'm in those. I usually spend most of my day gaming and trying to avoid people. I have problems that mean that I don't have feelings that are strongly positive. I can get ones that are strongly negative in certain situations but strongly positive ones? They are not something that I get a lot of (that part is probably my fault, I did try and stop feeling any emotions at all at one point in time so that I could try and make everyone else happy).

 My sibling has been bullying me for years, they make me feel depressed and anxious when I'm near them. My mum doesn't seem to give a damn about that. She wants us to be be best friends. She thinks that our arguments are just ""sibling rivalry"". It is not sibling rivalry. Me and sibling have tried to be ""friends"". That didn't work out. I don't even want to TRY to be friends with sibling due to how they make me feel on an everyday basis. My family think that I'm an asshole for not wanting to be friends with sibling.

1. The sign was creating a hazard being in the middle of the road, which completely defeats the purpose

2. Any item in the middle of a road is garbage. I can’t just place, say, a cardboard box in the middle of the road, so I don’t think this sign should be any different. The owners of the sign forfeited their ownership by placing it where they did

c7kttz	2019-06-30 22:56:29		AITA for confronting my friend on the group chat?	"My group of close ”friends” (we are all 16) from school and me are going on a week long trip to another city. Ive known them most of my life but due to many events, the bond isnt really there anymore. Besides they where using, abusing, manipulating and picking on me for the past three years and its common knowledge that keeping up with toxic people just because of your history isnt worth it. For the time being, we are mostly neutral and since we will go to different schools when summer ends, it is the best time for me to say goodbye.

Now what is important is that our group consists of four people: me, my twin brother, F1 and F2. F1 is actually still a pretty decent friend, he can be rough but I have no reason to burn that bridge. F2 on the other hand is where the trouble begins. He used me in school to become more popular among my bullies, picked on me when I used to be fat, constantly dragged me down, mocked my successes, preached my failures and ignored my personal mental issues. He has no respect for me and ignored me my whole life. I have no energy nor time left for him. However, my brother is his very close friend and almost always defends his actions. 

Well, today on our groupchat I decided to estimate the budget for the trip as I cant spend too much money. Immediately after I asked about money, F2 started complaing about me not being chill enough, started shutting me down. I ignored him and asked F1 since he too doesnt have much money. Meanwhile my brother told F2 to calm down. F2 started spamming the conversation with messages telling me to chill down. Finally, I confronted him in a long text, asking him to please let me get it done as there isnt much time left. I wasnt pushy as I can tell. From the other room of my house I hear my brother angrily screaming my name to himself which surprises me. After some time I summed up the costs and the estimated budget turned out to be too high (around 120 US dollars per person). F2 told me to simply get the money from my dad. I tell him that no, I cant simply ask for so much money. He still ignored everything I said so I sent a yet another text in which I asked him once again to please let me get it done and called him out for being ignorant and a hypocrite during our converstation.  He doesnt really say much after the text, we settle the budget.


When suddenly my brother rushes into my room and calls me an asshole for attacking friend2 on groupchat. I ask him to show me exactly how did I attack F2, to which he points the message where I confront F2 on shutting me down. I tell my brother that it wasnt an attack and that I simply confronted him.

c7ktsg	2019-06-30 22:56:21		AITA for asking my depressed friend how he is doing?	"I have an online friend that suffers from depression. I try to check up on him every now and then (maybe once per week) just so he knows im here to talk etc.. Today he was acting really shitty with me and I asked why. He said hes sad for the same problems as always but theres ""no point telling me because Ill just leave like always"" and tbh it really confused me and pissed me off. 
Im trying to be a good friend and a listening ear to him and I am not great at giving advice so I usually cant say much other than the usual stuff ""i understand"" etc and suggestions like volunteeting with animals, old ppl to get him into a better routine (he stays at home 24/7) .
We ended up in a big argument where I told him he is being immature and im sorry that my life doesnt revolve around him. I also reminded him that he never asks how I am doing to which he said that its because i only talk about my boyfriend and how happy i am etc etc which i dont think is true at all. He also says that i am a non existent friend because all i do is check up on him. Am i the asshole here? 
Im really busy and I havent been on social media much recently because I just moved but tbh I shouldn't have to explain myself. Im not his mother or gf so why should I be held accountable or some shit. 
Anyway, AITA? Im starting to feel bad because I know what it is like to suffer from depression and its probably the depression that is making him lash out but I just found it so unfair."	Not the A-hole	1	0

I actively avoid babysitting because normally she will need help with the younger two because the oldest goes to her mother's on the weekends and I try not to play favoritism so I just usually always say I'm busy which I know is wrong because it's a lie but I honestly cannot handle her five-year-old

I have children myself and they are not perfect by any means but they do listen. Her five-year-old throws tantrum over every little thing, doesn't listen, screams to get what she wants, etc. The most recent I was at a birthday party she tried to dunk a little girl when she didn't want to be dunked and obviously that caused a lot of issues as it should have. They had to leave the party early. she screamed at another birthday party when her mother asks her to stop picking her nose and then slam the door to her cousin's room and got herself stuck. 

I figured it's easier for me to just say I'm busy so I don't step on any toes by saying I can't stand being around your kid because if she's going to be at my house she's not going to listen because she doesn't listen to anybody's house.

my friends tell me I'm the asshole and I should just give help her out but I know me and I can't particularly discipline her cuz she's not my child and I'm not going to be able to put up with basically an unruly kid a couple hours a week

My cousin and I got married around the same time. We both ended up pregnant but my wife lost the baby. We dealt with that pain, and also the pain of the only people knowing is my cousin and his wife. She would constantly send pictures of her bump to my wife. She would then go on to send pictures of her baby to my wife constantly. Even right after the miscarriage that they knew about. (My wife told her to please stop and that it’s upsetting her) 

My mom and my cousins wife got really close because “they don’t have anyone” and it’s gotten on my nerves because they’ve always been an asshole.

Long story short myself and a friend were going to the cinema together tonight and he asked me if I could drive him down. The man has his license and a car that he shares with his dad. I said I'd pick him up. He lives around 5 minutes away by car. When I pull up to his house I see his car sitting there and I'm wondering why he needed me to drive him. I casually asked and he said it was environmentally friendly and said no more. So I drove us out to the cinema, enjoyed the movie, and drove him home again.

I shrugged it off because it's not a big deal at all but I'm just wondering why I feel a little bit annoyed by it and if my feelings are justified.

I'm going to start this off by saying that I do have mental health issues, that's why I wanted to get help from this reddit. I usually don't have the best judgement.

This all started when I was a kid. My father was abusive to both me and my mother, physically and verbally. He cheated on my mother every chance I got, and I lived most of the first 9 years of my life in fear.

After that, my parents split up and he kicked me and my mom out of the house, so we had to find somewhere else to live. It was a very stressful couple of year for me because I was dealing with moving away from my friends, going to a new school, and getting constantly bullied. All of this while my dad was pressuring my mom into making me visit him. She never discouraged me and it was always up to me.

I never wanted to, I remember going over one weekend and I had to sleep in the same bed as him, I was sleeping and I was obviously snoring because I woke up with his hand covering my mouth. I was terrified at the time, I was only 10. He would also hold my head under his ass when he farted because he thought it was funny.

Most of the time when I was over there he was paying no attention to me and he just at the tv on. I hated going over there and that made him try to put my mother into prison.

Skip ahead around 4 years. I'm in therapy, my dad wanted to meet my psychologist and psychiatrist, long story short it felt like all three of them were teaming up on me. I felt attacked and that was the last time I seeked mental help. I stopped talking to him. Blocked him on everything, my grandmother on his side emailed me basically calling me a bad son and telling me how much I upset him.

My birthday that year he didn't even text me (I had his number unblocked) to wish me happy birthday. My mom texted him and asked him why. He said I didn't deserve it.

I'm 18 now. I have untreated mental issues. I dropped out of school because of everything that happened. Every day is an uphill battle  and I can't help but feel that a lot of this is his fault.

He tried his best a while ago to be a good father, I was there this Christmas, we hung out a bunch. He's engaged now to someone that has kids of her own. I feel like he has a whole new family now and I feel like I don't belong there anymore. I just want to cut them out of my life.
I feel like it could help me let go of my shitty past.

Two nights ago, I told this to my brother as we are always each other's confidants. Rather than any support, as everything I pawned means a great deal to me, my brother has told me that he will no longer consider me part of the family if I don't get the ring back and that I am as good as ***dead*** to him.   
While I understand his frustration, I'm not without a job, and on top of my next paycheck, I have a guaranteed bonus. I just had medical and legal bills from my past resurface with no fast way to cover them without long term debt. 

I have just under 60 days to buy everything back and get paid within the next 3. The ring meant a lot to me too, and I just don't understand why my brother is taking it so personally when I know I haven't lost the ring for good.

c7knke	2019-06-30 22:40:29		AITA for not wanting to invite my fiancées cousins to wedding	"Context - my fiancées mother died when she was a young teenager and her father is in absentia and has been ever since. After the death of her mother she went to live with friends as none of her blood relatives could/wanted to take her in (her mother was the youngest of 3 by over 12 years and  single mother at 40 so her aunt an uncle were 60ish and cousins 30ish at the time).

We have now been together for nearly 6 years and I asked her to marry me last winter. Outside her aunt and uncle I have never had any contact with her wider family. Since we announced the wedding we decided we wanted it to be small and intimate with only our closest friends and family, we have invited her adoptive family and her aunt and uncle but opted not to invite her cousins (mostly me as I have never met them and the last time she saw them was 7 years ago) she hates not having close blood relatives and it frequently upsets her so I, by extension am very upset and angry with her wider family for barely seeing her (4 or 5 times) since her mother passed. The 4 cousins all see each other fairly regularly now in their 40s.

Her uncle is very protective over his kids and has strongly implied they should be invited to the wedding as 'they are family' but I believe family is not just by blood but by action and they have essentially done nothing for my fiancee for the last 10 years. She is very upset as does not want to ostracise her uncle too but I feel strongly that you shouldn't reward bad behaviour and family should go both ways and they should have been more supportive not just pop out the woodwork when we are getting married. She also doesn't want me to confront them about their behaviour.

My fiancee says that she thinks it would be easier to let them come and her sadness at the lack of a family unit is not to do with them but her loss of her mother. I argue that they could have improved the situation by being there. I am having a very hard time budging on this as I want her to be happy but also feel strongly that they shouldn't get away with bad behaviour then come to a wedding at our (significant) expense. But my continued reluctance could damage her relationship with what family she has? 

So AITA? And any ideas how to resolve this?

TlDR fiancées cousins who essentially haven't spoken to her since death of mother want to come to wedding. Fiancées uncle also thinks this and she doesn't want to upset him. I am currently  reluctant to invite them."		1	0

c7kn1d	2019-06-30 22:39:05	stayzer0	AITA, or we, for not doing what SIL wants?	"My husband's (“J”) father hasn’t been a good dad. On J’s HS grad night, he was gifted a suitcase and told that his parents were divorcing. J joined the Marines about a year later, did his service, and when he got home his dad wrote him off and said to never ask for anything. J moved on. 

J had a serious health scare this spring that put him in the hospital for 2 months. Right before this, his dad had a fall and will be in a home for the rest of his life. SIL is DPOA. While J was in the hospital, his dad decided that he now ""loves"" his son and wants a relationship him. This pattern has always repeated throughout their lives; when it's convenient for dad it's all good. FIL is mentally aware of what he’s doing, it's classic narcissism.

Now that J is home, life is getting back to normal. Except shit with his dad. I agreed to talk as a proxy to my FIL to appease SIL's request that their dad was bugging her to talk with him. Fine, I can deal with texting and stuff. I have the messages on DND and respond when I have time. Well, now she demands J to go visit. In fact, she's saying he needs to ""step up"", but he never agreed to visits. 

J doesn't want to, he does not forgive his dad for the 20+ years of awful treatment, and I don't think he has too. His dad has had ample time to apologize for the shit he did and has refused. Just because he's in a home, that doesn't change. I feel like SIL is only looking at this from her side, as she was daddy's little girl, and never experienced the shit J did. Fuck, J has been home for only a month. Can we focus on our family and our health before we take on someone who is a jerk and will never change? I think she's more TA for trying to make this our problem so he doesn't move out west. That's really what this is about, because she didn't start flipping out until we got an email from his SW stating that maybe it would be better for him to transfer.

This has no benefit for J, it will only cause pain. Her reasoning is that J will lose his dad forever and never have the relationship repaired. Honestly, it probably won't ever be repaired and if J has come to terms with that, it's his right. He has to live with it, not her. Which is why I feel like the meddling is more for the fact that if their father is out where she is, she would then have to be the one with more obligation than she really wants. But she signed the paperwork, he warned her of the burden, and there's nothing we can do about that. Are we really the assholes?

c7kkoz	2019-06-30 22:33:13	cantheman6	WIBTA If I dared my best friend's sister?	"DATED. I MEANT DATED

Mobile post so bad formatting is likely.

Some backstory. Me and my friend have known each other since we were born. He is a month older than I am and he has a sister who is 3 years younger than us. I've known her since she was less than a year old. His family and mine have also been friends for generations since we live in the same building for our summer house. We have known each other for all this time but we only really see each other for a month or so ever summer. My friends mother used to crush on my father back when they were younger as well but my dad never reciprocated feelings as he was best friend's with her brother as well. The whole situation is so similar it's genuinely scary.

Anyway this summer I can sense that my friends sister, let's call her Sarah, is clearly interested me. Now my friendship with my friend is much more important than a summer fling that in no way would last any longer than a month or so until I go back to college but I still don't know what to do. She constantly tries to show some affection and I can tell it is making my friend uncomfortable and my dad even noticed and pointed out the similarities in the whole situation but he ended that conversation saying that I would know how to handle it but I really don't which is why I'm here. Sarah used to be super annoying and I generally ignored her in the past and pushed her away as did her own brother. She has really had a glow up though and has changed her personality completely. I know that if this went any further that I would be in some deep shit with my best friend and it might be the end for us. Just to clarify if I did end up in a relationship with Sarah, this wouldn't involve any sex as that might be a bit too far. My main issue besides my friend taking it badly is that I also see Sarah as somewhat of a sister and I'm afraid it might be a bit weird considering I have known her since she was literally born, albeit I was 3 at the time. 

I know that I WBTA if I went ahead with Sarah but I have no idea how I can decline her without hurting her feelings. I just feel like this situation is gonna end with one of them being hurt by my actions and I fail to see a situation in which everyone is happy.

For context, me and my friend are both 21M, Sarah is 18F."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7kixl	2019-06-30 22:28:38	itsalive420	AITA for calling a woman 'dude'?	"Gonna keep this short as it just happened about 45 minutes ago. It's Canada day tomorrow so we're having a party that will go until midnight or so because we're a bit older here and want to be able to hang with our families tomorrow.

I'll call friend 'Sally' and her girlfriend 'Mandy'

I started my party at my house about 3 hours before all of this went down. It was very much a ""invite your SOs and we'll have some beers"" sort of thing. So I got the BBQ started, grabbed a few pints for some people that were showing up and started to loosen up a bit. My friend whom I have known for the last 15 years shows up with her new girlfriend after about an hour and a half from when I started the party. There's about 15-20 people over now, drinks are flowing and BBQ is being eaten. I saw Sally and said hi like I usually do ""what's up dude, how's life?"" and she told me how they came back from some trip last week and it was cool and all that. She introduced me to her girlfriend and this is where it gets a little weird.

I say ""hey what's up dude?"" to Mandy very casually and she gives me a weird look and says ""...I'm not a *dude*"". So I quickly apologized and just said I call everyone that, even my wife. Sure enough 2 seconds later as if it was a sign, my wife comes over and says to me ""hey dude we need some more hot dogs"" and she quickly introduced herself and left. I turned to Mandy and again quickly apologized and told her I was sorry if it came across weird and that I hope I didn't hurt her feelings(this was heartfelt, it could not have come across as bitchy or as a jab I assure you) then I made myself scarce. I find out about 25 minutes later that she's telling anyone who will listen that I'm misidentifying her and not making her feel welcome by misgendering her. I walked up to her and told her it was not my intention to make her feel unwelcome, I apologized and explained I just call everyone dude and that it wasn't personal but then right after that Sally comes over and starts telling me what her girlfriend told everyone else and that she agrees with Mandy.

ONCE AGAIN I apologized and Sally and Mandy left in a huff leaving me flabbergasted and having about half my guests come to me and tell me she was overreacting and the other half agreeing with Mandy. About 1/4th of my guests have left my party already so this is very upsetting to me. 

She made her feelings very clear on what I said, I quickly apologized and explained it was not my intention to not make her feel welcome and I'm sorry if I hurt her feelings. I hoped we could just enjoy the night after but to be honest I think she overreacted and it really messed up my party because now the mood is down and I am missing about 6 or 7 people who showed up earlier. 50% agree with me and 50% don't so AITA?"

c7kilb	2019-06-30 22:27:50	Cocoachan12	AITA for staring at a wall during a date?	"I (19F) went out on a dinner date with a guy (24M). I’m pretty inexperienced when it comes to dating, so I was pretty nervous. While we were waiting for our food, the conversation between the two of us fell flat and I couldn’t think of any other topics to bring up.

I was always taught that it’s rude to just stare at someone without reason, so my eyes kind of just directed themselves towards the wall adjacent to our table during this period of awkward silence. It’s important to note that he didn’t try to start up a new conversation, either.

Then he told me, “You seem to be really interested in that wall...” with an annoyed tone. He seemed to be upset that I wasn’t talking to him but luckily, our food arrived and I began talking about the food, I guess.

When we were finishing up, the restaurant got louder and louder (it was a bar restaurant) and I couldn’t hear what he was saying. So I repeatedly asked, “What?” In a relatively loud voice and he sighed and told me that I was being annoying.

AITA? Is it my responsibility to plan some conversation topics before a date? And should I practice a softer voice?"	No A-holes here	0	0

He's not bad at the games, but he does lose often. And when he does, he'll ask for a handicap. In Smash or any other fighting game for example, he'll throw his controller when he loses and get personally mad whenever anyone calls him out for being immature.

We were playing an open world game today, and I find out he's been cheating his way to the endgame and leaving us in the dust. I calmly say I don't want to play with someone cheating and leave. He texts me and gets extremely angry, saying I'm a righteous asshole for not wanting to play with him, and ignoring his offers to cut it out (because I was busy telling him why I'm not a fan of it). He begins to throw a pity party and says he wants to just play god and watch other people have a good time.

Because he was insistent on defending his cheating, I tell him that ""Cheating is bad. I think you'd learn that by now."" He cheated on his girlfriend a few months ago and it cost him his relationship.

I find a seat near one of the mall entrances and just chill while listening to music through my earphones. After about 5 minutes, an old man comes up to me and taps me on the shoulder and tells me that he wants to rest. At first I was confused and then I realized he wants me to give him my seat. I tell him I'm on break and that he can find somewhere else to sit since I'm tired as well. He gives me a mean look and leaves but other people were staring at me as well.

c7kfal	2019-06-30 22:19:15	Throwagay12344	WIBTA if I reported a person for using her dead kid's account?	"I'm an avid player of a phone game which involves playing/interacting with other people. The rules of the game point out that you should not share accounts or multiaccount, and it is generally frowned upon even if not unheard of for people to multiaccount or help out their family members.

There's one lady whose kid liked playing the game. Said kid died over a year ago. Lady continues using kid's account even today - directly affecting other peoples' gameplaying. She doesn't hide it at all. If it were her using the account on special occasions (like kid's birthday) or if she was just completing a project or two in honor of dead kid, I would let it slip... but she just full-out uses it to gain advantages on the game. And whenever someone new to the scene asks about it, they'll get shunned because ""omg she's grieving, let her be"".

At this point I see it as her plainly cheating in the game and using dead kid as an excuse, because it has been so long. I feel like one year is plenty of time to wrap up loose projects. However, I don't have kids so I'm probably biased and cannot ever understand her point of view.

So: WIBTA if I reported her?

Edit: Additional info. Lady has her own account so she's using both accounts at the same time. Also, this game is socially interactive i.e. what lady does will affect my and others' gameplay.

Tl;dr lady uses dead kid's account for over a year to do what I view/rules state as cheating on phone game. WIBTA for reporting?"	Asshole	0	0

The thing is, I don't want to have the party. My parents asked the band I'm in to perform, and are expecting me to have fun. The big issue is, there's no good reason for this party to exist. I was raised to seriously not care much about societal rituals (never went to church, communion, got to leave a wedding early {for a marching band festival I had to go for being a leader} with the bride and groom's consent).

I don't want the money and gifts from people, and don't want to waste a day that I could be working or doing something useful.

I didn't have to go to prom, which I didn't care about anyways (the pressure to attend was from my friends and their parents), and didn't go to any dances, again because I didn't care/didn't want to.

c7keyi	2019-06-30 22:18:26	MuchGiraffe	WIBTA if I cut ties with an old friend	"Apologies if formatting is rough. I’m on mobile.

Background: We have been friends for 8 years and supported each other in school. We’re 22 & 23

Recently he went through a bad breakup and turned to alcohol. He drinks every day and it ruining his life. His parents have kicked him out the house and he sometimes sleeps rough when he doesn’t want to crash on a friend’s sofa. 

My boyfriend was moving out the city and asked all my friends to come for some drinks in a bar to say goodbye to them all. My friend showed up with his jaw in a different zip code from whatever drugs he had taken before showing up. Despite this, we had a good night and it was nice to see him. He made multiple comments about knowing he’s an alcoholic but when we mentioned options to him such as AA he shrugged it off and said that it’s his choice to drink and we can’t do anything.

We left him that night in a club with one of his friends who we bumped into and went home at about 3am as I work an office job and needed to go home.

I woke up that morning and sent him a message saying I was worried about him and how self aware he was of his situation but him not caring. 

He replied two hours later saying he just woke up in London (we live a 6 hour drive or 2 hour train ride from there) with no memory of how he got there and how he was worried he wouldn’t get home for work and would get fired because he didn’t have enough money to get home. 

I looked up train times, found the cheapest train that would get him home and rang him to say I would buy the ticket and email it to him. He just laughed at me, told me he wouldn’t take it and to stop trying to act like his mum (who he hates). I got frustrated and told him he needed to start taking responsibility for his actions and to take the ticket, come back home and go to work so he wouldn’t get fired. He laughed, said he found a bike that’s unlocked and took it then was just cycling around London on the phone to me while I told him he can’t just act this way. It ended with me telling him that if he wanted to ticket to call me back but i couldn’t spend anymore time trying to convince him as I was at work. He was extremely rude and told me to fuck off.

I went back to work. I didn’t check my phone again for a few hours as I had already wasted 45 minutes on the phone but it was on loud and no calls came through. When I next checked I had texts saying ‘please don’t be mad at me, you’re my rock’, ‘I’m sorry I upset you’, ‘please say something, even if you are angry’ and ‘fine, be like this. I’m done trying.’

Another friend of mine text me saying he got the train home and went to work. 

I can’t help someone who isn’t willing to help themselves but I also fully understand why he acts this way. I feel like I’d be failing him if I cut ties but he’s changed from his alcohol consumption and is consistently rude and it’s starting to affect me.

c7keeg	2019-06-30 22:17:02	Shawn_Spenstar	AITA for refusing to say grace at a family dinner?	So for a little backstory I'm 32 I've been atheist since I was about 12 and have despised organized religion for about as long. My family besides me are all Christian's with my grandma being a very religious Christian woman. So every other week or so me, my brother, my sister and her husband and kids, my grandma and uncle all go over to my parents house for a family dinner. Before dinner my grandma always makes a big deal of saying grace, I sit their quitly and respectfully but don't say grace along with them. At the last dinner my grandma pulled me aside and asked me to say grace with them because my nephew's see me sitting there not saying grace and then according to her think it's cool not to say grace. I told her respectfully that I won't say grace, if my sister wants to raise her boys Christian that is absolutely her choice and I won't say anything negative about their religion around them but I'm also not going to help indoctrinate my nephew's into a religion I despise. Que grandma tearing up and my family saying I'm an asshole why can't I just say grace etc. Now imo I did nothing wrong, they have their beliefs I don't agree with them but I respect them and their right to have them. If the shoe was on the other foot and I invited them to a dinner at my house I would never ask my grandma not to say grace so I am I the asshole here?	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7kdeg	2019-06-30 22:14:32		WIBTA if I just called the cops on my pot-smoking neighbors, without taking any other steps toward getting them to stop making my AC unit unusable?	"I have always been pretty chill with weed use and such and really don’t mind being around it at party’s or when in outside, but 3 weeks ago some new residents moved into the apartment next door to the one I am squatting at and literally every time it turn on the AC (Texas summer, AC should be a human right down here) I literally just smell weed. Out apartment’s AC vents are connected so it comes in that way, but also they have taken to smoking right next to the intake vent too. It has gotten to the point where I just avoid going home or having guests over because the apartment is so pungent.

I would just tell them to please stop, but I am a girl in her early 20s who lives alone right now  and has had reason not to trust men in the past, and they are 3 men in their late 20s. So that is def not going to happen.

I also don’t think I can go to the apartment office and report them because I’m a squatter. I’m just staying in the apartment for a few months while my friend and her roommates are elsewhere for the summer. So I’m not on the lease, and my living here technically violates the lease because there is some rule about number of occupants or something so I don’t think I can go to management.

Which I feel like only leaves me with me tipping the cops. Problem is though that I don’t really think the cops would care about something like this, and also I feel like I would be an asshole for doing it because it’s only pot, and I’m not even supposed to be living here right now and I’ve smoked in my time too so it’s not even like I would be calling for something I’m innocent of? I would just be calling because its really starting to piss me off which I don’t think is a good enough reason to get law enforcement involved."	Asshole	1	0

I have a long time friend that expressed interest in staying at my brand new house that I bought at the beach I just bought I'm December, as I am going out of town for the 4th of July and he and his wife are coming back to town. This is a friend I was very close with when he lived in town, but have become less close with after he moved out of our area. He has asked more than once even though I have politely said I am not comfortable with anyone being in my house when I am not there. This is also my first home. 

At no point did I ever say I was ok with renting, AieBNB'ing or lending my place out to anyone let alone a friend. I saved for this for almost 10 years and fought very hard to have my first home. It has never been insinuated in any capacity that I would ever rent this out. 

The more concerning parts are that any time he has come back to the area before now, trying to hang out with him or offering him a place to stay for free when he is back in town he is wildly unavailable. This has happened on more than one occasion in the last 4 years. It is strange to me that me being out of town, he has no problem asking to stay at our place for days on end, but if me and my wife are here it would be impossible to see them for the same period of time - something that has happened more than once. I value our friendship, or what is left of it, but he's putting me in a terrible position.

c7kahx	2019-06-30 22:07:21	NuclearHubris	AITA for not contacting my best friend anymore?	"To preface: I'm sorry if the answer seems obvious to some, but it's not to me, and that's why I'm here. I think it's important to mention that I have been diagnosed with severe PTSD from my abusive childhood. I struggle with it 24/7. 

So I(24) have this friend we'll call Sparrow(23). So Sparrow and I have known each other for a few years now. We met at our community college, and were instant best friends - we hung out all the time, went through some friends, played DnD on the weekends, made new friends, and became confidants of each other. Things were great. We really meshed and neither of us had had a friend like each other before. Ride or die. 

Until things changed. Sparrow sort of... stopped talking to me. Nothing had happened between us, I'd even asked - they insisted nothing was wrong and they were just busy. But they'd been busy before and still *texted me* at the very least. Any invite out was either rejected, or accepted and canceled on the day of, usually in the morning.

I tried to talk to them about how I felt, which was the only time we'd hung out in about a year's span of time - we went to lunch and hung out, and things seemed normal. They told me things were fine between us and that they didn't text first, but they'd try, and things would pick up soon.

And they haven't talked to me since. I've tried to talk to them by texting first but Sparrow just doesn't text back, or texts back days later, and it's always one or two words at most. Even at really important life news (like getting my official PTSD diagnosis, something they knew I was seeking and actually originally encouraged me to get years ago.) I got ""Cool!"" or something similar and nothing else. That especially hurt. I got not so much as a text on my birthday, where every time before we'd hang out and have lunch and make a day of it. I learned things that were going on in their life through Twitter updates; they were hanging out with coworkers, going out to lunch, getting their driver's license, got a car gifted from their dad, visiting the university they were going to transfer to. Things they would normally have texted me about, or celebrated with me about.

I thought about it, talked to some people close to me, and now I'm just angry. They've not only essentially ghosted me for what seems like no reason - but insisted everything is fine while doing it. I don't know if the friendship was a lie and I never meant anything to them, or what. I decided to leave it and let them ghost me. They told me they don't text first but I'm tired of being the only one even trying to act like a friend. I'm really fucked up about it.

"Sometimes I have to go to a cousin’s house an they have a *big* dog. No, I don’t have allergies or anything. In fact, normally I’m a dog person but this dog is different. I don’t know what its deal is but even after multiple times trying to connect with him, or professionals trying to train the dog, it will bark like hell, pee like crazy, and *try* to attack me on sight. It’s been like this for a long ass time. 

The final straw was when they decided they wanted the dog to like me (again, it’s been years and nothing). I had to go on a walk with my cousin, who would hold his leash. For the entire duration of the walk I would have to stand like 10 feet away from her because even after giving him dozens of treats he acts as if I had just murdered his owner in front of him.

After getting back to their house and doing a pathetic game of fetch with him (I would have to back out of sight before she let him chase after the ball), the dog seemed to cool down. I thought I may have been safe. So after I tossed him a treat (I have to give him treats from a distance or else he would bite me) he ran off his leash, ran straight to me barking like a maniac and attacked me. I couldn’t run away (because that dog is fast), and I knew I couldn’t kick it or anything or else I would be forever painted as the “bad guy”. After like 15 seconds of trying to avoid it they finally got ahold of his leash. And put him in his cage.

Afterwards, they said they wanted to try a few more things to make him more friendly but I said I had enough and waited in the car 

I don’t want to deal with him anymore, so WIBTA if I told them to put him somewhere if I had to come over for a family event or anything? I would be fine with paying a *piece* of the cost but I refuse to come over if that monster is still there. And no, a cage wouldn’t work. It even barks and shakes its cage a ton if I’m even on the same floor! Hell even if he knows I’m there he will bark.

TLDR: Cousin’s dog is incredibly aggressive to me and recently attacked me. I want them to put it in a daycare or something if I come over. WIBTA

Problem was I was out of town for a few weeks so we couldn’t meet. I was very up front with him about how I didn’t want us to get too committed until we could meet in person. In general I don’t believe in “falling in like” over text and also based on his pictures I couldn’t tell for sure if I would be attracted to him irl. 

Two weeks pass and we have texted everyday not getting too deep but enough where I can tell we have a lot in common and I can see potential. We meet up and I know instantly I’m not attracted to him. I give it a few hours-since we have a lot in common we had a lot to talk about and are both quality time people. But in the end I didn’t get romance vibes and I still unfortunately wasn’t attracted to him. 

Later that night after we had parted ways he sent a text saying he had a good time and hopes we can do it again soon. I text back saying I had a good time too but I feel like we would be better as friends than dating. He took it well and while he was disappointed he appreciated my honesty and would still like to hang out more. 

So here’s the part I’m asking about. 
I texted him today (which is literally the very next day) and just was talking about church (we’re both religious and have casually talked about church stuff before). His responses seem to be shorter than before. Nothing mean but not as enthusiastic. AITA for texting so soon?

Like I'm sorry, but if you have money to spend on something that's slowly killing you, and you choose to spend on that rather than food for your dog, I don't have any sympathy for you. She doesn't even buy cheap brand cigarettes.

I might also mention that she makes more money than me. I see her on FB going places with her other friends several times a week. 
I've lended her money in the past and didn't get it back. Fucking sick of being taken advantage of!

c7k70h	2019-06-30 21:59:08		AITA? I sold camera gear to a stranger who only partially paid. He demanded a refund and I offered 50% of what he paid me so far.	"Am I being unreasonable?  

I advertised my old Canon 550D + 18-55mm kit lens for £189 on a local selling website. This includes a camera bag, remote and SD card.    

A man contacts me saying he’s willing to buy it but can only pay £100 now and will pay the £89 balance on payday.   

I agreed since he said he’ll leave his passport and driving licence with me.   

Then he didn’t come to pick it up when he said he would. 

After messaging him to see if he wanted it, the next day he responds that he does and that he’ll collect at 7pm. And that he would like two extra lenses that I was also selling. 

7pm comes and he doesn’t come. 

He messages again on Saturday that he’ll definitely come and pick it up. Which he actually does! 

I show him the camera gear and give him the opportunity to inspect it and take photos etc. 

I also showed him the two lenses that I had but state that I can’t give them to him since he’s not paying full price right now but that if I still have them when he comes to pay the balance for the rest of the camera then they’re his! 

Later on Saturday he messages me again saying that the rubber boundary on the view finder is missing. I apologised and said I hadn’t noticed and offered a FULL refund! He lives up the road from me, so I offered to come and pick it up. He declined and said that he’d still like the camera! 

He messages me Sunday morning that he’s “loving the camera” but would really like one of the lenses that I’m selling since it would be better for portraits. I guess his wife is an instagrammer or something. 

I said he can have them but he’d have to pay more later since I’m losing the opportunity of selling to someone who has the cash now. He declined saying he doesn’t have the money!

Then 10 mins later texts me saying he’s unhappy with the camera that it’s dirty etc.  

This time I offer a partial refund, since I know he’s used it and also because he’s annoying me! 

I stated that I’d given him the opportunity to inspect it and that I’m not a manufacturer or reselling business. Plus I didn’t make any false claims regarding the condition of the camera and stated that it was used! 

To hire camera gear for 24 hours can be £65+ so I figured giving him £50 back was pretty fair. 

He said he’ll hold onto it and pay the full balance on payday, but he thinks I’m being unfair. 

One of my friends also said that only giving half back was also unfair. So now I don’t know?

TLDR:  I sold a guy a camera, he paid £100 upfront and the rest later. He seemed to have no issues but now he’s demanded a refund after using it but I only offered £50 back, AITA?"		1	0

c7k48x	2019-06-30 21:52:13		AITA for wanting my son to have a “normal” name, apart from his ethnic name.	"( English is not my first language so sorry if I have any error)

I live in a city where we are very homogeneous, so when people see some different ( another race, speaking a different language, or having a rare name ) they tend to be agresive. I even had classmates bullied because of their families being from other countries.
 
Regardless of that I fell in love and married to a woman of Welsh ancestry, and he is very proud of it. She already pregnant and and the other day we were discussing names for our child. She wanted to give him a welsh name. I don’t have anything against it and some of the names are really nice. But I fear that people would discriminate him for being a “foreigner” because of his name so I told her that we could give him a welsh name but that we should also give her a “normal” name ( a name from here ) so that when he is with people he doesn’t know he can use that name. She told me that was a terrible idea and he get very angry at me, I guess that’s the hormones talking.

I really think my idea is a good one, she can have a son with a welsh name and our son isn’t going to be bullied or discriminated for it. Am I the asshole for this idea?"	No A-holes here	1	0
c7k478	2019-06-30 21:52:06	pringle_tube	AITA for not trying to reconcile with my father?	"As far as I can tell, there are a couple of points in this story where I could conceivably be the asshole (or arsehole as we'd say here). I'm very slightly autistic and sometimes struggle to know what the acceptable/expected course of action should be in a given situation so maybe you guys can help.  


I live several hundred miles from my family, and for the first time since Christmas, I am currently back in my hometown for a week to catch up. I took my friend up with me for the weekend as he'd never been here before and we wanted to check out some local breweries and distilleries. My parents are divorced and don't talk but live close to each other. My friend and I were staying at my mum's for the weekend as she has the guest bedroom and was celebrating her retirement so we wanted to be around.  


I told my father over a phone call weeks ago that I would be around this week. So I messaged him the day after I arrived wanting to make plans with him for the week ahead. Apparently he had forgotten the call as he was incredibly offended that I would come all the way up, not warn him, then spend the first two days with my friend and not drop by to see him. He said he'd be temporarily blocking me on all media and that I was not welcome to visit him because I had shown a complete disrespect for him.  


I was pretty devastated as I'd spent a week of holiday time in part to come and see him and catch up (we usually get along great, and he's getting a bit older now).  


Now, my brother and mother are of the opinion that he was 100% TA in his actions but that I should go around unannounced, be the bigger man, and try to reconcile things to the whole week isn't ruined. I take a different view; he's specifically told me he doesn't want to see me thus to go round could actually make things worse. Plus, I'm very hurt by his reactions, and as he is a man who never apologises I fear the only way of reconciling with him would be to admit I was wrong. Now I sense my mother and brother think I'm TA for refusing to go round.  


Extra Info: He had his dog put down a month or so back and though he was pragmatic on the phone saying that he was zen about it and pleased that the rescue dog had had such a good life, my mother wonders if he's really depressed about it and so going in ""all guns blazing"". He does have a history of depression, but overcame it 6 years ago and has since been really happy."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Two years ago i (20,m) moved away to start college, but still kept in contact with my parents regurarly, almost daily. 
I used to call my mom and stepdad evenly, but with my mom working irregularly i started talking more with my stepdad. 


This was actually a huge relief for me too, since when i talk with my stepdad, we just talk about random stuff like movies, our days and if im doing well. Now, When i talk with my mom, its more like a interrogation. How am i doing in school, am i keeping up with everything, am i exercising, stuff like that. 


Now, throughout my whole life ive had anxiety and been diagnosed with depression. My parents both know that. They also now that it gets worse when im under more pressure. I had to be hospitalised last october bcz i almost killed myself from the pressure of school, work and parents

After a while of almost only talking with my stepdad, my mom got Mad that i never called her, so i told her to say her schedule so i know when to call. This worked for a while and everything was fine. However, this past semester i did my bachelors essay and my partner sucked and didnt work  so we failed. 

This put me in a lot of stress since i need the points to get to the next semester and a teacher found another old assignment i hadnt done and said i could do that to continue. This still means im under a lot of pressure, and my parents know that. 

My mom, however, kept just asking about school whenever i call her, even though i am almost crying halfway through the call everytime. My stepdad on the other hand keeps talking about random stuff and how im feeling whenever we talk, which makes me  feel more at ease 

So am i the asshole for not wanting to call my mom as often as my stepdad?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c7k3l2	2019-06-30 21:50:33	throwawaywwws	AITA for lying about my friend cheating?	"Throwaway account and trying to keep it quite vague so it doesn't get linked to me. (at least I hope it's vague enough, I don't know how common this situation is tbh) 


My best friend (let's call her May) and I met eachother when we were really young and we've been really close ever since. A few years ago she met her bf (let's call him Dave) and the three of us hang out sometimes, but I'm nowhere near as close to Dave as I am May.
Recently someone close to May died and she took it hard, despite never drinking before she suddenly decided to go out drinking by herself, and while she was there hooked up with a random guy.
She told me the next morning and she was really ashamed of herself, I suggested she should tell Dave and she said she would, but asked me not to say anything in the mean time, so I agreed.


About a week later I get a message from Dave asking about May, saying he suspects she cheated because of how strangely she was acting, and he asks me if I know anything about it because he knows we're so close that she tells me basically everything. Now I absolutely hate lying. It makes me feel sick and guilty and I can't handle it. So I make a vague comment along the lines of ""I don't think she's the cheating type"" (which ordinarily is true, I don't think she would have done if she hadn't got really drunk after never drinking before)
Apparently this was enough to satisfy him that she hadn't cheated and he didn't bring it up again, and they're still happily together and May hasn't mentioned the cheating to him yet.


I'm really conflicted if I did the right or wrong thing because I almost never lie, but I didn't want to get caught up in a situation that doesn't involve me. And I'm sick of second guessing myself and not knowing what I should have done."	Asshole	0	0
c7k316	2019-06-30 21:49:12		AITA for inadvertently causing a customer to leave earlier than he’d planned?	"Before I start this, just wanted to say this was not a big deal at all in the long term, but it was just bothering me a little at the time.


So I work at a bakery/cafe, and part of my job is sweeping and mopping all the floors in the place, so when it came time to clean the floors in the cafe section, I noticed one of our regulars, named John, sitting at a table. My coworker Ashlyn told me John was planning on staying in the cafe until close.


John is a very nice gentleman, he’s a widower so he loves to spend his time in our cafe and interact with other customers and my coworkers.


I’m usually not supposed to clean floors if people are around, but I was running a tad late, so I asked John if he was okay with me cleaning the floors around him.


In his charming manner he said “I’m leaving the place to you,” and I was glad to see him be so kindly cooperative. I prepared to start sweeping the floors, and a minute later I notice that John was leaving. I wanna say it was about a half hour before close so he was leaving early than he’d planned.


Ashlyn called out to John as he was walking out to try to get him to stay and I did the same, because I didn’t want John to leave, I just needed to get the floor done.


He wasn’t upset or passive aggressive as he was leaving, he just told us to have a good night. I felt pretty bad for causing him  to leave.


As I was walking around our back room, I heard Ashlyn in passing say to another coworker, “These guys just kicked John out of the cafe.” (“These guys” because I was training a new guy)


I genuinely couldn’t tell if Ashlyn was mad or not, but she might’ve been because if John had stayed, she would’ve gotten more tips from him, and John is always very generous with tips.


I felt bad for accidentally kicking John out, and I felt bad for causing Ashlyn to lose out on some money, but if I hadn’t gotten the floor done at that point in time, I would’ve been stuck at work for about an extra half hour.

A little background, I am a senior in college and have my own apartment with a roommate. My brother is a senior in high school and still lives with my parents. We brother grew up in a Lutheran church so nearly all my beliefs/opinions are conservative.

I've been close with my brother for my whole life. I love him more than anyone. Since he was little he has been following in my footsteps, playing the same sports I play, dressing like I do, styling his hair like mine, he even wants to go to the same college. And like me, for all of high school my brother has been the good looking popular kid, bringing a new woman to meet me and my mom and dad every couple months.

I am visiting my parents house for a while for Independence Day, and 2 days ago he brought home a different person from the last time I saw him. It was a guy. It took me by surprise as he had been dabbling with ladies for his whole life. He told my parents and I he was gay, not even bicurious, and I took off to my old room. To put it simply my parents talked to my brother and the new guy and told me they like him and they're supporting my brother. I was furious and confused at the same time. Since birth I was told being told being gay was a sin and now they are ok with my brother being gay? I still believe it is just plain wrong. I know that's homophobic but that's was I was raised to think. I honestly think it's just a phase and he's trying guys out for a while.

WIBTA if I stopped talking to my brother if he fully believes he's gay? I've been avoiding him as much as possible for the past couple days. I will talk to him about it before I leave though.

c7jxtj	2019-06-30 21:36:24	Aniss201	AITA for grading a classmate's presentation when I wasn't assigned to do it?	"My German teacher has a particular method when it comes to grading oral presentations: The students are the ones who grade them, and he sometimes changes the original grade since no one really cares about giving accurate grades. He picks random students and gives them the topic they're grading (visuals, grammar, posture, etc.), but he's never said that someone who wasn't assigned to grade the thing can't share their opinion on it. 

Now one of my classmates is doing his presentation and I notice that it has a lot of text on it (long paragraphs that distract the viewers). The presentation ended and I wasn't assigned to grade the visuals, but the girl who did was completely distracted and just gave him a 5 (the highest grade). I raised my hand and told him that he had too much text, so the teacher changed his grade.

c7jx1c	2019-06-30 21:34:34	aitathrowaway2825902	AITA for losing my patience with my GF during a break down?	"Hey. It’s probably obvious that I’m the asshole in this situation, but here goes. My girlfriend and I are both 17. For most of our relationship, she has been struggling with abuse from her family and mental illness. She vents to me about this almost everyday and constantly talks about being hopeless. It can be really stressful and unnerving for me to hear, it overwhelms me beyond belief and I can barely process what she tells me at times.

Yesterday she was having a breakdown and was on the brink of running away. I tried my best to listen and give her options, but then she tried to call me and I couldn’t bring myself to answer. I felt like there was nothing I could do or say anymore, I could no longer support or help her as I can’t physically do anything. I felt like I was losing control and I felt like I was about to lose her. I couldn’t process what she was telling me at the moment.

So due to this, she got mad at me, and suggested taking a break since we are both obviously stressed out. Our conversation then devolved into her breaking into hysterics and me saying all of the wrong things, such as telling her that it is her fault at times for what happens in her family situation, that I don’t know if I can handle the relationship, that her and her family scare me, etc. It was a huge mess and I feel awful for saying those things while she had a breakdown. 

I apologized to her for being so harsh afterwards and told her that perhaps she isn’t in the right state of mind to handle a relationship right now and she agreed. We are now on a break. 

I used to be able to support her very well, she would cry on the phone to me until I calmed her down, I helped her get through drama with her friends, her mental illness symptoms, panic attacks, etc. But honestly, it’s become so bad now that I feel like i’ve given up. I’m overwhelmed and stressed as her problems have escalated and all she does now is vent to me. And now I feel especially bad for being harsh with her during a breakdown.

"The title says it all really - my (21M) sister (24F) who is non-autistic will scream at me or my mother when something happens that isn't to her liking, and today I reached breaking point over her behaviour by threatening to make it so she wouldn't be able to speak for a year if she ever screamed at me again. Honestly, I know threatening people is quite a pathetic thing to do (it was just an empty threat - I've never hit anyone in my life and the only person that ever pisses me off is her) but I'm fed up of how my sister treats both me and my mother.

&#x200B;

Firstly, some context about my sister : She's a graduate with a decent paying job and is paying pennies (like £200/month) to live at home. When I was younger she pretty much tormented me by constantly winding me up and getting me into trouble, which honestly has led to me fucking resent her. We've never been close, and when I finish uni and leave home I will never speak to her again because of the way she is. She treats my mother like shit, my father knows it and he won't tell her jack shit to sort her out, and whenever I bring up how she acts to my parents or her literally everybody brushes it off.  


Anyway, so what happened today was pretty pathetic - I went a grabbed a pre-made sandwich and got about 30 seconds of screaming in my ear how ""THAT'S NOT YOUR SANDWICH WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING..."" etc. and I just reached breaking point, stormed off upstairs and fucking shouted my threat back at her. Naturally she plays the victim stating that I'm not justified in my actions, and my parents agree and again they forget that she screamed in my ear for the 1000th time. This isn't the first time she has screamed about petty stuff like this, here are a few more examples that I can remember off the top of my head:

* Someone ate a yoghurt she was going to eat, but never told anyone that, and screamed
* Somebody mistook the easter egg she was given as their own and ate it, demanded that they should buy her a new one
* Somebody took one of her chocolates and she went ape shit again
* There was a missing fork on the table and boy did she let everyone know someone stole *her* fork (she screamed at everyone)

I really wish I was trolling because reading this through seems absolutely nuts.

&#x200B;

But it's not just the constant screaming about minor inconveniences, she'll bitch about every fucking thing possible to make the lives of my mother and I and living hell. It's been going on for years now, and I have to know if my response (i.e threat) to her was somehow remotely justified because I'm fucking done with her. AITA for how I finally snapped at her?"		1	0

I've never been kayaking, and I'm all for trying new things but I've been canoeing before and it definitely isn't my favorite thing.

c7ju4p	2019-06-30 21:27:34	woahhellotherefriend	AITA for giving a man a gift card worth less than I originally told him?	"To gain practice in my potential career field and prepare myself for the graduate program I'm starting this upcoming fall (tech-related), I decided to take on a personal project with a couple of friends from my university. The preliminary research of the project involves interviewing people for 15-20 minutes about their usage of a specific website, with the goal of redesigning the website for better usability. I was tasked with recruiting the interviewees. I was having a difficult time, but eventually decided to post a craigslist ad to find recruits. I decided to post in the volunteer section of craigslist.

&#x200B;

In the craigslist ad, I said that I only need a small amount of people to interview (up to 10 people), and that the 10 people who schedule an interview will be put in a raffle for a $25 amazon gift card. After one interview, an older man (mid 50s) asked if the winner \*had\* to be given an Amazon gift card. I said I was open for discussion. Well, I only ended up needing 5 people to interview. However, I was super grateful to all 5 people who volunteered their time to help me out. So after the interviews, I sent 3 of the 4 non-winners $15 Amazon gift cards, which was received with thanks.

&#x200B;

When I messaged the other guy about the Amazon gift card, he said he wanted a Visa gift card or a check instead. No one my age has checks or uses checks anymore, so that was out the window. And the Visa gift cards have a $5 fee compared to no fee with Amazon. Which means my $15 gift turns to $20. I know an extra $5 isn't a lot, but I'm not exactly rolling in dough as a broke college kid. Now, this is where I acknowledge I could've communicated better. But I didn't want to say ""No, that costs shipping and fees"" and risk him getting upset with me. I should've stood my ground. But, in order to avoid confrontation, I decided to purchase a $10 gift card instead and inform him that the fees cut into my budget.

&#x200B;

He messages me back, asking me if I can get a $15 gift card and go to the post office instead and get a $.50 stamp to send off. Now I'm irritated, because this guy wants me to physically drive to a store, pick up a gift card, and then drive to a post office to get him a gift card that he originally wasn't even supposed to get in the first place. And I live in a city notorious for very bad traffic.

&#x200B;

I re-iterated that I had already bought the gift card and that it was too late and also re-iterated that even though there was only supposed to be one winner, I wanted to reward everyone for their time with what money I have. I apologized for the inconvenience and wished that the gift card finds him well. If he emails me back requesting more demands, I'm thinking of blocking him.

Recently we got a new student in our school. His family is from Spain but moved to Argentina. I was excited but then I saw her  last name, Boluda. Now in Spain that is a normal last name, but in Argentina Boluda is a curse word ( it means idiot or stupid ).

This obviously caused problems, every time I call her people think I’m insulting her, their classmates laugh when I say her last name ( I need to say her last name every morning when I take the presence of every student ), and now my students insulte each other and when I tell them not to they say “ I wasn’t cursing I was calling [ her name ]”.

I spoke to the parents and told them I would have to call her by her second last name. They were really angry about it, they told me I couldn’t prohibit her daughter from using her last name. I know it may be bad but her name is causing a lot of problem in the class and I fear that their classmates will bully her because of it."	Asshole	0	0

c7jrok	2019-06-30 21:21:57	caelbi23	AITA For purposefully not standing up to workplace bullying?	It sounds pretty terrible but I have a middle aged coworker who has some sort of mental disability (downs syndrome possibility) who has difficulty keeping up with the pace in our work place. We are in the food industry so it is difficult to accommodate for someone with that sort of disability. He is very slow and has messed up orders constantly and even gave someone something they said they were allergic to. The cooks are fed up with him and will verbally berate him and it has started moving into verbal abuse territory, calling him a retard and how he's useless.. I had originally planned to say something to our boss a while ago to defend the guy, even though I'm not one for confrontation.  But for the past month or so, this guy has started spouting some pretty antisemitic and homophobic crap to me while we're alone in the dish pit (for some reason people seem to think it's ok to spill their guts and give me tmi). Said stuff like how gays are disgusting and going to hell and how he thinks Jews are bad people and how much he  hates them. How people of color and women are given good jobs out of pitty and that thats the reason why he's (a white straight guy) stuck with a minimum wage job. One of our cooks is gay, I am a girl, and another coworker he works with is black. For some reason, he never says this stuff to anyone else, just me. But since he has let on to his true nature, I just turn a blind eye to any verbal bullying and harassment towards him. Is this wrong? Am I the asshole? Is everyone the asshole? I know at least someone is.	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"My wife and I have had a cat for around a year now and very recently moved to a bigger house where we have an attic and basement. I havent explored the attic or basement for anything particularly harmful to the cat as I just close the doors behind me or after I've used either staircase. The cat will sometimes try to go exploring and I don't know if shell get into anything dangerous left from the past tenants. We have agreed just just close the doors.

Our cat also likes to jump onto the toilet and try to touch the water and play with it, whatever it's not a big deal if every time the bathroom is used we just close the toilet seat.

Well, my wife forgets to close the bowl constantly, and the cat will inevitably climb into it and start playing around with the gross water, and then today as I'm in the office and my wife is unpacking some boxes on the other side of the house I decide to look for the cat and realize I cant find her. Turns out shes been walking around the attic for who knows how long and getting into whatever is up there, the floor of the attic is covered in insulation and the homeowners have half assed everything else around the house so who knows whats left over up there.

I am upset because it seems like my wife just doesnt pay attention to the fact that we have another living being in the house now who will just go wherever without realizing what could be dangerous and it could all easily be avoided by just closing the shit you open. 

Well I asked her why she decided to leave the attic door open to let the cat up there and she said ""Are you really mad at me?!"" and left the house.

c7jp1c	2019-06-30 21:16:02		AITA for fussing over a $1 up-charge on a $40 bill?	"Last night, my friend and I met my girlfriend and her friend for dinner at a brewery. I only got to look at the menu for about 90 seconds before the waitress comes by to ask if we want drinks. I said yes I’m ready to order even though I wasn’t ready. I just wanted to get my order in. I order a sampler of 4 beers and after I picked out 1 beer, my GF finds out that she knows the waitress’s sister so they start chatting. And I think “oh perfect, now I can have some more time to look at the menu to figure out the other 3 beers I want.” They chatted for a solid 3 minutes.

The waitress eventually asks what other beers I want. I say, “now that I’ve had some more time to look at the menu...” kind of in a goofy tone to make light of the fact that I was interrupted. And my GF blurts, “stop being such a dick.” Sometimes when I make a joke or tease she’ll say this to me in a lighthearted tone, so i didn’t really think anything of it. I didn’t think I came off as agitated, but just in case I did, I offered to the waitress that I actually needed more time to figure out what I wanted, so I was genuinely glad that they bought me some extra time. 

When the waitress comes back to get our food order, my GF and I start giving our order at the same time. We all laugh, including the waitress. I repeat my order quickly to transition from the slight awkwardness that just happened. My GF seems very annoyed. 

After everyone orders and the waitress leaves, my GF asks me accusatorially, “why’re you being so rude tonight?” I’m baffled because I have absolute no history of being rude or impatient with waitstaff. I ask her, “how was I being rude?” And she replies, “you were talking over me when I tried to order, and you’re being a dick to the waitress.” We drop it for the time.

When we get our bill, I noticed that she rang up my hamburger as a “Cheeseburger with no cheese” and it was $11 instead of $10 like it said on the menu, So when the waitress comes back, I’m sure to be very kind and say, “I could be wrong, but I think on the menu it said that hamburgers are $10 and I was charged $11.” She says she’ll get the manager to change it for me. I thank her and give her my credit card, assuming she’ll change it and use my card to charge me the correct amount. She comes back with the receipt and my card and says, “I’m sorry, I forgot to fix your bill and I already ran the card, do you still want me to go fix it?”  I was hesitant, but my GF says, “it’s fine don’t worry about it, it’s only $1.” And then says to me “I’ll give you a dollar” and laughs it off. At this point, the waitress says, “I’ll give you a dollar too haha” and I know it’s only $1 but now if I ask her to go fix it, Ill feel like a dick. So I say, “I guess it’s fine.” In a tone that suggested that I was definitely not fine with what just happened. I left like a 5% tip. 

I told my GF says I was an asshole for the way I treated the waitress. AITA?"		1	0
c7jo3t	2019-06-30 21:13:52	LonelyBus5	AITA for feeling conflicted about my husband's success at work?	"My husband and I are in the same field career wise (we even met through work at a conference some years ago). Our field is very male-dominated, and relies a lot on networking meaning that as a woman you are always at a bit of a disadvantage, no matter how good you are at your job, which is something I have over the years learned to either get used to or draw strength from my frustration with ""the system"" for some inner motivation to ""prove them wrong"". 

Now I work very closely with my husband however, and while I am very proud of him (and have supported him for years both emotionally and financially), I can't help but feel conflicted when I see how easily things I have worked so hard to achieve just falls into his lap, despite us having a very similar background and level of expertise. 

It is easy being angry at a system, but now that my job has placed me in direct competition in a sense with someone I love and live with, it gets a lot harder. 

Because my husband has very little personal experience with discrimination (straight, white, cis man) - he doesn't always see the little ways that I experience discrimination on a daily basis, and therefore doesn't always stick up for me when it happens, and can sometimes even contribute to the ""boys club"" environment without realizing it (by for example claiming sole credit for common projects, taking opportunities that are in my sphere of competence instead of his etc.). 

When we had a conversation about this he said that he only accepts opportunities and leans into this office culture because he wants us to be well off for our common future, which I understand, and that it is unfair for me to expect him to see every little discriminatory thing that happens when I know he lacks that experience. I know I am in the wrong for directing my frustration at a system onto one person, but at the same time I am saddened by the lack of support and can't help but to feel scared of the fact that his success often comes at the expense of my own.

c7jn9u	2019-06-30 21:12:00	Ashphodella	AITA for being honest with my mother-in-law?	"Last year in August my mother-in-law started dating her current boyfriend. From the very beginning he tried separating the family by conflicts, but no one seemed to notice untill I made them clear what he was doing. He also keeps all focus on him when he's in the room and likes to belittle everyone, especially my sister-in-law and my boyfriend. He's also very condescending towards my boyfriend and his siblings. Mother-in-law didn't notice this and even put this man before her own children. She spoils his little children and doesn't even give her own children (17 to 22) the attention they need. My boyfriend suffers greatly in situation but has never had the guts to do something about it.

In November I told her the man was poisoning the family and she had to be careful not to neglect her children emotionally. I also made clear how he supported her becoming an alcoholic and how he always tried to demonise her children to make him look better in her eyes.

She banished me from her home untill I would apologize, but I won't apologize for something I didn't do wrong in my opinion. Nothing has changed since. I tried to help my boyfriend as he was deeply hurt and his home became unbearable to live. She states to everyone I have attacked her motherhood and twists my words so they seem as if she's the victim of the whole situation.

Above all this I've been helping her for years with the housekeeping and cooking because of her severe scoliosis. I never got any thanks or any other conduct of gratefulness. My boyfriend once had a fight with her and she even called me a burden.

Next Saturday we're going to my boyfriend's grandparents party. This will be the first time I'll be confronted with my mother-in-law since November. I'm preparing myself emotionally which makes me question a little bit if I haven't gone too far."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c7jmvj	2019-06-30 21:11:03	jephimikes	AITA for not defending my daughter against my wife's reaction to her sudden interest in sports?	"For the past 3 years, my younger daughter (an incoming high school senior), has been a part of Academic Decathlon (google it if you're not sure what it entails). It's basically trivia with guided study materials. 

Long story short, she told my wife and I that she was tired of all the studying and wanted to do something else for her activities in senior year.

She wants to do cross country in the fall, water polo in the winter, and swimming in the spring. I wasn't as opposed to it as my wife was, but I questioned how those activities would benefit her. After all, my younger daughter is not that athletic and certainly isn't looking at any careers in sports. 

We forced her to join Academic Decathlon for that reason (it is basically a trivia bowl with more guidance and study materials)--she is more studious than she is athletic, but I guess she's grown tired of it.

My wife, on the other hand, got extremely angry. She said that she'd have to drive our daughter to school at 6:30 AM in the morning for either a practice run/swim practice and that she might die early from her reduced sleep (my wife gets up at 7:30 AM for work).

My daughter said she could walk to school for cross country practice, but my wife got even angrier and said that if our kid were to get hurt on the way (we live in a pretty safe place, but who knows), she'd (my wife would) regret it for the rest of her life and how could my daughter stress her so much.

My wife also brought up the possibility that she'd drown during water polo or swim practice as another reason for why she should not do those activities. Our daughter knows how to swim but is not a competitive swimmer by any means--she lacks stamina and athleticism. 

Moreover, my wife and I reasoned that these activities won't help her for college anymore as she's already a HS senior.

We are not pressuring our kid to do Academic Decathlon again. In fact, I suggested that my kid just go to school, take more AP's, or read some books to prep for college (she wants to study medicine and economics so she could read some college level books in her spare time instead of an activity).

I did not get as angry at my daughter as my wife did, but my kid isn't speaking to either of us right now. AITA for not defending her against my wife? I felt like it was a conflict between them both that needed to be resolved between them."	Asshole	0	0
c7jkco	2019-06-30 21:05:08	17829463518	AITA for not wanting my brother and best friend to hook up?	"I (m19) didn't have many true friends in high school. I live in southern Africa, and went to very small conservative Christian school in a small conservative Christian town, and being a closeted gay guy, didn't find many true friends because I knew that most people would drop me in a heartbeat if they knew the truth.

I met a girl who was really open minded (she's bisexual) and we really hit it off as ~~fiends~~ friends. We've been able to confide in eachother, and she's been my closest friends for years. One of the issues I was able to talk about her with was my twin brother, he's majorly homophobic, doesn't know about me, and we don't really get along too well. 
 
Over time she also became friends with my brother, and now we've all left highschool, and my brother and I live over an hour away from her, so only see eachother every few months. Whenever I get a chance to see her, all three of us always hang out, but in the last few months, my brother and my friend have started hooking up. Nothing official, they're not dating, but it's enough.

Now, every time we see eachother, I can tell that they're both just waiting for me to leave the room so they can make out. One of our pastimes has always been lying in bed and watching movies, but now I dread it because it's basically just 2 hour sessions of them trying to be subtle about getting handsy in the bed next to me. 

She knows  he has a lot of opinions that have directly hurt me in the past, and will do so in the future, and that when he eventually finds out about me, he'll react horribly. 

I spent the whole of highschool being a third wheel to my brother and his girlfriend's, and have always ended up being left out, and now it's happening with pretty much my only good friend. I can't talk to her about my brother with her anymore, and I can't confide in her because I'm afraid of her telling my brother.  I'm aware this comes across as petty stupid teen drama, and I'm not going to say anything to them about it, because I don't want to try and control anyone's love life because that isn't cool.

We have a mutual friend for 2 years now(we're in highschool) and she ghosted us this summer. We are usually super close, but it does frequently feel like it's one sided,she most of the time doesn't care. She is usually reserved and quiet but among us she is super open and honest, or so we think. As soon as school ended she started ignoring us, I told her in February that I want this summer to spend it with her more than I did in the previous one, but in June she would stop responding or even seeing my messages. She knew about the messages, she was online, but she would intentionally ignore them. One day, Simone and I, were super concerned whether she was okay or not, so we tried to contact her or her mother, and the efforts were in vain. We woke up the next day to a vague message of her saying that she wants to do things that she always wanted to. 
This summer we had plans, her birthday is coming up on 25th of July and we don't know what to do. We have thought of sticking up to our plan of going to her flat and sing Happy Birthday and give her presents, but at the same time there is a possibility that she won't open the door, or she won't be home. We can't contact her, she's online sometimes, but she doesn't answer nor sees the messages, she basically ignores us and doesn't even tell us why.

I’m a designer and also have some experience with photography. Her wedding rehearsal dinner is on a Friday and the wedding is on a Saturday. I’m not a part of the party so I was going to arrive early Saturday morning. She already has a photographer set up and paid for to take photos on the day of her wedding. She asked if I could take photos at the rehearsal dinner for her the day before, because she’s seen some of my work before and liked it. I told her why not, and said it could be like a wedding present for her because 1, I don’t consider myself a hot shot photographer, and 2, I don’t know what to charge when it comes to that. Even if I did, I wouldn’t charge her up the ass because she’s family.

She knows I design, so I told her I could design things for her wedding, but that I would be charging her. The photos I could do for free and as a gift. She wanted invitations, dinner menus, and name place cards. I said I could do all of that for $100 for my time to design, and that she’ll still have printing costs to pay for the other things. I told her I had some connections in person and online where she could get discounts and not have to pay a fortune. She agreed and said that was fine. 

I just found out today by my mom that she already got the invitations done and I had no idea. She sent pictures of them asking her opinion. I explained to my mom that I told her I could do that as well as the other things she wanted and now I’m pissed. She didn’t even tell me. My sister is also cheap and wanted to go through a printing website where they did it all, and didn’t charge much.  I suggested her not to as online is limited in regards to how it looks with templates and what you can do to set it up. If she let me design them she could have it look anyway she wanted and have no limitations and I’d make sure they looked perfect and came out perfect once finished. My mom told my sister  “I thought hayleymikaelson was doing the invitations for you?” and my sister told my mom that I was charging her which my mom responded with “why is the place that’s doing them giving them to you for free?”

I feel like my sister doesn’t deserve me taking photos for her after telling me I could design those things and agreeing on the price and then going behind my back. I also don’t live in California so I would have to come out the day of the dinner to take the photos (I don’t get PTO at work currently, so I would be losing a days worth of pay.) She could find someone else to do it, but they’ll be charging her for it because that’s the normal thing to do. WIBTA?"		1	0

My father in law then walked into our living room, and looked around for our remote and turned the TV volume way down. Our younger son was in the LR watching Mickey and eating his lunch before nap time. 

FIL does not have hearing issues, and our kitchen is a fair distance from the TV, which wasn't hardly loud at all to begin with. 

It was the oddest thing to do in someone else's home, without saying a single thing. So I said ""Can you not turn the TV down? *son* is watching it.""

He blew up. How dare I talk to him like that, I should respect my elders, he's just ""turning it down so *son* doesn't get hearing damage""

I just said ""It's my home and I'll have my own TV set to a volume I see fit""

They left, and now I'm the big bad mean wife/mom for saying something.

TL;DR:. FIL turned the TV volume down in my house without reason or even asking me, and I asked him not to.

So my ex and I were together for 4 years. We are both performers. Almost every time he was in a show, he developed crushes on the girls who had leading roles with him. It happened about 4-5 times that we were together.

So he developed a really close relationship with this girl during a show. They would hang out one on one all the time. I never had a good feeling about her so I felt weird about it whenever they would hang out. He would almost never invite me to hang out with them. When we hung out in group settings (with our circle of friends), things just would always seem kinda tense. 

Flash forward a couple months and I just get this feeling to look at his text thread with this girl. Unless he deleted a bunch of messages, there was no overt cheating. They would constantly talk about really deep subjects with each other, and one time he even offered her a back massage. Without asking me or telling me about it!!!! I told him about it and he was mad that I invaded his privacy. The problem was never resolved.

I did this a couple more times. I’d say in the 4 years of our relationship I secretly looked through his phone and iPad about 20 times. He was always very secretive about his phone and never wanted me to see it - he claimed it was like a “diary” to him and he didn’t want me to see all of his stuff, which set off a thousand red flags in my head.

Another time I looked through his phone I saw that he had confided in ANOTHER female friend that he had a crush on another girl and didn’t know what to do about it. Instead of telling me! So I confronted him about it, and he said it wasn’t enough of a crush or a problem to involve me. He saw no reason to tell me if he knew it was “innocent.” And then he went back to yelling at me for invading his privacy.

I admit, my insecurities got ahold of me. And there were times when I found nothing incriminating. But there were times that he had said some pretty serious stuff to other girls behind my back. So I don’t know who the asshole is here.

So, am I the asshole?

TL;DR: I looked through my ex’s phone multiple times when his actions made me feel insecure. He saw this as an invasion of privacy, but I feel that my actions were justified by his sketchy behavior. I never saw him sexually cheating, but he displayed some emotional cheating behaviors."	Asshole	1	0

If she found out I was paying, she would want to pay me back and feel bad, and she also can’t afford to pay me back even if she wanted to. I know it would make her uneasy about how she wouldn’t be able to pay me back and add stress to the trip. Now everything is all booked and set in place to leave in a few weeks, but my gf wants to get my mom a thank you gift for the whole trip which would be reasonable if my mom  was paying for the whole thing.

c7jfwy	2019-06-30 20:54:29	advice_a	AITA for not wanting to participate in my niece’s wedding after she excluded my daughter?	"Mine and my sister’s families are very close. Our kids are more like siblings than cousins. My eldest niece got engaged, and we were all thrilled for her. My daughter and I spent hours on the phone with her helping her with early wedding planning. My niece even mentioned to my daughter that she was having a hard time finding enough bridesmaids because many of her friends are pregnant.

Then we all stared finding out who my niece had chosen to be in the wedding party. Everyone in the family was included except for my daughter. My niece asked me and her two sisters to be bridesmaids, asked my son to be a groomsman, included her parents of course, and even asked my ex (who has been estranged from my side of the family since the divorce) to be the usher. She made a wedding website with photos/descriptions of all of the people in the wedding party. My daughter is the only one not on there. 

My niece didn’t directly tell my daughter that she wasn’t included. Instead she created a text group with all of the women in our families except for my daughter to plan hair/makeup/etc for the day of. My daughter was with me and my other nieces when we got the text and didn’t have her phone on her, so she assumed she was included as well. Turns out she wasn’t. When I reached out to my niece for clarification, she stated that my daughter was not going to be included. When I asked her if my daughter could at least get ready alongside us in the bridal suite (doing her own hair and makeup), my niece said no. Her exact words were “there won’t be any room for her.”

My daughter is understandably crushed and has no idea why she would be the only one not included. When she and my niece finally spoke about it, my niece wouldn’t explain why she had done this or apologize. Her only words were “It was my decision to make. I’m sorry that you feel upset about it. I hope you can get over it.”

I never saw my niece as a mean person but I am questioning my view of her now. I don’t want to participate in a wedding where my daughter has been singled out/excluded for no real reason. I can’t think of anything my daughter could have done to offend my niece. It seems that my niece can’t come up with a single reason for excluding her either.

When my niece asked me to be a bridesmaid, I didn’t know that she was planning on asking everyone else in the family except for my daughter. I wouldn’t have accepted if I had known this.  Am I the asshole if I tell my niece that I won’t be able to fulfill my commitment as a bridesmaid and just attend as a guest? 

I’ve already posed this with my daughter and she thinks that me and her brother should both still participate because she doesn’t want to be blamed for our dropping out. If I do decide not to participate, I will be making it clear to my niece that it was 100% my decision to drop out because I feel personally disrespected that she would treat my daughter this way. I’m torn on how to handle this.

&#x200B;

My family makes me crazy, so I gotta ask because I'm really confused about how I fucked up here. I'll try to be quick.

&#x200B;

Me and my mom have a terrible history, we were both horrific to each other my entire childhood (although I think she should've tried harder as the adult, but whatever), and she kicked me out when I was 17, but lately we've been getting on okay. We go out to dinner at least once a week and hang out, and chat on the phone daily. The other night we were planning on going out to get Thai and watch some movies (my treat), and I called her out to the car my roommate drove me in to say hi to my cat we had picked up from the vet on the way.

We go inside, and she makes a comment about one of my roommates, along the lines of ""I though he was a boy?"" ... he is a boy. I tell her he is, and she asks if he's transgender, which I tell her he is. She says ""So biologically a girl. You lied to me? She just made me feel like an idiot."" I  am genuinely floored, because my mom is a social worker who writes legislation specifically for LGBT kids, and both of her children are gay. I try to be jokey and move on because she's skeeved me out, and say something like ""He doesn't even look like a girl,"" to which she responds ""She looks exactly like a girl.""

My mom always kind of talks about people's 'things' before she talks about them as individuals. Introduced me to her coworkers and friends as a kid with ""This person is \[gay, disabled, a former drug user, an abuse survivor, yadda yadda\]"" and it always made me uncomfortable. The fact that she would define somebody by their 'things' and not their personality or the things they do, especially the idea that she might treat me like that behind her back, coupled with the fact that this time it was blatantly transphobic- and that as I was walking out the door since I told her I was so upset she'd talk about him like that that I left early she sarcastically shouted ""Thanks for getting me dinner!""- I just haven't put in the energy to talk to her again. 

I don't think I will, and if she tries to contact me again without starting with an apology, I'll just ask for one and wait for it to come. I had her on insta and facebook, but she kept posting about how much she ""loves her kids"" and then would just tag my brother and BIL, so I just took her off of there because it hurt my feelings.

&#x200B;

Should I talk to her face-to-face and explain the problem to fix our relationship? She keeps talking shit to my brother and BIL when they visit her (they go over almost daily), and I feel bad about how lonely she is since she doesn't really have friends other than us three. She's hurt me so many times and I kind of just don't care that much, but her treating one of my close friends that way just made me so angry. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7jczi	2019-06-30 20:47:28		AITA for cutting my friend off at the same time that her boyfriend is leaving her?	"My best friend Jen started dating this guy last summer and in a few weeks he is leaving to go to Europe to explore for a year. 

Jen and I have been great friends for years and we talked every day. We recently got into an argument where both of us were at fault. While I apologized to her on my part, she said “this is just how I am, it is what it is.” It’s very unlike her but since dating her bf she’s stopped making effort w other people. Even his friends have issues with her and she doesn’t care bc she’s very wrapped up in her relationship.

I’m fed up, I put the issue past us and tried to go back to normal to no avail. This fight also happened while my grandma was sent to the hospital and I was taking final exams, (she knew all this) and it only added to my stress. I thought after being friends for years she wouldn’t throw it all away. This argument also felt like a reason for her to ignore me to spend every day with her boyfriend before he leaves (which would’ve been fine anyway).

My friends who know about this are saying I’d be a little bit of TA because relationships can make people delusional and when he’s gone, she’ll realize she’s lost her best friend and doesn’t really have anyone else this close to her.

Recently she had some tiff with her roommate and decided to move out and has been selling stuff online. After trying to sell a two year old couch for a week, she slashed the price to $40 and had a buyer. After communicating with him and making plans for him to pick it up, she decided to up the price, saying that she’s “still learning” how to sell shit online and she should “advocate for herself” and ask for more. She asked my opinion so I was honest and said that it would have pissed me off. I also asked her how she would feel if that happened to her. After trying to defend her actions I said “I know it’s hard for you to admit you’re wrong, but in this case I think you should.” She continued making excuses and the conversation abruptly ended. 

There have been big things that have happened in her life and she’s always blamed other people - a bad breakup, issues with her school, “friend” breakups, job issues, etc. She’s never admitted fault in any of these life events but I think she should think about where she may have been accountable.

c7j7iu	2019-06-30 20:34:18		AITA for dropping off my wife's kitten in another neighborhood.	"Alright, here it goes. 

My wife and I both agreed, no more cats! We had 2, and one of them died, and it was really sad, but also we agreed to not replace it. We have a dog and he is basically our kid. He means the world to us. 

Our other cat sorta just chills outside. He's chill. We don't mind him, and we feed him and let him inside every once in a while.

So anyways, there is literally so many cats in our neighborhood. We live in a farm town, and nobody foxes their cats. They don't really even take care of them. You can find a stray kitten on the road any day of the week if you really looked. Our town needs an animal shelter but farmers and rednecks sorta just don't care enough about animals in regarding them as ""pets"". I think it's more of a ""animals are for money"" attitude passed down over the generations.

And of course, my wife finds a little baby kitten on our street. I told her ""dude, it's cute and all, but we cant keep it"". But, ofcourse she is a sucker for kittens, (who isn't) and she brings it into the house. 

Now we have a little kitten, who isn't potty trained, and literally just meows nonstop. I am not over exaggerating. NON STOP.  

And I have no desire to raise this cat. I know for a fact that once he's out of the kitten phase, my wife will just throw him outside and feed him once a day if she remembers. It literally happened like less than 2 months ago. And then that cat disappeared, I think it died. It was always getting in fights with other cats in da hood.

Also, my wife posted this cat on Facebook. Nobody in the town wanted it. No one wants another cat honestly. There are so many of them in our little town. Like, if you drive around at 3am, you'll just see packs of them on every corner. 

So last night, after we have had this kitten for only a couple days, my wife decided to stay out late with her sisters. 

It's 1 am. I have to be up for work (for a 15 hour shift) at 4:30 am. I NEED SLEEP. and all I can hear is MEW! MEW!MEW! MEW!MEW!MEW......MEW!...MEW!... MEW MEW MEW MEW MEW MEW. 

So I grabbed the kitten, gently ofcourse. There was no anger Involved in this decision at all. I just really needed this cat gone. I put him in my lap, drove a couple blocks away, and dropped him off in a friendly neighborhood. I wished him the best of luck, and I didn't look back. 

My wife hates me. She thinks I'm a monster. But honestly like... We agreed on more cats... WTF. I feel like she couldn't look past the fact that it wouldn't be a ""cute little kitten"" forever and she would just get bored with it and lose interest. She has done it before, and it's not right. It's a super childish and selfish thing to do with an animal.

"My dad used to work in a facility that provided housing, schooling, and mental/physical treatment for disabled people. I used to spend a lot of time in that facility as a kid, but I don't have a lot of memories from there. 

Yesterday I was sent a friend request on FB by an American girl. Turns out she's a former patient my dad drove around back in the day. I didn't think much of it, so I allowed the initial convo to end. Not much later, dad msged me:

""A girl from the facility will add you on fb today. She wants to learn Hungarian. Texting is difficult for her as her hands don't work properly. Says she remembers you""

At that point, I was visiting distant relatives, so the girl slipped my mind. I just got back home today. I should add that currently I'm very busy myself. I'm awaiting response from the colleges I applied to, starting a new job soon, and I'm scheduled to move house as well. Add that on top of having to upkeep my relationship with relatives, and having to put up with the bullshit of my narc mom, sis, and Edad, WHILE trying to be a supportive girlfriend for my fiancé who is going through a tough time. My plate is full. 

She called me today while I was omw home. Tbh, I have no clue what she was saying. Partly due to her accent, and partly because I was walking on a windy bridge. I politely told her I would call her back later, which she seemed okay with.

I get home and start unpacking when she messages me, saying hi. I knew she would want a full conversation, so I excused myself and said I just got home from a trip, and asked if we could chat later. She tries to call me. I rejected the call and explained that I'm busy right now and can't talk, but promised to get back to her as soon as I could.

She starts begging me to become a part of the support system. In a panic I reassured her that I would, I just need some time to settle down first. I even set a timer for myself, so I could call her back ASAP. 

I kept my promise, called her back and she begged me again to become a part of her support system. I said yes, out of guilt.

I think she has cerebral palsy or sth similar. But I know for sure is that I'm not ready to teach Hungarian to a person who I can barely understand, and who probably has problems understanding what I'm telling them, too. I  don't have the patience or skillset to deal with someone like this. 

This whole thing feels like someone decided that they could shrug the responsibility of chatting with this girl onto me for brownie points. If I tried to protest, they would tell me I should do it out of kindness, since I don't have much else to fill up my time anyway.

c7j27t	2019-06-30 20:21:04	WildPipe	AITA for telling my mom not to give out my social?	"I'm 22. 


My grandma randomly stopped all contact with my dad when he was in his early twenties. She had bipolar issues. 

I grew up without knowing this grandma and never met her. I know little to nothing about her, and she is just a name to me. 

My grandma recently reached out to my mother by adding her on facebook. My grandma contacted my mother since my dad left my family when I was 14, and I haven't seen him since. Seems to run in the family, huh? 

My grandma called my mother and wanted my personal information. She supposedly wanted to put me in her will. That's fine. However, my mother gave her my information, including my social security, without contacting me. 

When my mother was telling me about  talking with my grandma, discussing the will, and giving out my social, I told her I would have preferred her to call or text me about the situation before she gave it out. She said that that's why she was telling me now.


Again, I told her to tell me about these things before she gives out my social. She started throwing a fit. She asked if I would have preferred to not get put on the will at all, because my grandma would have never called me to ask for the information.

I told her yes. If my own grandma couldn't call me to ask about that information, then I don't want to be a part of her will. And plus, I've never even had contact with her in the first place, and she's my grandma! She really couldn't woman up and call me for the first time in my life? ok. 

At the very least, I told my mom that she could have contacted me before she gave her my personal information. She started throwing a fit, saying ""what's a 70 year old going to do with your social security?""

Again, at this point, my grandma is a random person to me, that's had severe mental issues in the past. In general, I don't want my mother giving out my ss without me knowing, even if the person is family and is mentally stable. It's my fucking personal information. 

My mother continued her fit. She acted insulted and as if I was a disgusting person. She then stormed off. 

My mother and I have issues all the time. I can't stand her, and this is just one more thing that we have to fight about. I wasn't even making it a big deal. I just asked her to contact me about these things before she does it, and then she went off the rails. I don't trust her to begin with, and this fight just seems to add more.

She has a twin and two younger siblings who were, at the time, 3 and 2 respectively. Her father moved halfway across the country, never called or visited, didn't pay child support, and largely just abandoned them. He remarried and started a new family about a year after he left. This set of events left a deep scar on my wife who still deals with abandonment issues to this day. My wife and her twin have no relationship with him to this day and the two younger siblings have recently been working on a relationship with him.

&#x200B;

About a week ago her sister, my sister-in-law, posted a meme on facebook about how deadbeat Dad's should win an award for long distance running. She is known for her savage memes and sense of humor. I thought it was pretty funny and ironic so I posted a comment to the effect of ""Did you tag your Dad in this?"". While most people thought it was hilarious, my sister-in-law did not.  She blasted it for not being funny and not applying to him. I then pointed out how he left for 20 years, never saw his kids and never paid support. I told her that he's literally the definition of the meme and that if she was sensitive about that type of material she shouldn't post such savage memes. 



Things continued to degrade from there at which point I stopped replying. She continued calling me offensive words and doing everything possible to create a shit storm. I decided to block her until things cooled off, but that didn't stop the war as she tagged my wife and her mother in an effort to drag them into the drama. She also decided to start dumping family secrets out on facebook in an attempt to burn everything down. After the FB drama she took to calling family members directly in an attempt to get them on her side. Arguing that he is a stand up guy and I should not have said mean things about him.

&#x200B;

   Additionally SIL said I had no business talking about the man in any context because I am not blood related to them. I feel it is hypocritical because her husband talks about her father all the time. Once you are married you are part of the family, and people are entitled to their opinion of the man. You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house.

&#x200B;

My SIL and I are not talking and the incident has made a rift in the family. My wife and most of the family are completely ok with what I said as its 100% true and I am entitled to my own feelings about the man. The two younger siblings who have a relationship with him are all upset about it.

If anyone has ever downloaded Grindr, I’m sure you’ve come across the guys that message you every 3 seconds until you answer. 

I have found a way that personally works for me to weed out these types of guys, because there is something about the constant messaging that says to me something is not right with them. Maybe they don’t know otherwise, maybe they are indeed crazy. 

Anyways, I’ve found if I am talking to a guy and I have some inkling of an interest, after a few days of chatting, I’ll stop replying for maybe a 12 to 24 hour period. In my mind and when this happens to me, I assume they are busy or they have lost interest. Cool, I keep my cool or I move on. But when I do this to some guys, it’s like I have personally attacked them and they begin the tirade of messages to get me to reply. If a guy messages me back 1-2 times (as in maybe I forgot to reply), that’s cool and appropriate and I will gladly resume the conversation after the “probation period”. 

I was talking to some friends about this tactic and they said I’m an asshole for doing this to guys, because ghosting people is a shitty thing to do.

So for a bit of backstory, my older sister [17F] has been tormenting me [15F] for years be it physical or emotional. She calls me slurs that I dare not repeat on a daily basis and multiple times she’s given me scars and bruises that were hard to explain.

Once my sister even threatened that when she’s older she’s “going to get a gun and shoot me, my future kids, and future S.O. until we’re all dead.” 
Now it’s hard to get a gun here in Canada, but I’m still worried about it.

She’s also tried to run me over with a golf cart, brought a knife down my back, threatened both me and my older brother [19M] with a broom (and put a hole in his door), broke many of my belongings out of rage, and has ripped up my skin leaving a pretty big scar. 

I’ve said on many occasions that when I move out I’m cutting contact with her because I don’t want her to know where I live in fear, and my family thinks I’m being asshole-ish because of cutting her off. My entire family knows about the history I have with her but refuse to see it as something violent and endangering me (even though she’s done many things to try and kill me) and think it’s just normal sibling rivalry. All my friends support me in my decision to cut her off as they know how much it’s affected my mental health. But I still feel like I should get some closure on this. 

So, would I be the asshole for cutting her off when I move out?

c7iura	2019-06-30 20:02:48	fredinNH	WIBTA if I want to go somewhere different for vacation?	"TLDR: wife insists that we spend our summer vacation money renting a place at the same beach every year. It’s the beach she grew up going to. I want to do something different.

My wife’s family has been renting a place at a particular beach since the 1970s, not always the same house, but always the same beach. In fairness, it is an absolutely magnificent beach. 

About 10 years ago we started renting a place at this beach as well. Renting our own place here was a dream of my wife’s that we couldn’t afford when we were young and is still a stretch financially because this beach has become way more expensive than it was in the past, even taking inflation into consideration. Pretty much every cottage from her childhood has been torn down, and replaced with a big fancy beach house. 

Because of my wife’s insistence that we rent a beach place here every year, we don’t have the money for another big summer vacation. 

A few years ago I put my foot down and insisted that we take our child on a trip to Europe, and it was great, but we are right back to going every year to the same beach house. 

For people who don’t know, beach houses are often rented by the same people on the same weeks every year and if you skip a year you may well not be able to rent that place again because you “gave up your spot”. This is what my wife is afraid of. And the place we’ve been renting is pretty much the only place on this beach that’s In our budget. 

So, wibta if I insist that we do something different next year and risk not being able to rent a place at this beach in the future? We are at the beach house right now and I’m feeling mad about it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

When she came to the dinner ( I was already there), she looked like a smokeshow which aggregated my frustrations.

I introduced her to my entourage as baby momma as a passive aggressive way to put her on notice for the lack of sexual intimacy. 

She had indicated in the few days preceding the event that she is no longer interested in sex, she's 33 and an ex-model, still a 10.

The people around me took it as a joke, she was the only one who was in on the jab.

c7iu32	2019-06-30 20:01:17	boop17313	AITA for ending this friendship?	"Throwaway account (of course).  


I've been suffering from depression for years now. I've had one particular close friend, we'll call her Danielle, for longer. Danielle is one of the few people who know I have depression, and she's known for months. Lately (past few years), it has felt like she hasn't been particularly caring or considerate for my feelings. I finally decided yesterday evening to text her a short paragraph expressing how I feel. My exact text:  


*Hey Danielle, as your friend, I just wanted to express myself and my thoughts to you. I honestly don't really feel considered, thought of, or included by you and it's been bothering me for a long time now. You don't really check on me, even though you've known I've been struggling, we don't spend much time together, and you mostly ignore me in person. We have had our good times and I do assume that you care about me, but I just wish that you'd communicate more and act like we're friends. I just want to have a healthy friendship, and part of that (to me) is honesty and communication.*  


The ensuing conversation, which lasted several hours, consisted mostly of her attempts to make it seem like I'm being ridiculous. She claimed that I was trying to control her in order to make her text me more and be the only person in her life (what?) in some sort of twisted and unreasonable attempt at stabilising my insecurity and that she's not the type of person to text much and I need to stop expecting so much from people (I never mentioned texting, i asked that she'd communicate more, and I'm not sure where the rest of her assumptions came from.)  


I feel like I reserve the right to hold certain expectations from friendships and assert such expectations. I feel like she gaslit me quite a bit, and strawmanned my request. In the end, I ended the friendship. Was I being unreasonable?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c7isdi	2019-06-30 19:57:09		AITA for still being angry about this?	"Me and my now girlfriend went through some conflict early on/before our relationship that still effects me now 3 months later AITA?   

My girlfriend and I met senior year of high school and talked on and off for that year and the summer following until she got a boyfriend. I went off to college but while dating her boyfriend she would often reach out to me for someone to talk to because he was mentally and sometimes mildly physically abusive to her. I’d spend hours upon hours talking to her, comforting her, and telling her how being with him was not good for her mental health etc. she turned to me for everything and told me many times if she were to breakup with him she would want to come to me, she feared being alone and I told her I would gladly date her.    
Months pass she ends up breaking up with her boyfriend and tells me right away. I take this as my queue to try and be with her as that was what she told me she wanted and I wanted it as well. A month and a half passes of me and her texting/FaceTiming all the time, and meeting up every once in a while as I was at college.   
We planned a weekend we would spend together as our birthdays are one day apart and happened to fall on Friday and Saturday, so we wanted to go out and have fun together, just us, because we knew we were good for each other and things were getting serious between us. She exclaimed how happy she was to finally be able to not hide that she loved me and wanted to be with me. Of course at the time, I wasn’t messing around with or texting other girls in order to make sure she knew that she is the one I am focused on, she was my focus. She would tell me countless times to “keep the girls away”.
Now roughly a week before our planned weekend she’s acting strange so I ask what is going on. She says some guy texted her to “hangout” and that she is going to “hangout” with him on our birthday weekend. I ask who, she tells me, and it’s one of my old friends who’s a total douche and I warn her of that. She denies my warning and starts going off on me saying “I can do whatever the fuck I want I’m single”. So all of this goes down, I hangout with her on her birthday and she “hangsout” with him on mine, coming to my birthday get together after her “visit”.   
Later on we talk more and more apparently he was an ass to her after (big surprise) and we start dating, things were good when we weren’t talking about what happened, but when brought up she says she was just trying to feel “wanted” and that tipped me off because all I had ever done for her was make her feel wanted. She later changed her reason to wanting to feel “reckless” and that she “had to do something” when she was single “you can’t just jump right back into a relationship”.   Now, it’s been 3 months and still comes up every once in awhile and is really the only thing we argue about, I can’t help but think how different things would be if that never happened but AITA for still being mad at this?"		1	0
c7is1q	2019-06-30 19:56:20	alyra	AITA for not correcting my waiter on my bill?	"Hey assholes.  

There's a decently nice brunch place near me that I like to go to sometimes on the weekends, usually just by myself, and I'll sit up at the bar and read a book while sipping coffee and eating delicious food.  It's pleasant, and I do this maybe once every week or two.  So I've gotten to recognize some of the waitstaff, and they recognize me, and I'll usually smile and chat to them a little if they come by my area and don't seem super rushed with things.  No long conversations or anything, just friendly polite ""Beautiful weather, isn't it?  Have any fun plans for the weekend/your next day off?"" type stuff.  I mostly just keep my nose in my book, but I do make an effort to be genuine during these interactions.  

So one day I'm doing my usual thing, and my waiter is the same one that I've had the last few times.  (He might be new-ish, as I hadn't seen him around before, but he might have just been on other shifts or something too.)  We're developing a bit of a friendly rapport, but it's not like we're actual friends or anything.  I don't even know his name.  So the bill comes, and as I hand him my card, I realize that he didn't actually charge me for my drinks.  (I got both coffee and an orange juice, and neither were on my bill, but I'd also ordered plenty of food.)

Now, usually I'm too honest for my own good, and I'd just point out the mistake, pay the full price, and be done with it.  But I've also recently been told that not charging for a drink is the sort of thing waitstaff might occasionally do for their regulars on purpose, as like a ""hey, thanks for being cool"" thing.  And then in that scenario, it doesn't do anyone any good for me to be extra-honest.  Probably when this has happened to me in the past, I've been too clueless to realize what was going on.  I've never worked that kind of job, so on top of my general awkwardness, I don't have much intuition for how these dynamics go.  

So I'm presented with the card machine, and it's quick decision time.  I decided not to bring up the drinks I'd ordered, and I give the waiter a 25% tip instead.  (For context, I'm in Canada, and tipping ~15% or more is expected.)

But then thinking about it later, it occurred to me that if the waiter was going to intentionally knock something off my bill as a nice gesture, surely it would have been only *one* of my two drinks rather than both at once.  So now I'm thinking I must have misread the situation at the time, and it was just an actual mistake that I wasn't charged.  And, like, I know it's not like they're going to deduct the price of my drinks from his payroll or anything, but I hate the idea of them going to check the books at the end of the day and realizing that there's a coffee and an orange juice still waiting to be paid for, and concluding that my waiter is shit at his job for not staying on top of that.  Especially if he actually is newer to this job.

c7iri3	2019-06-30 19:55:02	MaKo1982	WIBTA for ghosting a girl in Instagram DMs because I think she has a crush on me?	"So, to explain, I am a chess player, m17 and live in Germany. I am always happy to network and make new friends in the chess community so I accept and follow back every chess player on social media, even if I don't know them.

So, recently a 14 yo girl from Greece (let's call her Mary) followed me on Instagram and I followed back, not thinking much of it. However, at one point she DMed me in a friendly manner, and not wanting to seem rude, I replied back and we talked a little. However, it really escalated later, she would text me several times on the same day and it started to be really uncomfortable to me, since she was using my name very often (like messaging me u/Makoooooooo or sth).

 She then, another day, proceeded to talk about past relationships and ended this conversation with ""Now I told the boy im single"" and even told me her family might move to Germany.

So, I started to feel more and more uncomfortable and awkward and when not replying to her she'd ask ""Where are you"" or ""Have I done something wrong?""

The thing is that I feel like she's trying to flirt with me but I am not interested at all (I mean she lives in Greece and is 14, sooo yeah) and I do not enjoy talking to her anymore. But on the other side, she hasn't said anything NSFW or obscene, so maybe I'm overreacting?

It’s gotten to the point where he just sleeps on the couch because he’s so loud and it affects my ability to sleep. Well he finally had a surgery to fix his deviated septum and while he still snores, it’s much much better. Today we had a fight about a few things and the topic of not sleeping in the same bed came up. I encouraged him to come to bed now that his snoring is better. (And to be clear he’s never not been welcome in the bed- even before the surgery- he just doesn’t bother anymore because he knows how loud he is and knows I end up moving to the couch pretty quickly after he comes to bed because it’s impossible to sleep). He asked me if I can promise I won’t leave in the middle of the night and go to the couch now that his snoring is a little better. I said I can’t promise that because it’s only been a week since his surgery and I’m a light sleeper, I don’t know how much it’ll bother me but I’ll try. He got mad at me and is now refusing to talk to me. He’s saying he had the surgery for me and that he’s been sleeping on a couch for years for me and the least I can do is just stay in bed with him. I said that’s not fair and he’s being selfish. Sleep is important and while it’s not ideal for either of us to end up on the couch, I do want to try but I can’t promise I won’t ever be bothered enough to move to the couch.

c7iq5m	2019-06-30 19:51:47	ThrowAway74595	AITA for telling my roommate I don't want her bringing her kid over anymore?	"A little bit of background first: Approximately two years ago a friend of mine (Cindy) bought an apartment and was looking for a roommate so I decided to move in with her. About 10 months in, Cindy meets someone and goes living with him. I'm left alone in the apartment with no talk about a possible new roommate.

Fast forward a few months and Cindy tells me her big sister (Vanessa) will temporarily live with me because she just broke up with her SO and has nowhere to go. She has a 6 yo son but Cindy told her to never bring him to the apartment.Now it doesn't take long before Vanessa brings her kid over for full weekends every two weeks or so (they usually stay indoors the whole weekend too). I'd have no problem if the kid was calm but he's really disruptive and his mother has very little authority over him. 

&#x200B;

Now for the main event: This went on for almost a year and I was too scared to say anything because it's a delicate situation and I thought Cindy was okay with the kid coming over. Until one day I had enough. Vanessa was about to leave the apartment and says ""I'm going to get my child"" and leaves. I wasn't even aware that he was going to come before that interaction and I had nowhere else to go.

The following Monday I call Cindy and explain the situation. She tells me she wasn't aware that the kid was coming over that often and that I never should have waited that long before telling her. And that the least Vansessa could do, is warn me when her son I going to stay at our place. She said she'd talk it out with her sister.An hour later I get a message from Cindy telling me her sister didn't take it well and told me to brace myself for impact. Vanessa comes home from work and I immediately get an earful. I could barely say anything. She'd immediately shoot me down saying I needed to stop being selfish.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole here? Here's what she said and my opinion on it: 

1. ""I come packaged with my son and you need to accept that fact and adapt to the situation"". I'm not her SO, her family or even her friend. I don't need to accept anything at all. It's a sad situation. I feel bad for the kid but it's not my problem. She's had enough time to look for an other apartment.
2. ""You're being selfish"". She admits she's selfish herself by saying she is tired of having to adapt to everyone and everything. Basically saying she doesn't care about what I think.
3. ""It's normal that my kid makes a little bit of noise and I do everything to keep him out of your way."" It's not a ""little bit of noise"". He regularly yells, runs around, slams stuff. She even let's him run around unattended.
4. I pay rent every month and it was never the plan that I'd have to live with a child.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Roommate brings her 6 yo kid over even though the rules have been clear since the beginning and overreacts

when I say I don't want him coming over anymore. She says I'm being selfish and she clearly let me know she won't

So I have a pretty good friend group that consists of me and three other girls who I'll call Maddi, Rachel, and Sarah. The group also has a guy in it who I will call Liam in this story.

So basically, Maddi and Rachel were talking over Instagram, and Rachel told Maddi (over DM) that she believes Sarah has a crush on her, just because of the way she acts around her. Rachel then tells Maddi to not tell anyone, but about 5 minutes later, Maddi tells Sarah that Rachel thinks Sarah likes her.

Sarah then tells Rachel about what happened, which makes Rachel mad at Maddi. Rachel then messages me (this is how I found out) about what happens, and I just sort of go 'ok', not really wanting to say anything to further anger Rachel.

About an hour later, Maddi FaceTimes me, and she is straight up bawling. I ask what happened, and Maddi tells me that Rachel and Liam confronted Maddi in a new chatroom and told her that they no longer trust her, and no one is talking to her anymore.

I honestly understand why Rachel did it, and I believe that she is right to not trust Maddi. But she confronted Maddi EXTREMELY and uneededly aggressively. However, I just try and calm Maddi down, as she is freaking out and I don't want to upset her more by explaining to her that Rachel was right to be mad at her.

But then Maddi starts painting herself as the victim, saying she did nothing wrong and that Liam has no right to be a part of this as he wasn't involved. But she kinda counteracts herself as she didn't know Rachel spoke to me beforehand and she messaged me, making me at the time not involved either.

I am a freelancer in a niche portion of the marketing industry and have primarily been working as a remote contractor for a consultancy for just over a year now.                                   



I have a decent relationship with my boss at the consultancy but am currently in need of new clients. There was a particular client that we were almost going to work with last year in November, but the prospective client decided because they determined that they didn’t have the money needed at the time.                                  



It’s been over 6 months at this point and I am still interested in the client that got away and I see a need I can fill in their company. I would like to work with them for free for a short period in hope of turning it into a paying relationship.                                  



Would I be an asshole if I emailed this company and pitched myself/my services to them without letting my boss at the consultancy know? Would it be like I’m stealing a client from the consultancy? Since the niche I work in is very small, I feel like there is a decent chance that my boss would find out.                                   



Alternatively, I have considered asking my boss if they know of any companies looking for freelancers. She has informed me of opportunities in the past so I think they might be open to sharing companies with me and if she does, then I can bring up the company I want to work for now…                                   



I don’t know the best way to approach this… or maybe I should just let it go?

c7ikeh	2019-06-30 19:37:52		AITA for not helping my mom unless she asks me for help?	"I'm 21F and live with my parents. Long story short, my mom has recently decided that she wants to ""purge"" our house. Shes been going through the house room by room and throwing out/giving away everything we havent touched in a year. She recently started on the basement, where we have a lot of old furniture, rugs, and a bunch of other stuff that shes been putting down there over the years whenever we didnt need it. 

My mom is very much a person who doesnt like asking for help. She wants help, but she likes it when people beg to be ""allowed"" to help her. I used to ask if she wanted help, which was usually met with a ""no I can do it myself"", only to get yelled at later for not helping (according to her even if people flat out say they dont want help, they still do and I should insist on helping her). Eventually I would just start helping without even asking, which was met with an argument half the time. Whenever I didnt help she would always get mad at me for not helping even though she told me she didnt want help. 

So for a while now I've decided that I wont help her unless she asks for it. If she wants help, she can stop acting like a child and ask me. This has extended to her cleaning out the house. She obviously doesnt want to be lugging stuff up and down the stairs all day by herself, so shes started asking me for help sometimes, but always dropping the ""you know you should be helping me"" line when she does. 

Well today she was trying to move some furniture in the basement (which I didnt even know she was doing) when all of a sudden she comes running upstairs screaming at me about how I'm such a ""disappointment"" to her, since I was letting her do all the work herself. I told her I wasnt helping because she didnt ask me for help, to which she responded that she shouldn't have to ask me for help, that I should just know to drop what I'm doing and help her automatically. 

I ended up helping her move stuff (because she asked) but shes still pissed at me for not running down to help today, and not helping unless asked in general. 

AITA? 

**TLDR**: my mom hates asking for help, wants people to essentially beg to help her. After getting sick of this I've decided that I'll only help her if she asks. I'm not going to play this game of begging her to let me help her do something anymore. Shes been cleaning out our house recently, and whenever she eventually does ask me for help, she always gets kinda passive aggressive about it when she does.

I would obviously usually say that my fiancee takes precedence, but my best friend is moving away about 1000 miles away on Friday and they are completely unavailable to hang out any other day except tomorrow. 

I've offered to treat today or literally any other day as her birthday. We are still going out to dinner tomorrow and having cake and ice cream / giving her gift, i would just be going out to my normal movie night like every Monday at about 10:30 at night. 

My fiancee is very upset about things because its her birthday and she wants me to spend the entire day with her. I understand its a special day, but its my best friend and they're leaving and who knows when the next time ill see them is?

To be clear, while she asked to go, she didn't explain where she was going until the last second.

I thought this was a girl's brunch, not a girl's brunch pool party.  I wouldn't care that it's a pool party *except* I've been basically begging this group of friends to come to my pool for a party this entire week.  They all said ""yes, let's do Anus's pool on Sunday"".  Then it became lets have a girls brunch first, now it's nearly 3pm in the afternoon, a storm is rolling in, and I'm standing here with tons of groceries / party supplies in hand watching a fucking storm roll in.

Now I'm not an expert when it comes to art; my anatomy and proportions suck and I really have a lot to learn, but I know some tips and I wanted to share them with her, since the drawing looked good but had some things that could be fixed. I started giving her my feedback in a polite way, but then she just said things like ""I didn't ask for your opinion"" and ""That's how my art style looks like"". Maybe I was being an asshole (since she didn't ask for advice), but I feel like any artist should be able to take criticism and understand that there's always room for improvement, not to mention that the ""That's my art style"" excuse is pretty lame."

c7ijwr	2019-06-30 19:36:33	AstoriaBlack	AITA for wanting to redo my exam that I failed because my teacher made a mistake in the studyguide?	"English isn’t my first language and I am on mobile so sorry for grammar and spelling  and format issues. 

So I’m a high school student and usually get pretty decent grades. I have a tech professor that have earlier been one of my favourite teachers but at the end of this semester I had a course for which we got a study guide at one of the first lessons. Soon after that lesson I was absent from school for a couple of weeks because of medical issues. When I came back I asked the teacher about what I missed and he gave me some texts to read and some accompanying questions, he said that was all I needed to know. Some time later we had a test which I studied for using the study guide we got at the first lesson. I thought all went well but after I left the exam room I started comparing answers with my friends and they had completely different answers from me!!!  It turned out that the study guide we got at the start, the only one I had, had the wrong equations in it and the rest of the class had gotten new ones while I was gone and no one had told me, not even the teacher. So I sat down and mailed my teacher asking if I could redo the exam at a later time, this was sent at Friday afternoon. The next week there are two different re-exams one on Monday and one on Friday if you didn’t go to any of them you were screwed and would get an Failed on the course. On Monday morning the teacher still hadn’t answered but it still hadn’t been a full workday so I decided to wait till Friday to do the re-exam. On Friday morning he still hadn’t answered my mail so I decided to do the exam despite that he hadn’t answered because if there was two tests in my name he had to base my grade on the best one (it’s a school policy). I arrive to my school about seven minutes before the exam starts and goes to my mail to make sure I know which room the exam is held in and he has answered. 12 minutes before the exam stars he has emailed me saying; Yeah you can’t redo the exam because it’s you’re fault you didn’t dubble check the equations before taking the exa. I got really sad because the redo of the exam was almost two hours before the rest of school started, most of the teachers wasn’t even at school yet. I got a crying fit and sat crying in the middle of my empty school for a long time before the math teacher came and calmed me down, after I was calmed down I tried to write a email back to the tech teacher saying that I thought it was shitty of him to email such a thing so close to the exam starting but I was probably a bit aggressive because I’m autistic and don’t cope well with sudden schedule changes. He later sent an email back saying that it was my fault he answered my email so close to the exam starting because I emailed him on such short notice. I don’t know, Am I the asshole?"

c7ijld	2019-06-30 19:35:48	Anon30126	AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to be a girl’s “beard”?	"Some background: my boyfriend (25M) and I (23F) have been friends for over a decade, and dating for about three years. He recently relocated to my city, and moved in with me. He just switched jobs, and at his new office, he’s working with an old friend from high school. I’ve met her several times, and she’s a very sweet girl (26). 

At first, I was excited for him to have a good friend at work, and to maybe get a new “couple friend” out of the girl and her partner, another friend of ours. However, he recently mentioned how the girl’s coworkers/family don’t know that she’s a lesbian, and think that my boyfriend is actually HER boyfriend. 

This upset me a decent amount. I get that she feels safer in the closet, and that “fake boyfriend” is about as in the closet as you can get, but it still upsets me to think about him pretending to date this girl for as long as they’re working together. This includes work events, like after-hours drinks and hangouts. It also means that my boyfriend won’t be able to bring any new work friends over to hang out, because I’ll either have to leave for the evening or pretend to be a roommate. 

I brought these concerns up to a friend of mine, and she essentially called me homophobic for not wanting this girl to be comfortable at work. I feel like it’s reasonable to want to be your boyfriend’s only partner, fake or otherwise.  However, it’s my boyfriend’s decision in the end. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My SO and I are temporarily living with his parents, who have pretty much abandoned their elderly (15 year old) dog.

Now, they adopted this dog when my SO was in 5th grade, so I believe they are ultimately responsible for her because they decided as adults to get a dog. However, they stopped buying her food last year and paying attention to her so I started feeding her because I just can’t see an animal go hungry.

Now she has a huge cancer tumor on her side, which recently burst open, with rotting necrosis and flesh oozing everywhere and she keeps licking it. I told them this dog needs to see a vet ASAP but they don’t care. She’s going to get a horrible, painful infection and get even worse.

They refuse to care for her. I cannot watch this animal suffer any longer. She is dying and it’s cruel and inhumane. Am I the asshole if I take her to the vet?"		1	0

I say nothing yesterday. Around 7:30pm he texts me an apology. I reply that i felt incredibly hurt and disrespected by his actions. no response, until he asks this afternoon if i want to get dinner.

The last time he was angry with me, i called, texted, and went over there as soon as i could and pounded on the door until he answered and we could talk it out in person. I don't feel as though a text apology is enough for this kind of behavior. I guess the question is more, WIBTA if I refuse dinner and end the relationship over his lack of giving a damn? we've been together over 1.5 years. ups and downs but nothing that severe.

"I (19F) have known my neighbor (18F) for a very long time and our parents are pretty close, however, I barely talk to her now. A few days ago she posted about a known pyramid scheme on her Instagram story, and has now contacted my mother for her to do one of their demonstrations in our home tonight. 

I originally shrugged it off because she has a job at a fast food place so I assumed she has minimal involvement with the pyramid scheme, but now I’m not so sure. Like I said, I barely speak to her so I don’t even know if she is trying to quit/has her job so she can focus on the “good money” the pyramid scheme is offering her. 

The company has been targeting a whole bunch of high school-aged kids in our area and I’d hate for my neighbor to be drawn into a scheme like this, especially since she’s off to college in a few months. It won’t sit right with me knowing she being taken advantage of when she has a perfectly good job already. But, I feel like giving her a lecture on how bad this company is would cause a bit of tension, especially since so many MLM “employees” get angry when their work is criticized.

She is trying very hard to make more money before college and I’d hate to be a buzzkill. My mom told me I should just let her do her thing, but I just feel like it’s wrong to let my neighbor think this is normal work.

Our house is next to a small river in suburbs. We were eating in front of the house and a boat of 4 men passes by, the boat obviously is too small for the 4 of them, and it looks a bit funny. They look foreign and i assumed they were not very well off but made the most of it. For all i know they couldnt give a sht about the size of their boat of what anyone thought. Anyways. My mom looks at them and she just starts laughing. Not loud but slightly forced. I cringed very bad at this because they were like 10meter(30feet or something). They didnt react but i couldnt really look them in the eyes. She looks at them and smiles and continues her half laughter. When the men passed I said:"" really..? Why did you laugh at them that sounds so mean."". She then got angry with me because I ""assume"" to much.

She does this quite often. Moslty it is received as playfull i think. But they did not. I know that her intentions were good but I just felt really bad..

Random man asked me if I knew of any cheap hotels nearby.  Looked them up on Google, and then asked him where he is from.  He's from a developing country overseas, won't say where specifically.  Anyways we got to talking and we had a pretty good discussion.  He's created a group that helps educate poor kids in his country.  His good work, plus the fact that he seems like a benign middle aged guy made me want to help him out.  I said he could stay in my apartment the night, told him he didn't have to pay.

He came over later at night.  Bought some beers and we chatted a little.  He said ""thank you"" several times genuinely and said he didn't take it for granted.  Next day we were at the deli again, he wanted help with sending emails to other groups (he's awful with technology and can't type well).  I felt kinda bad so I typed out professional emails while he dictated.   I was trying to do some of my own business on my laptop, but he kept asking for help. He was stressed and being kind of rude when I asked him to repeat himself (his accent + contents of email made it hard to understand).  Kind of felt like he was taking for granted my help now, as if I'm his personal scribe?  

I can think of a million things I'd rather do than type up professional emails/do grunt work (plus his attitude was kind of grating me, but he was stressed so....).  After typing a few emails for him, I abruptly said I have to go.  He seemed crestfallen.  I kind of feel like a dick for leaving him in the lurch, since he's a foreigner in the US who can't type well.  On the other hand, I feel like I did a big favor my letting a stranger sleep in my apartment, and I don't want to spend my weekend typing some dude's emails.  AITA here?"		1	0

I have a learning disability, and its a for me to find work. I've worked in a movie theater as janitor, and earned $40.




I bought dark souls remastered, played the whole thing, and let my brother borrow it. He traded it in, without my consent. For weeks, he said nothing, I knew he'd done something. I asked, ""who did you sell it too?"" and he replied ""I don't sell to my friends"". I knew it, he did sell it, after that I told my mother and she confirmed it, and she was surprised too. 



I don't blame her, however I do completely hate him now. In the 5 years I've known him, he's assaulted me 5 times, he's insulted my weight, and my learning disability, and has told me no one loves me. He hasn't changed. He said something that could ban me, so I won't repeat it here 


3 weeks ago, he had the audacity to say ""I was such an asshole once"" while he was still thinking I've forgotten about the whole thing. Well, today I told him ""why did you sell it?"" ""for money, shut the fuck up about it already"". I recorded 42 seconds of him confirming it, and after I stopped recording, sadly I missed the best part. 




I'll repeat the whole recording 


Me: how much will you pay back, the money you stole


Him: $20 


Me: I paid it for $40 


Him: its $20 now don't try to finesse me. 


Me: when I paid for it, it was $40.

After I ended the recording (really regret doing that)

Him: you waste your money on video games you don't even play. 



Me: it's still money I earned, so that games value is relevant to me, it's not a waste of money. 


Him: wasting your money on m&ms (the total amount I've spent on m&ms is $5) and video games, that's what your whole life will be like, pathetic. 


Me: I don't have an income, and what would I do with that money, its not even alot (it was about $500 I've earned all year) you probably spend it on shoes or other bull shit. 




Him: you don't know what I buy, and moms buying the shoes. Your argument is dumb

c7idq6	2019-06-30 19:21:38		AITA for not wanting SIL to move in?	"Hi Reddit,

My wife and I are both 30 and have a 9 year old daughter. My wife's sister divorced within the past couple years and wants to go back to school. She has 2 boys ages 11 and 8, both of which I love but are quite difficult to handle. They fight and scream constantly and have a hard time listening due to lack of consistent boundaries in their household. SIL wants to go to nursing school which her dad is going to pay for. She has the option of moving back in with her Mom for that time until she's out of school. Her mom is one of the sweetest ladies I've ever met. However, one day out of the blue while we were all hanging out my SIL dropped that if I get a promotion that she wants us to get a bigger house so she can move in and stay with us through school. She was half kidding, but we all know there's truth in every joke. She kept bringing it up that night and I basically said that if it came down to that I'd move out. I don't want to spend a promotion on a bigger house so it's more comfortable for her for a few years, even if she's paying rent. And although we have a third bedroom that's currently our quiet/training room I'd rather not give that up.

On top of that, I don't want to be a impromptu babysitter for her kids. They say this wouldn't happen but I know it would because I can't stand unsupervised screaming kids. Her kids would be split 50/50 with the dad, but how could someone reasonably study for nursing school and watch them at the same time? This is all really frustrating for me. In my opinion if she wants to go back to college she should put her ego aside and live with her retired Mom for that time. It'll give her an incentive to finish faster, and wanting to live with her sister(us) despite the added stress it'd cause me seems really entitled. I work at 5 AM and get up at 4 so I can be on the road by 4:45 at the latest. I have a hard time getting enough sleep as it is.

Despite me saying I'd leave, she brought it up again at a family birthday dinner at a restaurant and basically told a cousin ""He doesn't know it yet but I'm gonna move in with them while I go to nursing school"". I just stayed quiet and didn't engage in conversation again. When I brought it up to my wife she said she was just kidding because she knows it would bug me. How is that a joke?

I brought it up to my wife last night and mentioned how it bothered me. My Wife never talked to me privately, it was her sister just bringing it up out of nowhere. My wife shouted that her sister could live here if she had to because it's family and she'd pay rent. I told my wife last night that if it came down to it, we could split everything 50:50 and she can live with her sister.

It's not as if this is her only choice. She has daddy to pay for college and mommy to stay with. She can take out some loans if needbe. She's not some battered woman in a shelter. This seems like choosey beggar material to me.

Something that you should know is that I have diagnosed ADHD, and cannot help zoning out.
My mom and I were in the car, and we were mostly being quiet with the occasional sentence or two between us on random thoughts. Something that has happened a lot is that I will zone out, and she will start talking. When I come back to reality, I will ask her to repeat what she said because I didn’t hear her. She will then get mad at me for zoning out, even though I was already lost in though when she started talking. The same thing happened today and she yelled at me for not paying attention, and I shouted that we shouldn’t talk at all because I can’t help zoning out. She then stopped talking to me the entire car ride back. When we were in the driveway, I asked her if she wasn’t ever going to talk to me again, and she said I told her not to. I told her that she was getting upset over something that I can not control, and she said that if I “can’t control it”, than I should start taking my ADHD medication everyday. 
I have meds for my ADHD, but they stop me from eating, so I don’t like to take them on weekends, and only use them for school days. And, even when I’m on them, I still zone out frequently, it’s just for a shorter period of time. 
I do not feel bad at all for saying what I did. I can’t help zoning out, and I don’t understand why my mom minds repeating things every now and then in the car (the car is where it’s easiest for me to get distracted and zone out).

Fast forward two days. I get a message saying that quote, ""The Rocket League team is a community and anyone can join."" Basically, trying to kick me off the team by saying it's just a way to find friends. This pisses me off and I just forget about the Discord.

Today, while looking through discord, I decide I want to leave the server and so I do. Leader hits me up.

I feel like I’m not giving you the answers you are wanting but I can’t change the way I feel and I’m sorry about that but that’s unfortunately the way it is.  But I’m willing to remain good friends, however if that’s not what you want then I understand.

Me: I’m sorry I made you uncomfortable, I wasn’t trying to change your feelings or anything like that, my last message was just trying to get a proper understanding of your feelings, not trying to ridicule them. I’m more than happy to be good friends with you.

She has seen, but not replied to the last text (she saw it over 8 hours ago now) I’ve spoken to friends who say they believe she was unnecessarily rude, so I’m just looking for unbiased opinions."	Asshole	0	0
c7i5mj	2019-06-30 19:01:41		AITA For MisGendering My Cat?	"*^(\*)**Sorry if it's choppy, had to edit for word count*

When our cat, Olive was 3, a kitty came up to me outside our house and meowed. It looked like she was nursing, so I asked her where her babies were and-wouldn't you know it? She led me right to them. The 3 kittens looked just about the right age for weaning.

We set up a little shelter outside for them, and eventually began rehoming them. Boyfriend was adamant that we were ""not getting another gd cat!"", but Olive (who hates other cats usually) became very interested in the kittens. Eventually she picked up one sweet little kitty and brought them into the house and began cleaning them. Boyfriend texted me a picture of the two cuddled together with a message that said ""We have to keep her now"".

Well, this crazy cat lady readily agreed. Tiggy had a very sweet, outgoing personality. Everyone who met them was smitten.

We had the kitties fixed through a special vet service that does charity for rescues and provides discount services to regular customers. (We love them because they treat our animals much better than the fancy vets do.) Anyway, Tiggy came back with their belly shaved, and it looked like a spay mark. I've had lots of cats in my life, so I never doubted their gender.

When we took Tiggy to be de-wormed and have all that stuff done that you do for a rescue, we actually asked just to be sure. Vet said ""yes, seems like a healthy girl"".

Tiggy is now 20 months old and is twice the size of Olive, who is 3 years older.

Anyway, it's flea season now, and with flea season comes the risk of tapeworm. We decided to take both kitties to get treated and tested, just to be safe. Our normal vet was booked up for the day, so we decided to go to another vet, since it's a simple treatment. Vet does initial exam and exclaims over how big Tiggy is, ""especially for a girl"". About halfway through the exam, the vet exclaims ""This is a neutered male cat"".

Boyfriend and I are stunned.

""Are you SURE?"" I ask.

A cat's...junk is kind of on the inside, so it's not too easy to tell unless you probe certain spots. Vet probes. Yes, definitely a male.

Well, shit.

Tiggy is almost two and is used to being called ""Tiggy Anne"" on a regular basis. Tiggy is also used to being called ""my/our girl"" and ""good girl"". It's really hard to adjust to. I've tried calling Tiggy ""he"" and ""good boy"", and it feels wrong and confuses Tiggy.

We say ""good boy"", and Tiggy doesn't respond. We say ""good girl"", and Tiggy smiles and does this little wriggle that lets us know they are happy.

It just doesn't feel right, and I'm not sure that it really matters anyway, but...damn.

How do you fuck something like that up for two years?

I want to continue calling Tiggy ""she"" and I don't want to change their middle name.

Boyfriend thinks we should use ""he"" and change the middle name.

I know gender is such a touchy issue now, and I'm probably overthinking this, but would I be the asshole if I kept referring to Tiggy as a female and kept the feminine middle name?"		1	0

She has told me several times I should see it so that I could be in on the joke when she talks about it but it just doesn't interest me. 

She made such a huge deal about it and said it seems unfair since she has seen various shows that I'm a fan of to see why I liked them so much and has also learned a lot about basketball teams and players since I play basketball and am a really big fan and that taking an interest in your partners hobbies and likes is a big part of the relationship for her. I get that but it's just not fair that I'm obligated to see this show ( which has 9 full seasons btw with 20+ episodes each) when she can talk about this stuff with her friends and we can share things we naturally have in common.

c7i2w0	2019-06-30 18:55:11	lilomilos	AITA for not wanting to pay for a vacation where I spent almost all of my time helping my friend recover from her butt enhancement surgery?	"Since this is a very specific situation, I’m using a throwaway for privacy reasons. 

**Note - My friend has now said that although she is “extremely disappointed” in my actions, she’s going to drop the money issue.  So it’s not like I’m being sued or anything. I’m just posting to see if I am in the wrong with how I handled things.**

My friend recently got this butt procedure done in Mexico for cosmetic reasons. I personally thought it was a little unnecessary but I try to be a good friend and support her regardless. 

She ended up inviting me to come stay at a hotel with her for a week while she recovered. Then we would fly home together. I am a teacher and have summers off so I agreed to do it. There was no mention of money. (Because my husband happens for an airline, I hardly ever pay for flights, so the plane tickets were covered). 

I get there and the hotel suite my friend rented is beautiful. I have my own room and everything. But my friend was in no position to do much of anything. I had to basically play nurse as she couldn’t even use the restroom on her own. Whenever I got a chance, I would try to eat out and go swimming or explore, but since my friend needed me, my time was limited. I managed to squeeze in one hike and that’s it. Obviously, it was not exactly a traditional vacation for the reasons I’ve outlined. 

On our last day there, my friend asked me when I thought I could “pay her back” for half the cost of the suite. I’m like uhhhh excuse me?? Why would I pay you to play mommy/nurse for seven days?? She was pissed and we got into a big argument which obviously ruined the end of the trip.

My husband thinks it’s insane that she would ask me to pay her anything. However, a mutual friend of ours is on the side of the friend who had surgery. So I’m starting to doubt myself. 

Am I somehow wrong to expect that she’d cover the cost of the hotel under these circumstances? I mean, would you ask a friend to pay who spent time taking care of you?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7i228	2019-06-30 18:53:02		AITA for asking a fat girl to move her fat rump and a blondie to piss off, and getting revenge on a plane after repeated annoyances? Part 2	"Aight, I'm gonna have to ask you to excuse my immaturity and creepiness here, as this is just a graphic description of what happened.

Fat girl been out four times, blondie twice, all toilet. Fat girl can't squeeze through really so she pushes against the people in front of us, a young couple, and mutters something about thin privilege. I mutter something about squeezing and fatasses.

Fat girl comes back. Blondie tells her all what happens, fatty slaps me, laughs. ""hes such a neek, autism kid, no one likes him, dw about that shiz.""

Then, 2 hours later, or 4 hours since blondie's tumblr post, the fat girl lets off wind. Loudly.

The best way to describe it is, she spanked her pants against her fat ass, and her yoga pants were sagging so her pants were visible, they were ripped. Tried not to look, her buttcrack was clean at least, and read my book. I only saw this out of the corner of my eye. She jiggled around for a bit with a stressed expression on her face and then PARP, her fat rump jiggled and smell came out. Most tried to ignore it but it was loud as the engine lmo. She looked a bit embarrassed so I tried to lay off her a bit. A couple minutes later, she cried a bit. Apparentally she was being 'body-shamed' for a 'natural function'. Blondie reassured her but even she looked a bit annoyed.

Time for the wrath of the fatty.

&#x200B;

She was clearly looking for someone to take her anger out on, so she went for me.

She kicked me under the chair and kept swearing at me under her breath ""retarded pisshead"" ""the moon landings could have been framed on that forehead""(admit thats savage).

Then she shoved me and said loudly ""move your retarded arms and leave"" and repeated it several times.

I shoved her back.

Then I said ""Move your fat cow rump and tell your blondie thotticus friend to piss off"".

Not my most tasteful outburst, for sure.

Fat girl broke out crying, and blondie came and kicked me in the nuts and punched me in the throat.

The flight attendant saw the nut kick and throat punch, and asked if I would like them to be removed from the plane? She also expressed that she had seen the kicking and swearing and etc. She didn't seem to have seen my outburst or anything, but I assumed since she saw the fat girl crying she knew what had happened.

I said yes. I had a peaceful and relaxing flight. I inquired and heard they had another ticket given to them for a different time to the same location, and it was a holiday in a hotel booked after that plane's latest arrival time, so no major inconvenience caused.

So reddit, I think I'm TA, but just checking, AITA?

\*Notes

flight attendant was around 25, F.

my asperger is extremely mild, not enough to really excuse anything, just enough to be weird haha.

She is elderly and cannot move around very well these days. As such, I take her bins out for her. Not a big issue as I have to use the same passageway to take mine out anyway and she has always been a good neighbour.

Around 2 years ago, her kids all chipped in and got her a mobillity scooter. They had spoken to her before hand but she said she did not want one as she would not use it. They went ahead and got it anyway. 2 years later and she has still yet to use it.

The issue is, it is parked in our shared passage way as there is nowhere else for it. The passege way is too narrow to allow her to keep it in the garden (would not be able to turn it to get through the back door) so there it has sat for 2 years.

Every time I need to take the bins out or use the passage way for anything really, I have to move this damn scooter, there is no light in the passage way and I have lost count of the number of times I have ran over my own foot moving the damn this out of the way.

If she used it then I would have no issue but all it has ever done since she got it is gather dust and be an inconvenience to me. I tired talking to one of her kids about it on one of their rare visits but was told that it would be 'restricting her freedom' and that she might want to use it one day, the fact that the battery has not been charged in 2 years appears to be lost on them.

We only have a small one bedroom apartment so there's hardly any housework to be done and the place is maintained to a bare minimum. In my spare time, I work on projects to make our lives better or grow my work skills and I keep looking over and seeing her coloring on an app. The app doesn't even allow you to choose your colors. You press a numbered color and apply the colors to where the number matches. This has been going on for over a month at least. The coloring app is really starting to bother me. She hasn't been looking for work or doing anything for personal growth. She wants kids but I don't want to have kids with someone who has zero ambition and probably won't be able to take care of them if I died. I've asked if she's depressed and says no. She's generally a happy person. I've been telling her that I'm not happy with the lack of effort. I told her that i wished she replaced the coloring app with some meaningful activity- even if it's a video game where you have to use your brain, read books, or an art project that requires creativity. I'm just not sure how to handle the situation. Am I the asshole for picking on her over a coloring app?	Asshole	0	0

I'm going to call Future Father in Law FFIL throughout the post.

The party was planned with a couple friends from High school and college. We planned around going to Las Vegas, gambling, drinking, clubbing, the whole 9 yards.

I posted a daily update at the end of each day on social media to celebrate how awesome my friends are and how memorable the trip has been. The first day FFIL posts a passive aggressive comment on my post of ""why are you in Vegas?"" And ""thanks for the invite 😕😕😕"". I ignore him.

Day 2 comes and I do it again and he posts ""😠😠😠"" all over my posts. I just ignore him.

Day 3 comes and I'm playing blackjack in a casino when I receive this exact message ""you might not have been the one who organized the bachelor party, but I should have been invited. I probably would have not been able to attend, but I should have been given the opportunity to go."" 


Mind you I had been drinking, I was in a casino and I didn't want to deal with it, but I didn't want to ignore him either so I responded ""I'd be happy to talk about it when I get home if you want. Let me know.""

FFIL also responded with ""Not scoring a lot of points with me lately. I feel a bit disrespected twice now. You don't have the decency to even talk to me about your intent to marry my daughter. I approve, but you should have at least let me know you were going to propose to her.""

That last point was had a long conversation about months ago and came to a mutual understanding that I just am not traditional like that, but he felt the need to bring it up again.

Day 3 of the party is over in which I reported I actually made over $400 in the casino, and FFIL passive aggressive comments continue.

Now that I'm home my open invitation to talk to me is still open to him but he hasn't taken my up on it. He's been silent since I've offered to resolve this face to face.

I was on a road trip with my brother yesterday and it was my turn to drive. We had been on the road for about 6 hours at this point and I had been driving for 2 (I have no idea if that’ll affect the verdict but it’s some background). We were on a two lane highway with a speed limit of 70. 

Usually I’ll go between 5-10 over the speed limit in the left lane and if someone is coming up behind me I’ll move over so they can pass and then move back (since it’s only two lanes. In a big highway I rarely go to the far left lane at all). There were some cars on the road and a bunch of big semis. I came up on a car in the left lane that was only going the speed limit and was trapped behind her for close to 10 minutes. Not a big deal, but it was really frustrating. There were multiple times when there was space for her to move over to let me pass, but not enough space for me to move over, pass her, then move back, since they were going the speed limit in the right lane. 

Would I have been TA if I had honked at her?

"Well, yesterday 4 of my friends and me decided to go to a club, and I offered to drive. When we were at the club, at around 3am, I told my friends that I have to go because I have to get up at 8 o'clock for a family meeting, and that they either have to come now with me, take a cab or take the bus.

Although I told them I need to go to bed and that I was really tired, they all decided to go to McDonald's first. I didn't want to lose that time, but went along anyways.
Then, when we dropped of our first friend, 2 minutes later he called and said that he forgot his keys in my car, and that we please turn around and come give them to him. Because it was already so late (by that time it was 4) I figured he might as well ring the bell, or call someone from his family to open the door for him. So we didn't turn around, I dropped my other friends of at their houses, and then went home myself. He called multiple times, and now is really mad at me, because he has 4 siblings that live with him (still lives at his parents house) and he had to ring the bell.

While I belive to be completely in the right on this one, my friend is super pissed, and the other friends of us that went along also said I was an asshole.

My driver stops to pick another passenger up, and she gets in the car with an open beer, clearly drunk, and doesn’t put on her seatbelt. I usually just keep to myself in these rides, so I smiled as she got into the car and went back to the music in my headphones. We’re driving for a bit when my driver hits an unexpected pothole, and because she isn’t buckled in, she flies into the ceiling and spills her drink all over herself. I was unaffected, but looked around and both she and the driver seemed to be fine, so again I went back to my music. Soon I start hearing her loudly complain about how her head hurts and how she has a bump and is bitching dramatically at the driver, so I paused my music but kept the headphones in. 
She turns to me and snidely says “thanks for asking if I’m okay.” I didn’t really know what to say and she caught me off guard with her tone, so I just smiled at her. She began talking to the driver who didn’t speak much English, but they both understood French...which I also speak fluently. Basically she was calling me racist and prejudiced and talking shit about me and people from my city in French, not knowing I could understand. I didn’t say for the rest of the ride. 
When she got out of the car, she said “excuse me, next time there’s an accident, you should ask if the person is okay. It’s the right thing to do.”
We were not in an accident and it was pretty clear that she was fine and not hurt so I didn’t really feel bad about not talking to her, plus she turned out to be pretty rude herself. But I was still kind of confused by her reaction. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Like every so often we'll go see a film together, maybe grab food before hand. She is one of my closest friends despite how little we get to hang out. 

We decided we'd see Far From Home together when it comes out. That day is now 2 days away. The problem with this friend is she always has jobs that come with changing rotas. I understand it, I've done that type of work and it can make it hard to have a social life. But it means she's rarely available when I am and she rarely can tell me when that it is until a few days before. As well as that, she is quite difficult to get a response out of online so sometimes trying to arrange something is a nightmare.

I'm a huge Spider-Man fan so a new film coming out is a pretty big deal for me. As of right now I have absolutely no idea when I'll be able to see it with this girl. Meanwhile another group of friends have invited me to see it with them Wednesday evening.

I work full time in sales, my wife stays home with our 4 and 1 year old kids. We currently live is a 2 story house with a large yard/pool. When we first moved to this house we did not have kids and both worked. I did the yard/pool and she maintained the house, and I would help. We would randomly hire a landscaper or house cleaner depending on how busy we were but generally handled much of it on our own. We are about to move. We are upsizing our house but it will be a 1 level, however we are downsizing our yard and maintenance will be much less. When we first decided to list our current house due to me working, we hired a landscaper and pool guy to maintain both on a regular basis to make sure it looked good if a potential buyer wanted to see the house. For the most part we still maintained the house together. 

My wife asked that when we move since we will not need a landscaper/pool guy can we hire a cleaner to come monthly/biweekly. With all the changes we can certainly afford it, however I feel like we should not need to. I completely understand a stay at home mom with 2 kids under 5 is hard work. And I appreciate all she does for us and our kids to keep them active and healthy. However, I do feel like house cleaning is part of the job being a stay at home parent. I do cook 75% of the time, since I enjoy it and generally know how to cook a wider range of foods. With that I generally do dishes and keep the kitchen clean. She does do laundry 90%.  

I also believe hiring cleaners so often sets a bad precedence for the kids as they would think it is not necessary to keep things clean on their own."	Asshole	0	0
c7huo3	2019-06-30 18:34:43	throwaway300619	WIBTA for not letting my friend move in with me during his gap year anymore?	"My (18F) friends live in the southern part of the country and are moving to the capital, where I live, to attend university in a couple of months. Two of them, L and G (both 18M), already planned things out and will be living together. Another one of our friends, R (18M), was originally set to go back to his home country and study there but has recently decided to stay and take a gap year instead. Since most of our friends are moving to different places, R decided he would move to the capital as well and search for a job in order to make some money. Since he and G hate each other, living with them is not an option so he asked me if he could crash at my place for the year. Without thinking about it much, I agreed, as long as he split the electricity bill with me. My dad was also okay with him moving in and even offered to let him stay in his room. For some context, I've been living mainly alone since I was about 16 because my dad lives with his girlfriend and my mom isn't in the picture.    
   
R's been messaging me all week talking about how excited he is to move in and how he wants us and our friends to go bowling every weekend, go to the movies, have game nights, do karaoke, cook for each other at least one day of week and all these other things that I'm just not comfortable with for many reasons. One of them is that I took a gap year after high school, so getting back into a routine will probably not allow me to be as social as he wants me to be. Another one is that things here aren't as close as they are where he's from which means you can't just go anywhere you want by foot. The final reason is that he and G hate each other due to R straining G's relationship with his girlfriend, who R had a crush on for 2+ years despite being rejected by her on more than one occasion. I hate drama and R starts a lot of it with G and his girlfriend because he still can't get over her and hates their relationship. Every time there's drama, he always ropes me into it and it's really emotionally overwhelming for me because I tell him that he needs to get over her, he says he will, and then he never does.    
   
I've talked to him about it and told him he should stop growing expectations of how things will go as well as my various reasons for not wanting to be as social as he wants me to be. I told him we could compromise on having a game night once a month with our friends, however, he sounded disappointed. I also told him that if he wanted to move in with me he would have to stop creating drama and bringing me into it. After thinking about it thoroughly, I don't think he should move in with me because, recently, he's been causing more drama with his actions towards G and his gf. I don't think he's willing to change, and I can't live with someone who is as dramatic and emotionally overwhelming as he is, because I need my space to be able to focus on university and hobbies, which are my main priorities right now.

I work the opening shift from 3AM-9AM. We have regulars who come in everyday which isn’t unusual, but I have an unusual one who comes in at 430AM every single day and stays until 9AM. He sits in the lobby and opens the door for women who come in. This wouldn’t be so strange if he only did this once but he comes in Monday through Friday(which is the only time myself and the other opener work, we both have weekends off) and stays, on weekends he gets his coffee and goes. He sits there watching and eavesdropping on my coworker all morning. I’m obviously not a doctor but if you talk to this man he seems off. A month or two ago I left my job through the front door and despite the fact that the door was being held open for me by someone this man shoved me out of the way to get into the breezeway and hold both doors open for me. I don’t like being touched certainly not by someone who already rubbed me the wrong way. I expressed to this man and my boss how uncomfortable this made me and neither seemed to care. I have to leave my job through the back door to avoid this man. Last week he got there at 4AM as soon as we opened. Every single morning I push the donut racks outside on my own, this particular Friday despite my coworker telling him to leave me alone, he gets in the breezeway with me and presses his whole body against mine to try and reach over me to get the door.

I told my boss how uncomfortable this made me and asked her to tell him he’s not welcome back but she’s ignored all of my messages. My coworkers all told me that I’m being over dramatic.

I am not afraid of social interactions. I'm not scared to speak up and get  backlash.  I don't care mostly about other people, but I don't do anything illegal. If I realize I did something wrong I try to apologize.  I think people use each other, and all of us are selfish in our core. Just a lot of us are delusional and don't understand this.  As for me, I try to be honest with myself.  

Apparently others think I am an asshole. I constantly hurt people without doing anything. They ask what I think, I respond straightforwardly, they get mad.  Or online when I post my opinion, people get mad once again. I am honest. My intentions most of the time are clear.  I can use people for money and tell them I'm doing that.  If they agree, why do I have to refuse?  But people still are pissed. I don't get it.  I don't follow morals, religion or any other concept.

c7hrh4	2019-06-30 18:26:44		AITA for calling husband a 3rd child?	"The father of my children wakes up on weekends and goes right from a bed to a couch. Then he sits on the couch playing video games pretty much all day unless I make him do adult things like taking out trash or helping cook meals. Family outings? Nope. Eating meals together? Nope. Video games take priority. 

Let’s just say I’m a 24-7 nag because of this behavior. If I said nothing he’d just sit there all day and barely move? I really don’t know. With 2 kids it’s hard enough getting them off screens and now this habit is in full effect. 

I mean they don’t even go to the bathroom sometimes. It’s insane. If I didn’t nag them to you know, eat breakfast or you know, go to the bathroom or even brush their teeth, I wonder if they ever would? Father (3rd child) doesn’t say a thing. 

This dude is now upset with me for calling him that. AITA? Really tho? I get he works all week and is tired but I work too, from home mostly while I am with kids. The universe is out to get me. Wish marriage vows came with seeing into the future."		1	0

So my friend said she wasn’t going to go to this engineering camp unless I went with her, and my mom was going to force me to go. We decided we could sleepover for 2 nights in a row which I think made us kinda annoyed of each other. On the third day when we were about to leave, I saw some guy wearing airpods and I told her that some people wear airpods just to flex. She then said she doesn’t wear airpods because she has to charge them and so I mockingly said “I only don’t wear my airpods because I have to charge them” and sounded really annoying and flexy as a joke because we talk that way a lot. But then she said that I was jealous because I didn’t have airpods but she wasn’t joking. After that, I said I’m not jealous and brought up my house because she’s always complaining about how horrible her house is because it has popcorn ceilings and some bugs. She replied really sassy that all I ever talk about is my house which is like the opposite of me, I talk about it because I just moved into it a couple months ago and it’s the first house I’ve ever lived in so I’m excited. But then we walked to her moms car and she got in the front and never spoke to me since and it’s been a couple days now and I feel like I did something wrong maybe.

c7hpdw	2019-06-30 18:21:35		AITA for not believing my girlfriend when she told me I gave her an STI when we both agreed we have done nothing prior?	"So let me start off by saying, before we met we both were on terms from the beginning we’ve never done anything prior to my knowledge. A few moths progress and we start getting physical. Another month goes by and she calls me on the phone crying hysterical saying she has HPV. Me being 100 percent sure of my past I start becoming skeptical, so I question the doctors prognosis saying can you please get a second opinion? She took that as the wrong way and now firmly believes I was wrong in the situation because she said I didn’t listen to her right off the bat saying I was being mean acting this way. I’m a believer of I want to see the evidence from the doctor till we jump to any conclusions. She said she didn’t care she 100 percent believed she has it regardless. I also ran by her it could possibly be other things not being an STI.

Yesterday she informs me her parents think I am toxic and abusive for not believing her right off the bat. But I’m pretty sure if either of them were put in my situation they would have reacted the same way. They also told me how I rushed to the doctor to get tested 5 minutes after he call was not right, they said I should have waited till it all blew over for doing my due diligence.  

My whole gripe with the situation is I feel like she is letting her emotions get in the way of logical thinking and I am being outed as abusive for thinking otherwise. Was I acting mature in the situation or was I being immature?

c7hp22	2019-06-30 18:20:44	pax_et_veritas	AITA for telling my mom I can’t help with chores for my sisters wedding the week after my baby is born?	"So my family keeps asking me for favors in advance while I’m on maternity leave for the next couple of months starting in the next couple of weeks. For context, I’m in the US so unpaid maternity leave for up to 12 weeks. I’m lucky enough to get paid in full for one paycheck and partial payment for the next 3. Then after that it’s all just using up our savings which we don’t have a ton of so I expect to only have 8 weeks before I go back to work. I’m also a first time mom. 

My sister is getting married in September and I’m the MOH. I’ve planned and hosted her bachelorette weekend while 8 months pregnant and have been the bridesmaids liaison as far as organizing dresses and fittings and schedules. All while trying to prepare for our first borns birthday. 
My parents have agreed to come help out once the baby’s here but my mom keeps suggesting that she’s bringing my sisters wedding chores for me to help out with when I get out of the hospital. I’ve told her on several occasions (mostly off hand) that I’ll be pretty preoccupied with my newborn. It’s kind of been brushed off until today. 

My mom called and once again said she is bringing up wedding craft stuff for me to help with once the baby’s here. I’m currently 39 weeks pregnant and have no cares to give anymore. I told her straight up that I’m going to be too preoccupied with my baby. She then says “well when the baby’s sleeping you can help”. Seriously?! I said “when the baby’s sleeping, I also plan on trying to sleep. If the baby’s sleeping and I’m not, I’m going to be trying to catch up on house chores that I thought you were coming up to help me with. I didn’t realize you were coming up the week of my child’s birth to hold him while I do stuff for my sisters wedding.” She then acted like I was being ridiculous and started the guilt trip. I just told her bring stuff that needs to get done but I’m not making any promises that we’ll get to any of it. I told her I wish she would’ve given me some stuff to do now while the nursery is prepared and I’m literally just waiting for labor on my days off. I would have gladly taken something to do as a distraction from all the waiting. Still she tries to guilt trip and says both my grandparents are helping out. It’s just cutting out paper hearts so it’s not like a big project. Idk. AITA?

So my sister and I are usually quite friendly but she has a habit of being a fucking cunt at times and we only became better siblings following her going to uni as well as after I went to uni(I'm still at uni). 

She's currently studying for an exam in a couple of days, she normally doesn't stay at home since she's working and stays near her work however since her exam is near home she's back for the week and she leaves next sunday. 

Usually we are chilled with each other however ever since she went off to uni (its been 7 years) I've felt that she never really treats home as home and she takes my parents for granted and expects people to tidy up after her. My parents have normally tolerated her however today we were chilling and watching tv when she intentionally bumped into me while I was drinking coffee. This resulted my coffee spilling onto her. My reaction was WTF dude... to which she responded by blaming me and wiping the dripping coffee onto me to which I told her she's not welcome in the house, no one likes dealing with her bullshit and she's got problems and she's a selfish cunt who only looks out for herself. 

Following this she chose to violently try breaking her coffee mug and then poured all her coffee onto the sofa saying well now atleast its even...

So, earlier this year, my father said he wanted to travel in September to the Oktoberfest, in Germany. Right away I knew it wasn't a good idea, since I would be close to graduating, and also i had to be on the lookout for a job, since I am 23 years old and never worked before, I was not comfortable traveling in such a critical period of my life, and told him so. We made a deal: He would make an insurance on the trip, so if i found a job by then, he would cancel it and at least would not lose all the money.  
A few months later, I got  a Job! It's not full hours, it's an 8-month contract, but its in my field, so I'm not really complaining. However, my father did not cancel the trip, he instead insisted that I should talk with my boss about skipping ten days of work for the trip, which is something I found completely absurd to do on my first job, and again, I told him so, so he's calling me selfish for not even trying and that I am ""ruining his dream""  
Am I in the wrong here? I'm trying to build something for myself, and while I really enjoy traveling, I think I need to have my priorities straight.

c7hljs	2019-06-30 18:12:16	TheMightySnuffler	AITA for not wanting a relationship with my brother right now?	"Some backstory: my brother and I have a complex relationship, in part because we never grew up together (3 years apart but he went to boarding school when he was 8 and I was 11). We've recently gotten closer in the past couple of years and we usually talk almost daily through memes

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It all started about a week ago when we got into an argument over dinner. It was over something stupid (politics in which we have very contrasting opinions) but it was getting heated and making both me and my parents uncomfortable. I tried to get him to stop by saying basically ""let's agree to disagree"" but he became nasty, and started to belittle me for very personal things that I'm sensitive about. As a complete kneejerk reaction I lashed out by hinting at something he had told me in private which my parents would be livid about (not ok but I didn't actually say the thing if that makes sense), to which he responded by calling me the c word. However we were able to continue dinner and I thought things were resolved.

&#x200B;

However the next day my parents and I travelled up to my university for my graduation. Since I couldn't keep my emotional support dog in the hotel I left her with him for the week. I was incredibly anxious about this as it's the first time I've left her with him and being away from her is hard at the best of times. But I left her, and expected to hear from him while on the road/once I arrived. However I realised that he blocked me on all social media and text as soon as I arrived at my uni, meaning I couldn't contact him about her/get pictures etc. This left me absolutely fuming as I already had problems being away from her and I felt this was vindictive and malicious on his behalf. However my parents said I was overreacting and I was in the wrong for being rude to him the day before.

&#x200B;

It's now a week later and he's (finally) re-added me on social media, sending me pictures of her. His excuse is that he ""needed some time"" away from me. Fair enough, but my dog is like my baby, and if you were babysitting you would not cut off the parent from contact. This, along with our already complex history has made me realise I do not currently like my brother for who he is, and I do not want to try and maintain a relationship with him at the moment. I don't think this will be forever, just until he matures a bit and learns some accountability - what he did hurt me and caused me immense stress at a time when I am meant to be celebrating. I'm leaving the country for a couple of months and have made the decision I don't really want to resume our day-to-day contact we had prior to this. However my parents (particularly my mother) think I am overreacting and that I should forgive him immediately. They argue that if I ignore him this is no better than his behaviour and to a certain extent I do see their point.

c7hl8a	2019-06-30 18:11:29		AITA for not helping my parents?	"I (22) got out of the military 2 months ago to go back to school and my parents offered to let me live with them, rent free. I took up the offer but I felt guilty so I loaned them $40k they needed to pay them back in some way (they keep avoiding talking about the money so who knows when I’ll ever get it back).

They opened a business not too long ago and I have a lot of free time until school starts so I’ve been working for them for free and taking care of all the house chores. I don’t mind this since I do have a lot of free time but this does take up most of my day (I work for them 6 days/week for 5-7 hours/day).

What bugs is me is that they don’t press my older brother (25) to take on the same responsibilities. He’s on summer break right now so he has just as much free time as me. Last night, I got home from work at 2am and had to be up for 7 to work again the next day but I didn’t get to bed until 4 because I was cleaning up after my brother. He always leaves his dirty napkins and dishes anywhere he pleases. He keeps promising to cover some of my shifts to help me out but when the time comes, he says he’s too busy because he has to do x, y, and z.

They’re also super lenient and supportive with him whereas they’re very short with me. They’ve paid for 6 years of university for him but I have to go to a 2 year college because I have to cover my tuition and a 4 year school is out of my budget. If he doesn’t want to work, they always make excuses for him like “he’s probably tired, you can just do it instead”. But last time I wanted a day off, they flipped out and said I was lazy and inconsiderate for even asking because they would be working so hard and I would just be relaxing.

I told them I’m not obligated to help them out and they way they treat my brother is bullshit so they can deal the business themselves because they wouldn’t be getting any extra help from me. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c7hklb	2019-06-30 18:09:54		AITA for still getting mad at my gf for this?	"Me and my now girlfriend went through some conflict early on/before our relationship that still effects me now 3 months later AITA?   

My girlfriend and I met senior year of high school and talked on and off for that year and the summer following until she got a boyfriend. I went off to college but while dating her boyfriend she would often reach out to me for someone to talk to because he was mentally and sometimes mildly physically abusive to her. I’d spend hours upon hours talking to her, comforting her, and telling her how being with him was not good for her mental health etc. she turned to me for everything and told me many times if she were to breakup with him she would want to come to me, she feared being alone and I told her I would gladly date her.    
Months pass she ends up breaking up with her boyfriend and tells me right away. I take this as my queue to try and be with her as that was what she told me she wanted and I wanted it as well. A month and a half passes of me and her texting/FaceTiming all the time, and meeting up every once in a while as I was at college.   
We planned a weekend we would spend together as our birthdays are one day apart and happened to fall on Friday and Saturday, so we wanted to go out and have fun together, just us, because we knew we were good for each other and things were getting serious between us. She exclaimed how happy she was to finally be able to not hide that she loved me and wanted to be with me. Of course at the time, I wasn’t messing around with or texting other girls in order to make sure she knew that she is the one I am focused on, she was my focus. She would tell me countless times to “keep the girls away”.
Now roughly a week before our planned weekend she’s acting strange so I ask what is going on. She says some guy texted her to “hangout” and that she is going to “hangout” with him on our birthday weekend. I ask who, she tells me, and it’s one of my old friends who’s a total douche and I warn her of that. She denies my warning and starts going off on me saying “I can do whatever the fuck I want I’m single”. So all of this goes down, I hangout with her on her birthday and she “hangsout” with him on mine, coming to my birthday get together after her “visit”.   
Later on we talk more and more apparently he was an ass to her after (big surprise) and we start dating, things were good when we weren’t talking about what happened, but when brought up she says she was just trying to feel “wanted” and that tipped me off because all I had ever done for her was make her feel wanted. She later changed her reason to wanting to feel “reckless” and that she “had to do something” when she was single “you can’t just jump right back into a relationship”.   Now, it’s been 3 months and still comes up every once in awhile and is really the only thing we argue about, I can’t help but think how different things would be if that never happened but AITA for still being mad at this?"		1	0

They kinda need me because there is just not enough friends in the group, but I don't wanna do it. Not on their terms.




They have been ignoring me for the rest of the year whenever I wanted to do sports, and I was forced to develop several solo-activities throughout the years so I can keep fit. I already did my solo-activity today, to which, btw, I literally invited you and you told me ""it's too early, bruh"". So I'm sorry if I'm not too psyched to go to an overcrowded town sports-area with all the normies just like you pretending like they do sports, in the comfy shade of the sunset and mosquitoes. I don't enjoy having to accomodate random pedestrians into my sport-zone if I don't have to. I get it that it's a popular time to  do sports, but I do mine in the morning because you have fresh cold air then and there are no assholes around who just do sports to sit around and look at other people.





So yea. Here is my calendar, and here are the times when I am available. And if you can't condescend to compromise even once on my desired time to do sports, then I guess we'll see each other in winter on one of those awful pub gatherings because that's somehow better than doing sports, and it's so very cold outside- not"		1	0

Some people can walk to our school in 5 minutes, others like me are living nearly an hour away and need to use public transit. The neighborhood I'm staying in has a lot of brothels and I've already been mistaken for a prostitute a couple times (I know, I know, but it's been around 100 F nearly every day for weeks out here, if I don't wear shorts or a dress I'll die) so I really don't feel safe walking to/from the nearest tram station after dark. 

Most of my friends live somewhere in between (10-20 minute subway ride) and are also staying with host families in much safer neighborhoods. Our usual schedule is like this:

* 9 AM - 5 PM class, morning is in a classroom and the afternoon is on our feet outside
* 5-8 PM work at a cafe or something
* 8-9 PM dinner

Here comes the second issue: I have mild scoliosis so I look mostly ""normal"" but it's enough to make my back muscles uneven and severely limit how much weight I can carry on my back, let alone for the whole afternoon in the sun. Basically all of our homework requires a computer and my laptop is too heavy for me to walk around all day with. Yes, I have already tried to push myself on how much I can carry, I can do it once in a while but every day is just asking to get injured and undo everything I've gained in PT. 

So for the 3 hours at the cafe I basically just sit there twiddling my thumbs or attempting to write essays on my phone. It's wasted time. If I don't go to a restaurant with everyone else for dinner I'll have no dinner that day because my host family doesn't cook and grocery stores close very early here so I can't even get stuff to cook for myself. 

And yes, I am looking into getting a lighter laptop for the next school year. I didn't anticipate needing to carry my laptop around for anything on this trip and do not want to buy a new laptop while I'm still abroad and also don't have access to the drives I'd use to transfer my files to a new computer.

As someone who previously worked in food service, I know how frustrating it was when people would put pressure on me to choose something random that I think they’d like or when people would order elaborate things that aren’t on the menu. It just puts you in an awkward situation. So, trying to be courteous to the employees, I told him that I’m not going to do that, and he can order something off their regular menu.  He told me that this is what they’re paid to do that I obviously care more about them than him. I’m starting to feel badly about making this bigger than it needs to be, but I go here often and don’t want to form bad relationships with the baristas.

c7hfmp	2019-06-30 17:57:40	throwaway489597	AITA for not reaching out enough when my father had a heart attack?	"This happened a couple weeks back, but it's still been on my mind. 

My dad is in his mid-forties and recently experienced a heart attack at work. Fortunately, he made it to the ER before it got fatal. 

I recieved the news from my stepmom and she stayed with him in the hospital. She called me while there and I spoke briefly to my dad, he sounded fairly sedated on the phone (which seemed normal after recieving surgery). 

He texted me later updating me on the situation, saying they cleared the blockage and had him on nitroglycerin. I asked what the doctors thought ect. and said I was glad he was okay, I didn't get a response after that. I don't know what nitroglycerin does, but after hearing they had him on it, and hearing how he sounded on the phone plus the lack of response, i assumed it was some type of sedative and he was out of it. 

I knew he was going to be returning the next day and figured I'd get a better opportunity to talk to him then.

Well, turns out he did not agree. He got home and before I had the chance to ask him anything I was lectured about how hurt he was and how ""fucked up"" it was that me and my sister didn't reach out more. 

(Side note, my sister didn't reach out because of issues that arose prior to the incident. Our father kicked me out of my house without a phone or anywhere to go, and said he was ""disowning"" me and my sister due to a custody disagreement with my mom. This obviously upset her, because of what he said and because of how he treated her younger brother. I reached out regardless though because i'm not quite as blunt as her, and I still care for him.)

(He also said that the stress caused by that situation is what caused the heart attack, but I believe it's the 30 years of alcohol consumption and past drug use. I didn't think much of it, but thinking now I think he said that to put the blame on my sister and mother.)

I apologized and told him I thought he wouldn't be able to talk much. I don't know what kind of state people are in after a heart attack, but I can't imagine it's a very talkative one, and my few conversations with him seemed to back that up. Even after trying to explain myself and apologizing, he didn't let up.

My stepmom then created a group chat with me, my sister, and my half sister (M), for the sole purpose of saying, ""Thank you M for all your texts and calls, it meant a lot to your father.""

So, AITA? I asked them to update me on everything and let me know what was happening, but should I have done more? I feel bad but also think the reaction was a little too much aswell, I feel like they just want me to feel guilty, but maybe I should be. What do you think reddit?

Edit: Quick FYI, this happened while I was out of town so I didn't have the opportunity to visit the hospital, if I could've gone, I would've."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So obviously not the longest relationship ever lmao, but it's my first one and I'm pretty nervous about this whole thing. Oh and we're two gay guys in our early 20s. If that's of any relevance. I've seen others mention the genders and ages here.

A few days ago we were texting and he told me a very intimate story about how he lost his virginity. I'm not going to share it here, but I'll just say it made me feel a bit inadequate and awkward. Not because of him, but because of me... I lost mine when I was 18 to an older couple (older as in, 40s). Yeah, it was a threesome. It's a long story and I had my reasons, mostly wanting someone experienced to guide me. While I don't personally have regrets, the last guy I was talking to more seriously ghosted me after hearing this. So I'm feeling insecure about it. I don't want my boyfriend to think I'm a freak or a sex maniac or something.

c7hbf8	2019-06-30 17:47:18	momisannoyedwithme	AITA my moms drunk friend came to our door asking for her and I shut the door on his face	"
My mom and dad divorced last year and she moved to California and dragged me with her even though I wanted to stay with my dad. She told me she wouldn’t pay for my college if I stayed with dad so I’m holding out until I am old enough to go and then I’m never coming back. 

She has completely changed personality these last 8 months and all she ever does is drink and is on laughing gas all the time which is just so pathetic since she was 100% against that stuff before. 

She’s made a new ‘friend’ who I have never met before but she claims they’ve been friends for the last 25 years. He is a douchebag and slimy and paws her in front of me while staring at me and it’s just gross. 

Anyway she was home making dinner for me, because she’s usually out the house most nights with him, and she said she’d make it up to me and make me my favorite dinner. This guy came banging on the front door which is made of glass and she told me to go check. 

I went and it was him totally drunk and asking for my mom. I told him to get the fuck outta here and pushed him off the door because he was drooling on it. He called me a little slut (lol what?) and left. 

My mom asked who was at the door and I told her it was the neighbor because I KNEW if she knew who it was she’d go running to him. My plan was ruined when 5 mins later he called her and told her what I’d done. She was furious with me and predictably left me home alone to go running after him.

I threw her dinner out and made my own and the next day when she came home she called me a complete bitch for being so cruel to her and burst out crying. I didn’t think I was the the asshole at the time, but because my mom has a way of getting inside my head now I feel I’m being too hard on her.

c7hbet	2019-06-30 17:47:17	papasanchair	AITA for thinking that my neighbor keeps passive-aggressively mowing my lawn?	"So my wife and I (late 20’s) own a home in a neighborhood that is primarily retirees or close to it. My neighbor (we’ll call him Larry) and his wife are devoutly religious people who are usually nice to the point of annoying, but don’t cause any harm so we just kind of smile and wave when we see them. 

My wife and I have a one year old daughter, and another due in a couple months here. Early in the spring, my mower took a shit and I had to get a new one. No big deal. The lawn got a little long, I was waiting until that Friday when I got paid to go get the new mower. Larry comes over during the week and asks me if he can “bless me” by mowing the lawn, as it had gotten a little long. I explained that I was getting a new mower that weekend but accepted his gesture as just a neighborly thing. He’s semi-retired (early-60s), puts in a lot of work on his lawn, so I figured wth, go for it, thank you. 

So that weekend I get the new mower. It’s dope. It starts on the first pull, and I have no qualms with the definitely-too-much-money that I spent on it. 

Being that our household moves constantly with the baby and the pregnant wife, and the dog, and the cats, sometimes the lawn gets mowed on Friday, and sometimes it’s Saturday, or Sunday. But I always mow it once a week, and right before doing so pick up all the dog crap. I came home once from a business trip on a Sunday to see my front yard mowed and all the dog poop picked up. I asked my wife if Larry said anything, and she said no, she came home from work one day and it was like that.

Then today, my wife and daughter left to go do something, and I had an hour or two before an appointment to get the lawn done. I think Larry must have thought I had left too because I went outside and see him in my front yard picking up dog poop, and the front lawn half mowed. 

I say “Hey Larry, what are you doing?” and he says “I’m blessing my neighbor,” and more to the effect of “I like to do lawn work, if I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna do it right so I’m picking up the dog crap too” 
I say “well thank you, but I was just about to do that” and he goes on to say basically “you’re welcome, I’m almost done here and then I have to get to something else, so I’ll just finish up here” but then he trailed off saying “you guys must be real busy cause...” and then I think he caught himself.

So I basically think this dude is full of shit and using his “blessing” as a reason to passive aggressively mow my front lawn to his standards whenever I don’t meet his expectations. My wife insists I do not confront him and demand he not mow our lawn, as in her eyes he is just being very nice. 

So AITA for thinking Larry is a passive aggressive prick just mowing my lawn so that his neighborhood looks more acceptable? Or am I justified here? 

Tl; dr: My semi-retired neighbor keeps mowing my lawn without permission under the guise of a “neighborly blessing,” but really I think he’s just a passive aggressive jerk."	No A-holes here	0	0
c7haun	2019-06-30 17:45:54	MiketheKing2	WIBTA if I don't take the life insurance broker test my mom keeps telling me about	"For context, I (20M) am a college graduate. Ever since senior year of college, my mom keeps trying to get me to become a life insurance broker. My mom is on the verge of retiring from the phone company she has been working for for over 30 years and decided to become a life insurance broker to earn some extra income. I appreciate that my mom is looking out for me, but I telling her that I'm my own man and I can find other ways to make money. She keeps insisting that I become a life insurance broker even though it's not my cup of tea and I've been able to find work on my own. I've worked at two IT internships in the past, I currently work for the IT department of a real estate company and I've received a few interview offers from companies while perusing for jobs on the Internet thus proving that I can find jobs on my own. My mom claims that she isn't shoving this life insurance broker stuff down my throat, but I feel as if she is because she won't stop talking about it whenever she gets the chance to and it's starting to annoy me. For example, she keeps telling me about how some 27 year old guy from the insurance agency my mom works for has a ton of money all because he's a life insurance broker. My mom also keep insisting that I take the life insurance broker test as well as classes prior to said test and once again, I keep telling her that I'm not cut up for being in the insurance business. 

&#x200B;

While I do agree that earning extra income is good and I can use that to pay my student loans as well as pay for graduate school,  I don't feel comfortable with being a broker whereas I enjoy working within the field of IT because I majored in computer science when I was in college. As previously mentioned, I've been able to look for jobs on my own. Maybe I could find a job within IT that can cover my graduate school expenses (I know Abode covers expenses for the employees attending graduate school.) Plus I'm the guy where if you keep forcing me to do something, chances are I'm not gonna do it. Today, I told my mom that I'll become a life insurance broker as a last resort if I'm unable to find work in the future. So would I the asshole if I don't take the life insurance broker classes and the test. Thanks."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Okay so.

I was playing with my dog a couple of days ago, and I'm just going to mention that he can hold up about 25KG without a problem, he's also a pretty small dog. I was playing with my dog with someone else and yeah, then he ran away to someone else who had a pretty big dog, the guy who had the dog on leach falled down flat on the stomach, nothing too much happened between the dogs, I said sorry multiple times and felt VERY awkward. Then my dad came up to me, he was just going to say Hi, and the dude who had the dog had some friends with him, so one of them got up to my dad and literally screamed at him, saying I couldn't hold my dog, (remember I wasn't holding him I was PLAYING with him) I said that but nope still screaming, the dog was now close to us so of course our dog tried to get to him, and complained that I couldn't hold the dog (AGAIN) I could hold our dog but I needed to hold him real hard since ya know, the other dog was right in front of us. My dad told me it wasn't my fault but I want you guys opinions, 


I probably won't respond to everyone since I don't know too complicated English, but I will if I know how to respond.

I came back for Christmas and I had to listen to my mother say how I let myself go( what you totally want to hear for a month)

For the next six months she would only send me things on social media on how to loose weight and exercise tips. And then if I would ask for any support for my mental health or other struggles that contribute to my weight problems  she would get mad and I say I was ungrateful as she never got to go to college.

It’s summer now and I spent a month at my grandfathers and lost 4 kilos doing intermittent fasting and eating mostly Keto. I also began going to the gym and doing more then just boring cardio.

Now I’m back at home and began doing IF even if my mom says I’m starving myself (no I just am not hungry) I fought with her again(long story) and have been mad all day.  My sister said to come eat lunch and I said no because I am doing IF. 

Later my dad tells me to come eat. I tell him I will not eat and break my diet but I can sit with everyone else. He is now mad because he thinks I’m an asshole for not eating with them even though I offered to sit at the table and he said no.

A couple months ago my roommate came to me and said her brother was being asked to leave his place and was asking if he could stay with us for a few weeks while he figured out a living situation. I told her that I really didn't want another person living with us, but I didn't feel like I was in a position to say no. She promised it would only be for a few weeks, and he would sleep in her room and stay out of the way. Her brother came, and it was immediately apparent to me he did not only plan to stay for a few weeks. He hunkered down in the living room with all of his belongings, and even decided to rearrange our whole apartment. A few weeks turn into a few months, and he had made no effort to leave. Roommate did not like the situation either, and spent every night going out with friends instead of being home. I finally put my foot down and requested that he give us a timeline because an indefinite stay was not discussed. He ends up leaving, and my roommate and I had a conversation about what happened. We both agreed he had over stayed his welcome, and that he would not be staying with us again because it was a hardship on both of us. I warned her that it was very obvious her brother would ask to stay again, and she swore up and down if it happened she would say no.

Yesterday, roommate texts me asking if her brother can come stay with us for ""a while."" I immediately say no, and point out that last time he left we both agreed he would not be staying with us again.

We live about five (5) minutes away from where she works, but she wanted to leave from work straight to a grad party later. I figured I'd be nice and bring her stuff cause hey, she s my older sister. So I grabbed the shirt, shorts, shoes, and makeup she asked for and brought them to her since my over night shift doesn't start until 6 and ends at 2:00 am.

She did tell me where her shoes were, but they were next to an identical pair of black knock off Van's and I didn't see a difference so I took a guess and grabbed a pair. She did though and went on a mini rant about how I didn't follow her exact instructions, despite everything else being right, and how she'd now have to come all the way back home and fix my mistake.

I was annoyed at that and just left, but before I even got home I got six (6) more texts about how I didn't do exactly what she wanted and how I was such an inconvenience, and I eventually got fed up with it so I went home and brought her the other pair.

Both of my bosses are partners, same age which is 60s 70s, and they were both present today. My boyfriend and I were already having some issues this morning, just bickering, and so we went to work tense. Both of us tried to hide out attitudes and leave the drama at home. My bosses were already bickering also. My one boss, J, told her partner, A, to go home because all he was doing was yelling on the phone about a piece of machinery that was broken (that I was busy tearing apart and cleaning). They just want back and forth making smart remarks and insults and my boyfriend hid in the back while I just looked down and tried to ignore them. A asked me to do something with some wires. There's a lot of background noise from the other machinery so I didn't hear him and asked, ""what?!"" Sort of loud because he was talking to me from the back area. He jumped out of his chair with phone in hand and shouted in my face, ""everybody go home! Get out! And don't come back!""

I hear J frantically asking, ""what happened?!"" As I grabbed my keys and phone and took off to the car without a word. A shouted to me, 'And take him with you!"" Referring to my bf as I was walking away. 

Now, BF and I share a car. He owns title and I register and insure it. Without him, I have no vehicle to get to any job and it's miles of walking to the bus stops as I live in the woods. BF lives with me. 

I start pulling out of the parking lot after 5 minutes because BF wouldn't come out. He finally ran out, opened the door, grabbed his bag, and when I asked what he was doing he said he was staying and that I needed to chill the fuck out. I told him we just got fired (I worked for them loyally for years) and he slammed the door in my face. I drove home with no gas in the car and got back around 11:30. I call and he tells me to get him at 2 and that I need to grow up. I was so pissed. I told him I had no money for gas that he had the cash and he hung up. 

I'm expecting him to come home, pack his shit, take the car (he has a revoked license) and remove the plates. I texted J and told her A fired me and I did nothing to deserve how he talked to me and all she said was, ""I don't know what happened.'

My problem is that I’m being seen as an asshole even though my mother sent me to my room to go to bed. I’d be fine with singing happy birthday, but it bothers me that they think I don’t care about my sister’s birthday.

They broke up, after a month me and him started going out. His ex found out. He swears up and down that we were hooking up while they were together. That’s not true at all. I didn’t even talked to him properly at that time. 

Every time he sees me he makes some snarky comment about me, but he doesn’t even say it to my face. 

I was in class, minding my business, texting. He came in, sat right in front of me and made some unnecessary comment about me probably texting someone’s boyfriend. I was upset, I told him to stop being a little bitch, get over it and say it to my face if he had to say something, I said it loudly and people looked at us. He got up and left."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c7gu00	2019-06-30 17:04:19		AITA for getting mad at my parents for not letting my girlfriend over?	"I’m 20 and a college student. My girlfriend who I met at school lives 2 1/2 hours away so it’s somewhat long distance this summer. We barely ever get to see each other because of work and our busy schedules already. 

On top of that my parents have been reluctant to have have her visit the house at all. They both claim to like her a lot but whenever I ask to have her over I get a flat “no” with little to no explanation other than they don’t feel like it. Last summer she was over all the time and they were happy to have her as a guest so I’m not sure what changed. 

I had a deal with them that she wouldn’t come over for the month. Not sure what the purpose of that was but I agreed anyway. After a month wait i asked to have her over with plenty of time in advance and again “no we aren’t feeling like having a guest”. 

I try not to disagree with them much since it’s their house and I’m hopefully moving out in the next two years but this upset me. I basically just told them they’re being ridiculous and they seemed a little offended. This got me pretty much nowhere since the shut down whenever i try to bring something like this up. 

We can’t really go to her house either (long story not to do with me or her). We try to hangout and do stuff while out but with the 2 1/2 drive both ways it’s just tiring.

"Last night my gf and I went out to a tribute of a band, we started off good and while we were at the bar the conversation was kind of fizzling out, I noticed she was more quiet than usual so I asked her why she was so serious, her response was that she just felt like it, and I said okay. Throughout the night I kept trying to make conversation, but I received almost no reaction and one worded answers from her. Up to this point I realized she wasn't really in the mood to talk and wouldn't budge, so I kind of stepped away from trying to make conversation and enjoyed the music. This is when I started to be on my phone sometimes. I would show her things I found funny to me to see if maybe I could get some conversation out of it, but to no avail. She didn't really try to make conversation with me and I got worried, I asked if she was okay and she said yes. We ended our night early. When I got home she sent me a message telling me she didn't like going out with people who are on their phones all the time, I apologized and told her that she didn't really look like she wanted to talk and it's not that I didn't try to make conversation. 

She's still mad and I'm now having second thoughts about if I should've tried more to talk to her. Am I the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I've been close friends with this girl who we'll call Sarah for over five years. Sarah has always been conventionally pretty, and it's always been something I have been bitter about, but hasn't really stopped us being friends. I'm quite insecure about my looks, as I am opposite of Sarah, as in I am conventionally unattractive. I've always had bad self esteem issues, which Sarah knows about, despite her trying to tell me that I'm pretty, I know I'm not. 

Recently, Sarah did what I thought was impossible. She became even prettier. I can't pinpoint exactly what has changed, (maybe her makeup or maybe just growing more into her looks) but whatever it is, Sarah is even more pretty.

Now, my self esteem has lowered even more, and its hard to be around her, especially in public, when I see people looking so admiringly at her, and the opposite at me. So WIBTA if I told her I wanted to stop being friends, if continuing being friends hurts me mentally?"	Asshole	0	0
c7gnt0	2019-06-30 16:49:26	stressedbride_burner	AITA for excluding my former best friend from my bachelorette party?	"So I (25F) am getting married this October. Choosing my wedding party was tough because I had 3 really close friends growing up. One of them (Caty), was basically my best friend all throughout school. Caty, me, and our friend Lauren did everything together in high school. Later on, we became really close with Lauren's friend Anna as well. Caty and I were still close in college, but since then we've sort of drifted apart since we both went to grad school in different states. I see Lauren and Anna more frequently because they live close to me, but I don’t see Caty outside of planned get togethers. As a result, when I got engaged last fall, I asked Lauren and Anna to be in the wedding (Lauren’s the MOH), but I didn't ask Caty.

I didn't really think anything of it, but a couple months later, Lauren asked me if I'd talked to Caty. I said I hadn't and Lauren (gently) said that I should at least reach out to Caty since no one really understood why I’d excluded her from the bridal party. So I called Caty, we talked and she seemed really understanding about the wedding party. I also told Caty that she was really the only non-bridal party friend I wanted at the bachelorette party, but explained that I was afraid of drama with my cousin if I opened it up beyond the bridal party (my cousin’s a drama queen). It was easier to just say “bridal party only.” Caty said that if I wanted her to be there, she would love to come and I told her I hadn’t decided yet but I’d tell her when I did.

The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I didn't want Caty to feel more left out because she would be the only one in the bachelorette party who wasn’t in the wedding. So I told Lauren to go ahead planning the bachelorette party and to keep it wedding-party only. The thing is...I never actually told Caty I decided not to invite her.

So yesterday was my bridal shower and Caty, Anna and Lauren were all there. Later that night, we were hanging out at Lauren's house and Anna started talking about the bachelorette party. I guess she didn't know that Caty wasn't invited and assumed Caty was invited and going. Lauren was looking at me kind of panicked, but I didn't want to call attention to it and make it more awkward, so Anna kept talking about how much fun the bachelorette party was going to be. Caty didn't say anything, but eventually, she excused herself and when she came back, her eyes were really red. Still, she didn’t bring it up when she drove me home later so I figured she was probably fine.

So: AITA for not inviting her to the bachelorette party, and not telling her that she wasn't invited? I figured if she was there it would just be extra awkward because she'd be the only one not in the bridal party. But Caty didn't do anything wrong and I feel bad that she had to find out because Anna brought it up.

Edit: wow, ok, I get it. ITA. I can be pretty oblivious and I honestly didn’t think we were close anymore so I didn’t think she would care (also, with my cousin - I was at her bachelorette party so I wanted to be able to draw a clean line for why I wasn't opening up the bachelorette party, but other than that, i have no defense. I just hate confrontation). Clearly, though, I hurt her a lot more deeply than I thought. I’m going to call Caty tonight and apologize. I’d do it face to face, but I live in Virginia and she lives on the West Coast, so it’ll have to be by phone."	Asshole	0	0
c7gmta	2019-06-30 16:46:56	ThrowAwayAcc73849	AITA for calling child protection services for a granny next door who leaves her infant in the hallway because she is tired because of her?	"I came from doing some groceries and saw that the baby was in her cart in the hallway. I saw the granny walking upstairs and I figured, she’s probably just putting the groceries upstairs and she’ll come down later to pick her up again. Later the delivery guy rang my door bell to deliver a package. The delivery man also heard a baby crying and asked me if it was mine.. He was actually triggered by a baby’s crying. She was sitting in her baby car and crying really loud. She is not yet two years old. So I took her upstairs and figured the lady was old and forgotten it. She replied to me “damn it, is she already awake.. I can never get some rest. Can you bring her upstairs?” I don’t know what happened, but I believe my blood starting boiling as soon as I heard that.

So I got into touch with her daughter (mother of the baby) later when she came to pick her up. She told me literally this “Oh really? Well she does cry a lot, I can understand that”. I lost my shit twice that day and I replied “you should not treat her like that, what if someone kidnaps her?”. Only silence followed. I went back inside and the next day I called child services. I felt it was the right thing to do. She said the police shouldn’t be involved, since I didn’t see any injury.

A few days later the old granny, came knocking at my door. Very angry and shouting some slurs that I could understand from her native language. She told me something like “fucking idiot”. Later I got a text from her daughter as well telling me that I should mind my own goddamn business. Now I have a pissed off hood  (80% some ethnic group) because I called child protection services for that one lady. 

Did I do something wrong?

Cast:
Me=me, best friend=bff, party throwing friend=ptf, party throwing friend's sister and her sister's boyfriend= s&sbf

Background:
Most of our friend group and was in college about an hour from our hometown. Ptf was in our group mostly because she'd known bff for years and they were friends. I have known ptf longer than anyone in the group and due to multiple instances of her being rude to me we are not close friends. Bff likes her though and ptf doesnt have a lot of other friends, so I'm nice to her and try to include ptf in stuff we do. Also, ptf doesnt drive and isn't in college with us so she lives in hometown with her family. That means anytime we include her we have to go get her or go to her. Ptf also has everything paid for by her parents because she doesn't work, so she doesnt always understand when we have to be more frugal. 


On to the business at hand:
It's christmas time. We all don't have a lot of money, so we wanted to each get only one person in the group a bigger gift they'd really want than everyone get small gifts from each person. Ptf says she wants to have a Christmas party. We don't really want to, but ptf is pretty insistent, so we agree. We decide to do the gift exchange there. We set a rule $20-$30 for the gift (I know its not a lot, but like I said money was tight). Then we were going to draw who was buying which gift.

Ptf says shes also inviting her s&sbf, and she'd put their names in the drawing too. My friends and I other than bff dont know s&sbf more than a hello or two when visting ptf in the past. I asked ptf if we could not include them in the gift exchange, because we didn't have much money and we really wanted the gift to be something thought out and we'd really appreciate. Since we didnt know s&sbf and they didn't know us that likely wouldnt happen if we chose them or vice versa. On top of that I really didnt want to spend money on a person I barely know tbh. 

Ptf is upset and says no, that s&sbf would be upset if they were at a party where everyone was getting gifts but them. Then I suggested not inviting them to avoid that issue. Ptf loses her mind cursing me out and throwing a fit. S&sbf live at ptf's parents' house too so she cant just not invite them. We've been there before with them before and they never seemed to particularly care about being around us. I've known ptf for years and have never exchanged more than a couple sentences with s&sbf. According to ptf, they don't have many friends and would want to get gifts for Christmas too. We aren't planning this party for Christmas day, so its not like they're missing out on Christmas with their family. The family isn't lacking in money and ptf frequently mentioned how they always spends a lot on things for the two girls (especially the sister) so I never thought they'd care about some random gifts from ptf's friends.

Me and her talked frequently though it was evident from the day I met her we were politically at odds. She'd leave class quite a lot which I later found out was due to her receiving phone calls from her lawyer as she'd previously been arrested due to spitting on a cop during a protest, though I know she's been withholding details. Not my business personally, but it says a lot about her and the lengths she'll go to.  

Recently she's posted alarming things to her social media, a lot of vague messages about spilling some blood and rallying comrades and things of that nature. She sent a video to another one of my friends showing her hammering nails into a wooden baseball bat while expressing some very strong views, before she took the bat outside and smashed a watermelon with it. This was posted to a private group chat I'm told. Point is, it's started to escalate recently and with recent events I feel inclined to report her because of what she's done in the past and she does have friends who are violent felons who might join her in whatever she decides to do. Me and her still talk alot and sometimes get into arguments and she can be a good friend but I can't stay idly by while she posts threats. Would I be the asshole by alerting local authorities? I don't want to see her arrested if she does decide to do something worse."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Nieces (22 and 24) were teens and nephew (16) was pretty young. They were not abusive, they just caught some of the fallout when I went no contact. We all reconciled last year as my mother is terminally ill. I speak to my mother regularly through text. Nieces and nephew all have my number and are FB friends.

Youngest niece was pregnant when we reconciled. I spent quite a bit of money, hundreds, on a bunch of clothes, supplies, etc before baby was born as niece is not well off. On more than one occasion, I sent her money for needed baby items. All I asked is that she send me pics of baby. I know she sends my mom daily pics so I didn't think this was a big deal. I get no pics. I sent both nieces and my nephew large sums of money for their birthdays and had the same ready for Christmas. 

I did not do this to buy their attention. I did it because I love them and know they are worse off than I am, But I hear nothing from them. They don't text, they don't message on FB. Nothing. I have reached out a few times but get one word answers. I got tired of it. Christmas came and we were not able to get together so I just said screw it and did not bother mailing their gifts. Their birthdays are in July and I'm just not giving them anything. My older niece messaged me last week, after not hearing from her for months, to tell me she's pregnant and I can't help but think she's telling me because of what I spent on her sister's baby.

It's been put to me that I'm being unfair and that I shouldn't cut them off because I 'owe' them from going no contact before. Am I the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7ggrv	2019-06-30 16:31:43	rock_grl	AITA for shorting the tip because I felt like I was intentionally overcharged?	"At a Mexican restaurant for lunch. The menu is book style, and had several pages. One of which was their “lunch menu”. (It was not a loose insert). My husband orders the “lunch fajitas” (he said exactly that to the waitress). They were 9.95 on the lunch menu. 

We get the bill and we were charged 16.99. When we point this out for the cashier to adjust, she points out the VERY small writing that says the lunch menu is only valid M-F at certain times (we were there Saturday). I’m visibly annoyed but I pay the amount and tell her that they should not put a menu out on the weekends for prices that aren’t available. My husband even said he wanted the “lunch fajitas” and she should have pointed it out that the lunch prices were only available during the week.

I’m generally a good tipper (20% and usually regardless of service). However, this time, BECAUSE my husband was specific about ordering the “lunch fajitas” and she never said anything, AND the writing was so small about the weekday limits, I tipped her $5 on a $60 bill (about 8%). Am I the asshole for shorting her since it’s the restaurants fault for the menu but it was her fault she didn’t tell us?

Edit: for clarification, we were there for lunch. We weren’t trying to order special priced lunch items at dinner. Also, it was labeled “lunch menu” and didn’t say “lunch specials” or anything else to make it obvious it was special pricing. BOTH my husband and I missed the disclaimer because of how it was placed and size. It was about a 10 font (if that). The menu was super colorful and the contrast of the font made it even more difficult to see.

Edit 2: I just asked my husband if he pointed to the lunch menu when asking for the fajitas and no joke, he did. He pointed to the lunch fajitas, said “lunch fajitas” and he was not informed that the price wouldn’t be valid."	Asshole	0	0

c7gfie	2019-06-30 16:28:34	throwaway63019	AITA For being in a relationship with my stepsister?	"My stepsister and I have been dating for around two and a half years. For the most part we try to act pretty casually about it and try not to bring up the fact we're step-siblings to people who know we're dating. We don't actively hide it like it's something to be ashamed of, but we don't bring it up either.

Our parents didn't know for a while, we just never got around to telling them to prevent it from feeling awkward. However, they finally found out around a month ago and they were PISSED. We tried as hard as possible to be calm and  understanding, and assured them we weren't doing anything irresponsible and that our relationship is perfectly healthy.

However, they just weren't having any of it, and continued to be furious with us, and made claims about how our relationship was everything from incestuous to irresponsible to destructive, etc. We left after that point and our relationship with our parents has been really strained since.

Nothing about our relationsip is unhealthy or like some kinda porno sibling fantasy. We were both over eighteen when we started dating. There wasn't any manipulation or coercion involved. We're best friends who genuinely love each other, and we consider ourselves partners in life. And again, we are STEP-siblings.

We really tried to be understanding of our parent's fears and worries, and tried to calmly explain why everything is okay and that we're both fine and happy, but nothing we did got through to them. We talked to some of our friends about it and they said that while they don't think our relationship is a problem, its unreasonable for us to think it could ever be okay for our parents.

Again, I get that it might feel weird and all, but its our lives to live and there's nothing wrong with what we're doing and we're both happy. I could understand being mad about us not telling them for so long, but that's not at all why they're mad us. Are we really the assholes for (patiently I might add) expecting our parents to accept our relationship?

EDIT: She's only a year older than me, our parents got together when I was ten. We felt more like best friends than siblings growing up and we even waited until we were both eighteen to start seriously dating to make it feel less weird."	No A-holes here	0	0

I have met Leo before but I would not say we know each other well. When we arrived, it turned out it was us (me, Kay, Kay's roommate CJ) and Leo's wife (Cindy)'s family. Parents, siblings, spouses, little kids, uncles. We felt a little out of place but tried to be sociable and meet everyone and make small talk. We weren't like ripped out of our minds, but me Kay and CJ had all taken some edibles (weed - legal here) before coming over. 

Eventually we were sitting on chairs around a little table next to the pool and Cindy's family were sitting on the other side of the patio around another table. I didn't sense anything out of the ordinary / awkward about this. Leo came over and put down some BBQ chicken on the table in front of us and told us to eat. Soon after, Cindy's dad came over and apologized for not introducing himself, and then made some extremely passive aggressive comments about us eating before them. I immediately felt badly, I didn't mean to offend them at all and I just didn't know. I was high so I didn't really think before eating, but the host (Leo) brought it over and told us to eat and that more was coming, so I assumed it was OK. 

Afterwards, when cleanup was happening we (me, Kay and CJ) tried to jump in where possible to help out and the mom made a comment about how she was surprised we would help. The mom and dad were so not pleased with us but everyone else seemed OK I think? I'm not sure and now I am curious about what was the objectively right move here. 

The parents were asian and older so I don't know if this is a cultural thing or if I am a boorish peasant regardless of culture.

He didn't have his own car and had to be driven everywhere, he had a drinking problem, and he would constantly lash out at her and take out his anger on her. It was an ugly break up and not long after that, my friend would constantly talk about how she wants a relationship with a guy who ""has his life together"" and she went into specifics. She said that she wants a guy who has stable job, lives on his own, doesn't drink or do drugs, and actually has the means to drive himself.

Well, in November she met this one guy and they really rushed into dating. They agreed to be exclusive after just two dates and I eventually learned about what type of guy he was: He had recently gotten out of jail for his third DUI, his driver's license was revoked, he doesn't have a job, and he's living with his mom. When she told me about him, my first response was ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" She had been bugging me nonstop about finding a guy whose life is together, only to date some loser. And the worst part is that she told me that she's dating him because she thinks he's hot and likes his tattoos. I was upset with her over this, but I was even more upset with her when they got engaged just three months later. He proposed to her on Valentine's Day, she said yes, and they got married just a few weeks after that. Then she ended up getting pregnant later in March and she got pissed off at me when I told her that they were really rushing too quickly into things.

We stopped talking after she found out that she was pregnant, but she just contacted me and was crying about how her husband had been arrested for ANOTHER DUI and this time it was looking like he was going to jail for a LONG time. She was venting to me about how she regrets getting with him and she kept telling me that she didn't know what to do. And as my title suggests, I merely said to her ""I told you not to be with him. Now you have to suffer the consequences"" and I hung up on her. There actually is a small part of me that feels like I shouldn't have said that, but she really pissed me off when she got with this guy, especially since she had previously rejected a really nice guy who did have his life together in a way that she described, only she rejected him because ""his forehead is too big""."

c7g9kg	2019-06-30 16:13:11	Sushisweetsy64	WIBTA For Confronting My Friend About Wanting To Get Back With His Toxic Ex?	"So my friend dated this guy for a while. They were long distance. The age difference is a little over 4 years, he was 18 and my friend was 14. When they started dating he was already 18, and my friend was still 13. I thought that the age difference was way too much, but he begged to differ. They seemed fine at first, but then after a while he started showing his true colors. 

They broke up the first time because he cheated. He begged to come back to my friend, my friend took him back. They were fine. 

Now, they had met for the first time irl at a furry con. That went well until I heard he was trying to push my friend to have sex with him. No way. You’re 18 and he’s 14? That’s not gonna happen... 

Then they broke up again because he started being toxic and disrespectful. After about 2 weeks they got back together. It wasn’t any good after that and eventually my friend broke up with him and blocked him for good. 

I talk to his ex occasionally but mostly it’s about art commissions and normal “hi how are ya” kind of stuff. I know both sides of the story but both of them clash with each other. For example my friend said he tried to push him into sexual intercourse, while the ex says it never happened. 

Now, fast forward to yesterday when his ex sent me a text screenshot of my friend saying they’d want to start fresh with him and try their relationship again. I get it, people can change, but my friend constantly trashed them, called them names, called them a (person who likes underage people), and said they were constantly toxic. Why would you want to do that then?! Getting back with them will most likely only hurt you. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that my friend is either desperate for a partner, or is a complete masochist. These two have boomeranged this relationship over 5 times in the past. Move on already. It hasn’t done you any good. 

I know I shouldn’t be “controlling” what my friend does, as it may not be my place, and I definitely shouldn’t be making his decisions for him, but I don’t want to see him get hurt again. Sure they may really have feelings for each other but their relationship was beyond toxic, and I feel I should do something. 

Tl;dr: My friend wants to get back with his toxic ex, even after all they’ve did, and I’m kinda peeved about it. 

Would I be the asshole for confronting my friend and telling him not to do it? Even if they maybe do both care about each other?

EDIT: Since basically a year’s gone by, my friend is now 15 and the ex is now 19. Soon turning 20."	Not enough info	0	0
c7g8pq	2019-06-30 16:10:55		AITA for refusing to give my family's bird away?	"I(24F) live at home with my mom and siblings. My mom and step-dad separated about a year ago after 14 years of a toxic marriage. My step-dad is a narcissistic POS; he had severe anger issues and controlled all aspects of our lives because he was the breadwinner, and went to great lengths to keep my mom from working or gaining financial independence. She started working again a few years ago, step-dad lost his job because of a work tantrum, and my mom finally decided it was time to part ways (which he blamed on his unemployment). My youngest sibling is a teenager so they still have to remain amicable, but SD has decided he wants to cut down on his costs by selling the family home. He is in no way strapped for cash and only pays a small fee towards his child and about 1/6 of the mortgage, and lives in a great new apartment.

Looking beyond my potential homelessness (my mom and younger siblings could find somewhere to live together) we have pets. Small dogs and a veeeery big dog, as well as a parrot, all bought, independently, by my step-dad. He has a history of adopting pets that he neglects; we had to rehome an African Grey years ago because we moved to a new country, but, by the time we rehomed him, he was volatile and bit everyone.

If my family moves, they can take the small dogs, but the bird and big dog will need rehoming. My parrot has the potential life span of 80 years and is only 7, and I love him very, very much. The big dog is 10 and I don't think it would be easy to find a new home for her. I don't feel I give any of these animals enough love and attention because of my own schedule, and, unfortunately, my mom and I are the only ones my bird has bonded with (the small dogs get on well with everyone). My step-dad is being flippant about rehoming our bird and dog, insisting I don't give our bird enough attention and that there is a very good bird park near our house that I could pay to visit.

A huge part of me is livid at the fact that this man essentially burdened me with a baby for the next 70 years of my life, but I can't bear to give my bird away to strangers and never see him again. I also believe that, without the bird in the way, the next step my SD will take will be insisting we put down the big dog (her breed only lives to 12 at max and she has had health problems). He is only talking to my mom about this because he knows I'll flip my shit, and every time he visits the house he intentionally avoids the pets like he's desensitising himself to them. He's made comments to my mom about me not wanting the home to be sold because then I'll have to move out and that I am being selfish by not giving my bird to a bird park where he will get more attention.

I feel I may be blinded by my feelings, My bird is loved and happy, and my mom and I are always looking for ways to improve his quality of life and integrate him into the household, even when he is in his cage. AITA for not giving him up?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c7g7vq	2019-06-30 16:08:43	asswredfgw	AITA for storming out of a social event and quitting my job?	"Apologies if this makes little sense, as I've had a pretty rough month and my head's all over the place at the moment.

On Thursday, I quit my job on the spot after being treated like absolute shit for weeks. I had the job since January, but 3 weeks ago, a new manager was hired who absolutely fucking hated me, for no discernable reason. She cancelled my holidays that I had signed off since March, bullied me in front of customers and coworkers, and threatened to fire me, amongst other things, when we were on our own.

I reported her to HR after the first week of her being here, which nothing came of, nor did I even have a response. The final straw came on Thursday, after she said something to me that I won't repeat here, leading me to quit on the spot (never done this before, and I've always had a job since high school)

Completely deflated and upset, I was invited out by some friends to a BBQ Saturday night. I figured hey, seeing some friends might cheer me up a bit. I go to the gathering and have a good time, until I mention what happened with my work.

When I told one ""friend"" I resigned on the spot, they were completely shocked and told me what a shitty thing it is to do to quit like that, asking me ""how are you going to feed yourself now?"", that I shouldn't be so soft, and so on and so forth, despite me explaining to them why I left and the things that had occurred to me there. It turned my mood completely sour and made me feel even shittier than before.

Overhearing our conversation, two more people listened to what I had to say and were visibly shocked at what I was telling them about my job. However, they didn't really have a chance to talk to me, as my ""friend"" was going on about how being unemployed is shameful (I've been unemployed for a grand total of one working day so far).

At this point, I'm even more upset, angry, and honestly just sad. Mid sentence, I walk away from the conversation and leave without speaking to anyone. 

I haven't spoken to any of them since, despite having about 10 missed calls from people at the event, none of which I have responded to yet.

So, am I the asshole for storming out like that, and/or quitting my job?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7g6hz	2019-06-30 16:05:06	real-WAXOE	"WIBTA if I make the friend I fully support (financially) stop dating ""random"" guys?"	"So a bit of back story - I've been friends with this girl for about 7 years. She recently graduated from college but since her parents are divorce and neither parent can really support her at all, she was jumping couch to couch and did not have her feet on the ground AT ALL. She was going to end up homeless, so since I have an extra bedroom in my apartment I offered her a place to stay & feel stable until she finds a job and is able to move out.

I kinda have had feelings for her in the past, but i don't anymore since I got shot down hard. 
I have been completely abstaining from any social life for the past 7 months for a couple of reasons, so helping her get on her feet & me actually going to work have been the only things I've been doing since she moved in.

Now, before she moved in I made it very clear that she needs to just settle in & slow down on life (she's been very promiscuous in the past). She decides to bring up on the first day she's here that she is planning to ""just get dinner"" with a guy. Needless to say they are no longer ""just getting dinner"", and worse than that - she's also talking to other guys as well. I have pleaded with her to just not date anyone - that this is where her misery in life comes from as every guy breaks her heart inevitably it seems. She is saying that I need to respect her personal life, and just let her do what she needs to do to feel good.

Needless to say, this is just hurting me in all kinds of ways because she is both doing things that will likely lead to her downfall again - and it's like reopening the wound of getting rejected and just reminding me that for whatever reason I wasn't - and clearly never will be no matter what I do - good enough for her.

It is extremely temping to put an ultimatum on her and say ""either you're going to stop sleeping around - or you'll go back to couch hopping and perhaps never get your life back on track""

Will I be the asshole?

Note: there are a lot of details missing from this but this is pretty much what the story comes down to

Edit: alright guys I'm not trying to get her on my dick - she's not exactly my type since polyamory is a sickening thing for me (that is my opinion: feel I need to clarify that its my opinion and not something I'm trying to bring on as fact)

Edit 2: I've decided I'm just going to pressure her a fuck ton to get a job and be able to support herself. I wanted her to be able to relax and take a step back while here, but unfortunately she didn't mention she NEEDS to be sleeping around to function or something like that. If I can get her to move out with a job then I will feel like as though I've achieved my goal, even if she's still absolutely destroying her personal life every night"	Asshole	0	0
c7g5z4	2019-06-30 16:03:50		AITA for wanting the money my mom was saving up for me but decided to keep for herself?	"Hello, I'll try to keep the backstory in chronological order from maybe 2005 to now. English isn't my first language so please excuse any grammatical errors.

When I was about 8yo my parents made a savings account for me (it was to my name, but they had all the rights to do whatever they wanted with it as well). Few years later they divorced, my brother and I stayed with our dad on our request. But the account remained as it was, both parent were contributing a small amount each month. There was a LOT of drama between our parents, and me and my parents for years. Fast forward to when I was about to turn 18, my mom and I didn't have the best relationship. She went to the bank and made herself the only owner of the said savings account, and still (only her from now on) contributed to it every month. Even tho she had every right to do so, it was originally, and for years, meant for me, on my name. I'm 22 now and we're finally cool with one another, and I actually have a great relationship with my mom.

Recently I asked her about the account and she told me she was afraid I'd just take all the money and blow it on useless crap so that's why she took away my rights to it before I turned 18. Fair enough, but as I said we're cool now and I'd like to use the money for buying my own apartment after I save up the rest. When I brought it up she basically said it's to her name therefore hers now, and she's planning to invest it in her own apartment when she finds one she likes.

I know the money legally is hers, but I feel betrayed that I won't get the money they were saving for me. Am I the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

It paid really well and I was asked to return at Christmas, so I did for a month. I study at University away from home so finding summer jobs each year is tough, this felt like a blessing to not have to consistently apply to tons of positions.

The staff weren't all that welcoming - sure, they small talked with me but it was obvious I didn't fit in to their well established team and they often spoke of work nights out where I wasn't invited. Kinda awkward.

I asked my manager in Feb for my job back as life happened and I ended up moving out my uni flat, meaning I was living back at home. After a week, they said there were no hours for me. This was just one month after I left.

Around 5 weeks ago, they contacted me and asked if I wanted to work summer again. I said yes, despite seeing their advertisement 2 weeks prior and feeling a bit miffed to feel like the last resort for them. Nonetheless, I was told they would call me back in 3 weeks with dates to start.

4 weeks went, and nothing. Suddenly I got a message saying my number was wrong. I knew it wasn't as they have called me before but gave them my nunber regardless, to which they said they'd call that day. They didn't.

I reached out to the manager 5 DAYS and asked when I would be on the rota, to which he responded by saying he would call me the following day. He didn't.

Today I got a message asking me to sign documents next weekend. This would mean I'd start 1 month after they were supposed to contact me, and didn't.

I had enough. I no longer wanted to work for a company where I didn't feel welcome and had to constantly go out my way for communication. I messaged the manager telling him I no longer wished to work for the company as I felt like a last resort and had waited weeks for communication. I thanked them for their time and have since muted them (I have no intention of reading any response).

Monday - Help mom from 7 AM - 12 PM, then go help grandparents until 4 PM.

Sunday - Either Reg job for 6-8 hours or helping family. 



I just want a break. I literally am not getting a single day where I can do absolutely nothing. I have some days off this week from my reg job so I asked my grandmother if she would mind me taking Monday off from helping her, and she went on this passive-aggressive rant about how she used to juggle two full-time jobs and how she’d go to sleep at 2 AM just to wake up for the next job at 6 AM every day. I realize that sounds awful and I’m sorry she had to go through it, but I don’t see how that justifies me not having time off lol. She said I could have the day off but keeps passive-aggressively calling me lazy and making me feel like crap for wanting a break. I am only wanting one day out of the week to lay around relaxing.

c7g3sh	2019-06-30 15:58:23	thejohnnygrey_666	AITA for asking my bf to tone his gayness down a bit for his own safety living in a country full of homophobic people?	"I recently posted something here and someone has pointed out something that kind of makes me question my well-meaning intention. 

Here's the link to my original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c7dti7/aita_for_telling_a_guy_of_because_he_accused_me/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So I am 25 male who has been in a relationship with this guy for 7 years now. I don't really relate to popular gay culture. So I don't enjoy things like cross-dressing.  I am not feminine etc. My bf on the other hand is the opposite of me. 

When we first met, he was (somewhat) openly gay. You could tell by how he behaved. He wore what you call flamboyant outfits and hanged out at underground gay bars, and places which were not exclusively gay but gay people love to hang out at. 

I found myself falling for him despite our differences. But his being gay has many times got us in trouble. We live in a small city where people are so religious in a country that is not widely/openly accepting of homosexuality. In short, being (openly) gay means you are prone to discriminations, harrassment, and even violence here. 

Because I cared about him, I told him to TONE IT DOWN a little. Especially in public places. He could be as gay as possible in the right places at the right time. He could be gay af without drawing too many unwanted attentions to himself. He was hesitant but he understood I meant him no disrespect. He knew I was right. I did not ask him to change who he was. I asked him to adjust to our harsh and homophobic society because that's the only way for gay people to accomodate living their lives in peace here. Or we can always start pack our things and move to the US. 

But apparently some of the commentators think I am the asshole for telling him to 'leave his normal-self behind' and to be 'more like me'. I did not ask him to change who or what he was. His true self was what made me fall in love with him. 
What I asked was solely based on my love for him. I wanted him to stay himself and be safe. And we gotta play smart here. It was not like us denying who we are, or me denying who he is, because society will never accept us. But it was about staying true to yourself in a smart way and being safe in a society where gay people are very often discriminated against, treated horribly and even denied of their basic human rights. 

Am I The Asshole?

EDIT : I was and am not in any way embarrassed of him. Don't get me wrong. If I had been, I would have said no when he asked for my number when we first met. I love him so much and want him to be safe that's all. I just want him to play smart, not change who he is for anybody, even me. I have never like forced him to do whatever he did not feel like having to do at all.

So my girlfriend lives with her parents and doesnt make a lot of money. I have an apartment so we end up spending almost all of our time here (4-5 days a week). Our issue is she is always eating my food. Currently she is unemployed and has little to no money. The other day we got into a big fight because I came upstairs and she was reheating some of my leftovers from lunch. I told her it was super rude to just help herself to my food. If she is hungry I cleared out a cupboard for her and she can bring over and cook anything she wants. I also live 5 mins from her parents so she can go home ans grab something to eat without paying a dime.


Well time and time again she comes over empty handed and empty bellied. When I go to eat she makes passive agressive comments about how shes starving and asking for some etc. I always tell her if she wants to pay half we can cook dinner together, but she says she is broke. So I ask why she didnt eat at her parents before she came over... and she just gets silent.

My boyfriend and I play D&D with Andy and a few of his other friends every Saturday evening. I think Andy is (or has been) a bit harder on my boyfriend than everyone else because he's a bit jealous - I've been friends with Andy for longer than I am in this relationship, and Andy can be a bit of an incel / niceguy if you know the type. Again, not the nicest of traits, but nothing I can't handle. It helps that Andy lives several hours away so if I do decide I'm sick of his bullshit that's a really easy line to draw. I've also not just allowed Andy to talk shit to or about my partner, he knows I don't tolerate that, so it's all just in the subtext.

Around the time we joined, Andy almost managed to tear the group apart by getting way into ""roleplaying"" a douchebag who hated all our other characters - even when it's ""just pretend"", nobody likes getting yelled at for 3h straight. I voiced my concerns and after we all discussed it, Andy decided to scrap his toxic character and created a much friendlier one.

Since then things have been much better and I'm having a lot of fun playing. My patience with Andy wears thin sometimes, but I usually still view his company as a net positive overall and I'm a big believer in second chances, I've needed my fair share of them myself.

Unfortunately, my boyfriend has always disliked Andy and this incident has cemented his verdict to ""certified asshole"". He wants us to cut ties with him (and by extension, the group we play with). I disagree, but I'm also not a very good judge of character and have been majorly stabbed in the back by a supposed friend before. But I feel very uneasy about being told who I can or can't be friends with.

I told my boyfriend that if he really can't stand Andy then he should bow out of the group, it's at a really awkward time slot for him anyways and it's not like we don't spend enough quality time with each other. He blew up on me and proceeded to be a major dick for a while since apparently I like assholes.

&#x200B;

We have a babysitter who is overall great with our kids, and has kids of their own in the same age range as our kids.  My only complaint is sometimes they do not watch the kids as closely as I would, and often times allow horseplay i would never allow.

&#x200B;

Got a call from them earlier, complaining that my 4yo broke the zipper on their tent.  Evidently the zipper got stuck and he tried to force it and it came off the track, leaving it unable to zip anymore.  I do not have the entire story, but the from the details I have it sounds like they were not watching him closely, and after a few minutes of trying to play with zipping it up, the thing broke.  

&#x200B;

Normally I would replace it in a heartbeat, except it sounds like my son was not told to stay away from the tent, or not to play with it.  I am all for replacing things that my son breaks because of him not listening, or if something breaks too fast for any adult to intervene.  However from the details I have, it sounds like he was just left to his own devices and did not know he was going to hurt the tent.

Sometime ago I started wearing  a Christian rosary necklace, it makes me feel grounded and connected, but also because I really dig the aesthetic. But I can't help wondering if this might be appropriation. Also, in my home there are some little Buddha figures at my shrine.. Is it wrong to mix religions like that?

c7g0p6	2019-06-30 15:50:38	Milkcartonbrothers	WIBTA if I told my ex's friend he saved bikini picture of her on his phone	"Okay so backstory is that my now ex bf had/has a thing for his friend since before we were together and throughout our relationship. I moved halfway across the country to be with him in a new, shitty, city. It has been a struggle in every single way. I now have a job and friends that respect and appreciate me, but it took 2 years.   

After living together about 6 months he, John, changed or we changed. I always disliked this one friend, an old flame well call her Dawn. Dawn broke his heart years before I met him. They have many common interests and reconnected as friends. Their relationship was flirty, she would snap him at mignight and i asked him to have her stop since he has a serious gf... This was 3 months in. We move together 6 months into the relationship. About  10 months in John is letting his porn addiction spread to saving suggestive pictures of his friends on his ig. I found this by snooping. Yes bad but they confirmed my suspicions and made the youre crazy response now bullshit.   

I confronted John, cried for days, left for home for a week, but returned because i loved him. Thought this was the lowest point and only up, plus my home is my parents house and my dad is not so nice to me.

John stops the communication with Dawn for a while, but it starts up again. So then he lies again about her, so I then message her and tell her to back off. Dawn does stop communicating with him and he just throws in my face that im too insecure for him to have friends...

He has talked shit about me to her and has said i am selfish and all this. Does not, ofc, say i saw bikini pic of her save to his ig and i do have a reason to want him to distance hinself. to protect our relationship and my sanity bc he loved me and wants me.  But he doesnt and didnt.

I want to know would i be the asshole for telling his friend that he was a perv and i had a reason to insert myself and insist that they put up boundaries on their relationship. I am tired of being seen as crazy and being gas lite is one thing, there was verbal abuse from him over slightest fuck ups on my part, but to have it be given to others is another.

c7g0n2	2019-06-30 15:50:28		WIBTA if I don’t “fight” for my relationship?	"Super long and on mobile so sorry if the format looks weird.

TL;DR: bf and I want to make long distance relationship work. Trust and communication issues making it hard for him to move on with the relationship and trust me. I want him to be happy even if it’s not with me but he thinks it’s me giving up on the relationship.

My bf (24M) and I (23F) are currently on a break. We’re also long distance so things are a bit more difficult. We’ve had ongoing issues with trust and communication due to past mistakes from both parties. I am trying incredibly hard to move past what he’s done to me because I truly love him and would love nothing more to close the distance. He hooked up with his ex in the beginning of our relationship which made me distrustful and paranoid. However, he’s having a hard time moving on from me seeing a guy shortly during one of our many breaks. 

Our arguments are pretty much the same: “I don’t know if I’ll be able to move on from this.” I completely understand where he’s coming from as I’ve been in a relationship like this before and it turned out horribly. My ex and I stayed together while resenting each other. 

Every time he’s brought up breaking up, I always say something along the lines of “I’m not going to force you to stay with me if this doesn’t make you happy.” But he always takes it as me not fighting for the relationship. I get we can’t predict the future but from how he frames it I really don’t see his feelings changing. I want to fight for it but at the same time it’s tiring looking like the one who’s unaffected by everything that’s happened. I get paranoid and self conscious too. I just try to suppress it or reassure myself that it won’t happen again. 

Maybe it’s my fear of rejection and being hurt further but I don’t believe in forcing people to stay with me or love me if there’s a huge possibility that they will only come to resent me more. Would I be the asshole if he comes back and says he doesn’t know what he wants to do, and I say, “let’s end this if you’re not going to be happy with me?”"		1	0

In past 6 months, my mental health has declined down to a point where I can barely make it out of my room. And it's been long since I have actually met people. I always met people less but I was a good guy to be around. Everyone of my very good High School friends are home this summer and they have been texting me asking to meet. I always stall their proposal with an excuse. They're good friends but none of them really understand what's happening to me. My brother from another mother who is a flight away from me knows my problem and understands me. He says that I'll lose everyone this way and he's right. I am lonely, still. Just. Don't know if I should push myself to meet them and suffer quite a heavy anxiety. But at the same time, if I were them, I would feel ignored too. It's not the biggest problem in my life but a fairly underrated one.	No A-holes here	1	0
c7fzi7	2019-06-30 15:47:30	CitizenCue	WIBTA if I asked my cousin to pay for all of a vacation house I rented?	"My extended family is going on vacation this summer and they rented a large house for everyone to share.  My wife and I weren’t sure we could attend so we didn’t reserve a room in the house, and instead told everyone we would rent a separate small house nearby if our work schedules permitted us to come.  Sure enough, our schedules opened up so we grabbed one of the last available homes in the resort area, although it cost us about three times more than each room cost in the main house.   

Shortly after, my cousin told me that she realized that her family of four would probably struggle to all stay in one bedroom in the main house so she was wondering if we could swap accommodations.  That would allow us to stay in the main house (which would be easier and more fun) and they would have much more space in the separate house.  

We’re happy to do this, but while I think they should pay the difference in price, my wife thinks we should just swap evenly with them since we were already planning to pay the larger amount, and it works out better for everyone.

c7fze8	2019-06-30 15:47:10	throwaway345345216	AITA for not telling one night stands that I'm in an open relationship?	"I had a paragraph of background information on the relationship and how it came to be open but I realized that's irrelevant to the question. The one relevant fact I'll keep is that my partner and I don't live together, in fact, we're currently 6000 miles apart. If anyone needs more info on that front to make a judgment, just ask and I'll reply and answer.

To make it simple, I'm in an open relationship. When I'm out at clubs and I vibe with someone and decide I'd be interested in hooking up with them there's kind of a flow some people might be familiar with where you're both feeling the other person out, and then eventually you both just kinda air it out and say ""yeah, this is gonna happen."" As part of this flow, I am ALWAYS super explicit that it will be one night only, no strings attached. Some people don't feel as good about casual sex if it's explicit that's all it will be, and those people bail.

I have fun with the people who are cool with it, and I've never had a problem. Occasionally, I'll get asked for my number or to hang out the morning after. I have a canned response that's something along the lines of: ""I think you're \[insert compliment tailored to specific person here\], but I'm really just not looking for anything beyond what we already did."" Nobody has ever had a problem with it, because when I say I'm super explicit about my intentions before anything happens, I mean REALLY explicit.

From my POV, I'm doing my due diligence informing people that I will 100% not be interested in anything beyond a ONS, and the reasons why are irrelevant to their choice to sleep with me or not. I'm really close with my step-siblings, and we talk about shit like this. They said they wouldn't flat out tell me it was wrong, but that they thought it was dubious. 

I value their opinions, so that left enough doubt that I'm here to see what you all think? AITA?

c7fzb5	2019-06-30 15:46:56	0TylerDurden0	AITA for saying 'no' when a man asks to sit at our table?	"I guess this is more are 'we' the assholes.

I went to a pub to have a drink with a friend of mine, to catch up and discuss some ongoing issues in his life. I hadn't seen him for a while as he had taken indefinite leave from work due to mental health issues. He smokes, so we decided to sit in the beer garden with our drinks to chat. This beer garden has about 5 picnic tables, which could sit about 6 people on each. It was the middle of the day, so it wasn't particularly busy and we were sitting in the corner. 3 of the other tables were occupied but not full (similar to ours).

As my friend an I are speaking, a guy comes out of the pub carrying a drink and asks to sit on the same table as us. My friend said, verbatim, ""sorry, would it be possible to not as we're having a difficult conversation."" The guy looked taken aback but he walked away and sat on the table next to us where two guys were sitting. Honestly, I didn't really care if he sat with us or not but seeing as my friend was the one talking to me about personal issues, I understand why he didn't want him to. I also think, as other tables were free, it wasn't a huge issue and he did ask.

Fast forward about 5 minutes and one of the guys from the table that the man eventually ended up sitting on came over to the table and asked us if we had told the guy he couldn't sit with us. I explained the situation, that the guy asked us and we said if possible, could he sit somewhere else or on one of the vacant tables, as we're having a private conversation. He asked if we owned the table and began shouting at us and I shouted back, that he was being a twat and if the guy had an issue he could have said it in the moment rather then getting a stranger to defend him. The guy now at our table then insisted he wouldn't move and began to talk over us so we couldn't hear each other. An older man on one of the nearby tables gave him a thumbs up, as if to confirm his attitude/behaviour. We did eventually speak to the guys and deescalated the situation but AITA for asking him to sit elsewhere?

ETA: In case I've used the term 'beer garden' incorrectly. It's just an outdoor space for a pub with tables. The one we were in had tables like this:

c7fyqa	2019-06-30 15:45:21		AITA for chasing a potentially dangerous dream at the behest of my distant family?	"I (28M) have a somewhat specific problem that requires some outside perspective. I have never been very close to my family until the past two years. In my teens and early twenties I did a lot of acting out that would later be attributed to a cluster B personality disorder. I was diagnosed after being kicked out and sort of ‘othered’ as I would call it. Very little contact with my parents and sister, wasn’t invited to a lot of stuff, months without talking.

In this time period I decided to pursue a different career as I wasn’t happy with what I was doing but still supporting myself and working hard. I’ve always been interested in world events and more specifically  by conflict and frontline media. I decided to orient my life with the goal in mind of becoming a frontline journalist. I went back to school on my own dime, got in better physical shape, started saving a lot of money, became well practiced in camera work and started taking my mental health/treatment more seriously. Eventually I started covering riots (if you can recall any race related riots/protests in the past five years - I was probably there.) I sold pictures and articles to newspapers and quite a few online publications and maintain a pretty unique social media presence. Soon I want to cover conflict zones abroad.

Only recently did my family step back into the picture and now they’re incredibly critical of it. My parents say that I don’t value my life (though to be honest I can say this is the first time I’ve ever felt purpose or even happiness) and my sister says I’m selfish for chasing something that could leave me hurt or worse. I’m well aware of all of the problems media workers face in regards to safety and what they can be exposed to. I feel like they don’t get much say in my career choice as they didn’t want much to do with me when I started working toward these goals. Am I missing something? AITA?"		1	0

At about 1:30 AM, we are trying to sleep, the music, bass, screaming and yelling could be heard in the bedroom on the opposite side of the house.

I checked our noise ordinances, after 11 PM on weekends, you aren't to have noise loud enough that it disturbs your neighbors (meaning, if you can hear it loudly on other's property).

It passes 2 AM, they are still going. We walked out on the deck to see if they were maybe wrapping up, because no one could sleep anyway. We hear them laugh-yelling about how the cops were called, and the party next door (it was like a 3 house block party) shouted over and said, laughing, how the cops were called on them too. We called the police back and told them the noise did not abate. It broke up about 20 minutes later.

I'm still mad and I slept terribly, but I also wonder if it wasn't the right thing to do, after reading around online and seeing I might be ""that guy"". Apparently the right thing to do is to go over and ask them to stop? We don't know these people personally at all, there were a lot of them, and they were very drunk, we did not feel safe approaching them. Also noting, we did not call the emergency number. It's a very safe area so the cops aren't trigger happy, nor would it be normal for them to be busy with a violent crime. If I was still living in the city, I wouldn't have called.

We are on a family vacation at the moment and we had gone to a park where there were a lot of young families like my own. My 4 year old son has a new bike that he loves to ride around on and there was another family close by us that had also settled for a picnic like we had on the grass. They were pretty close by. 

My son is obsessed with his bike and loves it. He had been playing on it for a while, and the other family had a little girl his age that kept looking over. 

When we sat down to eat my son sat with me, the little girl came over and shyly asked my mom if she could play with the bike. My mom always says yes to everything, and she has this really blasé attitude towards belongings and she’s lost some of my sons stuff before that way because she just isn’t attached to material things.

I interrupted before my mom could speak and really gently told the little girl ‘why don’t you ask (my son) since it’s his bike?’ She did and my son said no. She looked a little crestfallen but went back to her family and she didn’t seem bothered afterwards. 

My entire family looked at my like I was an evil witch and even my own husbands facial expression was surprised at me.

I've been with my wife for over 20 years, we have an amazing child who is 2, we had him after many failed attempts at IVF. I love my wife dearly and I adore and love my little boy.

We are not by any means a wealthy couple although I earn just enough so my wife can be a stay home mom.

The whole pregnancy and birth of my son was pretty traumatic, my wife came close to dying twice.

Last year my wife told me that she wanted another baby, I was opposed to this for both health and financial reasons.

Also we live in a ""not very nice"" high crime area, I wish to move to provide a better environment for my son.

After some arguments and persuasion from my wife I agreed to have one more attempt at IVF, But we both agreed it would be our last attempt.

2 weeks ago we had the great news that we where having a baby, a week after that as part of the post transfer process we had another scan that advised that my wife had miscarried.

We are both still very numb from this news, but I've found out that my wife has contacted the IVF clinic to discuss going through the process again.

She has also discussed this with close friends, but not me.

I'm pretty upset about this and feel very betrayed.

Time passes and I decide to order ihop, I tell him not once but TWICE that I was ordering food and he proceeded to leave to get something at Walmart, when he comes back he asks what I ordered and I said I got French toast from ihop and he is mad that I didn’t get him something.

my female friend(GF) and her boyfriend(BF) started dating a few weeks ago. they are both the closest friends i have in this friend group. the problem is that i had a friends with benefits kinda relationship with BF but he broke it off bc he couldnt separate feelings from u-kno-what, he said that feelings are a bit much he wasnt ready at the moment because he his ex hurt him badly and just wanted to stay friends, which was cool for me but then he just avoided me for around two months, cancelling plans last second and saying that he doesnt have time. i was devastated, since i asked him multiple times if we were cool and the whole fwb thing was his idea in the first place. 

i have severe social anxiety regarding friendships and romantic relationships, separation issues and depression and during that time, it acted completely out. GF helped me through that time, and i am really grateful for that. during the past few weeks she started beimg super busy at university and we spent less time together. the occasional getting together with all of our friends on the weekends were kinda nit an option for me bc i still couldnt stand seeing BF, getting panic attacks etc.

 two weeks ago she wanted to meet me eagerly, which is weird bc i am usually the one to initiate plans. as soon as we get settled with some coffee she breaks down crying telling me that she and BF got closer over the past few weeks and kissed(on my birthday, where i wanted to do a little get together with them and two others, but since they all cancelled last minutes dismissed that meeting), telling me that there were more than just frienship-y feelings between them now, telling me that it is ok to hate her and that she is an awful friend and no goid than the others(something along the lines already happend twice, thus my anxiety issues) i end up comforting her, but i am kinda hurt. i told her that i need time to think, and that it would be nice if they could tone the couple stuff down a bit if i was present.
 
during the next two partys with our friends, they proceed making out and holding hands and all that good stuff, and i break down completely multiple times, leaving early.
other friends told me that they did the shitty thing, backing me up.

my birthday party is in three weeks and i want es to invite the whole group, but i have a bad feeling about inviting them. they both are a core part of the group and as i already said they are some of my closest friends. but i kinda dont want to break down again, especially on my birthday.

TL;DR two best friends start dating,both fully knowing that i have feelings for one of them, now i dont want to invite them to my party(bad TL;DR, since theres alot of stuff to unpack,sorry)

c7fona	2019-06-30 15:19:21		AITA for wanting to receive credit for a company that’s using my artwork as a logo design?	"[attached are photos of a bit of interaction.](https://imgur.com/a/59fyEwo) in my graphic design class this year, we were assigned a task of redesigning a real company’s logo that was looking for an upgrade. After weeks of collaborating with the Vice President of the company and spending HOURS on tweaking the design completely to the company’s liking and Out of a class of 50, my design was chosen to represent the company.

This was phenomenal and I was pretty stoked as a college student. However, after the redesign was posted on social media’s including Facebook, Instagram and a blogspot website (same caption as the facebook, just no screenshot pictures for the blogspot.) in April, I couldn’t help but notice that I hadn’t been given proper credit... which didn’t make sense, considering I had communicated via email with the VP multiple times. The only credit posted was “_______ university student.” I didn’t even have a name. 

I posted under their instagram photo 10 weeks ago hoping for some credit, or to at least be tagged. 10 weeks later and......still nothing. 

I find out they have a Facebook this morning and give it a visit, thinking maybe I’ll have credit on there........ and of course, I don’t. Being slightly aggravated, I posted under the photo, crediting my OWN work..... and receive an immediate response from the VP.

Frankly, due to the circumstances, I’m thinking that the VP is throwing out excuses. She didn’t need to tag me via Facebook - my full name, found in my emails and contact info, would have been sufficient if anything. Same with Instagram, when I posted 10 weeks ago and nothing was done. If she lost the emails and was not able to find my name, she could have simply asked my graphic design professor who was the middle man in creating the assignment to begin with.

I usually am polite and say something like “sorry man I didn’t bring my wallet” but I had just been fucking r8ped in a pickup game and was kinda pissed so when he came lumbering up to ask me if I would give him any money I responded with a short “no”. My response might’ve been on the curt side (sort of like how you talk to your dog when it won’t stop jumping up on you) but it seemed to set this kid off. He looked right into my eyes and said “of course not, you dirty hooked-nose jew”. I’m not even Jewish I’m black and I don’t think my nose is that big but his rudely still pissed me off. I said “at least I’m not a fucking wee-tard” and he ran off into the men’s room.

Apparently he wouldn’t leave the stall and they had to call the police to get him out and while I’ll admit my phrasing wasn’t too great, the kid was rude to me first, right? I’m 28 btw if that matters."		1	0

Her wedding is a fall destination wedding, which I scheduled time off work, reserved a hotel room, paid for airfare, will be buying a gift...etc...   (my hubs is not going).  I would not miss the wedding, as she is special to me.

The wedding shower is the July 4th weekend.  Hubs and I previously scheduled time with friends, through the 8th, at a lake house  It’s a nice break from work and allows us to de-stress, relax and enjoy our friends. 

I said no to the wedding shower, as I already have plans.  My friend insists it’s “only a 30 minute drive” but it would suck up my whole afternoon and in the middle of my vacation.

c7fl7n	2019-06-30 15:13:26		AITA for ending this relationship with stressed out man ?	"I had been dating someone for four months. I loved him. We hit it off. He said I was his person and that he loved me. He’s had a rough go lately. Work stress and some health issues. I feel like I’ve done a pretty good job of being there for him and offering support throughout.  

He has two kids, one from a brief relationship and one from his marriage.

He is close with his ex-wife. They are co-parenting. Its apparent she still has feelings for him (he admitted). I don’t think he really knows what his feelings are for her. He made some insensitive joke about ‘sister wives’ and still being able to sleep with her. 

I have met his kids previously. They liked me. The ex said before i am around them again, she would like to meet me. Totally fair. We met briefly. 

After the meeting, my partner invited me to spend the long weekend with him (he would have his kids). He ran the idea past his ex. She became upset. He admitted that the upset did not stem from concern about the kids. Thursday rolls around and i am told I’m not invited to hang out because it was upsetting to the ex. 

Hurts a bit and I struggled with that one. But ok. I was told that after this one time conceding, it didn’t matter if she was upset. 

My partner, the ex and the kids spent the Saturday of this weekend at the air show/fair. I gave them space and stayed away from the area (which is minutes from my house). He said he would text me throughout the day. Didn’t hear from him. I had text him a quick ‘hey... i love you’ at 12pm. By 8pm i hadn’t received a response. I called him and said... hey thats not really a text you ignore (especially how the weekend had played out and the choices he had made) He said he saw it but forgot to respond. 

That hurt. I said I’m done. It’s clear you don’t care. Good luck with your ex.

Guy : I'll play at whatever volume I want. Can you get off the stage ? ( in an asshole tone)

Me: Yea sure in a minute.

We went back and forth about me not being able to sit on stage. I'm not sure why I have to move WHEN he tells me to

Guy : You know you are very rude.

Guy: raises his voice "" THIS IS NOT YOUR HOUSE !!!"" THIS IS A CHURCH !!

Runs out and gets the Pastor. Pastor asks me why I can't move when asked. I explain to him I am not on his property and not sitting on any equipment. He says well when leaders ask you to move you gotta move.

Me : Who is the leader ?

Pastor : That guy is setting up all of his instruments on stage why are you sitting there ?

Me: to the guy - I think you are being a jerk

Guy : I don't care what you think.

My parents didn't like him at first, mom claimed that he was ""disrespectful"" for refusing to remove his cap after entering the house, dad claimed he had a ""sketchy air"" about him. Since then, I have brought him with me to festives and my parents gradually warmed up to him.

I broke up with ex last year and since then my relationship with my mom have gone downhill. A few points to note, I'm Asian, now 29 and I've been living away from my family since I was 17. My mom said I must've done something to warrant ex cheating on me. She told me that a break up does not solve the ""problem"", that I should get back together with him and get married immediately. I disagree.

I think it's ridiculous that my mom is trying to guilt me into getting back with ex. Ex is now happily in another relationship so even if I want to, I couldn't anyway. It's become something that my mom keep bringing up whenever I do go visit my parents, which lead to explosive arguments, so I've stopped visiting them. It's a shame, because my dad completely disagree with my mom.

c7fibx	2019-06-30 15:08:51	j-fred94	AITA for being curt to a trio of parents?	"Just happened, I will start out by saying I am (unfortunately) quick to temper, I’ve been trying to work on it.

I live in an area that has a really nice paved nature trail, and with summer in full swing it can get kind of busy. The pavement on this trail is narrower than driving roads BUT is painted to mirror one (yellow dividing line down center) with signs all over that tell people to use the walkways as if they’re roads (right keeps right, left keeps left, announce passing on left when needed.)

I’m riding my bike down a stretch that runs straight and on either side it’s kind of swampy due to all the rain we’ve had this season. There’s about 8” of dirt off to either side of the pavement that then juts down into the mud. 

Now- I’m riding on my side of the pavement and oncoming there are three young adults, all have a stroller they’re pushing. The only thing is they’re walking abreast to each other which takes up most of my half of the road. As I’m approaching the man on my side waves his hand to signal that I need to get out of the way (from left to right) and does so repeatedly instead of either speeding ahead of his cohorts to fit o their side for a moment or fall back and do the same. 

So as I approach I stay on narrow patch of pavement on the right and as I pass (here’s the temper) I say “get on your own side.” And he yells back at me “Watch it asshole!” Aaaaaaand I regrettably yell back “get fucked”

Nothing else happened, no child was put in danger or anyone harmed. I mainly feel upset because when I oof back to my apartment and told my girlfriend what had happened she said I was an asshole and I didn’t need to act so aggressively to someone I don’t know. And she has a point. The dude could’ve been openly violent or something but I didn’t think of that. I got angry because instead of doing the right thing and obeying the posted signs he tried to cow me into riding on the loose gravel above the muddy section, and then got even more mad when he called me the asshole. 

It’s kind of a convoluted and menial story, because I thought he was the asshole but he and my girlfriend seem to agree that it was me.

Should I have just moved over? Am I the asshole? Any insight is appreciated."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So we’re long distance for the summer. I’ve had my iud for a year and the past couple of days it’s been giving me excruciating pain. I texted it about him last night and he said I’m sorry and asked if is it normal. I said idk and I sent him some article links. He didn’t respond to those and just asked if I was coming home soon so we could FaceTime. I think he was getting impatient that he had to wait for me to come home (I came back at 10:30 pm) because he wanted to go out and have a beer (by himself), but I asked him to wait for me to get home first so we could FaceTime and get done soon because I had to work at 6 am the next day. 

Anyway, I expressed I was upset he didn’t text me more about the iud and didn’t seem that concerned. He got offended and said I should just know he cares about me. Which he does, but still i would like some reassuring texts before i can get a pelvic exam because I was stressed. And I said well, if you don’t say that how am I supposed to know? I also said I have birth control for his benefit too since he doesn’t want to use a condom. He seemed offended at that. I didn’t say it during the FaceTime call but I’m frustrated too cuz women always have to deal with the side effects of birth control and men never have to deal with it. At most they have to deal with a condom. It’s 10 am and he usually texts me good morning by now and he hasn’t. I just wanna know if I’m TA here."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Quick Backstory: My mom's friend is on a family vacation to San Francisco for two weeks and my mother volunteered me to watch their house and their two dogs during this time. I am quite annoyed because she did not ask me first if I wanted to do this. I Love these dogs though so I guess it is okay. Now on to the dilemma...

Everything was going fine for the first 5 until I was awakened yesterday morning by a phone call from work. There was an emergency at work and they needed me ASAP. So I hurried and took a shower, fed and water the dogs, let them outside for a bit to do their business, then let them back inside because it is way too hot in Texas to leave them outside all day. Off I went to work. When I came back about 9 hours later, they had totally chewed up and destroyed two of the remote controls (one for the TV DVR and one for their DVD player) because I left them sitting out on the couch. The homeowners specifically told me not to leave the remotes out or they will chew them up. Whoops. I am taking responsibility for leaving the remotes out, and I plan on apologizing profusely. My mom thinks I should replace the remotes that were destroyed, but I disagree. It would cost about $40 total to replace them. That is not too much, but it is a lot to me. I don't think I should have to replace the remotes because technically it was their dog that destroyed them, I did not want to house sit in the first place, and they are not even paying me for house sitting for 2 weeks!

Also this is a throwaway because I don’t want this connected to my main.

I (13M) went out to a hibachi dinner with my parents and two younger sisters (11F) and (8F).
I’ll call 11F Ally and 8F Shelley.

We had just received our drinks, I got a strawberry Japanese soda and Shelley got an original. Ally only got water because she doesn’t like most foods or drinks.

Anyway, Shelley and I decide to try each other’s sodas with each other’s consent and we agree not to drink a lot, just a taste. Since the soda drinks were kind of weird, there’s just a hole in the middle of the cap, I had to position my mouth correctly.

Now Ally is sitting next to me and Shelley is across the table. When I finally got my mouth pressed to the soda, I started to drink it but only for half of a second before it’s ripped from my hands by Ally.

I turn towards her and she is protecting the soda because who knows why. I punch her once in the shoulder and rip the soda from her grasps. She starts crying and I sip the original flavored soda. Ally is bawling like full on (she is kinda sensitive) and Shelley and I exchange our sodas back to each other. I turn to parents and they say ‘no more phone for tonight!’ in a quiet but stern tone.

My sister and father go to the bathroom to clean Ally up and I ask my mother what I could’ve done better. She said I was an asshole for hitting her once but I say this truthfully, I didn’t hit her hard and I don’t hit hard in general either. She ripped the soda that wasn’t even hers that she had no connection to, right out of my own hands and I took it back.

So I'm friends with W and I've been friends with them since the start of high school. W is pretty rad I guess, they have an edgy humor that can sometimes be annoying though.

I'm even closer friends with B. B is one of the nicest people I know, has helped me through a lot of things and generally been a really good friend since my second year of high school. 

I must note, B is apart of my main friend group whereas W is one of my outlier friends (if that makes sense). I have two classes with W and none with B but hang out with B every single day. we are all in the same homeroom and have been since our first year.

During our first year, B and W dated pretty hard. It was a lot of PDA and ended badly before I even became closer friends with either of them. I never knew why they broke up nor did I really care, honestly. Neither of them speak of eachother, let alone interact with eachother and W refuses to even say B's name/acknowledge they exist in conversation. It's been 3-4 years since this all went down

B, not very recently, told me they didn't want me to be friends with W and mentioned stuff about W treating them badly, however didn't elaborate. Everyone seems to know about what happened but me. I have no idea what W did. 

And now, W has invited me to their birthday party. Im excited but I feel like an asshole for being friends with them. They seem genuinely like a cool person, aside from their strange sense of humor. 

B is one of my closest friends, as I mentioned before. I trust them deeply and they've been there for me in some of my worst times. We've had a couple run-in's where they were an asshole to me but other than that I love B.

I feel like I have to choose between them, and I don't want to. My whole childhood was filled with having to pick one friend or the other and I don't want that repeating. 

So AITA?

TL;DR am friends with friend W even though friend B doesn't want me to be because W possibly treated them badly

(Note: I'm not going to ask B what happened. I want to respect their privacy, as they would have told me if they wanted to. I can't remember all of what they have told me due to memory issues, so they might have told me more of the story than I currently know but I'm not sure.)

"Ok so I'm (19M) currently in university and have some friends who are younger than me that are just about to hit 18. Where I live, thats the legal age to go out drinking/clubbing. Now, I go to one of the best party universities in my country, so I thought it would be a good idea for their first propper night out to be here (don't worry they've been to house parties and such before). 

Since its a few hours drive away I offered to let them stay at mine, and we could go out a few nights in a row. So my friend lists off who should go, including someone I'm sort of friends with, lets call him Jamie.

Jamie is a nice dude, he's funny and we've met a few times before. I'd be happy to have him around, however... Jamie looks 12. And that is no exageration. I've no idea if he has a growth disorder or if it's just bad luck, but he looks a hell of a lot younger than my younger teenage brother in comparison. 

I know what the clubs are like here. And the bars. If he rocks up with an id, he'd be clocked as it being fake, even though he really is 18. Even if he brought his passport he wouldn't get in, mostly as they take pictures inside the club to advertise, and if it looks like they're letting in 12 year olds, well... you can imagine the shitstorm.

I know what you're thinking, well why not try? Whats the harm? Well the last time someone in my friend group wasn't let in, it's game over for everyone. Not only do the bouncers not want everyone else in because they're suspicious, but we don't want to leave a man behind. So we try again the next night.

Anyway, I straight up said no and explained why (same as above). They looked like they accepted it, but still made it out that I was being an asshole. 

I understand this isn't his fault, but I don't want this to ruin the night for everyone.

Recently I have moved into a new house with my parents and with it being a larger house my parents have thrown many parties. I should probably add that Im a sophmore in highschool.

One thing my parents always ask me to do is spend time with them at parties or after, but whenever I go near them they use me as the butt of every joke infront of their friends. This started to lead to me going to a therapist for extreme anxiety, because I was scared to even go near them because of the endless insults and yelling after I get mad. 

This all became worse with my new house, as I said at the top, they throw many parties, and sometimes 3-5 a week. I have been staying away so I could be less anxious and more calm, which has led to my parents coming inside every 30 minutes to ask me to come out.

This morning my parents asked me why don't I do anything with them, and I decided to tell them the truth, that it was an insulting relationship and  I really just wanted to stay apart for a couple of days.

Sometimes my son will cry for his momma so I'll take him to her.. sometimes ill hang out but i usually say ""im gonna go vape and take a few minutes to myself"".. it will be about 10 to 15 minutes when my wife will appear and say something to the effect of ""oh there you are! I was getting worried cuz i couldn't find you!"" She will then set our son down ask what im doing, and within 5 to 10 minutes find a reason to disappear again. I have social anxiety, being around people makes me uncomfortable.. so am i out of line for thinking that if im just going to babysit the entire time that it'd be better for both my son and i to just hang out at home?"		1	0

Basically, he is very vain. All he ever talks about is the girls he talks to online, and talks about their looks. He takes nothing but selfies. And he is wondering why I want to be left alone. Whenever he was around, he never really talked to me. Only text his girlfriends. Me and my mom had enough. That’s why she divorced him. But AITA for wanting to keep my distance?

c7evd1	2019-06-30 14:32:54	jointlover217	AITA for wanting to stay home and not go visitor with my girlfriends family	"So let me make this clear, I have no problem with my girlfriends family but I do get social anxiety sometimes when I first think about going to do anything social. Sometimes  I really just enjoy being a homebody and knocking out all of the house chores and relaxing. Especially on a Sunday when classes start again tomorrow. 

My girlfriend and I live together and she woke up to a call from her mom this morning asking her to drive (about an hour) to come see her and help her out by picking up her siblings from her grandparents (another hour father away). Now at this moment when she is on the phone, I am half sleeping in recovery from a full day of drinking on the river with said girlfriend the day before. She asks me if I want to ride with her to go pick up her siblings and then spend most of the day hanging out at her parents house. I told her that I would honestly like to just stay home and do the dishes and laundry that was long past needing to do and chill out at home, and I also have to work at 7 pm tonight. This triggers a shouting match because “I don’t love her as much as she loves me” and she wants me to gather her things while she’s gone so she can move out and she wants to cancel a trip to drive about 4 hours to visit my extended family that we have had planned for at least a month. She says i’m being unfair because she is willing to go so far to visit with my family for a few days while I am not willing to go visit hers with her. 

The way I see it, she gets to see her family way more often than I do so that’s kind of unfair. They live less than an hour from us and mine is a minimum of four and a half hours away and I rarely get to see them since i’m at college. I have met and hung out with her family before and I have no issue with them at all and I have no reservations about hanging out with them in the future, I just wanted to stay home today, so I suppose I was just being selfish and thinking about my desires first.

My girlfriend and I live together but I work in another city so from monday to friday I'm not home and also sleep in a seperate apartment near my workplace in that time.

We have this situation for 3 years now and it works good because both of us like to have their private time.

This summer I will have to work for 3 months in the city we both live in. I'll be working in shifts  but I can choose the shifts I'd like to have. So in my head I  directly  went for morning shifts because I usually rise early and like to have afternoons free rather then the morning.
My gf on the other hand starts work regurarly around 11am.

When she realised that I'll be waking up every morning next to her at around 5am she made a big scene and demanded me to work afternoonshifts so not to wake her.

I on the other hand do not understand how my 1minute leaving the bedroom will ruin her sleep completely. And refuse to accept having to work a shift I do not like for 3 months just that her sleep isn't interrupted.

But then a few days ago, my PC is starting to lag, get slow, and always unresponsive so I decided that I have to buy a new one. I told my mom—I can’t let her borrow money from me for the time being since I’ll be having to buy a new PC but I can let her borrow next week, then she got mad at me and said NO NO NO (really angry) since she told her office mate that she’ll be paying her already on a specific date.

So as summer break began, he started to text me to talk, which is fine except he texts me everyday. Even on the days I tell him I need some space, I get texts. Now I understand his concern for me, and how he cares about me, but my issue is that he is so DULL when it comes to texting. 

I try very hard to stay invested in the conversation, but his responses are mostly like “Ah. makes sense.” and “Oh? sounds about right.” regardless of the topic. I’m heavily invested in politics and global news and even when I bring those issues up he just seems uninterested and can’t form the conversation. It’s just weird because in person he is actually very talkative and contributes to the conversations we have. 

So If I don’t talk to him or like not reply to his texts. he’d then text me “I miss you.” and then I just feel horrible. How do I text someone who can barely keep a text conversation alive? As a good friend, I’m fine with texting him every now and then but texting everyday is exhausting. 

I talked to a few friends and they just told me off because “I was being a bitch” but I thought It was reasonable to not want to text someone every goddamn day. So, WIBTA if I avoid texting him every now and then?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I'm looking to marry my fiance in the next few years, but there's a dispute over how we're going to pay for the wedding. We have our own savings to put towards it, about £5K, mostly out of my personal savings, a little out of hers. and my parents have offered us a further £4K towards the wedding. My parents gave my older sister £4K towards her wedding, and are offering me the same. However, her parents are refusing to make any contribution towards the wedding, simply saying they don't have any money and that my parents have more money so should fund it. However, I'm one of three children, and she's an only child. They've only had one child to worry about. My parents are slightly better off, but no way are they three times better off. 

I'm refusing to go forward with wedding planning until I get her parents to match my parents contribution. Either that, or we go with a much cheaper option, but her parents will have to stay at home. My fiance is upset about the whole thing, annoyed at her parents, but hardly surprised as she's always had these kind of problems.

Me (23F) and my husband (23M) who we will call C, have been married for a couple of years now. He is an incredibly sweet and hard-working man, and often works overtime hours due to his ridiculous job that doesn’t have good work-life balance. Due to him working 60+ hours a week, I encourage him to relax on his days off. However, he often spends the entirety of those days following me around asking what he can do for me. 

I know you might say he is making up for working a lot and wants to spend time with his wife, but it’s not spending time together that he wants. In the morning, he’ll repeatedly ask me what I want for breakfast. If I try to make breakfast for him, he stops me and tells me he’s got it. If I try to do household chores, he immediately comes and tries to do them instead. If he goes out, he will text and call me multiple times to see if I need anything. Am I sure I don’t need anything? If I need anything, let C know. 

I am a very independent woman, and growing up, my parents stopped doing things for me once I turned 16 so I’ve been “taking care of myself” for a while. When he asks me what he can do for me, I say that he can take initiative to do chores instead of waiting to be told. I also tell him that I would like him to relax, as a way to do something for me, but he never does. 

It’s starting to drive me crazy. The laundry will sit all day, but as soon as I go to do it, he tries to step in and say “why didn’t you tell me? I can get this.” If I get up to get a snack, he insist I sit down and he will bring me something or run to the store for anything I want. I let him do things a lot of the time, but I am a woman who enjoys working and being productive. I love to clean and don’t find it to be a hassle. I don’t want someone to wait around for me to order them around. I would love for him to just get up and do something in his own accord. 

I’ve previously mentioned the initiative factor and he always gets upset and says “I can never do anything right in your eyes”. AITA for not wanting my husband to do every little thing for me?"	No A-holes here	0	0

Along the way I took a curvy road that runs next to a nice stretch of  river and as I came around the curve I notice something large in the road and what looked like wet pavement all around it. I slowed down to see if it was trash or some other obstruction that I could simply move and  be on my merry way. I soon realized that the object was a huge 40 - 50 pound turtle that had obviously just been hit by a car before I got there.  
      
          I noticed the turtle flipped upside down and still moving as I approached. 
Although I saw the all the blood, I thought perhaps that maybe it wasn't too bad since the turtle was still moving, so I'll flip it over and help it off to the side of the road. As I rolled the turtle off its back I saw that it's shell had been shattered  into pieces and that the turtle was in a really bad way. I then try to move the turtle off to the side of the road with a stick only to have this tough son of a gun latch onto it and bite off a big chunk. I don't proclaim any veterinary expertise but it looked like he was well beyond the point of recovery.

Basically, I'll be working from home for the foreseeable future, and this weekend wanted to call my parents to chat about it. My girlfriend was really wanting today (Sunday) to be about us, so we agreed I could just call them during the week at lunch. 


We had a nice morning together - I woke with her breakfast in bed - then went to the gym. Afterwards I showered first and she was outside with our flatmate chatting. I didn't tell her I was finished, thinking she knows I'm usually quick and would come in whenever.


Since I know it takes her 30 mins to get ready, and takes me 30 mins to call my folks, I figured it would be a good time to call them since next week's going to be a big deal for me. 


She then comes in, sees I'm on the phone and showers. Afterwards, she is extremely upset I didn't tell her the shower was free. She is then doubly upset because I called my folks when we agreed I would do it during the week. 


Her hurt comes from me not communicating with her, and also that by calling my folks it means I don't listen to anything she says, and don't care about her since today was meant to be about us.


Fights like this keep happening, and I'm just becoming so numb. I understand I should've said 'Hey I'm done', but just don't think it's such a huge deal if I dont. She wanted to spend the day in the park so wanted to leave sooner than later. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7ehff	2019-06-30 14:09:53	alteralteregoslutvil	AITA for pawning my moms wedding ring?	"

I’m adopted. My mom has never really liked me. It’s the typical step child stuff. My mom was married for 3 years to a man she says she thought he was gay the whole time. They only got married for taxes and his mom gave them a house if they did. Our family has 9 kids. They divorced 11 years ago. When we first came to live with them they didn’t sleep in the same room. It was like a roommate situation with them. 
About two years ago my mom gave me the wedding ring from that marriage as like, a family gift thing? I’m not sure why she did that. I haven’t talked to Bob (I’m calling him bob) since I was about 8. He used to beat my little brother, who was 2. He would make my little brother finish all his meals and if he didn’t he would make him eat until he threw up, and if he threw up he would take his shoe off and spank my brother without a diaper on, so it hurt. He was 2!  and a few times he would take my older brother outside and beat him with a finishing pole when he was “bad”. He did it at night so my mom wouldn’t be able to stop him I guess. None of my moms bio kids got treated like that. Safe to say, I don’t like bob. Haven’t talked to him since he left us. 

Here’s where I feel like an asshole but I also don’t care. I guess I’m wondering if I’m concluded as the asshole, is there anyways I can make mends? I pawned the ring for weed money. My mom called me a month later asking if I had the ring because she wanted it back. Because “it really meant a lot to her and the times she had with bob” (are you fucking kidding me?). I just told her I would look for it but I’m not sure if I can find it. A week goes by and I just keep telling her I haven’t found it yet but it’s probably in my old craft box in the attic. Which I’m too lazy to get. 

Part of me feels bad, but part of me wants to tell my mom to fuck off.

"A few years back, my parents built a wall in the middle of their master bedroom to create a small “bedroom” for me, because I (8F) was sharing a bedroom with my brother at that time and they thought it was time to give me my own room.

However, since then, as a little kid, I had been getting lots of nightmares and would always run to my parent’s room in the middle of the night. This happened almost on a daily basis. My father eventually decided that he would sleep in my bedroom because there was no space. 

Now I am 14 years old, and I would like my room back. I actually stopped having nightmares around the age of 9, but it has become sort of routine to sleep with my mum while my dad sleeps in my room. 

My mum sleeptalks constantly at night, she snores incredibly loudly, and complains about me staying up late. It’s a pain in the ass and I want my room back. For context, we live in a tropical country so it’s really hot and humid at night. 

My mum likes to turn the air conditioning on with the fan, so it’s almost like winter every night whereas my dad just has the fan. He says he can’t stand the cold temperatures my mum has in the master bedroom, and so he can’t sleep in their room. My dad grew accustomed to just having the fan on, and so he can’t take the air conditioning anymore.

I really really want my bed back though, because that was the reason that they built me the bedroom in the first place. I insisted that I had to sleep in my own bed and tried to persuade my mum to not make the room so cold at night, but she refused. 

So now she sleeps alone, I sleep in my own room and my dad has been banished to the couch. Am I the asshole for making my dad sleep there?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I was in an extreme hurry to get to a tennis match that would start in an hour and a half.

My parents keep accusing me of wearing 2+ changes of clothes a day, when in reality I only wear one. Sometimes I will change my clothes, but that is only if I have a tennis match, and I was sweating all day. Which seems reasonable to me. 

I went downstairs, and I told her that I have no clothes to wear. 

She told me to check everywhere, but I had already done so. I asked her ""Why haven't you washed 4+ days of clothes? You are always so consistent.""

She told me to wear some dirty shorts, (which I think is disgusting), so I sprayed them with essential oils, then threw them in the dryer.

I'm (19f) from Croatia and my friend (24m) comes from France. I met him the last summer holidays working at a bookshop. His family isn't from Croatia, but they have been vacationing here since he was a teenager.

My friend is really interested in linguistics and learning foreign languages. We have been helping each other out study Croatian and French. Sometimes though, he expresses opinions that I technically agree with but they bother me, I just don't know if that's hypocritical.

Like he makes a lot of jokes about Croatian and Serbian (and Bosnian and Montenegrin) being different dialects of the same language. Linguistically that's basically true, and I also think people who try to argue they're ""scientifically"" different languages are cringy and usually nationalist, but when he makes light of the situation I feel annoyed. He can't really understand the whole politics and the sentiment behind declaring them different languages. For e.g. he recently asks me, why wouldn't you all just make ""Serbo-Croatian"" the official language and stop the confusion. Without understanding that no-one would be fine with this, nationalist or not. Including me.

*Tl;dr:

Although I believe that these are linguistically same languages, I don't like it when he as a foreigner talks about this topic like it's that simple or tries to discuss weird political solutions with me. So would I be the asshole and hypocrite if I called him out or justified?"	Not enough info	0	0

c7e611	2019-06-30 13:51:20	kappakingdon	AITA: Not going to Temple with parents	"Hi I’m 20 years old so I’ve started and am going through the phases of making adamant decisions about what I believe in and follow.

My parents are Hindu and although are not adamantly devoted to the religion, tend to go to the temple sometimes to pray to gods, etc. I have made it quite clear to them that I am non religious and they respect my boundaries and my decisions.

However today when my parents asked me to come to the temple with them, I politely declined and informed my mother that I am non religious and wouldn’t want to ruin their time. By all means I am not anti-Hindu or anything, I just have no attachment to the religion.
 My mom seemed a little distressed upon my declining and my parents went without me, but I have this guilt eating away at me.

c7e4ch	2019-06-30 13:48:41	CocaineIsMyGame	AITA For not wanting to hang out with my cousin?	"Alright I usually hang out with my cousin when she doesn’t have school to go so we usually go outside to chill and walk around. I don’t mind doing that with her but she tends to get loud and act like she doesn’t have any self control. There were a few times she had rudely told someone to stop looking at her. (She’s 16 btw.)  I have told her multiple times to at least to be a little quiet because when she gets loud, people stare at us with judging faces and honestly it makes me feel embarrassed about hanging out with her.  I know at that age, some kids don’t have any filter when they talk/act but I just wish she take in some consideration to how I feel when I’m outside with her.

Update: she tried to rob the store that’s around me. Saying that I won’t get in because she’s stealing. But me being with her will make it seem like I’m stealing too. I told her that I don’t want her to do that because I don’t want to ban from this store because of something she did. She won’t care if she if she gets banned because she live on the other side of the city but for me. I’m trying to teach her to do good things so she won’t have to deal with her mom getting at her ass for the dumb stuff she do. I honestly feel bad if I cut contacts with her because it doesn’t seem like she’s gonna ever think about my concerns about her and her wellbeing."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7dywv	2019-06-30 13:39:31	UnwantedHairCut	AITA for being mad that, without asking, my mum cut my daughter's hair. It was her first ever hair cut.	"We dropped her off as my mum baby sits every other Sunday night, which is something we are really grateful for.

We had a conversation about how her hair is a bit long in the front, but my wife has picked out a nice hair dressers for her first haircut.

When I got home my mum just texted me saying that she's ""lopped the ends of her fringe"", ""hope you're not mad"". As soon as I seemed shocked and a bit upset about it, she's gone very defensive and said it's not a big deal.

She's taken an inch of her fringe and basically chosen the hairstyle for our daughter. Not the one we give her.

Her reason for cutting it was that is was driving her (my mum) mad. My daughter's hair did need cutting, but it wasn't horrendous or anything. We just clip her hair (edit: a hair-clip, we don't cut it. Sorry!) if it looks like it's bothering her.

c7dxl2	2019-06-30 13:37:34		AITA arguement with long distance girlfriend	"So I have a long distance girlfriend. She lives in Japan and I live in Korea. She told me she will come to my home country in Australia next year in July. Korea isn't an option for her and neither is Japan for me. I told her that's too long and asked if she would consider coming earlier since we won't be able to see each other AT ALL for at least half a year due to her work circumstances. She can only take off 3 days in a row cumulatively so even if I visit her we'll likely not be able to meet much.

She knows that I had a similar past long distance experience that didn't work out and I got dumped after waiting for about 6 months which is why I'm nervous about this. It's her first long distance relationship. 

She told me that she really values her current job and wants to get at least 1 more years work experience before moving and at the earliest she would come in March. She is getting a promotion in August, one that she has been looking forward to for 2 years now. I got upset with her on the phone before when she told me this and let out a huge sigh and kind of abruptly hung up. I felt like she values her job over being together. Even though I'm a little hypocritical because I can't go work in Japan. Although Australia is the best place for the future as we have both agreed and she even said she would rather have children in a western country. I feel like I can't plan my life going back because I don't exactly know when she will come and the fact that we won't see each other for so long. 

Am I the asshole here? Should I just acknowledge that this job is valuable to her and just wait for her to finish it before coming?"	No A-holes here	1	0

c7duby	2019-06-30 13:31:57	tzholl	WIBTA if I refuse to pay	"I live in a house with a roommate let’s call her June. With the seasonal change in temperature and increase of humidity, (and just change of housing due to unreconcilable difference with the landlord) our house has got a minor mold problem. 


Now, June and I live in a cement house that has a metal roof. Previously I lived in a grass house during the last winter and have never experienced this before.  This past week, June has found mold growing on her backpacks and walls.  She has pointed out some mold near my baseboards. To my knowledge we are not experiencing any negative effects with coexisting with this mold. But she has started a warpath to kill it. Including using dangerous essential oils without notification or consideration for our dog despite my warnings about using EO in the close proximity of animals. 

Key info: 
-volunteers with very limited salary
- I have only three months left of my contract and will be moving
-June has an additional year.
-I have no significant mold growing around my room.
-Idc about mold
-I believe if she asked our bosses they would consider this a home expense and reimburse her for most costs
-I told her multiple times just use bleach and water let it air dry, ventilate properly. Yet she has bought gallons and vinegar and used EO to try and get rid of the problem
-she asked me to buy an item for her (mold related) while I was in our market Town and I did. I wrote this down as a cost on expense sheet, yet still ended up paying for it


Now, just today, she has arrived home with stuff for a DIY dehumidifier. This would go into her room.  And I’m already dreading and anxious about having to explain that I don’t want to pay for such things when we tally up the monthly expenses (we split household items such as rice, soap, etc)  I will be more than honest to say that there have been times where we have not seen eye to eye. I can be an insane grudge holder. 

I may just be jaded since I preform a lot more  work w our dog including waking up, feeding vaccines, carrying heavy dog food once a month for two miles, etc.  this is something we have talked about and she is working on. I do not want to let this part of our lives interfere and cause me to act like an ass. But in other aspects has shown real improvement in effort with the bush dog baby. 

Please help me. Would I be the asshole if I refused to split these costs with her? 

Best case I just wait out the only cold month left and tell her to ask our bosses for reimbursement, next best case I pay for bleach for my room and common room. Worst case I’m the asshole and I’m dumping tons of money into this shithole we rent. 

(No my LL will not remedy this situation this is a third world country lol.. and yes this may seem petty in a sense and make me an asshole but when your monthly budget is $80 USD every single dollar counts as I believe she has already spent well over $15 USD)

c7dti7	2019-06-30 13:30:27	thejohnnygrey_666	AITA for telling a guy of because he accused me of being hypocritical about my sexual identity?	"I am 25 male in a relationship with a great guy been together for 7 years. Now I do not really relate to the popular gay culture. I do not enjoy things like cross-dressing, I am not feminine and do not wear what you call flamboyant outfits. But if being gay simply means a person who engages in sexual activities with people of the same sex, then I am gay.

Now my bf is the opposite of me. He enjoys cross-dressing once in a while and is a little feminine. But we love each other the way we are so no problems there. 
He also has this circle of close gay friends who love to hang out together like once a week. Last week was my bf's birthday and he decided to invite these friends over for a little celebration at our apartment. 

One of these friends, Jake (not his real name) has been living abroad for a few years and was back in town so I do not really know him. He is a very outspoken and somewhat cynical guy. When my bf introduced me to him, he started bombarding me with a lot of questions about every aspect of my sexuality, which kind of made me feel uncomfortable.

He then asked why he had never seen me before, and my bf, bless his heart, told him that was because I never went to gay bars or places where gay people love to hang out. He then asked me why I, a gay man, do not associate myself with other gay men, so I told him, first I just don't really like being labelled as to allow everyone to define what I am or am not. Second,  I prefer keeping my private life private. 

He then said ""There is no such thing as a gay man living his life like a straight man. If you're gay, you're gay. You can't just walk around and give people the impression that you're straight while you still have a dick in your mouth every night in your bedroom. You're just living a lie.""

That really rubbed me the wrong way because I sensed it that he was calling me a hypocrite. So I told him that what I am or choose to be is none of his business. My sexual preference is merely a part of my self-identity. And I am in control of it in accordance with how I live my life. Not the other way around. If having a dick in my mouth means I am gay,  then I am gay indeed. But not because I identify with what most people and some gay people think is appropriately gay.""

He wouldn't shut up about it and kept pestering me until I completely lost my shit and told him that if he is gay and proud then ""what are you doing in the house of a person like myself?""
He looked really offended and then left immediately. My bf thought I was being a little too harsh. Am I the Asshole?

EDIT : Now all of my bf's friends also think I am hypocritical based on their late night WA conversation, and I told bf that I don't give a shit about what they think but he said he gives a shit because it's between his good friends and me, the love of his life, and suggests that I be the bigger person and apologize for 'kicking him out'.  I, of course, said NO!

EDIT 2 : Thanks for one of you here who DMed me and accused me of posting a validation thread. This might sound like it is but believe me, a tiny itsy bitsy part of me is indeed feeling guilty because it was my bf's birthday and things were awkward after that one friend left, which completely ruined everyone's mood to celebrate more. So yeah I basically ruined my bf's birthday party.
Grammar.

EDIT 3 : Thanks to one of the commentators here who pointed it out to me that maybe bf's friends are just being jealous and upset that I somehow have influenced in him toning his gayness down a bit in recent years. He used to be more feminine and flamboyant but since we started dating I talked him into keeping it down a little. Not because I was ashamed of him, but because not everyone is as open as others when it comes to what is being perceived as 'normal'. I am from a small town where the people are so religious and not as accepting as those in bigger cities.

EDIT 4 : To everyone who does not understand. People here are crazily religious and homosexuality is not openly and widely accepted. Being gay means you are more prone to violence and denial of public privileges. I asked my bf to TONE IT DOWN for his own safety. I DID NOT force him to CHANGE HOW HE WAS. I love him and want to save him from harm and rejection because that's how it is living in this country as a gay person. And he understood my intention. He is openly gay and now knows better than to act 'all gay' in public places, which is my point actually.

EDIT 5 : To those who call me a homophobic gay guy it's okay. But at the end of the day I know and I get to decide what I am. Because I am the only one who understands me. My bf understood my well-meaning intention and is not making such a big fuss about it like some here. He knows exactly I love him and care about him. If he felt that I am forcing him to change himself or live a lie, or oppressing his freedom of expressing himself as a gay man, then he would have left me years ago.  We're still together and love each other and it's all that matters."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c7dthk	2019-06-30 13:30:25		AITA for not wanting to go on my dad's fishing camp?	"First I apologize for my English, but since I'm very conflicted and only downloaded Reddit to make this post, I hope you can bear with me. Also sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. 

So, my dad's a fisher. It's not only a hobby, he loves it so much he's the organizer of an annual fishing camp.
Many kids from ages ~7-16 sign up and go to a different location to fish every day for a week, get their food and sweets here as well, sleep in a tent, have to wake up early and have very limited access to electronics. They can also do the test to get a fishing license and they're teached the material beforehand. 
You can tell by these rules that only kids who really love fishing would want to stay there.

My mom doesn't fish, but she helps in the camp by working in the kitchen or helping kids who hurt themselves or want to go home. (she's basically the substitute mom here)

Now me (13) and my sister (11) go to this camp every year (I'm actually there in the moment of writing this) and we HATE it.

Here are our reasons:
× We both aren't very fond of fishing and are pretty bad at it.
× Almost all of the kids here are boys and they aren't really open to making friends with us.
× Also, we don't know anybody here.
× We forget all the important things every year (since we don't go fishing at any other time of the year) and are basically beginners even though we  have been going here for years. We also kinda get made fun of for that. 
× Because we are the children of the boss and the substitute mom, we have this ""entitled"" stigma which makes the others even less motivated to befriend us (and we both are pretty shy and introverted).

So yeah, we aren't here voluntarily.
Of course, we tried telling our parents that we despise going to the camp"		1	0

c7dq18	2019-06-30 13:24:47	iwasplannedithink	AITA for not wanting to leave my house 2 hours before i planned to ?	"A little backstory: me and my boyfriend have been together for a little over 2 years. when my grandmother passed , i got her car so i would drive us both around. we have a baby boy (3mo) together , so clearly i need to(and do) sleep a LOT. recently he got himself a new car bc.. well, he needed a car lmao.

the car is a few years old and you have to manually shut the headlights on and off. a few nights ago he accidentally left them on and drained the battery. he got a jump , it’s working fine , no biggie. he was going to the dealership today so they can replace the battery.

i work at 12:30 . he texts me at around 7 to ask me for jumper cables , which i do have . we talk a little , then he asked me for the jump . he goes “i don’t want it rn bc once i get it , i cant stop until i get there and it opens at 11.”

Me: “i wasn’t leaving my house anyway.”
Him:”that’s why you’re leaving at 9.” 
Me:”no. i’m not.”
Him:”aiight see you then :)”

i rolled over and went back to sleep .

literally a few minutes ago my boyfriend facetimes me asking where i am. i groggily but casually said i was sleeping . he starts to get upset and argues that he cant go back inside bc they’re getting something removed from the house and cant go back in for a few hours . i argue back that i was leaving when i left for work (around 10:45 , 11) but eventually i said fuck it and just said

Me: FINE FUCK IT IM COMING
Him: nah don’t worry bout it (something something i wasn’t really listening bc i was half asleep) *hangs up*

we live a few neighborhoods apart , his bestfriend is right between us . why not call her ? why not plan ahead and ask me “hey if the car goes out tomorrow , can you wake up a lil earlier to give me a jump?”

i’m leavin to go down there in a little but

AITA for not jumping up as SOON as he wanted/planned?

TLDR; boyfriends car needs a jump , wanted it specifically at 9(2 hours earlier than i planned to leave). i told him wait , he gets mad

c7dmww	2019-06-30 13:19:29		AITA for bitching out of this wedding?	"So I'm a bridesmaid at a wedding 2,000 miles away. I've bought a dress, plane tickets, and was ready to go. 

I've known the Groom since high school, and the bride I've hung out with maybe a total of 4 times since they live 2,000 miles away. We always got along though, so they invited me to the wedding. I planned accordingly and invited a plus one so I wont be traveling alone.

Anyways, on the official wedding count email, I wasnt given the option to RSVP a plus one, most likely just an over sight. But I've brought up having a plus one multiple times during the wedding planning process. Then a couple days ago the bride messages me basically flipping out about the additional costs of my plus one, and now I'm responsible to pay $260 so she can attend with me. Then is sure to include that this is MY fault, and also cover her ass with a couple lies as well. 

Then while talking to the Maid of Honor, the more I realized that I'm going to be there to control the brides family, who I've never met, the bride is already being enough of a bitch where I have to kiss her ass, and I'll barely be able to see my actual friend, the groom.

I'm already dropping a couple hundred bucks to even get to the wedding, getting a hotel, helping fund the Bachorette party, and buying a God awful bridesmaids dress. So, would I be the asshole if I trade in my plane tickets and go literally anywhere else? 

I've spent a year saving money for this, and put in the effort just to get bitched at. I feel like if I'm gonna throw over a grand into a trip I should at least have a good time. 

I know its incredibly rude, but so is not offering basic accommodations to a Bridesmaid.
Also, i got no clear answer about whether there's even an open bar included with the $260 so what's even the fucking point?

-canceling my birthday dinner because he had a rough time at work and just wanted to cuddle at home 

-cancelling our anniversary dinner for the same reason and because he was worried about money

-dipping out of our RESCHEDULED anniversary celebrations because he had a headache 

-trying to back out of coming to a performance I worked on because he was so late (somehow managed to take 80 minutes to get from his work to the theatre, which for reference was about a 35 minute walk away, or 20 minutes in public transport). 

-canceling our plans to go to the pride parade because he had a stomach ache. 

-canceling several more casual dates because he didn’t feel like leaving the house 

If it was one or two instances of this, I would absolutely understand. I want to support my BF if he’s feeling sick or had a bad day. But it seems pretty much impossible to get him to go out; every time I manage to get him out of the house, we have a big fight about something stupid. When we stay home, no such issues. 

He keeps saying these things are out of his control; feeling sick or sad is not under his control. And I understand that, but it feels like he could still be making an effort to reschedule when he feels better, or at least be understanding about why I’m upset. Every time I bring the issue up and ask him to do better, he gets really defensive and refuses to admit that he has done anything wrong 

AITA for blaming him for being so flakey and wanting him to do better?

Edit: thanks for your comments everyone. I knew that we both struggle with depression sometimes, but honestly it had never even occurred to me that his cancelling would be because of it (especially since he seems perfectly content whenever we stay home, not depressive)."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c7dh0d	2019-06-30 13:09:24	playmorezeppelin	AITA for asking her to miss a football game?	"AITA? I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 6 months now and it’s been going great so far - I really feel like I’ve found the right person for me. But one thing that’s gotten to be a little overbearing is her absolute obsession with her college football team (I’ll leave the school out to avoid any bias).

Besides music, sports are what I live and breathe for. Just like her, I take a lot of pride in my team and consider myself more than just an average fan. But last night we got into an argument when I invited her to go visit my friend and his wife in September and she said she would have to check to see if there’s a home game that Saturday. I expressed my concern that she wouldn’t be willing to miss a single home game (there are 6 in a season) for something I wanted to do together and she got extremely upset and said I was being too controlling.

We’ve both been out of college for 5 years and her old campus isn’t even nearby... it’s in the next state. I totally understand being a die hard fan of your team because I am one. But at what point in your life should you prioritize that less than your relationship? She says going to those games is a tradition among her friends and they always went in high school and college. But my thing is, yeah so did everyone else who went to a major school. She definitely holds her fandom over my head as if I don’t understand (even though my team has 8 championships and hers only has 2 or 3, but they’ve been more recent - just sayin). I’m rambling a bit so I’ll just cut it off. But I’m seriously struggling here because we didn’t really resolve the argument that well and it’s still bothering me.

I bought a package for 30 lessons + the exams.
Funny thing I had to pay in cash, it was a lot of money I didn’t thought  much of it, Although this means he doesn’t pay taxes over what he gets paid(atleast that is how it works in my country) and he has ALOT of students.
I was fine with that w/e he’s done this for 13 years. But now I’ve used up my 30 lessons even bought 5/6 more but I need his approval to do my practical exam in order to get my drivers licence he was supposed to get a date for when that is happening. Since it’s so urgent for me to get my drivers licence this pisses me of and I’ve mention multliple times that I really need to finish up. He keeps coming up with bullshit reasons.

Let year I was going through a lot of stuff, my best friend on 9 years told my other friends not to talk to me and at the same time my dad was put into hospital where he was put on life support and was undergoing many serious surgeries so my mind was pretty foggy at this time. I was sleeping on my nans couch and floor (swapping with my brother) for 6 months whilst he was in hospital as my parents divorced when I was 5-6. Anyway, during this time I was really desperate to talk or vent to anybody and I had a super big crush on this girl and wanted talk to her so I wanted to tell her about it but i didnt know how to talk to her so I emailed (I'm so cool right, emailing people) a guy I knew and asked for advice to ask her out and I wrote him what o was going to say and at the end I said 'that's what I'm going to say to her, sound any good?'. Now, the problem is that he found the email a few months after and I forgot about it and didn't have a crush on the girl anymore and decided it would be easier to not burden her with my issues but he showed it to everyone and he put it out of context like i was asking him out. I was pretty sensitive from what was going on in my private life so I responded really badly and I went on a whole fucking tangent saying things like 'screw you you narcissistic asshole, I was asking for advice not asking you out!'

c7dd0p	2019-06-30 13:02:31	GabbyP_2828	WIBTA if I didn’t let my boyfriends brother come out with us?	"Very basic title but there is important background info to share. 
So basically, this past Friday night my bf changed our plans on me last second to go hang out with friends. I was upset and it was a dick move of him and he apologized and we agreed to do something Saturday night (yesterday). So Saturday rolls around and I told my bf we should go eat ramen and then watch a movie at his house; I was hungry and wanted to relax since I had had a long day at work. He agreed happily and when I was off work I called him to discuss final details. 

He hits me out of nowhere with news that since his dad hadn’t bought any food for their house, his brother had no food for dinner and his dad gave him $20 to get him food. I was confused and just accepted that we’d have to get his brother food first before we could go out and eat together. 

So I pick up my bf and his brother and we’re driving to Burger King to get him food, when my bf discreetly texts me a few times asking if we should just bring his brother with us to get ramen. By this point I was already annoyed since I was hungry since I hadn’t eaten at work all day, and knowing my bf bailed on my the night before, I just wanted a nice date night alone with him. 
So I didn’t respond to his texts about his brother coming along and we got his brother his food and took him back to his house. 

Then later when my bf and I are finishing up at the ramen place he brings it up and says how his brother had been home all day just doing nothing and we could’ve let him come. I immediately get upset since first off my bf didn’t think we were going on a date, and second, seemed to totally forget that he stood me up the night before, and third, always makes his brother out to be a victim since their dad doesn’t help him much but in my eyes it’s not my problem and I can’t fix their home life. He also is always depressed and down my bf says and basically smokes all day to cope, which again isn’t my problem.

c7d35l	2019-06-30 12:45:09	abenson24811	AITA or bullied at work	"Hello friends,

Long time fan, first time poster. One of my coworker continues to get on my nerves to the point where I literally cry at work. For example, she goes behind my back to trash talk me to the bosses, infantilizes me in front of patients, deliberately antagonizes me to the point where I tell her not to send something because it’s not done and 10 mins later it’s sent. Also she encourages me to reschedule dr’s appointments to accommodate her schedule and lift things with an injured back and come into work while sick, which is really taking a toll on my health, to the point where often I’m in so much pain I start crying and nobody cares.

Finally, she takes credit for my work and has a much sunnier personality than I do in addition to communicating more, so management has shown a lot of favoritism towards her. She gets higher authorship even on  papers for which I do most of the work, preference in project assignment, a better computer, and allowance to go to several conferences while I haven’t gone to any.

Edit: she also, in my frank opinion, has the worst work ethic I have ever seen and is incapable of figuring things out for herself. She’s switched between 3 different jobs in the last year. It seems like she’s lived most of her life taking credit for the work of others. I was honestly fine with everything until I got sick and she started taking shots at my illness through reprimanding me for doctors appointments and getting mad at me for being ill in front of patients.

I’m thinking about going to HR to complain with formalized documentation. If I did so, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7cw1j	2019-06-30 12:32:16	tadpole511	AITA for not listening to my sister?	"Background: I am the middle of three children. Five years younger than my sister, and two years older than my brother. Always been closer to my brother than my sister, though, if we’re being super honest, I’m not really even *that* close to my brother.

Basically, my sister and I have never gotten along. We fought constantly as kids, and when she left for college, communication pretty much stopped entirely. Lots of rocky times during the next five years, which included her moving back home, stealing my stuff, lying constantly, and even a death threat towards me. Around the time I left for college, my parents ended up kicking her out. I completely cut off contact at this point, so everything after this point is secondhand info from my parents.

Apparently no one’s 100% sure exactly what was going on during this time because she’s a pathological liar. Though we eventually found out that, among other things, she was telling people that her dad was dead, and her step-dad (who is in reality all our dad) was abusive to her. She continued stealing and eventually got arrested. Got bailed out by a friend and fled the state.

Around my senior year of college, she had all immediate and most extended family and friends blocked on social media. Though we discovered she had gotten married and was living a couple hours away. My mom tried to reestablish contact with her, though I had zero interest. I did continue getting secondhand info though. There were accusations of abuse, favoritism, lies about pregnancies and adoptions, and general abuse directed to my mom. Now, my mom is not perfect, but she absolutely does not deserve this kind of treatment. 

During this time, I moved overseas and got engaged. As far as I know, she knows nothing of either of these developments in my life. I recently got a message from her saying that she’s sorry she was so awful, and she wants to get back in touch. It was completely out of the blue. We haven’t spoken or seen each other in at least 7 years, and, as far as I’m concerned, I don’t have a sister anymore. I really don’t believe her at all—she has a history of being hugely manipulative, and from everything I’ve heard, she hasn’t changed in the slightest. But my fiancé thinks I should at least hear her out, and if she hasn’t changed, then I can cut contact again.

c7chka	2019-06-30 12:06:13	slavetothecustomers	AITA for staying the night at a guy's house my friend had a crush on?	"Context:
The friend in question (now former friend for the following reasons) is a very charismatic person, everyone likes her, and she abuses that to her advantage. She is the ""leader"" of her friend group, and decides who gets isolated from and who gets into the group. If she decides somebody is an asshole, everyone will turn away from that person no questions asked. 
We lost contact twice because of this, the last time because of this situation. She used to be my best friend, and I loved her to pieces, but I realized how fake she is. 
She also has a boyfriend (not the guy in the title).

Onto the story!

Cast:
Me - Me
FF - Former Friend
C - Former Friends 'crush'

A few years after the first time we lost contact, I contacted FF to reconnect and maybe get to our good old friendship again. She instantly said yes and I met her friend group. We all got along well and went clubbing together, that's when I met FF's boyfriend and C for the first time.
We went out more and more as a group, until I started talking to C more because I felt bad for him, always sitting by himself a bit further away. FF excused herself to the toilet and took me with her to tell me C has a huge crush on her and she's not sure if she maybe even likes him back. I let her know that if she wants to explore her options, she needs to reconsider her current relationship, and that was it. 

Or so I thought. 

The next time we went out, I got pretty wasted and missed my last bus home. I had no money on me to spend on a taxi, so I asked around if I can stay at anyone's place for the night. C said I can go with him. 
I didn't think anything of it because 1. I was not even close to interested romantically in him and 2. FF had a BOYFRIEND. 
Well I stayed the night (literally nothing happened apart from him drunkenly checking my pulse on my fitness watch before falling asleep) and the morning after went home.

I thought it's all good.

Nope.

The group wanted to meet for a round of Billard at a local cinema, to which I went. Everyone that came ignored me apart from one sweet person who probably didn't get the memo. 

I texted FF afterwards and asked what was wrong. 
Apparently she thought I had sex with C, which I didn't so I told her.
All she said was ""Ok"" and change her WhatsApp status to ""Fuck Fake Friends""

I also texted C (who wasn't there that day) to ask what the fuck was happening and he had no idea. He didn't even like her that much, he just hangs out with her because FF's boyfriend is C's best friend, which made this situation all the more confusing.

I feel like she wanted to manipulate me into something by saying she has a crush on him and he's crazy about her, and I don't know what it is.

I guess it's been 8 or 9 years that I set up my mom and aunts Facebook accounts, for both I used the same password which I came to find out, neither has changed. They are so typical ""old people Facebook""  it's not even funny. 

They live two doors down from each other but haven't spoken in months over some slight that I don't really understand. I didn't want to get involved. But on Thursday my aunt posted a family picture and tagged my mom. This led to the most embarrassing old person flame war I've ever seen. It started off with jabs and deceased into accusations of each of the sleeping with different cousins growing up, my grandpa using lsd in the 60s, car wrecks, pet theft, illegimate children and other little things. Thier other siblings and cousins begged them to stop but then that woukd start side flame wars that caused other issues. 

Finally I had enough because they were talking around but still insulting me and my pregnant wife. Just to test it out, I logged into my moms, then my aunts and just deleted the picture and comment thread. Then I changed the password on each account. I went by and put a note on each of thier doors explaining I had thier accounts and I'd give them back when they grew up. I haven't heard from either of them.

My sister (who got called a ""Tr-mp fucker"" in the war, so her reaction really surprises me) said I way overstepped my boundaries. I probably did but was I the asshole?

c7cdw3	2019-06-30 11:59:44	hotcuppateapls	AITA for refusing to feed my son kosher despite his fathers strong insistence I do ?	"My ex husband is Jewish, but a cheeky Jew who breaks rules such as shomer negia, not being adherent of the laws of shabbat, has tattoos etc. We’d been together for 15 years.

One thing he has always done is keep strict kosher, and when we were married I kept that with him along with our son who is now 12.

We divorced 3 years ago (infidelity...another major no no in Judaism!) We used to live in a central Jewish hub in London but after our separation I obviously couldn’t afford to live in London and so moved back to my home town in Hertfordshire into a more modest house to be closer to my family. He offered me the entire home but running costs were just silly and not something I could afford with my job. 

My ex is very close to his son and the two maintain a strong and loving bond. However, my son has privately expressed to me that he isn’t sure if he wants to eat kosher anymore, AND to be honest, I’m on a minimum wage job that means sometimes I need to do cheap and cheerful dinners that are convenient for me. I could make it work with kosher but it would be far less convenient and I don’t have space for two kitchens either. 

I told my ex that I was thinking of not keeping kosher in my home, as we get on very well and are two level headed adults. I can usually trust him enough with different POV in how we raise our son. He was horrified and offered me an extra huge stipend a month solely to feed my son kosher. He already pays for EVERYTHING for our son, I can’t fault him and he really does contribute towards so much, but I would feel awful taking this money when I know my son doesn’t even want to eat kosher.

He has practically begged me to move back to London or allow our son to move back to London with him (not happening) so that he can be immersed in a more Jewish upbringing as Hertfordshire isn’t really much by way of multi faith diversity. 

I feel terribly for my ex husband because I know he is worried about a dwindling Jewish identity and he wants more than anything for our son to be a proud Jew. I also know my son is torn between two ‘identities’ and I want his life to be as easy as possible. He had to give up Hebrew lessons, he sees his family only on major Jewish holidays, etc. I mourn that for him.

Backstory:
We're studying at a boarding school so it's relatively easy to get about (important). This was when we arranged a study group. Anyways, suddenly all the girls got a meeting for some ladies night shit (she has no control over this) and they made and announcement for it (I wasn't aware of the announcement and she thought I knew) anyways she texts me to wait at the meeting place for her. And I waited 30 MINS before I told she had better hurry before I leave. 

Clarification:
I know the text is quite an asshole move. But she's currently crying over it (it was just pasive aggressive). Telling me I'm mean and that I ruin her life. She's badmouthing me at this point. Also,      I always joke about stuff like this. If i were to say these exact things to one of my normal friends they'll usually just laugh and tell me to fuck off (not kidding). When I originally texted it was bcos I was bored (had a friend with me to keep company) so I jokingly texted her that (I've done this plenty of times to plenty of people). I know it might seem psychopathic but knowing me passive aggressive isn't even aggressive. It's just me bothering people for fun (done this tons of times. They laugh too)

1. We were best friends before I decided to unfriend her because she's overreactive and overdramatic

2. She has daddy issues (I'm already aware of this) and she blames me for provoking her memory of that (she views me as a daddy figure wtf. We're not even friends anymore)

3. This isn't the first time out study group went wrong. Last time I hung up on her bcos I was tired of answering her questions for confirmation (on place eventhough we talked about it). (I still went there btw. She was nowhere to be seen) She's saying I'll let her down again.

4. She's saying she's expecting more from me considering we were best friends and I treat her worst than I treat other people (False I treat all my friends that way, she's just the most emotional of them all)

5. She's saying me threatening made her very scared (for some stupid reason)

6. I didn't know there was a meeting and had already waited 30 whole minutes

7. I'm still associating with her bcos of an upcoming competition

Am I the asshole?

c7c92r	2019-06-30 11:52:27	biskedasticity	WIBTA if I confronted my sister about how she is raising her child.	"I have lived with my sister for many months, and ofc been around her before that. Now that her kid is getting older, I have been getting concerned with how she's raising him. 
Context her only son is 7 almost 8 and she is a single mother. 

1. She still sleeps with him in her bed. He doesn't have his own bed or his own room, they completely share one. There is another room in the place, but she uses it as a guest bedroom instead. It has gotten to the point where he cant fall asleep unless someone else is in the room. 

2. There have been times where she will go; switch over laundry or take the trash out, and she doesnt tell her kid. When he looks around and can't find her he immediately panicks. ""Wheres mom"". The second she comes back he will run to her and hug her and say he misses her. There was a time where she was late coming come, while I was babysitting. She said she would be home at 12,and when 12 :30 hit her kid started throwing a fit about her being late and cried. Despite me telling him she said she would be late. 

3. She aids him in his panick by talking about her death. ""If I die you can go live with nana and granpa"". 

4. She speaks through her child when she doesnt want to do things like "" I dont think *insert childs name* would like that"" even though sometimes her kid will pipe up and say he wants to do it. She let's him do whatever, and helps him often. Sometimes when he cant find things he will literaly just stand wherever he is look around and go ""can you find it for me"" and she does, without fail everytime. 

I feel I should confront her. I may not be a doctor but this seems like textbook separation anxiety, and he is only 7. I have talked with my mom about it and she agrees that my sister may not see what's going on. I am just worried what this could do to a kid over time, because seeing a kid panick at such a young age about things that are not panick worthy is worrying."	No A-holes here	0	0

So 2 days later, I was missing her and I texted her, she seemed super dry and had zero interest in talking with me, later on I found that she was/is mad because I took the break and kept saying that I wanted to take a break from her, she said she was wondering if she wanted to keep being friends and now she's ghosting me.

I had out of town visitors and we were going to attend an event, but I said I could check on them before and after the event. 

So on our way out, I stopped into their place and got the larger dog out of the crate, but their smaller dog (who I actually haven’t ever met) was growling and when i opened his crate, he didn’t leave it. So I shut it. And took the big dog outside for a little walk. 

When I went back up. I noticed the little dog was out of their crate. I must have not shut the door properly. The big dog went into his crate easily. But the small dog was hiding under the sofa. And when I reached down, he was growling. I tried to entice him with a treat. But nope. He wasn’t moving. And I had to leave for the event. So I did. Big dog in the his crate. And little dog under the sofa as I just couldn’t get him to go back in his. I texted the owner and said “[bjg dog name] went back in no problem. I tried to bribe the little guy with treats. But he wasn’t moving. Growled when I tried to scoop him out. He just Dosent know me well enough yet. He’s hiding under the couch and won’t move. And growls when I try to move him. I hope he Doesn’t totally destroy anything! Sorry! I figured he’d go out with me. Otherwise I wouldn’t have even tried and just left the small crate door shut. “

After the event. I texted my neighbour saying it even late and it might be another hour or so until I could get back. She said that’s ok, because she was on her way home. 

When she got home. I got a text saying “So [small dog name] absolutely fucked the whole house up. Like are shoes ripped papers up omg”. I replied with “:/ I’m so sorry I didn’t try harder to put him back in. I feel terrible. “

And now she’s not talking to me at all.

I had two very good friends Z and H.. i don't know what happened but for some reason Z suddenly started coming off as distant, responding to messages too late, etc. I asked him about it but he acted like nothing was wrong, after a few tries i stopped trying because it felt too onesided (I should mention here that he didn't notice this at any point and never bothered reaching out)

A few weeks after this, H calls me and asks about Z, apparently he wasn't talking to her properly aswell (H and Z were way too close, and probably more than just friends), I have a lot of respect for H and I felt like I should talk to Z and ask what's up, Z's explains but one thing leads to another and suddenly hes onto me saying he thought I actually called him to apologize or maybe to patch things up  and compares me to his exes for leaving him. I was stunned and didn't get a chance to say anything during his rant but later I sent a long and well written message explaining everything from my perspective, to which he simply replied ""okay"" And didn't respond further

Him calling me out the like triggered my anxiety and i faced some tough time after that fight.. So  when Z messaged me in our group chat  and asked me whats up and why I was avoiding them after 5 months, I didn't say anything and simply left the group chat. After which he DMed me privately saying that I was being extremely rude and that he cared about me and was always there for me in whatever way he could have been, i send him that screenshot in which i had defended myself and he hadnt bother to respond to it to which he laughed it off saying its too long to read and lets just take things the way they are..

Z didn't clarify his stance and neither did he tell what i had done wrong.. So reddit, AITA for ignoring Z just like he ignored me?


EDIT: for those who are saying theres not enough info.. Z, H and I met while we were interns, i have a history of anxiety and he was aware of it. While talking once, he told me that he thinks i don't trust people and don't let people into my life because i think they will leave me. So he claimed that he will NEVER do that to me and help me overcome my fears. I didn't like the idea but didn't say anything either. Although afterwards he actually was there and helped me get through a lot of stuff..

The last big thing i knew about him was when his mother was sick and in the hospital. i regularly checked up on him, tried to cheer him up in anyway i could think of, his mother got better but he never told me when she left the hospital. His brother wedding was right after that so i figured he was busy at that time (Although i found out about the wedding from from H and not Z) me and H were active in our group chats but he wasn't after that.. i know i am paranoid and Z and H did too, and if i had fears or insecurities i would ask them and they'd help.. so when i started feeling he was getting too distant i asked him specifically, asked him to read the chat of the past few days and said that i felt like he didn't really want to talk, he just laughed. I figured if he wanted to talk he could message aswell, which would a proof that would keep my paranoia at bay aswell.. so i left the chat  there.

c7c42d	2019-06-30 11:35:13	HollowAllo	AITA - Was my mom the asshole for getting in an argument with someone in Starbucks?	"This is a pretty short story, but I thought I should post it here anyways even if it happened a few years ago, since it was pretty eventful. Plus I didn't know where else to put it.

For context ; my parents and I were driving home from a trip, and wanted to get some Starbucks before we went on the road again.

I was walking behind my mom when we got out of the car to walk into the Starbucks, and my mom went to open the door and hold it open for me.

Here enters **Cunt**, (*C for short*) talking on her phone to one of her friends, from what I was guessing. She proceeded to act like I didn't exist and walked in front of me. My mom waited for me to go inside, but I got blocked by C before I was even able to walk inside. Confused on why my mom wasn't letting her inside, C lowered her phone and cleared her throat. ""*Excuse me. Can you let me through?*"" She says, sounding annoyed and entitled. ""I'm holding the door open for my kid."" My mom said, getting a little bit annoyed, pointing to me, behind C. Keep in mind, there were **2** doors.

My mom pushes me inside and lets the door close on her as we walk into the store. My mom orders for us while I went to the bathroom (*it's important. yes*). As I came outside, I see this bitch yelling at my mom, grabbing the attention of everyone in the cafe. I felt my face turn red. I shot her the nastiest glare I could muster and she stopped, glancing at me and the back at my mom, blabbering to the cashier and continuing to talk to her phone. I was surprised a glare from a 13 year old would shut that woman up. I don't blame her. I have a resting bitch face that gives that ; ""Don't talk to me."" vibe.

We walked outside and entered our car as I happily sipped on my hot chocolate. C came out of the store and was *still*talking on her phone. My mom stared at her and gave her the bird as she pulled out of the parking lot. C was a bit baffled but shot her a nasty glare along with a bird from her.

So, I suppose this applies to my mom. Was *she* the asshole?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c7c2rb	2019-06-30 11:30:36		AITA for trash talking my general manager?	"I work at a restaurant that has high manager turnover. So high that we currently have two assistant managers filling in from other locations. It’s pretty much down to just the GM and the fill in managers. 

Because of this there is really horrible communication between management and employees. I also understand that my GM is under a great deal of stress and pressure from her bosses. 

I am an incredibly hard worker and great with guests. Today I even had a guest call after we closed and asked to speak with a manager. Apparently she wanted to let them know about the awesome server they had that evening, which ended up being me.  

Recently my manager has been using me as a punching bag. I feel like I can’t make it a single day without having some kind of negative interaction with her. I have always been a “yes, girl” and I think she started to take advantage of that. 

She speaks to me in a tone an impatient parent would speak to a disobedient child with. She tries to make me feel stupid and embarrass me in front of other employees. Whenever I speak to her she looks at me with a confused expression and tells me to slow down and repeat what I said. It’s to the point that whenever I talk to her I make sure I speak slowly and yet she still does it. 

I do not know a single employee that isn’t considering quitting because of her poor management, myself included. 

We have been having a lot of different managers filling in over the past few months and they all have seemed to notice her negativity. One of them in particular seems to have a interest in the horrible morale and asked me what I thought. 

So this is where I think I wander into asshole territory. 

I expressed my frustrations and he said he would like to bring the issues with our location up with the regional directors. I feel good about that. Although, I do worry about repercussions if I am mentioned specifically and it gets back to her. 

The thing is, it felt REALLY good to have someone in management listen to me and care about what was happening. We kind of started making little, casual comments about her to each other. I’m not sure if he does it with other employees. Although, I have overheard conversations with other servers confiding in him about their issues with management. 

I feel like his interest has kind of peaked a mutiny. We make comments to each other about her being passive aggressive and unapproachable. She’ll say something rude to someone and when she walks away we comment on it. I hate to say it, but hating on her has made the job much more bearable.

c7byaw	2019-06-30 11:14:17		AITA For feeling upset that my friend did sexual stuff with another girl?	"There is this friend that I like, and he likes me back. However, because I do not believe in long distance relationships, we are not dating. Because of how we both are, we still fell into a pattern of telling each other lovey dovey stuff and doing things whenever we are together.

I am in college still, and have never entered a relationship. I didn’t and don’t want my first relationship to be with a guy who lives a thousand miles apart and that I can only see occasionally. I also didn’t want to be in a situation where I was interested in a guy but couldn’t pursue anything with them because I had a boyfriend who I could almost never see really far away. Likewise, I would hate myself if the guy I was interested in stopped himself from pursuing something with a girl because of me. In fact, I want him to move on from me as soon as possible, because otherwise I am afraid that I would be holding him back. Due to this, I have encouraged him to go on dates or hook up with girls in general. Maybe encourage is the wrong word, it’s more like “Oh girl X seems interested in you? Maybe you should try something out with her”. Regardless, he hasn’t yet.

With this in mind, this past weekend a bunch of our mutual internet friends went to visit him, I couldn’t go. Before our mutual friends went to visit, he caught wind that one of the girls liked him. However, he reiterated multiple times that he was absolutely not interested in this girl, that he wouldn’t want to do anything with her, and that his disinterest in her had nothing to do with me, she was just completely not his type. 

Yesterday when we we texted about how the trip was going, he implied that something did happen between them, but was very vague. I got a little upset, and told him that if something did happen, I rather find out from him than one of our blabbermouth’s friends. He then got defensive and told me he didn’t have to tell me anything.

He was correct, he didn’t have to tell me anything. Because of our situation we came to an agreement that neither of us had to tell each other if we did anything with anyone else. Once he said this I apologized, told him he was right, and that he should go on to enjoy the vacation.


But honestly, I feel completely heart broken. I don’t know why. I think it’s because I feel lied too but I’m not sure. If he was interested in doing stuff with her, he could’ve just told me and I would’ve understood. But he seemed so vehemently opposed it just struck me out of nowhere. It doesn’t help he was texting me lovey dovey things throughout the days as well as some lowkey sexual stuff as well. I kind of feel like I should completely cut him off my life. I know it’s irrational but I can’t think about the situation without feeling terrible. Even if it was something purely physical, why would he say one thing and then do the opposite? Everything was so out of the blue. AITA for feeling this way or WIBTA if I went through with how I feel?"		1	0
c7bwb3	2019-06-30 11:07:25		AITA for not doing what my dad wanted me to do when he wanted me to do it	"So a few days ago (on Friday) I was playing videogames with my little brother having some brother-sister bonding time when around 6 pm my parents get home from work and grocery shopping. This is what usually happens on Friday night. My dad asks me and my brothers to help unpack the groceries and as we help unpack my dad asks how our day was and other typical parent questions. This is where we take a turn out of usual Friday night shenanigans, my dad asks if I've reported to this government company that gives money to those who are unemployed. I told him no since I didn't think I had to because I had already received money from said company in my bank account. He told me to still do it anyway as that might of been the money that i didn't recive from the past two or three weeks. I said I'd do it later because 

1) I didn't exactly now how to reported as i've never done it before. 

2) I wanted to eat dinner first and wanted to to it when I'd head back into my bedroom for the night. 

3) I was in the middle of a race with my brother (we were playing a racing game) 

My dad said that I have to do it now and I told him no. This turned into a back and forth of him telling me to do it and me telling him no, our voices getting louder each time.  My dad then started several senteces where he was going to threaten me with some sort of punishment to do with electrical devices (I.E playstation ban, Phone and laptop ban etc.) but never finished those sentences because i'm now legally an adult. The only threat he could think of was kick me out of the house, I told him to kick me out because i knew he was bluffing or so i thought. He then told me to pack my bag and leave, so I did I only grabbed my handbag, phone and beanie because I thought he'd come after me and tell me to come home (spoiler alert he didn't) as I went to walk out the door my mum through her tears begged me not to go but I told her dad didn't want me here and I walked right out the door. 

The further I got from my house the more I started to fear that my parents weren't gonna come after me. Eventually my mum and only my mum caught up to me me and convinced me to get in the car and we went to McDonald's got some nuggets and sat in the parking lot and talked for a while. She told me that it doesn't matter if dad does or doesn't want me home because she does, she also said that after i'd left not only her but my brothers cried aswell. We ended up driving around the city before going home. I was expecting my dad to say something to me when got home and have a big chat about what happened but he didn't say anything to me and hasn't said anything since.  

It's been two days and i'm only now starting to think that maybe I was in the wrong and I should be the first one to say sorry. Should I be the first one to speak up and apologise or sould my it be dad.

c7brua	2019-06-30 10:50:41	nofamilytripnow	"AITA for not wanting to go on a ""fun family"" trip for my sister's birthday, a few days after my grandma died?"	"  

So, I'll try to keep this short cause the idea for a family trip just came up and my mother is still trying to convince me to go.

I (20/M), littler sister (16/F). We aren't really on friendly terms, more neutral. She being my sister and I being her brother is basically the only thing that connects us.

A few days ago, my grandma past away. She was an amazing person with so much love. Grandpa passed a long time ago. I am still grieving, and upcoming week her funeral will be held.

This shocked us all, we knew that things were bad, but we were all hoping it wouldn't happen so soon.

Today is my little sister's birthday. Because of the bad news, we didn't have a family party. My little sister did have a party here with all her friends yesterday. But she also wants to do something today, some distraction. 

So, she wants to go to a theme park. Suddenly, out of nowhere. I understand that you want to do something, that's fine. But sadly, all her friends are on vacation, or working (after re-reading this I wonder where all of her friends from yesterday went). So, my mom wants my little brother and me to come along too, so it'll be a family trip.

My mom and sister are both kinda manipulative, and for the last year, I've been trying to not be manipulated into doing what they want. If they'd did this in the past year, I might've forced myself to go with them, but I don't want that anymore. I don't want to go, I am grieving too, just like them of course, but I want to deal with it in my own way (talking to friends, resting, minding my own stuff). I've lived too long like that, and it's exactly the reason I want to move out for the coming semester.

So, please tell me. Am I the Asshole for not wanting to go?

Thanks in advance, doesn't matter what choice you made."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I'm a 14 year old girl and there are only girls in my house. My mum has a tight routine for washing and housework that we all help with, and part of that is she does all of the clothes washing if we do other stuff around the house. Unfortunately today felt like the last straw. She works hard in her job so relaxes a lot at home, that also means only washing  everything at the same settings. All of my clothes end up crumpled, soft colours get dirty and the most annoying, all of my bras end up crumpled and in weird shapes just because she won't turn the heat setting down a tad on the washing machine.
I feel ungrateful because she always has ways of making me feel like I should deal with it. She's too tired from work, doesn't have a lot of time, feeling ill so she she doesn't want to be working at home as well. I'm willing to do all of my own washing, ironing and tidying if it means I don't have to wear bras with pads that resemble play dough mounds and straps that curl up like pizza rolls. 
So WIBTA for getting annoyed at her for ruining a lot of my clothes? It feels stupid because she bought all them for me but for gods sake, my t-shirts look horrendous. My school uniform is a mess, and my underwear drawer looks assaulted.

c7bqlf	2019-06-30 10:44:46	yeehawmilktea	AITA for being upset at my mother over a pair of contact lenses?	"Hi Reddit,

I'd say I'm a pretty self-conscious person. I first started wearing glasses when I was 8, and I have been wearing them ever since... Until two days ago, when I purchased two pairs of contact lenses for a drama performance where I couldn't wear my glasses. I made a deal with my mother that she would contribute to buying my contact lenses so that I would be able to wear them consistently on Wednesdays, when I have both dance and volleyball, activities where I can't really wear my glasses. We agreed that I would wear glasses for the rest of the week.

When I came home from the performance, my mother started to compliment my face, which made for a nice change. She went into detail about how my ""cheeks weren't squished down anymore"" and how my eyes were ""brighter and less droopy"" etc. She then started talking about how glasses made me look ""unattractive"" and ""nerdy"". 

On its own, those comments would probably be fine. However, I've struggled with self-esteem fairly consistently during my life. I used to get bullied a lot as a kid for my appearance and intelligence etc. Around the time I got glasses, I had also transferred to another school where I was treated way better, so I think I subconsciously associated my bare, non-glasses-wearing face with ugly, gross, etc. My mother knows all of this. 

So I got a bit upset at her. No yelling or swearing or anything, but I quietly told her it upset me to hear her describe something that i had worn for practically my whole life as ugly and something that makes me look unattractive. I told her that made me feel like I've always been ugly, and I would really really prefer if she didn't say that, and that her comments were mean and degrading, especially considering that contact lenses weren't my full-time option, I will still almost always be wearing glasses anyways.

Immediately, my sister and dad jumped in and started berating me on how I should really be taking it as a compliment, and that *this* was why they never complimented me. They were in complete agreement with my mother and believed that I was being a ""brat"" and ""picky"".   
Reddit, is there something I'm missing? My family doesn't normally really do this, and I can't help but feel like maybe I did something wrong.

EDIT: I generally do take off my glasses at night, so it’s not a case of my mother being surprised at my bare face, if that makes sense."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c7bneb	2019-06-30 10:30:18		WIBTA for reporting a guy that ‘stole’ my phone number on set?	"This happened after I was working on set for a TV movie as a tiny, tiny actor. 

The person in question is one of the drivers for the main actors. 

Him and I talked every now and then during breaks, but nothing special outside of the normal friendly/professional relationship. 

However, two days after my last day on set, I got a message on my phone. (I can provide screenshots, they’re just all in German). He had gotten me a mango lassi on set and in the message, asked me how it had tasted - so I immediately knew it was him. 

When asking where he got my number, he replied that a document with small actors and extras contact info was  laying around openly on the table (a huge no-go in itself), and he had seized the chance to get my number and message me. *To his defense*, he did say that if I was uncomfortable he would delete it immediately. 

This man is definitely in his mid-30s, while I’m 21, and we honestly had no flirty vibes on set - so naive as I was, I assumed he was just being friendly. (Dumb, I know)

*However* - he then asked if I was single. Not forbidden, but I realized why he was messaging me now. 

I responded with: “Yes, but I don’t want our conversation to go into that direction.”

Him: “Oh, how come? You’re not in a phase where you hate all men, right?😁 Are you often in [city] or rather in [other city]?”

I told him clearly that I wasn’t interested and he pestered me a bit, but eventually got the message and left me alone. 

**Here’s the thing**: I feel incredibly uncomfortable knowing that the production left my personal information laying around in the open like that. It contained my address, social security number, you name it. I don’t want anyone to lose their job, if anything I would report what happened without name dropping, so they’re more careful in the future and maybe brief the crew that getting phone numbers like this is *not* ok. 

**However**, I talked to a friend who works as a camera assistant and she’s making me have second thoughts. 

She says that he was just taking his shot/being romantic, I would’ve done the same (hell no) and how I’m over-reacting. Apparently, he probably interpreted my friendliness as flirting and that I shouldn’t be ‘so nice’ to men if I can’t handle attention of this nature. She said that I’m at the beginning of my career and a ‘nobody’, so this would shine a negative light on my name and cost me future jobs for starting drama. 

I’m really unsure how to proceed, so, r/AmItheAsshole, WIBTA if I reported this incident or should I let it slide? I’m overwhelmed and would greatly appreciate outside perspectives on this."	Not the A-hole	1	0

"This could get convoluted so I'll just get right to the point: I became a father at 15, and a single father at 17. I won't waste too many characters explaining all of that, but basically high school gf and I were young and dumb, she never really took to mothering and decided that she didn't want to do it at all when presented with the choice of kid or university. By the time my kid was born both of my parents were already dead and my only immediate family were my sister, who is ten years older and who I lived with, and our brother, who is fifteen years older than me and lives abroad. 

As soon as I found out my baby's mother was pregnant, my sister made it very clear she doesn't care for babies and young children at all and, when my daughter was born she wasn't welcome in her home for more than an hour or two at a time and certainly not overnight. When her mother ditched our little girl, my sister basically told me to choose to keep my kid or keep living with her. Of course, I chose my daughter and we moved out. Sister entirely cut me out of her life, stating again that she doesn't like little kids. 

Now my daughter is 9. She's a wonderful kid, and I love her more than anything. Quite apparently, this is the age when she's stopped being a ""little kid"" in my sister's eyes because she's decided she doesn't mind being around her now and is trying to get involved in my life again. I've so far resisted all of her attempts because quite frankly I have no interest in being around her. I had an absolutely hellish time after she kicked me and my little girl out and I'm still angry that she cared more about not liking kids than she did about me. I didn't expect her to help with the child or anything, I get that she was my ""mistake"" for want of a better term and that I was responsible for her. But kicking me out and cutting off all contact hurt, especially when she was the only family that I had here, and in my mind she made it apparent there that she doesn't really care about me. Perhaps an important note is that she didn't apologise for any of this and feels like she doesn't have to. She's pretty upset that I want nothing to do with her any more, and has complained to our brother who's kinda trying to play peacemaker. I don't think I'm being unreasonable here but who knows, maybe I am. What do you lot, as strangers, think?

ETA: apparently relevant information, so I'll add it. Copy and pasted from a comment: what happened was literally that my kid's mum dropped her off with me one afternoon, was late for pick up, eventually called saying she wasn't coming back and by the next morning kiddo and I were homeless. She blocked me on everything, including my number, and my attempts to reach her through other people were shot down. She unblocked me after 18 months but still ignored my messages and calls.

ETA #2: because people are asking, I was planning on moving out when I turned 18, and when I say my sister kicked me out with no notice I mean she woke me at 6AM and told me I could take whatever I could pack into binbags within half an hour and then I had to get the fuck out of her house."

\- Shitty roads that would make traveling to that rural place last much longer (\~30h that are included in the one week stay)

\- The extreme heat we are not used to (Everybody just naps at daytime)

\- Completely distancing themselves from Country A even if it means traveling this far, not understanding that we owe Country A everything we have (They would never identify as someone from country A when asked)

&#x200B;

I would be staying at my grandmothers house. On top of it all id feel uneasy because my neighbor shot his brother two years ago and we are acting as if not much happened (idk where the police is at). My uncle also had his car stolen in the same place.

&#x200B;

My family acknowledges the problems with the place but they don´t care too much about it because they say it will just be for a week and we will survive. I´d have a few more cousins to go that want to have their weddings there. They have a strong identity and for them its their duty to visit their ""home country"" for such important events in their lives.

Am i the asshole for not wanting to travel along with everyone else to her wedding?"		1	0
c7bh7b	2019-06-30 10:02:46	Someothercyclist	AITA for acting like this?	"Not sure if this belongs here, but I'm trying anyway.

  
Bit of background info: I'm a male in year 8, Australia. I had a crush on a girl from about year 5 to year 7. We have been friends from about year 6 and are still friends today. She has no idea I ever liked her.

Not too long, but there is a TL;DR at the end for people uninterested in judging.

  
Sometime at the beginning of year 7, (around May) there was a school camp being held. The girl I had a crush on was coming on the camp as well. On the second day of camp, she had started to more or less ignore me. One of my other friends, let's call her 'Nicegirl' had been talking to me a lot on a walk we had to do for the camp. We'll call the first girl 'Plant.' When we got to one point of the walk, Plant said something along the lines of 'this is how I act when on a holiday' and called Nicegirl my 'girlfriend' because we had been talking to each other a lot. I was that kid who hated that kind of idea, despite the fact I had a crush at that time.

&#x200B;

Now, the 'AITA' part.

After that point, I had wanted to distance myself from Nicegirl a little bit (I later developed a crush on her, and still do like her. It's mutual.) even though she was being nice. Either that evening or the next, we were watching a movie and Nicegirl ended up sitting next to me. I, again, almost ignored her for a while after. She had also been offering me popcorn that was being handed out, and I didn't take any. I spent my time wishing I had never come to the camp.

&#x200B;

Looking back on this, I fell like a huge \*hole. I tear up just thinking about how I acted. I wish I could go back and just give her a hug or something, she liked hugs. I feel so unappreciative and so ungrateful. I believe I am the \*hole in this situation, what does everyone else think?

&#x200B;

I have done other things on that camp I'm not proud of, but they aren't so relevant. Ask me if you want to know more. You can also ask for any details on Nicegirl if you feel it necessary.

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

I liked a girl, she never knew and wrecked me, a nice girl I now have a mutual crush on was there for me and I more or less ignored her."	No A-holes here	0	0

c7bgm3	2019-06-30 10:00:19		AITA for sleeping with a guy my friend slept with?	So I’m in a friendship group of 3, one of them has a boyfriend and the other one slept with the boyfriend’s friend about a week ago. She said she had no feelings for him whatsoever but he did for her. A couple of nights ago, we were in the club and he asked her to go home with him and when she rejected him (multiple times), he got upset and started giving me attention instead which I liked mostly because at the time i was in a bad mental state and I was trying to fill up the emptiness. I asked her a couple of times whether she minded if I went home with him and she told me no, do whatever you like. So I went home and slept with him. The next day, she lashed out at me, telling me she was really hurt and that I was really disrespectful for sleeping with him just days after she did. She has told me before that she would feel really uncomfortable if one of her close friends ever slept with someone she previously had slept with, which to an extent I understand. I apologized and she told me she forgave me because we are basically sisters and she knows that I feel bad (because I do) but that it’s gonna take time for her to get over it because she can’t be walked over like that again. I just can’t let go of the thought that although I knew the circumstances, she did give me the go ahead to sleep with him and she knew that I did it impulsively because I was upset. If she really didn’t want me to sleep with him she should have just told me. Her defense was that she didn’t really know what to say in the moment. I feel horrible about what i did and how I made her feel; I regret everything about that night but something tells me I’m not 100% to blame. AITA?		1	0

This morning I was flat out told that I wasn’t invited. Her reasoning was that she wanted it to be a small gathering of family and a few friends which I can understand completely.

I was and still am extremely hurt because not only have we been friends since high school, I’ve consistently kept in touch with them, and met up with them since we graduated 6 years ago. Where as the other “friends” invited haven’t and have ignored them when they’ve wanted to catch up (last time we all did was February for her birthday), and haven’t spoken to either of them after that, not even over Facebook. I’m even going to be doing them a favour in November by watching their house and their pets for 2 weeks while she’s in the city having the baby. 

I had just finished staying with them for a week and a half (they live 2 1/2 hours away from the nearest city) and everything was great, there were no arguments not even awkward silences, everything was perfect.

"Recently new neighbors moved in across the street, constantly have parties all night and play loud music. That I can put up with. However, last night of course they are all drinking and doing their regular thing, except its almost july 4th and ya know people here are like 'murica. A few typical fireworks nothing crazy, until they shoot one off that was similar to the sound of an M80. One of those fireworks that shoot up in the air before they go bang. These are illegal and you need a permit in this state to light them off. So after the second time one of those went off, I walked over there and flagged one of them down then 3 others walk up as well, I politely asked them not to light those off as we live in a city setting, where a simple mistake could set a huge fire, not to mention setting them off while drinking. Anyways, after asking the resident to take it down a notch, all 4 of them decided to start yelling, making an effort to start a fight and even going as far as to try and get in my face. So after that is when I decided to contact the local police, and that effort was in vain because no one showed up anyway.
So am I really the asshole here? Tried to cut them a break and be respectful and polite, and they tried to fight me 4 on 1 because of it.

I understand that she works hard and is tired after a day at work and I don't mind doing chores. But she isn't doing anything after work but watching Netflix until bedtime.

c7bckr	2019-06-30 09:41:51		AITA for telling some kids to go kick a ball somewhere else in the park.	"This is a simple case. Some friends and colleagues of mine were having a picnic in Hyde Park, London. 2 very young boys, maybe 5-6 years old, start kicking a rubber ball near our circle, they start getting close and the ball bounces into our circle twice. On the 3rd time I grab the ball, throw it further than they were playing and told them to ""kick the ball over there."" - simple as that.

Now this is when this woman, let's call her Carol, scoffs at my reaction, and starts calling me a grumpy old man. I tell her that they should kick the ball around somewhere else because we don't want to end up with a football bouncing of someone's face. She responds with a flood of: ""it's a park, it's a public place, you aren't more important than they are, you don't own this part of the park, and they are kids, let them have fun""....

Now, I have certain thoughts on that particular line of thinking, and I shared some at the time, mostly how when a group of people sit down in a public area, usually other people respect that tiny remporary plot of land. But apparently that made her repeat her previous points, but with some awkward mock-disabled tone of voice and hand gestures (no kidding, I'm talking wrists up to the chest, ""burr burr I hate children because I'm Goofyface."")

So i t happenes a few weeks ago , but the story starts a long time ago , we live in a small village and all the houses are really next to each other , when my parents got married they moved here to this house , and our neighbors where all kind exept one family , yes its the family of the lady who has AD .

A few months ago I was walking back home from basket ball game with my friends and once i got to the front of my house I see this lady witch is the mother from the family that hated my parents for no reason , and as I was told stories and memories from this  old lady she made my mom and dad's life way harder than it should be , now I saw her right infront of my house just standing I went to the gate to open it when she starts calling me young man, I approached her and answered by saying"" yes ma'am"" , at this moment she stopped talking and then said : ""don't you recognize me son ?"", now at this moment we all knew she had AD, and I didnt want to hurt her mixed feelings I responded by saying ""yes ma'am I do recognize you "" then out of no where she starts telling me that her husband is abusing her and her kids are trying to kick her out of the house and all about her family problems .

1 min into the conversation I told her I need to go to the bathroom and that I will be back to talk to her just so that she stops talking because I really didn't care about her family issues , and I never came back.

Long story short : an old lady who I dont like who has Alzheimer's disease tried talking to me and I ignored her because she used to be mean to my parents.

My parents gave me a credit card linked to one of their accounts and it has my mom's name on it, not mine. It's for emergencies and such as they trust me not to blow their money on stupid stuff. They also said to use it for school stuff in college and for food, since I still live with them and they think they're still responsible for my food. Fine okay, I like it. I also have my own debit card where I put my money earned from babysitting and stuff. I use this when buying stuff for myself and other people (basically things I wouldn't expect my parents to buy for me now)

I go out to eat a lot during school breaks with my friends, some of which are financially comfortable and some of which are not. That's fine and doesn't affect all our friendships, just means that sometimes we need to chill when picking places to eat. We usually split the bill (we end up eating at places with family style meals most of the time) and everyone puts either cash or their debit cards down. I put my credit card down and sometimes a friend sitting next to me would comment sarcastically like ""wow fancy credit card"" seeing my mom's name. I know it's not meant to insult, just pointing out I happen to be the most well off in the group. I don't flaunt it or anything, I just try to quietly have fun with my friends. 

AITA for using my parents' money to pay for food when I'm with my friends? Is it rude and should I be using my debit card? I can handle using it but I prefer to save for other stuff and use the CC for food. But I might unintentionally be coming off as stuck up."	No A-holes here	1	0

I shipped a box to her with gifts for my grandmother as well, since she would be visiting. I was unaware that my aunt (A) would also be visiting my mother when this box of souvenirs arrived.. so, since I didn’t have anything in the box for A, I asked my mother to not open it in the presence of her. The box arrived when A was at my mother’s house, and she apparently urged my mom to open it and was excited to see what I sent. 

It was a lot of stuff. Sake, tons of candy and food, purses, accessories, stationery, etc. My aunt apparently got tearful and felt a little left out. 

I feel really, really bad about this, mostly because I love A very much but our relationship isn’t super close and I did not go out of my way to get her anything. We talk a few times a year and exchange a gift at Christmas but souvenir shopping for her didn’t even cross my mind.

c7b4q3	2019-06-30 09:07:57	BroadTelephone	AITA for not offering support to a friend/coworker	"It's very common around here to have be good friends with your coworkers since we all somewhat live for work. We have seasonial work and during the season you live in homes provided by the company. You work in different groups, usually 2 to 6 people on different projects.

During the first few months this year I was having a really difficult time, my mental health was horrible. At first that was something that I could handle without bothering others, but I got worse to point where I wasn't able to do my work load for 2 to 3 weeks. (Yes you could call in sick but that's a big deal around here so you usually handle it internally with your project group.) That, understandably, annoyed my coworkers because they had to do my work now, sometimes on short notice.

Long story short, my main project group for this season and I had a big fight, but considering that we work together, live together and have been friends for a few years now, we sorted it out and everything went back to normal. But that's not the case with that one friend I'm talking about. She went on a 4 week vacation shortly before the whole ""We all like each other again"" happened. (You don't get days off during season, that's what the off season is for, but if your groups are okay with taking your work no one cares. It's also not uncommon.)

While gone she basically told me that she doesn't consider us being friends anymore and that she's going to request to be not put in the same projects as me in future seasons. At that point we stopped talking until she came back. I asked her if we wanted to hang out some time, talk about stuff. She said no.

After being back she didn't really get back on track. She left meetings early, didn't show up at all and didn't do the work assigned to her. It was obvious that something wasn't right. Now I'm the last person to give you shit for something like that, that would be highly hypocritically of me.

I was worried about her, but she's actually quite scary, so I asked a coworker if he could go ask her what's wrong, since she was planning on leaving for a few days again this week. (And we have a deadline on monday, you don't leave that close to a deadline unless something is really wrong.) Turns out that due to the heatwave a family member of her died.

So my question now is am I the asshole for not offering her any support or kind words? I feel a lot like I wouldn't be the right person to do that, but at the same time I know that she was already in that bad headspace when she ended our friendship so I'm not sure how sure she's about that. Also I really could have needed more support earlier this year even though I tend to push people away when I feel unwell and I do not want to make the same mistakes regarding her, that they did regarding me."

"So a few months ago I had a friend that was in a tight spot and needed a place to stay, he was practically at my house 6 days a weeks as is and I was fine with it due to knowing/understanding his situation. 

After a while we both came to an agreement that he would pay me a small sum for every month he stayed with me. 

After the first month he was very late with payment and shows up to my house with a new laptop. I ask what the deal is and after pulling some teeth I get half of what he owes and a week or so and some more teeth later I get the other half. The second month he said I’d have the money by a certain day and again did not receive said money. I confronted him a few times throughout the month about it and he said that he was leaving the beginning of next month and we’d be settled by the time he left. 

He left and I never saw any money. So I decided that I wouldn’t put any effort into the friendship. For the time being out of my frustration. A cooling off period perhaps. 

Months later after he was gone I get a call from him asking for an account number to send money to and I receive the agreed amount. 
I struck up a conversation because we’re still friends at the end of the day and he admitted that he was upset that I reacted the way I did, not talking/ignoring him and then now that he’s paid me I’m trying to act like nothing happened. 

I tried to explain that I wasn’t upset that he didn’t pay. Just that he didn’t communicate with me. All I asked for and needed from him was a “hey I don’t have the money now but give me a few weeks/months and we’ll be good” but he just up and left one night after owing me money for months and moved across the country. 

I felt slighted in the situation and taken advantage of because I offered my home to him and all I needed was some reassurance that he hadn’t forgotten about it. 

He explained that I have known him long and well enough that I shouldn’t have assumed he would leave it unpaid, and that I should have had more faith. 

In my mind when he finally paid, 
1) I wasn’t mad about the situation as much or at all anymore. And willing to let the friendship continue. 
2) that the issues with money are now water under the bridge since he paid his “debt” to me.

In the long run I learned that you shouldn’t let your friends stay on your couch.

At first we had a silent pact of taking turns to pay when going out, but recently she stopped paying for her share, even when she is the one suggesting fancy places.  When the bill comes at the fancy places, she looks the other way.

Every time I tell her about this she starts crying, and says that as a man I should not bring this up. She says she'll pay in some of the dates, but not all of them.

As far as I know, she's not having any financial issues, and her arguments never include financial problems. Her only argument is that she's a woman, and so I should be the one covering most of our dates.

Note also that she is the one always suggesting to go out, I'm a pretty simple guy, and don't need to eat out, let alone go to fancy places.

Overall she is a really nice girl, seems to really love me, but I can't stop feeling that in a future with houses and kids, all the financial burden will be on me.

So weekend before the test, I badly injured my leg. Like could not walk, in complete agony whenever I moved it. On the day of the test, leg felt a bit better, could walk on it again but still was sore. I hadn't had the time to study properly as I was in bed the whole weekend in so much pain that I couldn't focus on anything, so decided to get a doctor's note and skip the test. Note my grade for the class relied on this test, I needed to pass but hadn't studied enough to do so because of the injury. Could I have studied earlier? Yes probably, but I chose to leave it til the weekend before because I didn't anticipate not being able to. I had done a bit of looking over notes etc, but this class' professor was a hard marker so it would not have been enough. My friend said I should have sat the test, and took the consequence of waiting til the weekend before to properly study. Was I the asshole? At the time I thought it was fair, I was still injured just not as badly on the day of the test, couldn't guarantee that the walking required to get there wouldn't have led to leg getting worse, but I mean I technically could have made it to the test, just didn't want to take the risk.

c7atcl	2019-06-30 08:18:19	anonymous_28626	WIBTA if I married a similarly-minded woman even though I'm a gay man?	"I should explain: there's no LGBT marriage or adoption/surrogacy in my country. The family bonds are quite strong and there's an expectation you'll get married and have children by the time you've reached mid-late 20s.

When I was in university, I dated a man for a longer period. It was a secret relationship, like most gay relationships are. He left me after two years because he wanted to ""stop wasting time and focus on starting a family"", or something along those lines. That break-up mentally devastated me, but at the same time, I think it made me contemplate my reality and options.

I rarely get sexually attracted to women. Still, I can have strong intimate feelings for female friends, and I've kissed women before and genuinely liked it, although not as much as kissing other men. But I have a strong desire to be a father, to care for my kids, and I think I'd do a good job at that. I also have a stable and secure job in naval engineering and I could provide for my family.

There's a female friend whom I've known since childhood. Since returning to my hometown, we've been spending a lot of time together. She's a wonderful person and we share many similar interests regarding the future, family, values in life etc. My parents like her, though I'm sure they're also worried for me because I'm turning 27 and I'm still single. But the social pressure aside, if I ended up marrying someone like her, I think we'd make for great parents. She's traditional (in the no sex before marriage kind of way) and wants to be a mother more than anything. I relate to that strong will to be a parent.

Given the circumstances, WIBTA or unfair if I did this? Not saying I'm going to marry my female friend whom I mentioned, we aren't in a serious relationship yet. But in general terms, to be able to have my own family."	No A-holes here	0	0
c7asih	2019-06-30 08:14:39	Popcornery	AITA for lying to my parents?	"So here’s the story. I am 16 years old and I have severe depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, and ADD. My parents have always been extremely hesitant in letting me get help. Although my mom was willing to allow me to see a psychiatrist, she was not willing to consider medication for a long time. My dad still is very upset by the fact that my mom finally allowed me to take a low dose SSRI for my depression, which is better than nothing, but doesn’t do much. 

When I was thirteen, my depression got to the point where I physically was unable to feel any emotion at all. I was basically an empty shell. I did find something that helped me a lot though.  I found that when I smoked cannabis, I was able to get enjoyment out of things, talk to more people, worry less, and focus better. So I started smoking marijuana, which is legal in my state (not for my age, but the legal penalties are severely reduced) about once or twice a week, and never in my parents home. I also made sure that it never interferes with my schoolwork. The point that I am trying to make is that I was not a recreational user. 
Eventually, after searching my room without my permission, (which I understand, as they are my legal guardians) my parents found about two grams of weed, which would last me about 2.5 months(1 gram~1 joint). They completely lost their shit,  and were upset that “I didn’t tell them that I was using drugs” and that “I wasn’t honest about my mental health issues with them”. 
To be clear, I was very honest about my mental health issues with them, they just didn’t want to listen, and seemed to think that if I improved my outlook, then the problems would fix themselves. I am not asking about that.  I am asking if IATA for not telling them about my pseudo-medical marijuana use.   
I just want to close this out by saying that I don’t want any messages telling me that I shouldn’t be smoking pot at this age. I have done my research and I have weighed the benefits and the disadvantages of the plant. I understand what I am getting into, but the negative side effects are not as important to me as being able to enjoy life. Also, I do not just enjoy life when I am high. When I smoke marijuana, my overall daily outlook is better, regardless of whether I smoked *that* day or not. Ok. Thanks for your opinions."	Not the A-hole	0	0

      Today I went over to my friends for a sleepover and they all had Evil Apple which is a dirty card game like Cards Against Humanity, installed in their phones. They told me to play with them, so i installed it.
A few hours into the game, i recieved a text from my mom saying ""What is this garbage game? Delete it now"" And i had told them that it was a card game. 
Ever since that I have been ignoring their messages because im so angry. 
This isn't the first time too, they always get mad at me for watching shows with any involvement with the supernatural or dirty jokes. And sometimes I think its way too over the top. And I think im a good child myself, I dont smoke like the other kids do, I always attend school.

c7alrj	2019-06-30 07:46:42		WIBTA if I stole my sister in laws perfume?	"So, when I first met my husbands family about 6 years ago, I gave his sister 2 very expensive perfume sets as a present on 2 different occasions. At that time she was living with my in laws, but moved out about two years later. 

Today, while visiting the in laws and staying in what used to be SIL’s room, my MIL opened the closet to show me where the extra pillows are and I noticed the two perfume bottles, barely used, sitting in the closet. It looks like she left behind a few things but obviously they were things she didn’t want to take when she moved out (ie some cheap costume jewelry, half burnt candles, old clothes). I feel a little hurt by this, but no big deal. 

For context, my relationship with my in laws had been very rocky until a couple years ago. I think she didn’t take them because she didn’t like me and therefore didn’t like the perfumes? Idk. 

Now, I really like those perfumes as I had spent a long time picking them out, and really like how they smell. I know perfumes have a shelf life, but by the look of it and smell of it, they both seem fine. I would hate for them to just sit there and go bad, without ever being used.

WIBTA if I just took them as I leave on Monday and get some use out of them??

c7aj97	2019-06-30 07:36:20		AITA for asking my parents to get a pet sitter?	"I currently live with my parents 2 dogs, a cat and a bunch of goldfish.

Recently my parents have begun driving over and staying with my brother a few days at a time, ostensibly to help him with his business. This leaves me stuck at home with the pets, which those with dog owners know means feeding them and taking them out for a few hours.

I have recently begun to get my life together (I had severe depression, anxiety and was a drunk) leaving me with less time to be at home because I am going to AA meetings, volunteering, taking up disc golf and begining job training.

This of course translates into less time at home which isn't fair to the animals because they don't get to go out as frequently as they should unless I change my plans (I frequently do).

As a result of this I asked my parents to hire a pet sitter or begin paying me for watching their animals while they are gone.

This caused them to freak out, saying that I'm only asking this because I'm anxious while they are gone (I am), and that I owe them for living rent free and having a cell phone they pay for.

I don't feel like I owe them anything else besides my gratitude because the house is paid off (it's been in the family for generations) and I'm constantly doing gardening and yard maintenance for them (I recently spent about 20 hours thoroughly cleaning a pond on their property, built a filter and a fish friendly environment for it. I also made and maintain a vegetable garden for them).

I've offered to pay for my rent, phone and sign a lease only to be rebuffed because ""we're family"".

I also feel like I'm being taken advantage of because boarding the pets would be $150 a night minimum.

I don't mind watching the animals for a night or two, but honestly what will they do when I start working full time?

c7aiwc	2019-06-30 07:34:57		AITA for leaving my girlfriend with her friends after waiting for them for 2 hours?	"It was her birthday and we decided it would be a hangout day. We had lunch and then went to the lake. It was me, my girlfriend, my friend, and a couple of her friends. Once we got to her friend’s house, the girls went into her friend’s car while my friend and I stayed in mine. They told us they would meet us at the lake and we left. 
(My girlfriend’s phone broke the other day so she sent texts through her friend’s phone) 
We waited for about 5 minutes until they said they would be on their way. It wasn’t until 20 minutes later we get a call after I texted then. They got into a car accident (a minor one). They said they’d be on their way ASAP. An hour later we got fed up and left to go back to her friend’s house and I sent a text. We got a call back from my girlfriend saying that they’re at the store and they’re on their way there and we better turn around. 

I got fed up and drove back. 20 minutes later they come to the lake and park in the lot behind our lot across the street. Then they told us to come to them and I refused. They wouldn’t pull up and we wouldn’t go to them. After 20 minutes I left her with her friends that I trusted. 

I got a call saying how I better come back and pick them up. They said I ruined her birthday. AITA for driving off?

c7ai79	2019-06-30 07:32:19		AITA for resenting my father for asking me for money and thinking he is being entitled and selfish?	"I have been having a strained relationship with my father lately. He quit his job a few years ago to try and establish his own dairy farm. It has gone poorly and he has several debts from relatives, a few loans from the bank and has also been receiving warning from the bank due to defaulting on home loan EMIs.  His only source of income is the monthly retirement pension that he receives.

I started earning only last year after graduating from college but I am unable to start saving for myself as I have to send a big proportion of my salary to support his failing business and his EMIs. The remaining money is just sufficient for me to live fairly comfortably for the entire month (although a lot of the times I require cost cuttings here and there). 

It's starting to piss me off that working hard every month over a year and my account balance resets to nearly 0 every month because my father keeps borrowing money and promises to return me.  It's gotten to a point where now even my salary is not enough and he wants me to pick a hefty loan from bank on his behalf. He promises to pay off the EMIs by himself. The loan amount is about 1.5 times my annual salary.

I expressed my worries and refused to get a loan for him and to lend him any more money even though he is at risk of losing his house. He told me that he expected me to be ""little more responsible towards my family"" and that I should recollect that my education wasn't cheap and he paid a lot for it. It pissed me off to no bounds, and more than anger, it hurt and left me disappointed that he'd say something like that. In that moment, I almost wished I'd never been born. In the past 7 years, he rarely ever called me to ask me how I am doing. He only started calling me more over last 1 year and mostly always calls to ask for money. But now just because I want to save for myself and start securing my own financial future, I am irresponsible and a burden I guess.

I don't think I can ever bring myself to liking my father ever again. I may be able to talk to him normally but seeing him act like this and say the things he said despite me trying my best to help him for over year has crushed me. The last few months have been filled with guilt, anger and disappointment but thankfully I have a lot of friends and work to keep me distracted most of the time. I want to visit my family to see my mom and my little brother but I don't because I don't want to be in the same room as my father. Even seeing that I received a call or text from him are frightening now because more often than not it's to force me to give money or take that loan. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

She has a boyfriend, but she never talks about him unless he's around.When he is, it's all really sexual. I don't mind talking about boys with her, but I've told her that certain things make me uncomfortable and would prefer if she talked with someone else. She gets really offended if I tell her I'm uncomfortable, and the last time I did, she came to school the next day with her boyfriend's used cumsock and threw it at me. It's not like I'm shaming her for having sex and thinking about people in sexual ways, I just feel uncomfortable thinking about my friends like that.		1	0
c7age0	2019-06-30 07:25:25	HatesAllRacists	WIBTA for contacting companies and warning them about my brother’s homophobia?	"So long story short, I’m gay but has been called lots of demeaning stuff by my brother ever since I was a kid. He always makes these dick-sucking acts to mock me, like forming a circle with his hand and pretending to give a blowjob with his mouth. Always having this smart-ass grin in his face too when something’s on the television mentioning about a person being gay, etc.

To make matters worse, I can’t really do anything but deny his allegations whenever he calls me gay. I’ve been closeted my entire life owing to my dad and the country where we’re at in general. Pretty conservative place.

Now he’s just graduated and looking to apply for work in his chosen field. He regularly tells our parents what company he’s applying at the moment which gets passed down to me.

So Reddit, WIBTA if I anonymously warn companies about his general homophobia and crappy actions? I know it’s gonna ruin his chances since white-collar companies here are more liberal and are intolerant of intolerance if you get my gist. Especially the Western company subsidiaries here which he’s aiming for.

EDIT: Hey all thanks for a quick response. Didn’t expect that.

Just to clear up our relationship with each other, we don’t really talk properly for more than a decade now. We had a falling out and now only talk when we’re full blown fighting (I’ll say mostly because he thinks I’m always throwing shade when I literally don’t care about him, but that’s a super subjective position from me).

So yeah, can’t really talk to him properly. Also I don’t think it’s defamation when I’m only saying the actual stuff that happened right? I do would like for other people to corroborate my claims if someone asks me. Oh and the last homophobic fight thing just happened awhile ago so I can’t really say he’s changed etc.

Anyway anyway, I would like to ask a second question to new people as well. Even if it’s a (totally) asshole move, do you think you’ll proceed to do so regardless if you’re in my shoes? Thanks!"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So heres some context, I'm really introverted and i get really mentally drained from family gatherings especially since I don't really know anyone apart from my immediate cousins. I have the belief that just because someone is technically related to you by blood, does not mean that you are required to be close to them, kinda like how a very close friend can be considered family, a very distant family member can be considered an acquaintance. This is just my belief and because of this I don't really feel the need to socialise with my distant family members but I still try to be polite and friendly if they ever try to talk to me.

So anyways there was a family gathering at my uncle's house. I came and I had already stayed for 4 hours and I was already pretty drained from it and i secretly really wanted to go home to 'recharge' or something. However, one my immediate cousins wanted us to stay over and have a drink which I really didnt want to do considering how uncomfortable it was for me with the crowd that was there but I was willing to do it if he really wanted me to. 

At that point I could tell my sister didn't really want to stay as well and she asked me privately if I wanted to stay and I decided to be honest and told her no. Then she got pissed and accused me of being antisocial so I told her if she wanted me to stay I can stay but she said even if I stayed I would be quiet and boring anyways to drink with which is kinda true. So we left and now my sister is super pissed at me for being antisocial and only caring about myself but I really dont see how this is my fault and if she wanted she could have stayed while I went back considering she is alot closer to them.

c7aegl	2019-06-30 07:17:54	infiniteseaofstars	AITA for yelling at my sister to be quiet	I (17f) live with my younger sister (15) and my parents. My dad was out for a night fishing competition so he wasn’t home. It was 1 in the morning and I kept hearing boisterous laughing from our living room and noises. I knew it was my younger sister because my mom was asleep. I text her to quiet down because it’s 1 in the morning and we have a cat who recently had kittens. The cat is struggling to take care of them and they are weak. So I didn’t want the noise to stress out the mom anymore than she already is. The cat and my sister were in the same room. She ignores my text so I FaceTime her and ask her to be quiet again. She proceeds to ignore it and I am getting pissed. It’s late and I have asked her multiple times to quiet down. I get up and go and I tell her to be quiet or to go to another room so she doesn’t disturb the house. She proceeds to tell me she can do what she would like. I start to get a tone and I take her IPad out of her hands. She proceeds to get up and throw her drink on me, it was milk. I toss the IPad in the floor. (It has a extremely protective case and it was fine, the floor is carpet.) I started to yell at her. Then my mom comes in the room and starts yelling at me for telling her to be quiet, not for me yelling. She heard our conversation and decided that I was at fault because I asked my sister to be quiet. For context, my sister has a slight mental disability and has always been favored over me since I was younger. My mom is acting like i’m awful for yelling at her and asking her to be quiet, even though it was 1 in the morning. She told my dad about it and he tried to have a sit down conversation between me and my sister about it. The blame was still all put on me and that I should have never told her to be quiet in the first place. I know I shouldn’t have yelled at her but she threw milk on me because I asked her to be quiet. Now I am grounded for a week because of the whole ordeal.	Everyone Sucks	0	0

" *So just to be clear I usually use Reddit on my phone to chuckle at the stories on this subreddit and many others, that being said this is a brand new account, however, my story is 100% true and I am just looking to see if I am the asshole. I'm not really worried about creating a throw-away account because I don't honestly know anyone besides me who uses Reddit. So I will just keep this one.* So basically here is a bit of a background into my story

&#x200B;

* I have a wonderful girlfriend whom I love living out of state in a long distance relationship,
* we have been together for two years and I am planning on moving to her state once she earns her associates degree in May.
* however, ***I never have told my family I was in a relationship.***

&#x200B;

My entire life my family has been in every aspect of how I live and this was only worsened when I went into foster care, and I and my sister were removed from my mother. I honestly, just wanted one thing in my life that wasn't my families business and although I wish I could have told my mom, my aunt and uncle put every single conversation with my mother on speakerphone and never left us alone. So I just never told anyone except my sister.

  
Fast forward and my Aunt and Uncle help me get settled into an apartment last year, but the problem is that they moved to Oregon with my sister and although they had been planning this for nearly 8 months, had only told my mother a month in advance. My mom freaked out and got super upset ever since.

  
I decided to tell her now, almost a year in advance so she could get used to it. I told her I needed to tell her something difficult and she said she would understand and that she is always going to be happy for me. So I took the leap and told her, She immediately freaked out and called me telling me I was making a stupid decision and that she wanted all the details, but I couldn't take it and I hung up on her because she was cursing at me and being so mean. I explained the situation is that I've known for two years I have wanted to move there and that there are a lot of things that ""seem to be God"" pointing me to there. She got angry that I'm only telling her now and I reminded her that she freaked out exactly the way I didn't want her to, I also told her that to be completely honest I felt bad as a son for wanting to leave since my sister left, and I have only been considering staying because of her. 

&#x200B;

On top of that, because of her reaction, I don't feel like I should tell her I mainly want to leave because of my girlfriend. I honestly, want my mom to like my girlfriend when she does meet her and I don't want her to hate her because she is the reason I'm leaving."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c7adyj	2019-06-30 07:16:08	dedstrau55	AITA for not wanting to go to my ex best friend’s step dad’s funeral service tomorrow?	"Hi all,  

Having a bit of trouble figuring out if this is a dick move or not so looking for some insight.  

When I was in elementary school, I had a wonderful teacher that was not only a great person but made learning fun.  

My best friend’s (we’ll call him John) mom was also a teacher at this school. Fast forward to when John and I are entering high school, and it turns out his mom and my old teacher have been in love for some time and have decided to tie the knot.  

So it turns out that throughout high school, this man that was originally a teacher I looked back on as one of my favorites, became more of a general father figure I looked up to greatly as my time in high school went on.  

I was over at their house all the time, I was best friends with John after all. But the problem with getting older is realizing things you hadn’t previously realized due to naivety or whatever you want to call it.  

My dynamic with John was borderline abusive. The simplest way to put it was that he used me. His mom was strict growing up and I was his trusted friend, so if he said he was doing something with me, she believed him. He used this knowledge to coerce me into many situations where I was either uncomfortable or unhappy at the end.  

I don’t blame him for doing what he thought necessary to achieve his goals at the time, but I do blame him for not thinking about the effect his actions had on me and my self esteem.  

This brings me back to John’s step dad, my old teacher. He passed away last week, and his funeral service is in the morning. I love his family, they played such a large role in raising me that I can’t ignore it or downplay it.  

I want to be there for them, but my mistreatment by John over years of time is causing me a ton of anxiety, and I don’t know if I can get through this without freaking out honestly.  

Am I the asshole?  

Edit: Thanks all for the advice, I ended up going and said very little to John, but was still able to portray my sorrow to the family."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c7ady0	2019-06-30 07:16:05	leggybasil	WIBTA if I Used Sex to Get My SO to Shave his Mustache?	"I’m currently involved in a relationship with a man about whom I care very much. He’s thoughtful, kind, and attentive, and I always found him physically attractive. My problem is that he recently started growing a mustache, and the new look really turns me off. I mean, I really, really hate his new ‘stache- it’s one of those bushy, 70s-porn, Super Trooper-type mustaches and it really detracts from his physical attractiveness.

I know that the mature thing to do would be to tell him that I prefer him clean-shaven and let him decide for himself whether or not he wants to shave it off. My problem with this approach is that he’s rather sensitive about his looks, and I don’t want to hurt his feelings by telling him the truth about what I think of his mustache. He is nearly 20 years my senior, and on multiple occasions, people have thought I was his daughter when we were out in public together. He is self-conscious about his age and his looks, so I don’t want to say anything critical about his appearance. I really care about him and I don’t want to hurt his ego.

Now my bf really enjoys giving oral sex, in fact, it’s his favorite thing to do when we’re intimate. I was going to tell him that I don’t like how his facial hair feels on my sensitive parts, and that I can’t enjoy the act with his mustache getting in the way. I am pretty certain that this will get him to shave it off without me having to ask explicitly. While I think this approach will preserve his easily-hurt feelings (he is very sensitive), I’m not 100% comfortable with using sex as I tool to get my partner to do what I want.

c7ads9	2019-06-30 07:15:30		AITA for not telling my boyfriend about being autistic?	"TL;DR at the bottom.

I was diagnosed as having Asperger’s when I was 4, but was not told about this diagnosis until I was 13. The stigma around autistic persons and the jokes made have made me very wary and uncomfortable when it comes to talking about my autistic traits, which I have worked very hard at minimizing the past couple years. At most I probably come off as a little awkward or somewhat of a loner, but as I’m very talkative, at best I’m passing as neurotypical. I’m 19 now, and he’s 21.

My boyfriend was honest right off the bat by off-handedly mentioning his ADD once we started dating, which I was supportive of as well as his occasional frustration from it. We’re both fairly awkward individuals so it would never have occurred to him that anything was “off” on his own just from that, and we both ramble as well- just another coincidental trait we share, at least that’s what he thought. 

My sister is a blabbermouth and while we were talking on the phone she off-handedly teased me about taking ‘special ed’ classes when I was younger, since we were on the topic of our early school years. I tried to laugh it off as a joke but when he prodded a little bit further, I admitted I was in special ed but did not want to say for what. Him, being an individual with ADD, said he would “understand completely” since he had to be in a similar program in his country when he was a kid.

When I told him I had asperger’s the tone of the conversation immediately changed and I could tell he was pissed. I decided to give him time to cool off (and also I was admitted scared he was reacting badly) and told him we’ll talk later. Immediately he sends me a message saying that autism is a “big deal” and he’s extremely hurt that I had kept it from him. He says he would have understood and I was being cautious for no reason.

We haven’t been together very long but even if that wasn’t the case, I told myself I would probably not bring up having asperger’s to a potential partner if I could help it. I’ve been very very embarrassed ever since; mostly because of how it was brought up, and yet my sister agrees with him. She even said she was happy with herself for bringing it up since “a secret like that isn’t healthy”.

TL;DR My sister reveals I have autism, boyfriend gets upset since he talks about his ADD and feels like I don’t trust him. AITA?"	No A-holes here	1	0

c7ac4h	2019-06-30 07:09:17	Subsushie	AITA for waking up my dad to drive my brother to work?	"Hello,

This morning I had scheduled to drive my brother to work before I started, to then pick him up after I finished my shift. We currently live at home with our parents, and share one of their cars. We also have one scooter to share, but for obvious reasons neither wants to use it due to speed limits. 

When I woke up I had forgotten that I were to open the store, and needed to pick up keys because I had forgotten mine in the locker. I was super stressed out, and called a co-worker to see if he was awake and could lend me his keys. As a new shift-leader I wouldn’t want to call the boss and ask him to come open 7 in the morning. 

I woke up my dad, and asked if he could drive my brother. I would pick him up after work as planned. My brother then proceeds to send me a message where he states what a shit move it was from me to just take the car as soon as I had the chance, and leave him with the scooter. 

I then explained that I sorted him being driven to work, and I would as said pick him up. He then said that I was very selfish to wake our dad up, when I in theory could’ve taken the scooter. (Which is true). But in my defense nothing has changed for him, and my dad is a sweet hearth and don’t really care if he had to wake up an hour earlier than usual. 

Yes, I could’ve taken the scooter, but out of stress I just took the car. Am I the asshole?"	Asshole	0	0

c7aazq	2019-06-30 07:05:17	gyx579	AITA for wanting to give away my brother's dog?	"My brother (early 20s) and I have shared an apartment together for about a year now, and my only major disagreement with him is the manner in which he treats his dog. He works 10 hour shifts four days a week; and on his days off he’ll spend just as much time, if not more, going out to hang out with his friends. The poor dog lies on the floor the all day, occasionally whimpering at the door, every single day. I really don’t mean to exaggerate, but the sadness and depression in the dog is apparent.

I feel like my brother treats the dog as if he’s a video game that’s there for his personal amusement. He’ll take him for a 15-minute walk, and then he’s gone for the day leaving the poor dog in what is essentially imprisonment. I would spend time with him and take him to dog parks myself, but I’m a full-time grad student currently studying for board exams and I’m working part time. Unfortunately I don’t have the time to take care of someone else’s pet right now.

I have brought this up to my brother several times, and his argument is that all working pet-owners leave their pets at home all day; and my answer to that is even if that were to be true, just because other people do something wrong, does not make it okay for him to do the same thing wrong.

I’m now at a breaking point and I feel like the only humane solution is to give the dog away to a family, or to someone that does have the time, to give him the care and the attention that he deserves. I don't want to risk ruining my relationship with my sibling, and I’ll try to convince him once again tomorrow. But unless things change soon, I’ll put an ad up to give the dog away. Would I be wrong if I were to do this?

Tl;dr – My brother doesn’t give enough time to his dog; I want to give him away to someone that will."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c7aatl	2019-06-30 07:04:35	lonelyman72	AITA for wanting to dip out on paying rent to my cousin?	"I recently graduated college with a degree in advertising, and once I graduated, I moved back home to Phoenix. I moved into an apartment with my cousin and her husband with rent at $1550. I pay $550 and they pay the $1000. I told them that I would be there until March, but I am currently not on the lease.

The problem I have discovered is that the advertising market in Phoenix is not nearly what it is compared to the bigger cities in America. After a long discussion, my girlfriend and I have decided to move to Seattle. The two main benefits of moving is that Seattle is where she is from and she could work a $52,000 a year job to get a crack at her student loans which don't start accumulating interest until next March, and I would have more opportunities to find work in my field of specialty, therefore financially beneficially for both of us. 

When mentioning this idea to my cousin and her husband, my cousin was outraged at the thought of me leaving and not paying the $550 of their rent, saying that rent is going to be ""more expensive"" and that they are going to have shell out more money if I leave

However, here is why I don't feel bad. My cousin's husband makes $80,000 a year as an accountant for a well-known company, my cousin also works like 30 hours a week, but they spend almost $400 a month on weed, eating fast food six days a week, and they go drinking quite often, which adds up as well. They are more than able to pay the $1550, but want me to stay so they have that extra money. 

I feel like my life is being forced to be put on hold for my girlfriend and I wanting to position ourselves into financial security instead of me paying rent for another few months to people who don't know how to budget if their lives depended on it. Everyone in my family is calling me an asshole for wanting to leave, even though it is because I am trying to get my life together and I want a fresh set of opinions.

c7aa9o	2019-06-30 07:02:29	tt22hhb	AITA for asking my dad to buy things for me?	"This is a throwaway account. My dad and mom have been divorced since I was about a toddler. Since then, my mom and my younger brother have moved to a different country and I rarely see or speak to him. Although, sometimes on my or my brother’s birthday or around Christmas time he’ll send us a message asking what we want for presents. I feel bad that I only ever talk to him when such holidays happen. Then again, he usually never reaches out to us to try to ask us what’s going on in our lives.

Last spring, my grandparents from my dad’s side came to visit me and my brother as I haven’t seen them in about 5 years, and they told me that my dad misses us and would love to speak with us. I mustered up the courage to send him a couple messages and we end up talking about university as I am soon to apply. He sends me a promo video for a university exchange program for the place he lives and I honestly had no idea how to respond. 

It’s not that I dislike him, but years of living without a older man in my family has negatively changed me and I’m always anxious when I visit my friend’s house and their dad or uncle is home. I know it’s an irrational fear but honestly I have no idea how to deal with it. 

This August, my grandparents on my dad’s side offered to fly us back to our home country for us to visit family before I go to university (when I’ll have much less free time). My mom told me to splurge and buy whatever I want since I haven’t seen my dad in so long. I feel guilty that I’ve avoided talking to him for many years and that now I have to ask him to buy all these things for me and my brother. I don’t feel close to him at all and I am scared that I’ll have to live with him for about 2 weeks. I know he wouldn’t do anything bad to me but- I don’t even know how to talk to him in real life or tell him about my anxiety and feelings of depression as of late.

More drinks in like an hour later, I found myself with A and the other friends out on the patio after I had scored some tortilla chips from a friendly vendor who was offering them to me. I was offering a lot of passersby some chips just out of being friendly/drunk. Some accepted, some didnt. whatever.

c7a60f	2019-06-30 06:46:15	Kiwicky	AITA for wanting to stop sponsoring a child in Haiti?	"I really need to help on this one because it’s been eating at my conscious.

A few years ago I decided to start sponsoring a child in Haiti, a little girl who is about 6 now. The sponsorship consists of just me paying $38 a month until she either turns 21 or leaves the program.

I was younger and more impulsive when I made this decision and only now as a college student working two jobs realizing that it’s actually more money than I thought, it’s one of my larger monthly expenses.

I took a trip to Haiti a while ago to see the program first hand for myself and I am certain that they are a good organization and that the donations actually help the kids sustain themselves.

I know that $38 doesn’t seem like a lot to many people but for me right now it would be nice to be able to save as much as I can until I get situated in the career I’m pursuing. I want to become a teacher because I am very passionate about helping children which is why this is so difficult!

The older the kids in the program are the LESS likely they are to be sponsored, with teens rarely ever getting sponsored, I want to believe that if I decided to stop sponsoring her right now that she would get a new sponsor fairly quickly.

So just give it to me straight: am I the asshole for wanting to back out of this commitment to focus on my own growth?

c7a4va	2019-06-30 06:41:38	Lurtle7	WIBTA for denying a family trip?	"I'm a college student from the West coast, but currently working at a company in the Midwest this summer. To get there, I had to drive across four states. Because it was the first time I drove across more than one state, my mom insisted on joining me to help drive. For context, I don't get along well with my parents, and I find 1:1 time with them to be really unpleasant. But I totally appreciated how helpful it was to have another driver with me. 

In five weeks, I will have to do the road trip back home, and then three weeks later go back to school. My parents insisted on joining me again on the way back, treating it like their vacation. Instead, I proposed doing the trip with my best friend. We'd split the driving between the two of us and it would be a lot of fun. My parents thought it was a great idea and agreed. So I started planning it with my friend. 

Now, my parents still want to do a separate family trip this summer once I get back. They don't know where they want to go or how long they want to leave for. I agreed to leave work a week early (using vacation hours) to provide time for this family trip. 

Then, a week ago, they called me to say that they've finally decided on vacation plans. Their new plan is to instead fly to my location, drive me home, and make a vacation out of it. So back to square one. When they called me, they said they already got full approval from my siblings (also in college and away for a portion of the summer) AND they called my friend/his parents to tell him he would not be joining me on this trip anymore! I was annoyed that my family would hijack this trip with my friend, so I thought a good compromise would be to invite my friend back to join us all together. That way, I could spend time with both my friend, as planned, and with my parents. 

But when I proposed this idea to my parents, they accused me of being ""so uncompromising and selfish"". They said that no matter what, having my friend there would ruin our family trip (For clarification, they have nothing against him, they just want it to be only our family). That was honestly the best compromise I could come up with, so I'm sad that their reaction to the suggestion was to call me selfish.

I don't want to tell my parents more affirmatively that I don't want to do this trip with them, because I don't want to admit to them that I don't like them. I know this is weak, but I really don't want to have a big confrontation/falling apart. My parents called again to plan spots to visit, but I'm indifferent to wherever we go because I probably wouldn't enjoy it anyways. At this point I'm seriously considering telling them I'm ditching and doing my trip alone, effectively ending their ""quality family time"" trip plans.

Yesterday around 1 PM, my dad tells me to get ready to go out. I ask him where we are heading, and he replies with the beach and some tourist trap. 


My cousin from Germany is over to the States, and he’s a mid-20s Surgical Assis. My parents are obsessed with impressing him and they believe that involves taking him to all the attractions nearby.


I personally do not like him and find him toxically masculine. I have several relatives from Europe, and I remember another unpleasant experience with one who was homophobic towards me. I politely said “I don’t want to go.” My Dad sighs and says “I don’t like it either, but it’ll be fun.” 


I frankly find spending a day reading (halfway through *Things Fall Apart*) and playing games much more relaxing compared to the crowded beach and streets nearby it. 


He leaves and tells my mom who promptly comes over and repeats the same thing my dad has said. I start to get frustrated and say “I want to stay home.” She frowns and goes back to her bedroom and just repeats “Please.” for a few minutes.


I tried to ignore her childish behavior when I just frowned and said “Ok fine! But don’t expect me to have a fun time. In fact, I’m not going to be all smile-y and happy for you.” She doesn’t reply and I choose to get ready.


Fast forward to sundown (around 9 PM), I’ve spent 7 hours outside at that point and really was not enjoying it. During school breaks, I tend to be more introverted. I felt like I had missed out on a day to myself & sacrificed my happiness for my parents’. 


Feeling frustrated, I start to rant about it on the ride home. We’ve dropped the cousin off at my grandparents and I say “Mom, I’m unhappy that we’ve spent the whole day outside.” (Roughly translated, I speak to my parents in their mother tongue)


My mom replies with “Oh don’t you start that again and ruin my night.” I frown and say, “Start what? I told you I didn’t want to go. And I only came to make you feel better, but now I’m the one who is regretting this.” 


We proceed to get into an argument that I don’t really want to describe. Just know that she became childish and tried to scare me by going faster on the streets and abruptly stopped outside our mailbox at night to go check the mail. I was fuming over her reckless act. 


It’s been about 24 hours and neither of us are talking to one another. I know it’s not a big deal, but this happens **all the time**. I remember a really big one where we had an argument (in which she called me a f_gg_t) at a resort and I wanted to stay inside after.


TL/DR: I went out the whole day to make my parents and our guest from Europe happy, but I couldn’t help complaining about it later that night. AITA for not shutting up?


**I can apologize if you guys think I am wrong here. If not, let me know because I don’t want to go on a 3-day long trip (we’re leaving tomorrow) that I feel will just be a repeat of this.**

One of the girls is tiny and super drunk so I’m just doing my best to keep her walking. The other is not as drunk and is walking ahead alone.

The super drunk one sits down on the path and as soon as she does a car drives past and an egg hits her head and goes everywhere all over mine and her clothes. After this like I’m just doing my best to get her home without being hit by another egg because it upset her and the car had driven past another time and missed.

Whenever any car came past I would kind move her out the way so it would hit me not her. Luckily we didn’t get hit again but super drunk girl starts running off to the other girl I was with. When I caught up though the other girl starts saying I’m a dick head for babying the super drunk girl. I put it down to her being drunk and ignore it and focus on getting them both home. But about 5 minutes later she starts it again saying the same things. I turned round and I think I said something along the lines of. “I’m sorry to be honest but you are being a bitch right now. I’m just doing my best.”

When I got home I showered and washed the egg out of my hair and slept and when I woke up I saw a message from the girl I called a bitch saying how the drunk girl brought up that I called less drunk girl a bitch.

Of course this is only my side of the story but I have tried to remember as much as possible and also be as honest as I can.

MA then said, “Well if ———— is going to be there, I won’t.”. I was also good friends with ————, but it meant a lot more to me if MA was there because we had been through a lot. I gave the invitation to ———— and carried on with my day. ———— could attend. I let MA know and she was furious, saying things like “WHY WOULD YOU INVITE THAT B**CH!” or “Do you even want me to be there?!”. I wanted her to attend but seeing as she wouldn’t I cut my losses. Turns out MA ended up staying the night at her friends house with her boyfriend the same night. I ranted at her and yelled at MA for being rude to me. We split and didn’t talk for a while. That was a year ago and we haven’t spoken since. She texted me and said that she misses what we had and wants to be friends again. I replied with, “I miss it too but don’t miss being ditched.”. She kept ranting about how she messed up and how I should forgive her blah blah blah. I ignore her. Now she’s passively trying to hint at wanting to be friends, but I keep pushing her away.

“The government pays you to study. If you come over you can get a job in any nail salon easily.”

“In my medium sized home town we have a shopping mall. You know the mall you have here every town in America has bigger one just as big”.

“They love me back at the hotel. I bought them all shoes so they adore me now.”

“My church won’t stop giving me money to help people here. Like I get off a flight and I have 5 emails from my church asking to give me more money.”

He also mentions the fact he is 70 years old all the time. Eventually the bar gets a little busier and the woman has to serve other customers. He continues to watch her and try to get her to sip his drink every time she comes past. Eventually another couple sit next to him and he starts spouting the same BS. He said to them “I once owned a big motorbike, so you know I’m not the kind of person you want to mess with”

We finally snapped when he said, “I’m hearing that all of the women in Australia are turning into men. Ya, know like they are just becoming more masculine”.

We pipe up and call him out on that he says “I’m sorry if I’ve offended you” we tell him he doesn’t need to come to this country and “save” people and he is out of line. He finishes his drink pays his bill and leaves saying “I don’t need this shit”

c79qgx	2019-06-30 05:50:08		AITA for refusing to wear a costume at work?	"(Mobile formatting lol) 

I work part-time at a higher-end boutique in a mall. My job requires a very basic uniform of black business-casual clothes, closed-toe shoes, and a black and grey blazer. I personally love this uniform because it’s so basic but also very sleek.  

We have recently launched our summer campaign that is really geared towards drawing in the “millennial hipster” demo. Like I said our shop has always been pretty bougie and our usual demo is the 35-55 crowd.  

So I walked into work today and during briefing my manager told me that I would be greeting. I didn’t think much of it, as since I am part-time I usually either greet or do other supporting tasks. 

However, before i stepped onto the floor my manager brought me to the back and told me I had to wear a costume since I was on greeting. This costume was bloody atrocious and comprised of a blue and pink flannel, large hipster framed glasses, and a straw fedora with our logo on it. I audibly gasped. Here’s a (simplified) version of our conversation 

Me: do I seriously have to wear this?
Manager: yes 
Me: I’m sorry but I just don’t feel comfortable wearing that. Can’t I just stay in my uniform and greet like I usually do?
Manager: nope. This is required by head office that greeters wear the costume. 
Me: Can I ask around and see if I can switch positions with somebody else? 
Manager: trust me nobody would want to switch with you. Nobody wants to wear the costume. 
Me: okay....can I at least just wear the glasses and the flannel? I just don’t want to wear a hat that everybody else has been wearing 
Manager (angrily): you know what ____? Just wear whatever the hell you want and go onto the floor. I don’t care anymore. 

I awkwardly just shrugged and headed out without wearing the costume and continued on with my shift. My coworkers commended me for refusing to wear the costume telling me that everybody has been really against wearing it but being forced to wear it by management.  

My manager throughout my shift did not talk to me at all. If I had a question or was in her sight she would just look past me and just ignore me. She made a coworker come and tell me when to go on lunch/break. 

I surprisingly did not get written up but now that I’m home and thinking about the whole situation I feel bad about my behaviour and do want to apologize to her. On the other hand though, I feel like I shouldn’t because i very clearly stated that something was outside of my comfort zone and instead of my manager taking it into consideration she acted passive aggressive towards me. 

I feel like no matter what I will apologize, but I would also like some feedback from uninvolved third parties. Was I the asshole today? Or was it just a bad moment?"		1	0

c79py7	2019-06-30 05:48:14	Inserte_Pseudonimo	AITA 4 evictioning roomie? Im the Landlord	"A little backstory: the business is to rent houses, and with the permission of the owners, we split these houses' in bedrooms, and subarrend them.

Nicknames: Roomie1, the Asshole (Roomie2)

2  young ladies rent and say ""There's NEVER going to be a late fee 'cause we ALWAYS pay on time"". (2 dollar fee per day late).

The first couple months everything fine, they paid on 15th's. BUT THEN, they both started to take up to 5 days to cover the amount of the rent, on December, they paid UNTIL Christmas.

So far I had been accepting this and just charged the late fee, not a big deal, but this month, this fucking June, it's already 29th (today) and only yesterday Roomie1 paid, not only after telling her mom that her daughter was 2 days from going homeless (local laws state that they have 15 days from the payment day to cover the price of the rent), and then, mom paid her rent with a 26 dollars of late fee.

But Asshole, look, she's an Uber Eats deliverer, with a bike, and she ALWAYS left the bike on the garage, which had a tiny fence keeping it from the street, told her someone could steal it, and wow, it happened, on early March. I felt bad for her, and lend her my bike, which I LOVE, I worked as a waiter for it when I was younger and I thought that it'd be good to help someone in need. WRONG.

I let her to be 5 days for free, she paid on the fucking 23rd, but idiot me, let her pay me that late without fee because, well, I thought it was a good deed. WRONG.

Same thing on April, 23rd, I only charge 5 days of late fees, on May she paid me on time, I didn't think much of it. But June, today morning(29th), one day before her eviction, I go to the house and there is an ugly bike on the garage, FUCKING purple (mine was red), I ask EACH of the roomies and they told me it's Asshole's bike. I realize she FUCKING SOLD MY BIKE, and with that money paid May's rent and got this ugly af, shitty bike, I.GO.NUTS.

&#x200B;

I calm down, knock, Roomie1 opens and says ""Oh, Asshole went out today earlier, she is not here"". I reply: ""ok"".

&#x200B;

I take the bike,and go back.

&#x200B;

I knock again, Roomie1 opens, I call Asshole's number, imagine the face of Roomie1 when Asshole's phone starts noisefully vibrating, and, suddenly, going silent even without hanging up. I then shouted: ""Asshole, I know you're inside, just letting you know to pack up, this is your last night here, and don't worry about giving back my bike, the one you sold, I took the beautiful bike you replaced it with, and you'll be getting a call from my lawyer, I'm suing you of theft (in my country there are laws that protect you if you borrow something and isn't returned) and if you don't leave by tomorrow before 11:59 p.m., I will be suing you for private property invasion"". I turn my face to Roomie1, who at this point is white af,and tell her: ""Hope you have enough to complete the other half of the rent before the day after tomorrow"".

c79nxa	2019-06-30 05:41:04	ghtfscjkug	AITA- Dumb Dinner Argument	"I (20F) asked my boyfriend (20M) to go out with me for a late dinner tonight. He said he would and that he was at a friend’s house but he could leave at 9 so we could be at the restaurant at 10 and all ready to go. As someone who has previously worked in the service industry, it’s really important to me that we don’t go to restaurants any later than two hours before closing since I know how frustrating it can be when people come in right before close after a long day. As such, I confirmed that 10 was the pick up time and he agreed. At 9:45, I looked at the menu of the restaurant to find out that happy hour wasn’t actually on Saturday’s so i texted him to let him know and see if he wanted to change plans. He told me he was still at his friend’s house and asked if he should just stay there and have us not go out to eat. I told him he could stay but he had to let me know because I was getting really hungry. He then told me that the earliest he could come back was 11:45 and I stated that was too late so I’d eat at home. We had previously had a lot of discussions about how it bugged me when he was hours late to agreed upon. He had stood me up for three hours just two nights ago and I was upset at that. During that argument, he agreed he would do better and try to be more timely. I agreed that it was totally okay if plans fell through as we see each other a lot, but I’d appreciate it if he primarily stuck to his word about when he’d see me. He agreed and was on time the last time we saw each other. When I told him I was a little upset that this most current dinner date fell through, he argued that it was my fault as I changed the plans last minute. However, if he was supposed to pick me up within fifteen minutes but stated previously that he would need to leave the friend’s house an hour before the pick up time, then that means he had no intention of meeting with me on time. AITA? Or rather because I don’t think either of us are particularly assholes, do I have a right to be upset?

Edit: thank you to all of those who have responded. I know it’s a cliche thing to say, but he really is an incredible partner in every other way. I know that I am a priority for him as he shows me that everyday in the way he acts. He has ADD and I think sometimes he just hyper focuses on what is at hand and forgets sometimes. He’s also just a tardy person who doesn’t get upset by stuff like that, but I do. I know I also do things that annoy him, but he generally is a less broody person than I am so he gets over it quickly. I also am sometimes not on time so I guess I shouldn’t hold him to as high of a standard, but I will discuss with him further about how this makes me feel. Thank you all again!"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c79nw4	2019-06-30 05:40:58	honeybearsippy	AITA for making my boyfriend location share with mr	"Long story short: 
On June 1, my boyfriend was caught lying to me about several things. The most pertinent thing being that he told me he was going to bed with a headache. Instead he went to a party with some friends. (He also told some people that he wasn’t in an exclusive relationship but we’ve been together for a year.) We’re in a long distance relationship. 

He was caught in the lies and begged for forgiveness. Promising a lot of things including that he’d share his location with me from now on. This was his idea. I wouldn’t have asked for this. 
 
Last week he unexpectedly turned location sharing off, we fought about it and he put it back on. Tonight, he’s telling me that he wants to take it off. That he hates sharing it 24/7 and doesn’t think it’s good for our relationship. That he promises to be honest about where he is.
I told him that I’m not ready for him to unshare his location and if he takes me off it again, I think that’s a sign that he doesn’t respect my wishes and that we should break up. 

I asked him for a compromise that we keep it on for one more week. If he can’t agree to that, then I feel as if he is unwilling to compromise and I’m unsure how we can maintain a relationship that way. 

AITA?

My girlfriend and I have been dating for around five months. We are taking a month long break because of some problems we were having and the break is almost up. We still text but we haven't seen each other in a month. She recently has been working overtime at her company, so I decided to get her a gift to show appreciation for her hard work. I went online and ordered a set of snacks and a plushie as a gift set. 

Naturally I was excited for her to get the package and I hoped she would be happy. The company notified me by email that they delivered the package. I texted her ""Hey go check your mail I sent you a package"" and she told me she isn't dressed and will just check it two days later. (She lives in an apartment)
I naturally felt hurt that she wasn't eager to check what I got her.

c79khk	2019-06-30 05:29:15		AITA for leaving the price tags on the clothes I bought for my boyfriend?	"My man’s got a simple wardrobe, and he likes it that way. I’d like for him to broaden his horizons a bit; I think he looks dashing in black, but I’d like to see him try other colors-I bought him a few nice shirts. They can be dressed up or down, feel nice and soft, and seem like they’ll be comfortable. 

He’s stated before that he’d let me pick out a few outfits for him, as he does for me on occasion. I love when I try on clothes at the store, show him the options, and he picks something out for me. It’s a great feeling, and I experience just as much pleasure when I shop for him, imagining how handsome he’d look in such-and-such. 

However, it isn’t as simple as, “Oh, he’ll look great in that! I’ll buy it.” He has a theme he’s stuck with; Black Death Metal band tees, sweaters and jackets, and a few pairs of jeans. He hasn’t strayed from that theme and I’d like, at the very least, to see him in some different types of shirts. I’m not asking him to throw his wardrobe out, just expand it. He’s particular, like most of us, but with a heavy dose of stubbornness. Without trying something on he’ll say he doesn’t like it, or it’s not for him.

So here we are. It goes without saying, but I spent a pretty penny on the shirts. Would it be a complete asshole move to leave the price tags on some of the shirts I bought for him, in hopes that it guilts him into wearing them? I realize that sounds manipulative, which is why I’m here. I’d like to say in my defense that I don’t use this tactic elsewhere in our relationship. I don’t make a habit out of manipulating or guilting him; I love and cherish him. I haven’t done this yet-the thought crossed my mind, and I figured this was a good place to get some clarity on the situation, without involving those close to us.

c79gyi	2019-06-30 05:17:23		AITA for taking my adopted dog back to the shelter?	I've had my dog now for over a year and a half. I adopted her from my local shelter. I was unaware, neither was the shelter apparently that she has separation anxiety. (Had I known she had separation anxiety or the extent of it, I would not have adopted her.)  I have had 2 dogs before and was oblivious that dogs had these types of behavioral issues. She will pace back and forth in her crate when not home, try to break out of the crate, and howl and bark constantly, she is stubborn and difficult to train. I have tried treating the anxiety with little to no solution. I contacted a local trainer and was told that the dog just needed confidence, and that once she had this confidence this should alleviate the separation anxiety. After a few hundred dollars and weeks, the training was complete and there was no difference. She continued the same problems as described above. I have tried multiple natural chewables to help calm her down.(essential oils, CBD, natural chewables for dogs, aroma therapy)  I take her running at least 30 min in the morning before work. (The trainer said walking/jogging her will not alleviate the anxiety, and the separation anxiety may be incurable.)  I've tried leaving a peace of clothing in her crate to be comfortable with my scent with her and she only goes to the bathroom all over it. Finally we went to a vet, and the vet prescribed an antidepressant. (I was against having her on any type of meds constantly as I thought some TLC would help or cure her). The antidepressant worked initially. It calmed her down and kept her quiet, but after months and months of her being on it, now it seems the effects are no longer working as I have been having to try to keep her quiet, and she continues to act out. I feel as though I have tried everything with her and am getting constantly stressed with trying to focus all my time on cleaning her, making sure she's ok, and making sure she stays quiet. There is no joy in having her, only stress, and frustration. AITA?	No A-holes here	1	0

EDIT: thank you to everyone for your feedback and support! I know what steps I’m gonna be taking next and won’t be responding to any more comments. Love you all and HAPPY PRIDE 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈

My parents are divorced. I’m 20, my sister is 17, and during the week we live with my mom and stepdad. On weekends, we spend time with our dad at his house which is 40 min away. My sister has a job where she works a few hours on Tues-Thurs, and I have a 10-5 research job at my university.

I’m living at my mom’s for the summer. I also lived at home during the previous 2 semesters and commuted to college (~20 min one way) every day. My parents wanted me to commute and I defer to them on these issues because they help me pay for school. 

On Wednesday, my sister and I told my mom that our dad wanted to take us to Canada to visit family for 5 days (Sunday to Friday). My mom said yes, we can go. 

Usually my sister and I drive over to our dad’s house on Friday evenings, but my sister had a picnic with friends today (Saturday). I woke up around 10:30 and chilled on my phone at my house the entire day. My mom is in a bad mood because my sister is out and I am home doing nothing. 

I know she is more stressed now because she’s holding a summer workshop for 3 weeks (just finished her first week) and she usually doesn’t work 9-5 on weekdays. Now she’s acutely mad at my sister and I for our respective activities (or lack thereof) today. 

My mom’s been “anger vacuuming” and slamming doors downstairs for multiple hours. She yells at my stepdad at some point  for “doing nothing all day besides drinking coffee and reading” (keep in mind he had 2 strokes!!!), and around 7 PM she calls my dad on the phone. I text my sister at 7:50 to ask her where she is— she hasn’t left for home yet. My mom is still on the phone. 

Around 8:30, my dad texts my sister and I to let me know that my mom isn’t letting us go to Canada. I’m angry but unsurprised. I ask my stepdad if he knows where the passports are. He does not but he goes to look. 

After my sister gets home around 8:30, she asks my mom for the passports. Strong no. 

I go downstairs and ask, and I tell her that whether or not she gives us the passports, we’re still spending the week with our dad. She says we can spend the week but I can’t have the passports. I immediately ask her if she’s “doing this out of spite” and she says “yes.” I then asked her if she “likes being a mean person” and she also says “yes.” She then follows it up with “get lost.” This is verbatim. 

I go back upstairs and into the library/storage/guest room. I find the passports in a box and take them. My stepdad tells me that he couldn’t find the passports, to which I reply that I did, and he’s just like “huh.” Rather than being supportive of our trip, I think he just doesn’t want to get involved/argue with my mom more than they already do. 

At 9:30, my sister and I grab our bags and leave for my dad’s. When we’re driving, my mom texts me that she’s kicking me out of the house for taking our passports from out under her nose.

I wanna start off by saying I love my boyfriend. He's everything you could ask for, even with the typical 19 y/o boy qualities that can be a bit annoying (gaming while we're on facetime, he burps and tries to blow it in my face, etc.). He's *very* attractive, super sweet, a perfect gentleman when he tries, and all that.

I especially love his hair. It's what got my attention in the first place.

But his beard. He's asian and has that trademark spiky asian hair. He never grows out his beard fully, but just leaves the stubble. Now, his beard doesn't make him any less attractive and it's not like, a deal breaker or anything. *But* I do love the smooth baby face the best :3 I've casually brought it up to him a few times like when it gets pretty long I'll say ""wow spiky haha. Are you going to shave it or grow it out?"" with a smile because I know he doesn't want to grow it out (he's said so). He'll be like Oh yeah! and shave but using some kind of razor that doesn't do it *all* the way but leaves like... a stubble.

One time I had asked about the stubble and he said his electric razor does that and for *smooth* skin he has to use a regular one but he gets lazy a lot.

I really don't mind the stubble, but baby-smooth face is just my personal physical preference. I think it's a small change and not a lot of effort is required but maybe it's out of bounds.. I'm not sure how guys think, this is my first relationship.

WIBTA if I asked him to shave all the way?

c797gi	2019-06-30 04:46:42	Avianmosquito	AITA for refusing to let my daughters visit their mother?	"I met my ex wife when we were 8. We were hot and heavy really young, and had our first child when we were 16. I loved them both dearly, but following a mental breakdown I had when I was in my mid 20s we split up. Thankfully, our younger child is too young to remember the divorce. But even so, I still thought the world of her. It took me years to realize she wasn't a wonderful person. 

A few serious incidents finally sealed it for me, like her dying her unconscious sister's waist-length hair black and making her shave it in retaliation for embarassing her in front of a date. Or her punishing our younger child for wanting to see me. Or her cutting off our older child entirely for choosing to live with me and not her.

About a year and a half ago, she ""got a job"" on the other side of the state and started vanishing for weeks at a time. I didn't think much of it. Eventually, though, she just never came back. Ten months later, we found out she was in prison two states over. She was in prison for fraud, extortion, identity theft and practicing medicine without a liscense. My older child was furious at her, my younger child was just glad she was found. I was glad she was out of my life forever.

Both of our daughters want to visit her. The older one to chew her out, I think, and the younger one misses her. I will not take them, but I can't bring myself to explain why. I keep lying about not having time, and how we don't have a car, and how it's so far away, when I know full well we could make it. I can't take it, but I just can't tell them I personally can't deal with ever seeing their mother again. Or that I hate her. Or that some part of me still feels guilty about the entire thing, like it's my fault.

I can't stand it. I know my older child has figured it out, and I feel awful not being able to apologize to her. And I know my younger one believes me, which is even worse. But that's where I am. I'm lying to both my children, letting my own feelings override theirs and keeping them away from their mother.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT:
I have spoken to my daughters. My older child already figured it out, she already knew how I felt about her mother before this all happened. My younger child actually didn't cry, but it was a near thing. 

I told them both I'd see if there was a way they could go without me, probably with their uncle. Neither of them liked that. I offered instead to go with as far as the city, and their uncle take them to the prison. My younger child accepted that. The older one wasn't. I even offered to go with to the prison, but remain in the lobby, or the car, but she explicitly wants me to talk to her mother. I was afraid of that. I told her I'd think about it.

I talked to their uncle. He agreed to this plan. He also wanted me to talk to my ex, though, and he's bringing his sister along. 

So that's where we are. The trip is next weekend.

EDIT 2:
We went. It took 12 hours to get there and 14 hours to get back. The girls talked to her. The little one was excited the entire way there and sad the entire trip home. My elder daughter gave her mother a piece of her mind, but she kept it brief and quiet enough none of us could hear her, and was dead silent for the first half of our trip home before the boredom won out. I did not talk to her, and with any luck I never will again, her brother did and politely informed her that there's no longer room for her at their house, all her sister told her was ""You're dead to me."", which is pretty much my sentiment as well. Overall, about how I expected it to go. It was not pleasant, it was not productive, it did not make anybody feel better (at least not yet), and I think it's why the little one has needed affection more or less constantly all day today, but it's done."

c796tx	2019-06-30 04:44:47	saddestjitters	AITA for not letting my mom sleep in my house?	"Backstory:


Since I was around 8 years old, my mom would scream at me for even making the most petty mistakes you can imagine. For example I always got yelled at for coloring over the goddamn line in a color book for school or the time she told me she didn't even wanted me right in my face after I got a low score at a test. This really fucked with me because I was constantly being yelled at and I can't get peace for even a goddamn second. And at school if I got even a single item wrong I know it would be a goddamn exorcism when I get home. Fast forward to a few years and now I'm at a good job with enough pay to keep me from eating out of the garbage but my mom had some rather unfortunate financial problems. This was brought upon by her rampant addiction to buying tons of designer handbags. I kid you not she would bring home a new handbag or whatever tf she bought every week and when I checked the price of one of them my jaw just dropped on how much that single bag cost. This rampant buying soon caught up with her soon she lost everything, for the past days she is staying at my aunt's house but will soon be forced to leave because my aunt has 5 kids and can't afford another mouth to feed. So my mother is now at my door begging to stay for the night and I flatout said no.

So going to try to keep it short and sweet but recently moved in with my bf and he has a cat I have a dog. They don't get a lot but going to address it with training (this is important). I finding myself getting woken up every morning  around 4 or 5am pet. He corrections with a scruff whatever that is but the behavior continues anyways and I put her in a her room/ closet it's literally a walk in so I dont think its abusive has her litter box and toys and food bowl and taking her out at around 7/8 when I get up. I have down everything I could think of to prevent her from waking me up. Her eating was loud so I put her on a food schedule so she was shitty before we went to bed and wasn't eating lousy before trying to fall asleep. She use to scratch at the other closet door I put tin foil in front of it. (Something I learned in dog training school to keep cat off of the kitchen counter which it work for this too.) I've encouraged him to play with her so shes less likely to have the zoomies. (She won't play with me unless hes there I've tried endlessly just a very shy cat) I've moved my dog in the guest bedroom so she has access to the whole house when we aren't there and at night. We switch when the animal are out so there never together. 
I feel like I put my best foot forward and try to fix this problem with multiple different tactics and I still get woken up but her zoomies or her meowing and I now hate the cat. I feel like its reasonable to ask to put out another litter box(we have an extra one). Downstairs and keep the cat out of the our room while we were sleeping. The only rooms she wouldn't have access to is our bedroom and the guest. She could roam the basement, living room, kitchen, gaming room I don't care. Would I be the asshole asking for this?  I just hate being woken up by a goddamn cat every night or morning. I also really want too try to love her for the sake of our relationship but me waking up angry every morning is not helping."		1	0
c794z0	2019-06-30 04:38:50	wafflekid_69	AITA: Girlfriend called me clingy for being worried	"So I’ve been seeing this girl for about 2-3 months now. We both have a strong connection and everything seemed to be going very well up until a few weeks ago. Her life got turned somewhat upside down in June. First she had her phone stolen, then she got this real bad cough that’s still going on, and what set her over the edge, her car registration is suspended for 3 months because of insurance lapse reasons (her car was registered in her ex’s name, that’s a  whole story) so she is car-less til September and it’s causing her a lot of stress. She hasn’t been giving me the greatest vibes lately, but I get that since she’s really stressed. 

Anyways, I went to Atlantic City for the weekend for warped tour and yesterday and her last text to me was “Okay! Be safe and have fun! I love you ♡♡” at around 5:30pm on Friday. I sent her a meme at like 8:00 and then gave her an update when I got to the hotel at 10:15. I didn’t hear from her. I went to bed and woke up and texted her good morning at 9. Still didn’t hear anything. Noon rolls around and I’m getting worried. I tried calling and her phone goes to voicemail. She went out Friday night for her friends birthday and she told me she was sleeping over. She goes out with this girl once a week for bowling and she had told me she drove drunk one time...So I end up messaging two of her friends and asked if they heard from her (I just wanted to know if she was okay) One of them texts her and finally she texts me back and she writes “I don't have any messages from you?”. So clearly my phone wasn’t sending her texts. But then she goes off on me saying it was embarrassing that I was asking her friends if she was okay and that her mom would’ve reached out if anything had happened to her. I told her I was genuinely concerned and that I’m not trying to be clingy. But then she goes to tell me “The clingy has been brought” which really upset me. I’m taken back by the whole thing and I’m really not about being clingy. That whole thing about being attached to someone’s hip just turns me off so I’m really bothered by it. Am I the asshole for reaching out to her friends to make sure she’s okay?  Meanwhile she always asks me to let her know when I get to work (I work overnights) while she’s asleep.

TL;DR
Haven’t heard from GF for 18 hours because she wasn’t getting my calls/texts. I reach out to her friends to ask if they know if she’s okay. She gets back to me and says she was annoyed I reached out to her friends and says she was embarrassed and called me clingy for it. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

c793uz	2019-06-30 04:35:07	throwawayacc839	AITA for being mad about how my boyfriend’s new job is affecting our relationship?	"UPDATE: Thank you for the responses. Although many said there’s NAH, I do feel like I let my emotions overwhelm me. My mental health isn’t his responsibility and I need to work on that. I also didn’t really know what I was asking for out of him, I was just upset. But I realize now it’s NOT that I want him to magically make more time for me or something.

I ended up texting him right after seeing the first response. I basically said I feel like it’s been harder to make time for one another recently and that I love him and am proud of him for taking on this job, and I in no way blame him or want/am asking him to change his working situation, but it’s hard nonetheless. It went well, I tried my best to make it clear I don’t need more “me” time or want to exhaust him further. We agreed that after he gets home from work he needs a few hours to himself to recharge, then we’ll FaceTime in the evening. And to be clear — I never said I was going to not support him or ask for more out of him. This was never going to be a dealbreaker or a “demand”, I love him so much and I would do anything to make it work. Thanks again, Reddit!


Original post:


Throwaway because he knows my main account. I’ll try and keep this as short and simple as possible —

So my boyfriend of over a year recently got a job that requires, on average, 11 hours a day, 5 days a week. It’s manual labor and I can’t imagine how difficult it is for him and how tiring it must be, and he needs the money for college so I would never ask him to get a different job for my sake.  We’re also doing long distance right now so we mostly call and FaceTime. 


Part of me feels so guilty because I know his job is so demanding and I work as well, and I can hardly compare my job to his (I’m working in retail to save up some money as well, but way less). But the past couple weeks there have been some times I feel annoyed or upset with him and I feel like it’s not anything more he needs on his plate, and I’d look dramatic and not understanding. Stuff like him falling asleep when I feel like I need someone to talk to, etc. I brushed it off because I know he’s tired. 

Today, I was just in a crappy mood and I was trying my best to pull myself out of it. I talked to my boyfriend a bit but we ended up calling on the phone in the late afternoon (5ish) when he got home from work. I’m feeling really sad (I struggle with mental health a bit) and it’s just really nice to have him there for me. I can tell he’s tired though so I tell him it’s ok, go nap. He ends up falling asleep until 9:30pm. Now I’m feeling upset because this seems to keep happening and I really needed him. 

I don’t want to be the asshole but I worry I am. He’s working hard, he’s tired. But he’s also my boyfriend and the feeling of not having someone there for you when you need it at times can be rough. Anyways, AITA for being upset with him? 

TL;DR: Boyfriend started a new, very tiring job. He’s always exhausted and I feel a bit neglected but can’t really blame him. However, I’m getting annoyed. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

"A few months back I got a new roommate, it's a 2 bedroom house and I thought it would be more economical to rent out the unused bedroom. I met my roommate a couple of times before we made any final decisions and he seemed ok. Quiet, kinds nerdy, in his 30s.

After he moved in we started having a couple of problems: 

1. he wasn't doing his dishes and he was leaving them out with food in them to the point that it smelled pretty raunchy and I was getting sick of cleaning them up. 

2. There has been a strong odor in the house, particularly near his room, since he moved in. I dont know what the source of the odor is, I don't go in his room although he leaves the door open when he leaves for work and I close it because it fucking stinks.

I brought up the issue with the dishes, he said he didn't mind when things got dirty but he'd do better at cleaning it up. In his defense he's been pretty good about it since then, and I thought that might take care of the smell but it hasn't.

I've had roommates in the past, I know that people have their own smells and odors and that's part of life, but this smell is very strong and unpleasant, to the point that some of my friends have mentioned it to me when they come over.

I talked to him about it yesterday afternoon, I tried to be as nice as possible and I asked if there was anything in his room that might be causing the smell. He got very defensive, I think I embarrassed him and he told me it was none of my business.

I'm considering giving him notice and asking him to find a new place, but I feel bad about it because he's a nice guy and he pays on time. AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

"So this is literally the first time I've posted something on Reddit and I'm already regretting it, mostly because it's a pretty dumb story and it happened months ago. Welp, I guess I'll do it anyway.

I'll give some background information first: I used to have lunch with the same people as this girl did. She was kinda mean to me when I entered that social circle (which was at the beginning of 2017), but we became friends a few months later, I don't even remember why. It was a pretty fake friendship, we barely talked to each other and we had nothing in common. Around October of 2018 my sister went to a classmate's house to give her a German class, and the girl I'm talking about was there because she's friends with my sister's student. When my sister came back home she told me that my ""friend"" was taking pictures of her while she was teaching the class, which made me realize that I probably should end that friendship. 

Now a few months later (January of 2019) the girl started talking with one of my friends about her being a year younger than most of us. I wasn't paying attention to the conversation until I heard something like ""Has your period arrived yet?"". It was pretty random so I gave them a sort of confused look, but then the girl said something like ""Why are you looking at me like shit?"". I just walked away awkwardly and then complained about it with my friends, I never explained what really happened to her. But thinking about the whole situation I guess she had the right to think I was giving her a shitty look since I just suddenly stopped talking to her (I don't think she knows that I know about the pictures)? Plus, it's pretty normal for girls to talk about our periods and it isn't something we should be embarrassed of, I guess it was a kind of a random but valid question, so maybe I shouldn't even had given her a confused look.

"My bf and I have been dating for awhile and it has been very good so far. I am very close with his family, especially his little brother in the past. We'd send each other memes, I'd help him with school and college and his crushes on girls and other stuff. He has been pretty nice to me so far. My bf and I are 19 and his little bro is 17. 

Lately, he's been a bit moody. I get that, I was very hormonal and I got easily embarassed and angry and lashed out some times. I get that he's going through that now. 

My boyfriend has been called a ""fucking idiot"" more times than I count these past few weeks for being slightly slower than his little brother at new games and over little things. 
He also tells him to ""shut the fuck up"" if he asks him a question like how is your day or something similar. He gets angry and sometimes physical with my boyfriend and once with me. He might've been playing around, I dont know but he hit us with his backpack and I just kind of asked for him to be gentle and my bf didn't say or do anything. I asked my boyfriend in private if his little brother was usually like this and if he is okay and if anything is happening at home. My bf just said he's a teenager.

The brother went to camp a day ago and up till then he didn't interact much with me. I gave him space after I asked him if he's doing alright and how's his day after no response. Sometimes he will send memes to me and I'll send them back but thats pretty much it. The days before he left he told me to shut the fuck up after I asked my boyfriend a question and I was a bit upset. My bf didn't say anything and just answered my question. 

The day after he left my bf said he'd miss his brother and I just said ""ah, yeah, you guys are buddies..."" and my bf asked me if I would miss him. I took a big enough pause for my bf to get hurt and get that I wouldn't. He asked why and I told him I was a bit hurt by some stuff he was saying. My bf got upset and said he was just a teenager and that he's just 17. I didn't argue because I didn't want to overstep or escalate.

c78vhr	2019-06-30 04:09:19	AbsoluteCat	"AITA for ""bothering"" my friend?"	"**EDIT: I got enough of an answer, thanks**

tl;dr at bottom

So this one feels pretty minor of an issue, but still. My friends and I voice chat over Discord a lot because some of us live in different cities after we moved out for college.

Sometimes, one particular friend tends to annoy (maybe just) me, idk about anyone else. He's known as the eccentric one in the group, but here's the thing:

Sometimes, I'll ask him a question while we're playing games together (or just him, if I'm doing something else at the time, which is actually usually the case) and he'll refuse to answer the question. Even if it's a quick yes/no question or a really simple question, he'll be like ""give me a bit"" and say something like ""I'm trying to pay attention here/listening to audio cues/playing the game"" and this happens pretty often.

Sure, he still answers sometimes, but whenever it does happen (which is somewhat often), it makes me feel like I'm being ignored or whatever. AITA for wanting an answer after I ask a question instead of being pushed aside? I usually end up asking again because I just want an answer, damnit, and am I being too impatient or is he being rude?

I know he's ""the weird one"" in the group (not just me, all of us agree on that) and he's still my dear friend, but I don't know if it justifies what he does or what I do, because he'll still refuse to answer out of stubbornness/as a matter of policy, even at risk of an argument starting, and we've argued about this more than a few times. I feel like it's easier to just answer the question and I don't know why he doesn't, even though he's really stubborn about not doing it.

To me, it's frustrating, but I don't know if I'm being an asshole or not for 'bothering' him while he's trying to do something even though we're **already talking** and chatting about stuff, whether it's related or not.

tl;dr, in voice chat, ask friend a question, he refuses to answer, it bothers me"	Not enough info	0	0

This initially made me feel like an idiot, since I had a chance literally everyday to talk to Maya but didn't take it. So I tried to think a lot about what I could do about it. In the meantime, I was forced to be more outgoing to make new friends, and I made a pretty good amount of people I'd consider friends. There was one particular 'group' of kids that were in a lot of my classes with me (honors history, honors algebra 2, gym, Spanish 2) that I 'clicked with', so to speak. There are 5 of them, but the one that's important to the story is Harry [15M]. Harry invited me to hang out with them with a few of their other friends, and when I went to Harry's house, I saw Maya there. I casually asked Harry what she was doing there, and he told me she was his neighbor and friend. I immediately saw the opportunity here, and went up to talk to her. It went pretty well, and afterwards, I confessed to Harry that I liked her and asked, since he is a mutual friend, if he would basically find ways for us two to creatively meet up so I could talk to her. He agreed, since he thought we would 'make a cute couple'.

So soon he was pushing us together pretty often, and a week ago, I asked her out. She said no, because although she liked talking to me, she said I'm not her type and too 'frat boy-ish'. I was a bit sad about that, but whatever.

So when Harry asked how it went, I gave him a blow-by-blow, and he got kind of pissed. Honestly, idk why he got worked up on my behalf. Maybe he just wants drama, or maybe he really does think we'd make a great couple. But regardless, Maya texted me very angrily today, saying that for the past few days, all of her friends (led by Harry) have been lobbying on my behalf and telling Maya she made a mistake and asking her to give me a chance. 

She accused me of setting Harry up to this. I really didn't, and I don't Harry think asking her to give me a chance is particularly 'pressuring'. Harry and his friends all think she should give me a chance, and are saying so to Maya, their friend. I personally don't see anything wrong with that. I honestly feel like my chances with her are blown if that's how she was reacting to people telling her to reconsider.

Friend (23F)
Crush (19M)


To provide some background, this friend (Friend) is getting married in a few months and has something like an open relationship with her fiancé. They both see people outside of their relationship, but it seems to hurt Friend’s feelings whenever her fiancé sees somebody that isn’t her. 

For the past year or so, Friend has had a crush on a mutual friend of ours (Crush). To put it mildly, this crush is unrequited. Crush has made it abundantly clear to Friend that he does not want to be anything more than friends and that it makes him uncomfortable that she continues to pursue him when he’s not interested. 

I’ve been a sort of third party in some of this because they sometimes talk to me about each other. This is probably the main source of contention, as Friend says I should keep away from Crush since I knew that she had feelings for him and confided in me about a lot of stuff in their “relationship.” 


As you may have guessed, Crush has taken an interest in me, and I’ve started seeing him casually. To avoid keeping secrets from Friend, I told her about this. She flew off the handle, saying I betrayed her but also that I didn’t have to stop seeing him because she didn’t want him after I touched him anyhow (he was a virgin before me). 

However, the next time I mentioned him—again to avoid keeping secrets because Friend told me that would be the only thing she had a problem with—she got angry again. I’ve decided not to mention Crush to Friend again because it seems to upset her every time, but I don’t want to stop seeing him because—in my mind—she doesn’t get to have a say even if she liked him first because she’s getting married in just a few months. 

To make things clear, I would not ever try to pursue her fiancé; even if I wanted to, she has proclaimed him off limits. This is another reason why her relationship doesn’t seem so open, but that may be beside the point. I also wouldn’t start dating a friend’s crush as a rule, but I made an allowance this time for the simply fact that she’s engaged and I’ve been single for a while. 

This situation seems to have made her jealous or upset with me to the point that she hasn’t talked to me but has been badmouthing me to other people (I heard from a mutual friend). I don’t know if I even want to be her bridesmaid anymore, though I’m unsure how to back out gracefully. 

AITA for seeing him to begin with? WIBTA if I kept seeing him? 

TL;DR: My friend who is getting married in a few months has an unrequited crush on a guy that I’m seeing. She is jealous and angry at me because I “betrayed” her."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c78usu	2019-06-30 04:07:10	Boglin007	WIBTA if I report my doorman for calling me pretentious?	"I moved into a new apartment building about a month ago. It's a doorman building and most of the doormen are really nice. I always say a pleasant, ""Hi, how are you? Have a nice day/evening"" to them when I leave or enter the building, but I don't stop to chat to them as I have seen some of the other residents do.

&#x200B;

One of the doormen (whose shifts coincide with my coming home from work) has this habit of trying to strike up a conversation with me as I'm almost out of the lobby and heading down the hallway to the elevator - like, he'll shout out a question to me, or comment about the weather or something. I usually (pleasantly) shout back an answer and keep walking to the elevator, as I'm always exhausted after work and just want to go to my apartment and relax.

&#x200B;

The other day he shouted out to me, ""Come here, Miss Pretentious,"" so this time I turned around and walked over to the front desk and said politely, ""What did you call me?"" He then proceeds to say I'm pretentious and obviously think I'm better than everyone else in the building because I won't stop to talk to him or the other doormen. His tone wasn't angry or mean really, just kind of jokey but in a condescending way. I politely explained that it's not that I think I'm better than everyone but that I'm just really tired after work and want to go home. I also said I find it weird that he always tries to talk to me as I'm almost out of the lobby, thereby necessitating me turning around and walking back into the lobby in order to have a conversation (if I wanted to). He ended by saying that I won't fit in with the ""culture of the building"" if I keep on refusing to talk with the doormen. I told him (again, politely) that I wasn't really interested in fitting in with the culture of the building and told him to have a good night and I then walked away.

&#x200B;

Since then I have seen this doorman twice and both times he has greeted me with, ""Hello, Miss Pretentious"" (same jokey, condescending tone) as I walk into the building. I have completely ignored him both times.

&#x200B;

I feel like I should probably talk to him and tell him I don't appreciate being called that, but honestly I just want to report him to his supervisor as I'm getting sick of dreading walking into the building and I feel like I shouldn't have to deal with that in my own home (ok, building). So WIBTA if I just go ahead and report him? I don't want to get him fired or anything, but I do want him to stop."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c78ubs	2019-06-30 04:05:50		AITA for sleeping with my former teacher that's married?	"Disclaimer before we begin: I have and never will condone cheating. I've been cheated on in the past and it was a terrible feeling. I feel really guilty about it and idk what I should do from here on.

Context: 5 years ago I was in highschool. She was my Business teacher. There's always those teachers that everyone will have a crush on and she was one of them. She was always really nice to me and would be extremely fun with having different ways of making the class exciting. After leaving highschool she was one of those teachers that you'll miss the way they taught, especially once you're in university.

5 weeks ago I was at a coffee shop and kind of in a hurry. As I was leaving I saw her sitting with a friend a table (didn't know the friend) and she stopped me. I told her I was in a hurry and that I've always appreciated how awesome she was and she blushed and her friend laughed. I told her I'd love to stop by the school sometime and say hello when I wasn't crunched for time. She said she would love that.

Two nights ago:  I went to a pub for a friend's birthday (around 12 of us). I went up to the bar to order a round and she was there in the far corner of the pub sitting with 3 friends. I sent over a bottle of wine and said ""tell her I still plan on stopping by some day"". I went back to the table carrying drinks of all sorts and then shit got real I guess. 3 of the guys I was with went to the same highschool, the rest were friends from university that were home for the summer.

She came up to the table and asked if she could talk to me for a second. My one friend kicked my foot under the table like ""dude what is happening"" so I left my phone on the table (stupid) and walked outside with her. We had a cigarette and she asked if I wanted to go for a drink somewhere else, as her and her friends had just paid their tab and were leaving. I told her I had to tell my friends and she kinda just said ""just go back afterwards and say you saw an old friend when we were outside"".

We went to bar down the street and had a few drinks, talked about life. She asked if I had a girl I was seeing and I said no. She started telling me that her and her husband were on the verge of a separation and she feels like she's missed out on a lot of fun in life by being in a toxic relationship. I asked if it was difficult for her to live with someone she's on the brink of a separation from, to which she stated he had moved out about half of his stuff.

I finally said I should go back to my friends. She invited me back to her house and because I was drunk and she was gorgeous and actually fun to be around, I obliged. We ended up sleeping together and I borrowed her phone the next morning and called my friend from the bar. Told him I lost my phone and that I needed a ride. He picked me up, handed me my phone and said ""if you think you need to apologize, we can't be friends"" and gave me a fist bump. Told him what happened and he said it was a legendary story but to keep it somewhat ""hush hush""."		1	0

c78trt	2019-06-30 04:04:08	Throwingitaway945	AITA for bringing up what my nephew did?	"I am childfree and I have little to nothing to do with children besides my two nephews. The eldest was a really sensitive child and always careful with things. The youngest (who is four) is not. He's pretty much a terror, doesn't like to listen, often has tantrums and is rather rough. 

&#x200B;

Today my mom and I  met up with my sister and her two kids and ended up at the beach. My mom and nephews moved further down the beach and while there the youngest grabbed a crab and crushed one pincher with a rock and then found a worm type thing and tried to pull it apart. My mom stopped him the second time and reprimanded him both times. Eldest came up and told us what he had done but on the way home my mom said he seemed to get a lot of enjoyment out of it.

&#x200B;

Just now (several hours later) my sister phoned and I brought it up. I will say that he is good with cats/dogs and it might just be him not recognizing that small creatures are also alive/can feel pain which I also mentioned in the conversation but I was/am concerned about the disregard for other creatures.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for bringing it up? I could tell my sister was unhappy with it and the call ended really quickly after that.

&#x200B;

As another am I the asshole kind of thing, during the talk I said ""Maybe he should... crap, I was going to say talk to someone, but I guess he can't really do that."" Meaning that he is 4 and he is in speech therapy, he leaves the consonants off his words and mostly only speaks with vowels. So I don't even really know what could possibly come of bringing it up because if there even was/is a problem I'm not even certain how much help he could get."	No A-holes here	0	0

I really don't think it's an asshole move and he is stupid for thinking so because It's not like it's 1 over until closing and I am tipping well.

c78spo	2019-06-30 04:01:04		AITA for refusing to pay for gas?	My girlfriend found a job out of state and will be moving soon. We had planned on buying plane tickets and with the amount of luggage she was bringing the total cost for her ticket and mine would have been around 180 dollars. However, my girlfriend found out her new roommate actually lives fairly close and will be renting a UHAUL. So we offered to go with her with the understanding we would only bring two boxes. Also, I (the boyfriend) would help her drive. My girlfriend originally offered to split gas but the new roommate declined. Now our trips start tomorrow and the roommate just messaged my girlfriend asking for me and her to cover the entirety of the gas. The trip is 1300 miles and we calculated gas expenses and they are around 400 dollars. We are furious that she sprang it upon us at the last minute. Our flights would have been cheaper and we would not have to spend 24 hours in a UHAUL. Are we the assholes for refusing to pay?		1	0
