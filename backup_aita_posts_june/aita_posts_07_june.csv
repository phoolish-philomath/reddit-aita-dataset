by3rs1	2019-06-08 03:57:54		AITA for cutting off toxic friends	"I'll try and keep this short as possible.

I've been friends with these two guys named ""parker"" and ""bobby"" for the past 2 years(fake names) We first started talking alot because they found out i played video games, they thought I was cool at first because I'm a ""girl gamer"". After a while I dated parker for a month but then we broke up and that's when things started to get bad. Me and parker decided to stay friends and play video games together (mainly csgo and other fps)    We started to argue alot over stupid things and Bobby was no help as he stimulated the fights even more. We drifted apart after fighting for about 3 months and didnt start talking again until about 4 months after the break. Bobby had moved up north because his dad got a new job, and him and parker broke ties for a bit up until they started playing video games again, Parker started talking to me more and eventually i joined back in with them everything was fine for about a month until the toxicity kicked back in. Parker and bobby started harrassing me over small things and when id get offended theyd just say ""its just a joke chill"" and othe things like that. Since im black they started calling me a stupid ni**** and a monkey, i always retaliated which just fed the fire even more, but today their Wifi was acting up while playing csgo and it was reaching the 1000s i made a joke about them having broke people wifi and parker got upset and said "" you act like everybody is supposed to have parents that make a 6 figure salary""  granted, my parents are very wealthy but i was upset he took the joke so far parker and bobby continued to bash me over little things calling me a ""b**ch and h** and other offensive things up until i got really mad and started insulting them on all of their flaws in a really prissy tone. I banned them from my discord server and thought it would be left at that,until parker threatened to message my dad and tell him how horrible of a person i am and ""embarass me"" in front of my family. I feel bad for snapping at them like this (we've argued alot before but this argument was significant) but im extremely upset at the threat he made to embarrass me infront of my family. 


TLDR:My friends got into an argument over wealth and personality and theyre threatining to embarrass me to my family.

I know theres probably alot missing here and its written poorly but i need to know if im being overreactive to all of this or not."		1	0
by3rhi	2019-06-08 03:56:50	smaug2324	AITA fiance(22m) yelled at me (23f) the day my grandma passed away	"For some context: 

My grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, dementia, and that whole shebang. She was fine for a while then in a span of 3 weeks she went from occasionally forgetting names to hospice. 

Today I get the call from my dad that she passed away. I was really close with my grandma so even though I knew it was coming it is hard and emotional.

The fight:

Well we were driving back from a short work conference. I got a call from my parents talk in ng about funeral plans, what day, where, all the logistical stuff. The first words out of his mouth are something like "" oh man sorry I cant go I wish I could "" and I was like umm why cant you ? Which he said work but he hadn't even made any attempt to get it covered. So I tell him to try cover it and he says yeah I suppose I can try. 

That hurt my feelings a lot that he wasnt even thinking of trying to cover it until I said it. I snapped at him being like hey that was pretty rude how you said that. Why would you assume not to come with me? Which set him off apparently pretty badly.

He went on a rant about how he is sick of fighting, how if I want to ""fucking crawl up his ass and nag him about tiny details"" i am free to. Pretty much just yelling at me while I'm driving about how much i am pissing him off. Honestly I was holding my tongue to not say anything rude best I could. 

He tried to act calm after I started bawling again but wasnt remorseful about yelling at me.

Honestly I felt like I couldnt let it go that he was yelling at me. I asked for an apology which he said something like ""I am sorry I yelled at you"" but made sure to re bring up the point of how I irritated him. An insincere apology. Any time I try to talk to him more about it he insists I am pushing his help away and in his voice he gets angry and snappy.

After he calmed down he cant decide if he was the asshole or if I was. 

Obviously I think he is but he thinks I am the asshole.

I know I dont have a free pass to say whatever just because a loved one passed away but come on do I get any slack? Isnt it frowned upon to tell at grieving people ?

If there are any question comments I'll try answer. I dont know if I should try talk to him more or drop this."	Not the A-hole	0	0

by3q8o	2019-06-08 03:52:32		AITA for possibly having a coworker fired?	"This is pretty long so scroll for a TL;DR. 

So I work seasonally for the water department for the city I live in. Obviously since I’m seasonal I’m put in charge of the stuff no one else wants to do, like mowing, cleaning, doing things that don’t require a degree/certification to do like much of the work the full-time guys do. I’m just there for 12 weeks in the summer in between semesters of college. 

There is a full-time worker that’s been there for quite sometime. He’s an older guy who doesn’t have much of a filter. He has the tendency to bring up some pretty inappropriate things, things I wouldn’t repeat to my mother if you’re catching my drift. For example, the latest episode involved him talking about moving to the Philippines, where the age of consent is 15 (mind you, he’s probably in his 50s), and sending his wife on a week long vacation so he can do *things*. He’s awfully specific about the things he wants to do as well, and he says it in a way where we can’t tell if he’s joking or not. Given it’s only males in the office, he can be pretty gross at times.

Apparently, a few weeks before I started, the supervisor hired a new full-time worker. The earlier noted employee ran him off in 2 days. He said he quit because of how uncomfortable he felt around the old guy. I knew about this, and it sort of stuck in the back of my mind. 

Today at lunch,  the other seasonals and I were in the office alone with him. *Somehow* a conversation got started about Tinder and how he wanted to make a Tinder to meet some young girls to hook up with. This is where I’m a bit hung up. I feel like we egged him on. He would say something outrageous (this conversation took some major turns, its too much to put here) and we would say “What?!” or something to prompt him to elaborate.

Another employee caught wind of all that happened and asked me about it, saying “If you felt uncomfortable, you need to say something.  He’s already on the hot seat” (from earlier noted incident) To which I said “I didn’t feel uncomfortable, I just couldn’t believe what he was saying” “Like what?” Then I mentioned the Philippines thing. I then said I didn’t want to be involved in it, and I didn’t want to take it to the supervisor. Not because I felt he was innocent, but because I didn’t want to be *that guy*, especially since I’ll be gone in a few months anyway. You know, lowly seasonal blue collar guy. 

The employee I mentioned that sort of interrogated me already doesn’t like Mr. Perv for some other reason. On top of that he’s a bit of a kissass to our boss given opportunity. To no ones surprise, he brought it to the supervisor and we haven’t seen him since. I feel like absolute shit; egging him on, telling Kissass, the whole deal. I don’t want to be the guy who got another employee fired, especially since I’m seasonal.

He's a younger, 1yo, energetic dog that needs a lot of play time and could probably use some socializing at the dog park. My roommate (let's call her Rachel) is almost never home to spend time with her dog, and Bronx's behavior reflects that. He barks, gets into the trash, and whines for attention. Though I've gone out of my way almost every day for months now to make sure the dog is properly taken care of, it really bothers me that Rachel doesn't do more for Bronx. I confronted her on the issue in which she got defensive and said he has food and water, implying that should be enough. I settled on telling her that I won't be taking care of the dog anymore, so he'll be put in her room when she isn't home. Am I the asshole for not enabling my roommates behavior and purposely not taking care of the sweet pup? I don't want to just lock Bronx away in a room, but uncorrected behavior (from the owner) is getting to be too much for my day to day living.


TLDR; my roommate has a misbehaving dog and is never home, therefore I put the dog in her room when she isn't home

my ex (D) is a serial abuser, and has been with his current boyfriend (C) for probably a year and a halfish. C messaged me a few months ago saying that D was abusing him and that he had enough and was leaving. I talked to C for hours, poured my heart out to him, opened up some difficult things about my past with D, tried to help him get out. after probably 7 hours and an attempt at getting police involved (they wouldnt help) D ended up coaxing C back into his trap, C told me he was going back and blocked me on every platform that he knew I had. it ripped my heart out, i'm not a very empathetic person, I have a lot of trouble being emotionally supportive, and I opened up wounds of my own abuse while talking to him. I was just very tired and betrayed.

jump forward a few months, yesterday C messaged me again saying that D is awful. I feel like I should message him back, I have no idea what D is doing now, he got progressively worse throughout our relationship, and has pulled some new tricks on C. I'm hurt and I'm angry at C for turning on me after I tried so hard to help, but I know firsthand how hard it is to get out of abuse. I don't want to talk to him, but does that make me an asshole? I haven't opened the message yet because I dont know what the right thing to do is. mostly I think im scared to pour my heart out and get backstabbed again."	Not the A-hole	0	0

by3n5k	2019-06-08 03:42:32	TheUltraGamingChamp	AITA for thinking a nice kid in my class is extremely annoying?	"So I take a Ceramic class in high school, and there’s this kid in my class who we’ll call RAM. RAM is usually pretty kind in the class. He complements people and saying their projects are the best in the world. I get he is kind, and I don’t find him annoying cause of that, but he can really get in my nerves sometimes. For one, he always asks me questions, usually when I don’t feel like answering any, mostly cause they’re either completely obvious, or I’ve already answered the question. An example is that he regularly asks me when my birthday is. Since I already have answered the question, I tell him I already answered it. And the worst part is that he just answers his own question after I tell him I already answered said question, literally making that entire conversation completely pointless. Another thing he does has a little backstory. In the middle of the year, when he was talking about eating ice cream, he made this really weird tongue noise to imitate licking ice cream (the kind of tongue noise a sexual predator would do). I thought it was really funny at first, because it came out of nowhere, but then he started doing it again... and again... and again, and when I tell him to stop, and he says sorry, but then later on, maybe even the next day, he does the same exact noise over and over.

by3mv4	2019-06-08 03:41:31	Matb013	AITA for limiting my fiancé’s wedding.l venue choices?	"Just got into a huge fight, and want general opinions here. I’ll post with as much context as I can. Sorry if it bores you.

My fiancé and I are getting married next year. We came up with our final guest lists two months ago and we are at a number that’s considered medium to high - 180. 

I come from a big family and a culture where not inviting members of your family is considered highly disrespectful. Because of that, my close relatives alone are about 40-50 people. My parents are paying 25% of the costs (as are hers) and as such I’ve asked them to give us a list of their “essential guests” - family friends and extended relatives who 1) expect to be there and 2) have invited us to their weddings. That number came out to 34 guests out of the 180. 

My fiancé has a small family and her number is nowhere near mine.  However we have been in agreement about this final guest count for months. Every once in a while she will mention not allowing kids, which I do not agree with since there are only 8 of them and I actually want them there. 

We visited a venue this week which we thought would accommodate our guest count, but during the visit we found out it wouldn’t unless we would be ok with awkward seating arrangements. There was one other venue that was a close second but this was her first choice and my #1 or #2.

She believes it’s her right to choose her first choice. I said that if she’s unwilling to pick her second then we should have the awkward seating. She does not want that, and wants me to ask my parents again to not include their essentials or disinvite the children. I think that we’d be creating a huge rift between us and my parents over a slightly more glamorous venue. 

If you’re still with me, thanks. Let me know what you think"	Not enough info	0	0

by3jl4	2019-06-08 03:30:47	amobilephoneaccount	AITA for feeling disrespected that my family tried planning my daughter's birthday without asking?	"Had a hard time jamming our dilemma into a title, so if you clicked it anyways I appreciate it. Now, onto the debacle...

Necessary Backstory: My immediate family has never gotten along with my wife and vice versa. They think she's dramatic (she is) and she gets upset that they refuse to resolve problems and instead pretend they aren't effecting anyone (they do). 

The Dilemma: My mother is an incredible woman and she wants to continue a long heratige of wonderfully quant and well themed birthday celebrations with her grandkids. Every year she asks to do something separate from my wife's planned celebration which is frustrating but understandable. Her wanting to flex her own grandmother creativity coupled with an hours drive and the fact that they seldom socialise at our parties anyways, we accommodate them almost every time they request a smaller get together at their house. 

Two days ago my mother sent us a message saying that she would like to have a get together at her house to celebrate our daughters birthday. The problem was that she said she had already spoken with all my siblings and made arrangements for them to be there on such and such a date. She closed asking what we thought. 

Now, we had already been planning a celebration at our house but hadn't sent out invitations as it's still a ways away, however the logical weekend date was the same as shed taken the liberty of choosing for her get together. My wife immediately got upset and told me that my mother was trying to exert control and how awful it was. I tried to calm her down while defending what I wanted to believe (and still do) was a sweet intention.

I replied back that we had already been planning her celebration for that date and that we would gladly accommodate a second get together for them the following weekend if they couldn't attend. I get a reply back that the date I proposed isn't good for them and that we should plan their get together for the day after our celebration. Frustrated I declined as I would like some rest on my weekend (especially after entertaining a children's party) and I work two jobs. 

Now, we had a family chat and a subsequent falling out because everyone views us as being difficult. How absurd is it to get upset that I wouldn't further accommodate them at my own expense when they won't even consider attending the celebration my wife is planning? She pours herself into these little parties with budget-centric but immersive themes for the kids to enjoy. They're always over the top and to have my family just start planning their own before even asking about the date, to us, is too much.

My family's defense is that my mom wanted to do something sweet for her grandkids (which I get and appreciate entirely) and that they'd only asked us if that date was okay because they'd made certain they were all available. This makes sense only if you ignore the fact that you didn't even ask if we were interested in having a second get together in the first place."	Not the A-hole	0	0
by3j4f	2019-06-08 03:29:16	cokekoalas	WIBTA for refusing to drive with a specific friend?	"For the record, me and this friend never had problems before this. I'd even consider her one of my closest friends, we've truly been through thick and thin. The problem comes in when I got my driver's license. 

I'm 19 years old and got my license a little after my 18th birthday, so admittedly I've only been driving for a little while. My friend has been driving maybe a year longer than I have, but she drives a large truck with stick so I have no problem admitting she's probably a better driver.

Recently, I've sort of become the go-to carpool for my friends since I live in a pretty central area and honestly, I'm one of the few people who has air conditioning, lol. I have no problem with this, I love my friends and gas for my tank is usually pretty cheap, and I get reimbursement from my friends a lot.

Now for the issue, my friend. Ever since I started driving with her, she has pointed out things on the road for me. If she sees a cop, she points it out. Understandable! But then she points out every other stop sign, and then what kind of lane we're in, and where we turn in to, and where and how to park. 

At first when I was a sort of nervous driver, I appreciated this. But it's been a year. And no change.

I often point out to her that I see what she sees and it's okay, she doesn't have to use up her energy driving for me. I wouldn't even call it backseat driving because she's never ever condescending or puts me down. I know she genuinely thinks she's being very helpful. 

The other day we were going to a concert and it was really bad. I told her point blank that I don't need her advice and I find it very distracting when she does so. She seemed a little hurt and said she does it because she's an anxious person, but the rest of the ride and the way back she stopped.

Now we have today. We went to have lunch together and she started up again! I audibly went, ""Oh, Jesus Christ Kirsten, please."" and she stopped for the most part, but still every now and again when I guess she thought I didn't drive correctly and needed help she pointed things out.

She's driving me fucking bonkers. I don't even want to drive her around anymore because I find her non-stop helpfulness so irritating. I recognize she has the option to drive herself places, but I know she doesn't like driving and honestly she has the shittiest car ever. She's so sweet, and truly has the personality of a cupcake, but good lord. Am I overreacting here? Am I the asshole? 

TLDR: My friend backseat drives in what might be the nicest, most innocent way possible and won't stop no matter what. I find it extremely annoying and am to the point where I do not want to drive her places. AITA?

Now that we've gotten that out of the way time for some background information my mother and father never married they had on accident at 16-17. They often fought but what finally broke the camels back when my father went to a foreign country and cheated(with my now step mom). Leaving me I think about 6 or 7 and my sister really young I can't remember her age. This left my probably 20-23 year-old mother all alone taking care of us because it was years before I ever saw or heard from him again even then he was on and off and always unreliable. I think that's it if I forgot something I  can fill you in then. 

Now for the story right now im in one of the stages where he wants to act like a father so sometimes we texts and very rarely but sometimes we talk on the phone this happened over the phone. We had a normal conversation at first then at some point I mentioned that a friend of my mom's was staying with us. Something I forgot to mention is my father is more of a friend to me than a father... Anyway I mentioned my mom's friend was staying with us for a bit so he asked are they male or female I replied im not going to answer because I didn't think he needed to know.  so we got into a huge argument I'd rather not get into.

Context:

I (24 F) accidentally locked my keys in my car like an idiot at 8:30 PM, at my house while parked in my driveway.  

I called for roadside assistance to come help me. I’m panicking like hell as I wait. I’m glad I’m home, but I have a million anxious thoughts running through my head at this point.

A male worker finally came by at 9:53 PM. He got out of his work vehicle, and walked past me without looking at me or saying hello. He went straight for my car. 

I followed him, and made sure to stand a few feet behind him to give him room to work. 

I thanked him twice for coming to help me, and I apologized for calling so late (my words, exactly, were “I just didn’t know what else to do, I have to be at work early in the morning. You just saved me! Thank you so much.”)

He unlocked the car door quickly. The entire time, though, he was silent. He never responded to anything I said. No hello, it’s okay, etc- NOTHING. He acted like I wasn’t there!

As he turned away, without thinking, I blurted out, “Oh my gosh, you just made me so happy! Thank you! Can I hug you, or would that be weird?”

He FINALLY looked at me and said, “Yeah that’s weird.” And he didn’t intentionally shove me, but he tried maneuvering around me so fast to hurry up to his truck that he bumped me with his hip.

I just stood there. I was shocked. That’s literally all he said to me.

On one hand, I can completely understand how I might have creeped him out. If genders were reversed, I would definitely say it was creepy of me to ask for a hug!

But I didn’t mean for my appreciation to come across as weird, or inappropriate, at all. I was just so relieved to have help!

About a year ago, I introduced her to one of my very good friends from work (let’s call him Jake). Jake and Lauren hit it off and started dating pretty much right away. Their relationship wasn’t always the best (on again off again) but they really seemed to care for each other. Jake and I are also very good friends with ‘Tyler,’ who we also work with. The four of us spent a lot of time together, and everything was great!
Fast forward about 8 months, and Lauren and Tyler have been distancing themselves a bit from Jake and I. Other mutual friends see them around quite often, and when we reach out to them they don’t always respond. Jake talks to Lauren about this, and she tells him he has nothing to worry about. The next day, she stops responding to all of his (and my) messages. She tells me two weeks later (our first time talking in 2 weeks) that her and Tyler had become romantically involved. She doesn’t see a reason to tell Jake, as the two of them “were on again off again anyways”, despite Jake believing they were “on” at the time.
I reached out to Tyler and explained that I was uncomfortable with hiding this from Jake. I had plans with Jake already that night and while I wasn’t going to tell him, I wasn’t going to lie to him either if he asked. Tyler said that it was not for me to tell, and got mad at me for crossing boundaries.
Tyler did eventually tell Jake, and he was devastated. Lauren and Tyler cut off all contact with both of us after this and as a result, Jake and I got a lot closer (as we could both relate to the feeling of having someone so close to us leave our lives).
One night, after a few too many drinks, Jake and I had sex and he stayed over. We haven’t continued this, and are still close friends, but I feel awful. I know it was just a revenge fueled thing, and Lauren doesn’t even know, but I can’t help but feel guilty.

by3cqh	2019-06-08 03:08:21	CLOROX_CONFIRMED	WIBTA for leaving my current job	Hey folks so very long story short I work for a place called Stopping of Wings (you can guess the actual name) and I’ve worked here for about a month. I started around May 6th doing training and started working in the store May 8th. During the first week of being at the store I hit overtime (46 hours) as I had agreed to pick up shifts for other that called out. Good money and this built a good relationship with management as they appreciated that I would always be willing to stay late or come in early to help with various tasks. This continued for the whole month of May, I think I worked a total of 180 hours last month, and lead into June. Now I’m going into to do a course to become an EMTB ok June 5th. As policy for the company I notified my GM and RM 2 weeks prior to update my availability. Well last week I got my schedule and they had me working both class days during my class time. I brought this up to them and thankfully they changed it allowing to enjoy my first 2 days of class this week. However a few days ago I received my schedule for next week and am again working my 2 class days. Now a little background info is that throughout this week I have called, texted, emailed and talked to each my GM and RM to make sure they don’t forget about my classes. Essentially badgered them to a point where they can’t possibly forget. So here I am 4 days later and still no word about changing my schedule. At this point I’m drawing the conclusion that their putting me in this predicament. This leaves me with either skip class and work or skip work and go to class. The issue is during last month I agreed to work OT to pay for my classes so I shoveled out 1.3k just to get in last minute to this course. Now I have to ask, would I be the asshole for assuming this is intentional and finding work elsewhere?	Not the A-hole	0	0
by3cok	2019-06-08 03:08:12		AITA for canceling playing videos games with an online friend for an irl who got bit by a dog...	"Self explanitory.

My friend got bit by a dog after a drunken night, this dog gets so scared from any sudden sound, a sneeze, a laugh anything and he goes insane, I cancel my plans with my friend and I say sorry. I tell her why I am canceling and tell her to find another friend to play with because I didn't want her to play alone... I'm drunk but I'm still polite but just with a bunch of weird ass typos.

She says and I'm copy and pasting this: ""Splatfest isn't even until later and she's not going to die from a dog bite, but okay.

My friend works at a vet office and her co worker has almost had her hand ripped off by a dog. Also I've been bit by a Zebra. She'll be fine. lol""

I tell her she's inconsiderate for undermining her pain and my worry for her. And that she knows I am sensitive especially right now due to my grandma passing a week before this happened.

She told me she lied about her feelings and that it's my fault she lied? She also then says I'm calling her ""names"" (she's talking about the word inconsiderate) and me SAYING she is inconsiderate is abusive and manipulative.

*(If you want screen shots I have most of them I can show em eventually, I'm too lazy right now though)*

Am I the Asshole?

Also before you ask because I know people wanna know news about injuries, I got you: Yes, my friend is 'okay' but she now has carpal tunnel, and pretty bad nerve damage in her forearm. She is needing physical therapy for about 16 months, if it doesn't get better they have to do surgery..."	Asshole	1	0

I was in my bed and I heard a loud noise that almost sounded like a jet engine. I looked out my bedroom window and I see a large tractor plowing the cornfield. It is late out and I have work the next day. I got annoyed but tried to ignore it. After hearing it for more than 20 minutes, I went out in the backyard and waved a flashlight and screamed as loud as I could to get his attention when he came towards me.

He saw me and stopped. He said ""can I help you?"" and I asked him why are you plowing the fields loudly at night? I need to sleep. He said he was just doing his job. I told him why can't you do it during the day? He did not answer and said ""is there anything else you need or are you going to let me get back to work"". He had an attitude to him which made me more angry and I screamed at him and told him that he shouldn't be a noise nuisance at night.  He turned his tractor back on and drove away and continued plowing the fields. I cursed at him loudly knowing he couldn't hear me.

I talked with some neighbors about it today and they said that they heard it but it wasn't a big deal and I overreacted. AITA for yelling at him even though he was doing this late at night?"	Asshole	0	0

one of the girls, (we will call anna) picked les miserables as her movie, it's a long movie that is 100% singing. nobody in the group was super thrilled with the movie choice but as it was her choice we still watched it. 

annas turn came up again and she decided to pick les miserables, I asked if she could pick another movie as we never watch doubles. she seemed annoyed and told me it's her choice of movie and that's the one she picks. the other people in the group chat chimed in and agreed with me as they did not like the movie, she has now left the group chat and is mad that we are not letting her pick her movie.

&#x200B;

I have been with a dance team for a couple of years and every year a pamphlet is printed for the recital, the pamphlet includes a list of all the dances for the day and some ads at the back or tributes from the parents of the dancers. This year my dad is making the ad and paying for it. Every year our team has one but it cost $100 to have a spot. My dad has asked me to collect $8.50 from each of the twelve dancers so we can pay for the spot. Im not sure if this is done every year but I don't think this is an unreasonable request.

Last week I texted once, into the Group Chat, that my dad was making the ad and needed 8.50 from each individual. Only 5 out of the 12 people have came to me with the money. I texted once again today and no one has responded to the message since then. I know this Chat is active because my phone is blasting with notifications the entire day.

I don't know if anyone will give the money yet but it seems unlikely. If I don't get the money I am thinking of telling my dad to not do the ad at all. I don't want to ruin the relationship I have with these people. I do not know what their reaction would be like. WIBTA"	No A-holes here	0	0

&#x200B;

so i have this long distance friend i met on twitter before i didnt have mine deleted. last year, i didn't have a job during the summer, and had to pay for this court thing, $135 a month. she offered to pay for it for me which was rly nice, and we continued to borrow money from each other and pay it back because we both had hard financial situations. however, ever since then i realize how important it is to have money, so i save almost all of the money i have at my job. any of the money i do spend on myself, i hustle back by selling weed and carts on the side. i don't struggle now with money, i def wouldn't say im rolling in it but i had a few thousand saved where when i didnt work all thru the summer and wouldn't get paid for a while, i was (am) okay

&#x200B;

me and this friend, her name is emily, haven't talked for a while. i would start to get annoyed because we would have conversations and she would seem interested and then ask to borrow money. grated, she always paid it back and it's not like i don't have the money to do it, but i don't like being used. i never asked to borrow money but i felt like i had to do it cause she gave me that money a while back

&#x200B;

we didn't talk for a couple of months, like not liking each other's pictures, not rly talking, and then out of nowhere she liked one of my finsta posts about me being depressed and messaged me like hey i saw your post are you okay? we exchanged a few messages, and i told her about something that was rly bothering me. and then she didnt respond for a few hours and was like ""oh that sucks dude im sorry. hey is there any way i could borrow 45 for an uber to and from the doctor friday? literally no one is responding to me"" and i didn't rly respond right away cause i was annoyed at that and she was like ""sorry for being annoying""

&#x200B;

now this is getting too long but i told her how i felt and how i didn't rly want to lend her money bc it felt like she only was pretending to care and popping up now to get money. but now im wondering if im the asshole because she gave me the money a while back when i was struggling and we always exchanged money? it's not that i couldn't afford it or wouldn't do it, i just felt like i was being used. she messaged me later and we made up but it still wasn't an ok thing to do imo.

When I was 25, I was also diagnosed with cancer. I received surgery and have been monitoring it for the past few years. A while back, I had a fall out with my family and stopped talking to everyone except my dad and my sister. I had an argument with one person and everyone began picking sides. Later I was diagnosed with cancer and nobody offered any support except my dad and my eldest sister. I was so angry at them that I distanced myself for several years now. However, it becomes heartwrenching to be missing out on all of my nieces and nephews lives and not being able to spend the holidays with them. 

I recently got out of a long term relationship that my family did not approve of. They hated him. So I have been spending a little more time with them lately because I miss everyone. I can feel the tension when I walk in the room but i do my best to avoid it. 

Lately, I feel like I've become my family's punching bag. A handful of individuals have been making comments on how much weight I've gained (I've gained 60lbs post-surgery and I cant seem to drop the weight with my hormones out of wack). They also make comments on my previous relationship, and how I'm an idiot, and lastly, I frequently hear comments on how I got a college degree and yet I'm still struggling. I appear to be the talk of the day, each time I'm surrounded by everyone. I feel like om everyone's punching bag. 

Its bad enough that they didnt support me through my cancer diagnosis, knowing VERY WELL that our mother died of cancer. But to come back into their lives and become a punching bag is ridiculous. 

I'm stuck between sucking it up and dealing with it because they are the only family I have or pushing them away again. I'm thinking of doing the latter. Or moving idk, I'm so over being bullied."		1	0
by39pa	2019-06-08 02:58:23		WIBTA if I asked my girlfriend to stop being so affectionate towards me?	"This girl I met is great. We vibe together pretty well and she REALLY likes being physical. I like being physical too. The thing is, she is constantly coming over to me even when I’m in another room because she wants to be kissed. And I’m not talking like every few hours. It’s more like every 20 minutes. And she always wants to cuddle with me when we’re in my bed or sitting on the couch. Again, I don’t mind cuddling, but if I’m uncomfortable (physically) or trying to sleep, I don’t want to cuddle.

I feel bad because this girl really likes me and I really like her. I don’t want it to come off as “you’re getting annoying and too clingy,” but I feel like anyway I put it, that’s how she is going to take it... I don’t want this turning into a fight, and I really don’t want to hurt her feelings.

I feel like I’m stuck choosing between keeping myself happy or keeping her happy.

Then a few days ago, I messaged her if I can switch slots because I don't think I can finish it all.

She just leaves me on read right after, which doesn't make sense since she's actively posting on Twitter...

I shared this to a friend and she said I may be the one wrong because I gave my word and then suddenly I left her hanging and my reasons would sound like excuses.

They've been together for maybe 3 weeks but they have been together before and I think they are good for each other. It was last weekend when she came to me and told me she was engaged. I told her I was happy for her and that I loved the ring. Nothing seemed out of the usual. Till today. My husband came home from work and told me she was getting married this weekend. I figured he heard a rumor or something that wasn't true so I messaged her to ask. 
She's getting married Sunday. She didn't tell me about it. When I asked her she said yes and that she hated not telling me but didn't tell me because she was worried my husband would tell her ex who is also the father of her two kids. I guess her fiance is planning to adopt the kids after they get married and she didn't want her ex to find out? My husband doesn't even talk to him. He did receive a text a few weeks ago that we thought was her ex. I took a picture of the number and message and sent it to her asking if it was him since they were asking about her. As far as I know my husband never even texted him back. 
Anyway, she said she loves me, that she's really sorry and really wants me to be there now that I know about it. The reason I'm not planning on going is because I'm actually really hurt by her not telling me. My husband didn't even have her exs phone number. Her parents knew she was getting married. My husband found out through their uncle. Her cousin knew because I guess she's doing her hair for it. I feel like we are the only ones that didn't know.

by35uy	2019-06-08 02:46:09		AITA for not wanting to give my mother money?	"First, on mobile, so be kind.
Second, I actually have a really cool mom. Growing up, I was spoiled, got to travel, received an excellent education, and knew I was loved. I generally have a good relationship with her outside of this issue. For the record, she was a single mother and kicked ass at it. Dad was not around at all, though that’s a different post.

After graduating college a few years ago, I landed a decent job that allows me to live comfortably, though I am by no means wealthy. I make as much as the average teacher in America.  I have an incredibly small amount of debt and have managed to save roughly $10,000. However, my mom frequently asks to borrow money from me in amounts equivalent to an entire month’s paycheck. 

The problem stems from the fact that she makes WAY more money than I do, like a six-figure income, and that last time I “loaned” her money I never saw it again. 

Now she is back asking for another loan. I don’t want to get into the specifics of what she needs the money for, but it’s nothing essential or health-related. 

Part of me wants to just give her the money when she asks. I’d love to be able to just dole out cash to my loved ones. But part of me also wants to escape this trend of “loaning” my mother an amount that is, to me, a large amount of money.

So I was having lunch with two of my female coworkers (one single, one fairly newly wed— neither have kids OR family members with SpEd needs) who would consider themselves progressives. 

The topic of anti-vaxxers some how came about and we spent a good chunk of time lamenting about the idiotic parents who won’t vaccinate their kids. 

Both of them know my son (5yrs old) has autism  and they’ve met him before. 

I simply said that we vaccinate our son and since the biggest fear anti vaxers have is that the vaccines will make their kids autistic— we ain’t got nothing to lose. Probably double the dose if we could. 

Then things got really tense and awkward. 
They kinda did the awkward laugh while looking at each other not knowing to do. Thankfully, we were near done with our lunch and they were like “oh look at the time.”

by33cm	2019-06-08 02:38:23		AITA for getting into a sibling fight over a desk? (both point of views in post)	"So my sister and I are both furious right now so we are gonna present you with both of our versions of what went down.

&#x200B;

My version (21F):

Our parents bought us both two very nice oak study desks when I was 15 and she was 10. We take academics and studying seriously in my family and since I was older, they bought me a nicer and bigger desk. When I left for college (age 18) my mom switched our desks so my (now 13) sister could use the nicer desk while I used the smaller one whenever I visited home (once a month). I had no problem with it. Fast forward to today, I'm home for the summer and studying in preparation for a big test and I ask for the nicer desk because it is still my desk to me. I spent hours slaving away at that desk throughout my high school years and its just my preference; never really used the small desk, never saw it as ""mine"". My sister doesn't use either oak desk and instead uses the office desk most of the time. But today, she was using my desk and I asked to use it. My MOM goes off on me saying its no longer my desk and I'm not allowed to use it because it is hers. My sister refuses to let me use the desk (which was mine my whole childhood) the same desk she barely uses and my mom takes her side and I get upset and leave the house to go to the library (has no empty study rooms ever). I come home and now everyone is mad at everyone. I don't care if she uses the desk when I'm not (I ask for it hardly ever)

&#x200B;

Sister's version (16F):

So of the two desks, the one my sister had is much bigger, with a lot more drawers and space, while the one they bought for me was smaller.  I used to study downstairs in our office, but my parents told me I couldn't study there anymore and could use the other room, with the two desks in it. MY SISTER (and my mom) told me I could have the bigger desk (the one they originally bought for her) and I used it for a  portion of the school year (Feb/March to May). When summer came, I continued to use it and all my books were moved into the drawers. My mom asked me to give up the big desk to my sister and use the other desk, which doesn't seem fair to me as I have to give it up. I have been using the desk for an online course, and was gonna use it to study for my ACT/SAT this summer. Also, for the entire time she was here, she NEVER used the desk to study or asked to use it, until now. I don't care if she uses it when I'm not."		1	0

by32dk	2019-06-08 02:35:16	paradoxx69	AITA for refusing to let my parents move to US and live with me?	" I'm a (20 yr old male) international student who's been studying in a college in New York for over two years now. Recently, my family has just won the Diversity Lottery, which would grant me and my parents a permanent residence in the US (in like 10 months).

So when we started discussing about the future of them moving here, my dad told me to transfer to a college in another state (possibly California) because New York is too cold for him and has caused health issues for him when he came here in the past. He even had to go to ER during his 1 week stay here because of the cold weather that made him get vertigo. So, he wants our family (him, me, my mom and my younger bro) to live together in a house just next to the college in California that I would transfer to. Back in my country, it's pretty common for children to live together with parents even after they get married so I can't really blame my parents for wanting to live with me, esp when I'm still financially depending on them. 

Problem is, I REALLY love living in New York. I have some friends and relatives here and I've always planned to live here in New York after my studies even if we hadn't won the lottery. I have also lived in CA for a month and really didn't enjoy staying there. Also, after living in the US on my own for about 3 years now, I realize I really don't want to live back with my parents even in New York, much less move to another state that I don't like. (There are tons of other reasons for why I hate living with my parents but I wanna keep this short)

I talked to my mom about it and she was totally cool with just visiting me in New York every once in a while. She doesn't mind if I wanna live independently in the future and isn't even enthusiastic about moving to US anyway. She told me she could always go back to her hometown where her mom and sis live and where she's happy. My dad, however, told me it felt like my mom and I don't care for his health conditions for not moving to CA. I told him that since he has most relatives, friends and his own business running back in our country and since he isn't accustomed with the culture here (he can't even speak English),  maybe he shouldn't move here and instead just visit me in New York every once in a while like mom. Needless to say, he was REALLY pissed and more importantly, disappointed in me. I also talked to a friend from our country whose parents are moving here and he told me I am kinda an asshole for this decision since it's in our culture to take care of parents no matter what and told me to not forget my culture. 

Keeping my cultural background in mind, AITA for this decision? Also, is there anyone here who come from the same culture as mine (where children usually live with their parents even after marriage) and gone through a similar experience like mine? Any thought or advice would be appreciated!"	Not the A-hole	0	0

me and my wife have just adopted 2 kids, a 4 month old and a 3 year old. they are brother and sister. 

throughout the adoption process some of my family acted strange, I always brushed it off and never cared to much but that was until an aunt showed me screenshots of a conversation that some of my family had in a group chat where they all agreed that adopted kids don't make a real family, one family member also threw in some not so nice homophobic comments (we are both females) 

the family members we decided to cut out where my other aunt, my mum and dad, my uncle, my nana and poppa, and 4 of my cousins. so a lot. 

I added them to a group chat and told them they are banned from seeing my future kids and I do not want to see them. 

I'm now feeling like crap and because its my mums first grandchild she has been messaging me non stop trying to apologize. 
most of the family I cut off have been doing the same, I now think I went to far because I've made almost all of my family mad at me.

by31nn	2019-06-08 02:33:04	Krish1986	AITA for being mad at my bro for not letting my son on a float trip	"Little background, my brother got married a couple years ago and every year they go on an adults only camping/float trip for her birthday. I’ve never been able to attend for various reasons. This year my oldest daughter started dating the son of one of the wife’s family friends. Somehow it got brought up letting the two teens go (under heavy supervision of course and she would sleep in the tent with my brother and his wife). I was ok with this because my brother is more strict and protective of my girls around boys then even I am. It was decided  that being young teens they wouldn’t really count as “kids”. Also the mother of the boyfriend would not be drinking and therefore be able to properly supervise the young couple. 

My son who is one year younger really wanted to go but I told him no because his uncle wouldn’t want to be responsible for TWO teen/preteens and she asked first. They agreed to ONE kid. Well my sister and BIL decided to go but only for the day for the float and would come home. I was happy because this meant my daughter could go down with them for the day, have an extra aunt and  uncle to watch her, and wouldn’t need to stay the night. 

My son mentioned really wanting to go and my BIL thought that since they were going and would only be there for the day him and my sister could take my son for the float, be the responsible party, take him in their canoe and bring both kids home before the drinking began which is what they didn’t want kids there for.  We didn’t think it would be a big deal since they were letting two other teens go and wouldn’t even be responsible for my son. 

BIL called my brother to let him know and my brother flat out refused. He told  them the ONLY reason he made the exception for his own niece was because the bf wanted her to come, not because he wanted to do something nice for her like I originally thought. No, only because she is dating the son of his wife’s friend. I also found out that the boy has been allowed to come every year, along with other exceptions other years but only children of the wife’s friends/family. 

I’m pretty upset, I don’t understand why other teens are an exception, other kids have been an exception but one teen that would only be there for the day in no way their responsibility is a no go and also because I find out my daughter was only one because of who she is dating and no other reason. However I’m not even sure I have the right to feel upset. It’s their trip their rules but I can’t help feeling slighted that the rules only seem apply to our side of the family."	Asshole	0	0
by30xj	2019-06-08 02:30:42		AITA for lying about sex toy?	Husband doesn’t like sex toys. I’ve used a vibrator for years prior to meeting him until mine died about 2 years into when we started dating. He begged me not to get another and I didn’t. This past year our sex life has been suffering as we have both been busy. We have had several fights about putting effort in for sex (at one time he really wasn’t) and in the heat of the moment I bought a vibrator and hid it in my closet. Since then things have become much better but I forgot about the vibrator until he found it recently. I lied and told him I bought it the other day as a surprise to spice up our sex life. He believed me but now I feel terribly guilty for lying. I just was so worried he would be mad that I bought and hid it since he had always been so opposed to it before. Am I the asshole?		1	0
by309k	2019-06-08 02:28:37		AITA When I was 10 I broke my dad’s guitars. I feel super guilty but now I wonder if they’re actually broken.	"When I was little I got a keyboard. Not a good one, just an old little keyboard. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Also, my dad is a guitar fanatic. At the time I think he had nearly twenty guitars and basses altogether.

Sometime when I was 10, my family moved to a new house. When we were packing the keyboard, my parents detached the keyboard from its stand (for storage maybe?) which left a sticky residue on the bottom of the keyboard.

After moving in, I found the keyboard in a box and brought it to my room. I loved that thing, and even taught myself a few songs.

After a while my parents saw dark marks on the floor that they thought I made with my art supplies. I said it wasn’t me and got grounded for lying. The marks kept on appearing, and I kept on getting grounded. For an entire year.

Eventually, I saw that it was the adhesives on the keyboard making the marks. I went to my parents and told them it was their fault because they detached it. At the time, I expected an apology, but got yelled at, grounded, and my dad took my keyboard to the dumpster.

I thought that I should get revenge by breaking my dad’s guitars. An instrument for an instrument... little devil I was. On a few of the guitars I turned each of the tuning pegs around once, and then back twice in the opposite direction, making it look exactly the same as before. After doing this to four guitars (ES-335, telecaster, fender precision bass, and another bass), I decided it was stupid because all my dad would have to do is turn the peg around one time and it would be the same as before.

An hour later my dad went to play his guitars and realized they sounded wrong. I didn’t come clean about it until my dad said he’d use a fingerprinting kit.

He said I’d wasted thousands of dollars worth of equipment and that the guitars would never sound good again. I feel bad about it still and never ask my parents for money.

When my dad plays guitar and I’m there, he picks one of those four guitars and says it doesn’t sound right. It makes me feel super guilty... I’m in high school now and we still do this. 

Would doing what I did really waste thousands of dollars? Is he teasing me when he says the guitars still sound wrong, or is he serious?

TLDR: Dad throws away keyboard and kid breaks his expensive guitars."		1	0

by2zqs	2019-06-08 02:26:58	gobbler6000	AITA for not appreciating a 450$ watch by my mother?	"So it started off with the fact that I had recently lost my phone. A phone given to me by my mother because she gets a new one annually from her postpaid plans. I was devastated because I lost it at a public transport and must've dazed off because I literally haven't slept for 4-5 days studying for our finals. I gathered up the courage to tell her that I lost it but she was both upset and worried because she knew that smartphones were really integrated in our school and that we rely on it for updates from our professors etc. 

We went out to look for new phones in a mall. She pointed me to phones and was eager to buy me one. I looked at the phones and what she pointed to me were phones that were not up to quality and were really cheap. I knew what phones would lag by the next few months by looking at their specs and phones stay with you for a loooong time. Seeing that she looks at really cheap phones. I told her that let's not buy for now so that I could look online for cheaper phones in which you would get a better quality when compared to its price. I also wanted to restrain from buying since we also had to pay the 2/3 of of the tuition of my second semester ,which was due also that week. I assumed that she was financially being carefull and I wanted to respect that decision by making the phone the last priority.

Here's where it started. She went to a business trip and came back with not just one but two watches worth 450$ for me and my brother. That was like the cost of a semester and a half.  I also threw away the idea of buying a phone that I researched on that was like around 150$. (The cheap phones she pointed at were like 200$ and the phone I chose was, performance wise, better.) I was flabbergasted at first because I dont really wear watches since it insanely itches on my wrist and the feeling alone bothers me. I didnt wear it for two days and she became really upset. She didn't believe that I dont wear watches. Now my family calls me ungrateful and that she regrets everything that she bought for me, things prior to the watch.

I ended up wearing the watch with cotton beneath it and or bandages just to show that I like the watch. They also gave me a phone that was similar to a nokia 3310. I also had to gather up courage again to ask my dad for the tuiton payment. 

Being a working student isn't really possible from where I live so I rely most of it to my parents and hope good grades and obedience compensates.

Do I have the right to be slightly upset about it? The watch was allegedly solar powered and shock proof :s"	Asshole	0	0

by2yks	2019-06-08 02:23:22	joestackum	AITA for wanting to skip a family reunion?	"I will condense this as best as I can.  My mom is from a larger family (she is one 7 kids), and my grandparents passed in the mid 90’s.  A reunion was started 15 years ago and I have made about 11 of them over the years missing only a few due to various reasons.  As the years go by, families grow, and health problems arise.  We lost my moms oldest sibling, my aunt, this past winter and others are struggling with health issues.

Another factor in all of this, is my relationship with my mom is not good and neither is my brothers relationship with her.  He has a wife and three kids, I have a wife and two kids, and she has missed many events and moments over the years.  Visits after births, baptisms, birthdays, sports, concerts, Christmas’, etc.  She  has a history of alcoholism and is in remission of lung cancer.  Her lack of involvement is not due to her health, it’s been the way she has been since my parents divorced when I was 10, so 26 years later she is who she is.  

Over the years I didn’t mind going to the reunion and having her parade us around to give the allusion to her family that we are all getting along and such.  However, they all know that we are not that close.  And with each of us adding new little ones and her literally not seeing her youngest granddaughter yet, or only seeing her other one twice, she still is expecting we will be there, at least to my knowledge.

My brother and I don’t want to go, our spouses don’t want to go, and with that we have said to each other we won’t be going.  He is 8 years younger than me, and didn’t have the same relationship with our aunts, uncles, and cousins.  Hell I am in a middle spot as far as ages and feel the same way to an extent.  

That said, and I am happy to fill in any gaps, but AITA for not wanting to attend this?  And while I may have some regrets not seeing some people, the issues with my mom have made it difficult."	No A-holes here	0	0

My room overlooks the pool and I was sitting at my desk playing solitaire. Blinds were down btw. I hear a few odd noises and I see them climbing over the fence and their are on my property. Since they think I’m not home I decide to just film them from my window and watch if they do anything. They climb back over the fence change into togs and climb back over and start swimming and playing around in my pool. I was fuming. I had the video as evidence of them trespassing so I called the police, not the emergency line but I called them. They came to my house and I showed them the video. I looked out the window and the girls were gone as well. I tell them that they came from next door and the police question them and give them a warning and make them apologise to me. The family next door wasn’t happy, they came and abused me which was caught on camera by my only security camera that I have at the front door.

by2uat	2019-06-08 02:09:20		AITA for getting upset at my boyfriend’s aunt?	"I’m 19F, I live with my boyfriend and his parents due to my very abusive upbringing. I’ve been struggling with how life is outside of my old household, so I’m only a 3/4 of a functioning human being at this point.

My bf’s aunt is really nice, but I feel like it’s superficial. Don’t get me wrong, I like her, and I’m not the only one who notices it. Bf’s mom has had her fair share of aunt. Aunt is overly Catholic and brings up God a lot. She knows I’m agnostic, sometimes I feel like she only brings it up when I’m in the room. She has gone through two divorces due to her husbands beating her. Which you would think she would sympathize with me. 

The story begins now from last night. We were looking at some yearbook photos from high school last year and this year (bf is graduating today, I already graduated last tear.) They were all oogling over my bf’s dad’s work with the pictures he took of bf for his senior photo’s. It’s okay to be proud of somebody’s work, but ffs they were practically obsessing over the two photos he took. It was kind of weird. 

So, I chimed in about my crappy photos. My dad did them, and they weren’t bad, it’s just my smile was obviously fake, I was crying in them, and my hairdo was from last night’s homecoming that I was not allowed to take a shower afterwards. My dad was screaming and blaming me for my senior photos being late. Even though he knew for weeks when to send them in. 

I bring them out, and you know she’s just saying they aren’t bad. Okay, fine with me. However, after saying that she then says “Wow, he has to be such a NICE man for doing ALL this work for YOU.” She knows the reason why I live with them to an extent. She doesn’t know my stories, but she fucking very knows well that my parents we not good people. I begin dropping hints that we are estranged and that I do NOT want to talk about my family. She continues on gushing about how nice my parents are and she hopes that we reunite one day. This woman knows nothing about me. She then says, “you should heal, get over it.” 

This is where I had enough, all I said was that I did not want to heal. I left the table upset, obviously. 

I get off from my graveyard shift at 6AM, bf’s dad picks me up. He scolds me for dare trying to hint that I didn’t want her saying that they were good people to her. And basically told me that I should have just kept my mouth shut and said “thank you.” He’s like a father to me, I feel like my abuse wasn’t that bad and I should just suck it up.

We have been in each other’s lives for 4 years now. My daughter is 13 and my gf’s son is 8. My daughter and dad are close, by my gf’s son really hasn’t warmed up to my dad and doesn’t really interact with him despite my dads efforts. 

My dad is in his 60’s. Last year he won a court case that paid him out $$$$$ because of an injury at work. He got paid that amount this year and he’s been awesome, he’s still working at that company on reduced hours and they basically can’t fire him, and he’s also set for life. We’ve never been poor but the money is absolutely amazing and he’s helped me and my girlfriend buy an amazing home. 

My dad and my daughter (13) are REALLY close. She loves him more than she loves me sometimes, especially since my dad is very gentle and kinda like mr rogers and I’m pretty rough in comparison. 

My dad is a train fanatic and he’s passed that hobby on to my daughter. He has been talking to me over drinks when we’re shooting the shit about taking her on a trip around Europe to trainspot and I just kinda went along with it cuz I didn’t think he was serious. Well it turns out he was and he wants to take my daughter. 

He didn’t invite me or my gf or her son. When I told my gf she was really excited and then asked if we were invited. I said no. She said ‘well is Braydon at least invited?’ I had to bluff it and said I’d ask my dad. Well my dad said nope, this is just a grandaddy daughter trip, and in private he said to me he’s not taking no kid that he doesn’t know. When I told my gf, she flipped out and told me my daughter couldn’t go if her son can’t go. She said we are a family and it’s favoritism. I told her it’s not really fair to my daughter especially because her son doesn’t even particularly like my dad. 

She’s standing firm on this. WIBtA if I let my daughter go?


EDIT: My kid is going. My girlfriend went nuts and has moved to her moms for the time being. I’m apologizing right now for not responding to everybody but as y’all can understand there’s so much shit going on in RL at the moment. My kid isn’t missing out on this.

We are somewhat friendly with our neighbors, we've been next to each other for 9 years and exchange friendly hellos and stuff. So we're not a complete strangers.

2nd person- My 22 year old fiancee. 

This happened not even an hour ago, I'll try to give full details and answer any questions to help illustrate my dilemma and what transpired.

Phew, okay here we go. Her and I have had sex the past three days, it was good, she got off and so did I of course but we all know ladies need the release or its unfair and I'm all for that. I want her pleasured as well. Fast forward to today, we both take anap after our shower and a long day at work, I sleep for maybe an hour and half, she's still alseep so I decide to go into our guest bedroom that has my gecko, boxes for moving and a single queen bed. I feel like having some me time and I load up my pornhub app, about 10-15 minutes in (gotta find that one video, you know) and I start handling my business. She wakes up and comes looking for me, she finds me on the bed sprawled out with a hard dick, she scoffs and just walks off. I get up, not finishing but wanting to know why she acted disgusted, so I wash my hands and ask her what's on her mind. 

She says ""Am I not giving you enough?"", implying that she isn't putting out enough, I tell her no, I like the sex we have and it's great for me, the urge came up and I didn't want to bother her being asleep and all. She tells me she doesn't understand why I would need to jerk off if she's enough and if we had sex 3 days in a row, I tell her that I simply wanted to and that I don't know why she is so off-put on my self-pleasure. She tells me that since I'm watching porn, I'm looking at other women and that its essentially cheating on her. I stay quiet cause I don't know how to respond to that, I'm not talking to any females just simply watching porn, that I feel is entirely natural for someone to watch and masturbate. I tell her ""It's a natural thing to do and I felt like it. If you feel its cheating then that's your own insecurity and I'm not going to stop doing what I feel is no problem."" She grabs her things and storms out of the apartment to our mutual friends house. 

Now she knows I masturbate, she's come to me about washing her panties after I cum in them and that's been no problem for me. I believe her insecurity comes from her feelings of believing I'm cheating on her by doing so with porn. 

So help me out, Am I the Asshole for telling her I'm not going to stop jerking off to porn and that the problem is her own?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I told her about me struggling to even get out of bed sometimes. I’m also still dealing with the death of my brother and dad, my dad died the day after my brother. 

So I just got my report card back and turns out I got a D- in math and a C in Aquatics. The rest were 3 A’s and 1 B+. Every teacher had something good to say about me. She starts by coming into my room with my friend there and begins to berate me, saying that this isn’t like me, colleges aren’t going to like this and such and such. I never said I was going to college, honestly I didn’t think I’d be alive right now so it’s hard for me to think about college and all of that good stuff. She completely embarrassed me in front of my friend. I would of understood if she yelled at me in private because I can handle it, but being yelled at in front of people is just shitty.

This isn’t the first time she’s yelled at me in front of someone. She would take me out to eat so she could make me talk about shit that really hurts to talk about. I hate opening up to people because of this. She knows I can’t get angry in public so I just end up being overwhelmed and start to cry uncontrollably. It’s embarrassing because I can’t leave, she’s my ride and I live far from the food places.
Fast forward to today, she comes in acting like nothings happened and she sees that I’m angry and starts to get more sad. She just continues to stand and stare at me, (I really hate people staring at me, it makes me so uncomfortable for reasons), so I yell at her and say “what?” and she’s still there. I start becoming increasingly frustrated because I just want to be left alone since I could feel the tears start to well up. She eventually leaves and I know she’s upset.

I feel guilty about it since I know she also just lost her son and her ex husband of 17 years. I feel so bad but I’m stressed because all she does is talk about my brother and I don’t know how to cope with my feelings. School has been so stressful and she isn’t helping that situation at all. She doesn’t even say good job on the rest of my grades. All she does is look at the bad things. I can’t take it anymore, I can’t do anything about it because I know whatever I say will upset her.

So, some background: I've helped rescue animals most of my life, because my mother worked with the ASPCA. My father has always been supportive of this, to an extent. We've taken in quite a few animals because of this- currently, not including the two kittens, we have 4 cats and 2 dogs. My dad has always said that 5 cats is the hard limit for the household, and I can understand that. One or two require extra already, let alone 5. I would know this, because I'm the cats' primary caregiver.

This is where my aunt comes in. My aunt is... neglectful, to say the least. She has 6 biological children, and 4 unspayed, unnutered pets. One thing led to another, and her cat gave birth. Already, that set off some alarms, but her husband had taken the initiative to buy the food for the kittens as they weaned off milk, so I just kept an eye on them whenever I went over.

Well, not only a few weeks after they were born did their youngest (6yrs) try to drown both of them in the toilet before an older sibling stopped them. I'm not talking ""child doesn't understand death and tried to wash them off in the toilet,"" I'm talking ""we asked child why they did it, and they said they wanted the kittens to die."" Stuff. Then, when I came to visit, I saw not only mishandling of the kittens, but also that the husband has made a habit of throwing them. On tile. Over handed. I wish I was making this up.

I offered to adopt them, and they were only too happy to get rid of them, but not before asking me to pay 100 dollars to get Mama cat spayed. Of course, they didn't have the funds (despite going on a trip to the beach only a week later...) 

This is where it gets dicey. We had four cats. Dad said 5 cats maximum, so I called up 4 different friends trying to get a foster home just to keep them for the time being. As teenagers themselves, they weren't able to sway their parents to help, so I contacted two older friends. One said due to having pet rodents they couldn't, and the other told me that their residence didn't allow for pets.

So I did something I'm not proud of and lied to my dad's face, saying I would only take one in. At night, when he was asleep, I took them into my room and set up all their amenities. He trusts me, and I lied to him, even when I know he has a soft spot for animals.

He never comes into my room, so he still hasn't seen the second one, but I still feel guilty. I'll be moving out at the end of summer, and I plan on taking two (my older one and one of the kittens) with me. I don't know, I had to get them out of there, but my options were slim to none. I'm the one paying for everything, but they're still in his (and my) house. I feel guilty, but these kittens are flourishing and their fear of people has diminished, but this doesn't eliminate the fact that I lied straight to my own father's face."	Asshole	1	0

We moved to our current house a little over a year ago. We are on the end of a cul-de-sac. Our lot is shaped oddly, and it borders an apartment complex. There is a tall hedge, but unfortunately it does not completely extend along the property line.

Over time, we've noticed people using our yard as a shortcut to get from the apartment complex to our cul-de-sac and then presumably from there to the grocery stores and restaurants nearby. On the map, the yellow arrows are the routes people are taking through our yard.

Am I wrong for feeling this is unnecessary and needs to stop? We have 3 small children, and I don't like the idea of strangers walking through my back yard just because they can't be bothered to walk an extra block along the street.

Additionally, what can I do? I'm not great with confronting people, but I've come up with a few ideas:

1. Set up Wyze cameras and do *something* with the footage (send it to the police, post it on YouTube, idk?)

2. Put up ""No Trespassing"" signs. Would this actually work, or just make the trespassers mad and make things worse?

3. Try to give Gospel tracts to anyone who walks through and ask them if they're heard the Good News. (We're Christians. Mennonites to be exact so I'm pretty good at being passive-aggressive. )

4. Put up a fence. This is my least favorite option because it costs money, may require getting a permit, and I'm not sure where the exact edge of my property line is so I might need a surveyor to tell me that."	Not the A-hole	0	0
by2nmo	2019-06-08 01:48:48		AITA for telling my girlfriend I'm only interested in marriage if we agree about sex at least daily?	"I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years and we've been talking about marriage. She's great.

I have a very high sex drive. 2-3 times a day preferably, but at least once a day. My life would be noticeably worse and I'd be unhappy with anything less. 

I've been in relationships before where the sex dried up to 1-2 times a week. Since we couldn't get that resolved, it was best to part ways for the benefit of each of us.

&#x200B;

But marriage is a little more permanent. It's supposed to be til death do you part - there is no parting ways. 

&#x200B;

So, am I the asshole if I put it out on the table that we need to agree to sex at least daily, or else we aren't compatible for marriage?"	Asshole	1	0
by2nm7	2019-06-08 01:48:47	Jhinsou	AITA for telling a 6 year old he's not strong enough.	"Background: I work at an amusement park, more specifically as a Game Op. Which means I operate games where you pay to play to try and win a prize. Today I was at Long Range which is close to a basketball free throw just like a little taller.

&#x200B;

Event: Halfway through my shift I notice a boy looking around 5-7 years old watching people play. Which isn't that rare, usually young kids will stare at people playing. The boy approaches after a group of teenagers gave up after 6 attempts. He approached the counter and pulls out 2 dollars from his pocket. I ask if he wants to play and he hands me the money. I hand him a basketball and say ""good luck"" . Knowing 100% this kid won't make it. He throws the ball and it makes it about halfway up. Then I said ""You're just not strong enough yet"" in a sympathetic way.  I say it because I think for most kids it gives them hope for future victory instead of just defeat of present them.

&#x200B;

Well about 10 min. past and this women comes walking aggressively toward me, she asked:

""Were you the one that helped my son"" 

I reply ""Yes?"" 

Then she goes on a rant about how wrong it was for me to tell her son he wasn't strong enough. She went as far to say I ""crushed his dreams"" Which was the point I think maybe I didn't say ""yet"" loud enough. So I try and explain my side which she was having none of, so I just said ""sorry for this accident"".

by2laz	2019-06-08 01:41:38	Sunprofactor90	AITA For not attending my late brother's memorial service?	"Several years ago my 23 year old brother died of a heroin overdose. He was a second year pharmacology student, and after going missing from class for a few days his peers noticed and called the police. He was found dead in his apartment with the needle in his arm.

My brother had struggled on and off with his addiction for years. My father and his wife were deeply in denial about the problem, to the point that they didn't get what I considered to be adequate help for him, and didn't even object to him studying pharmacology, which in my opinion was a colossal mistake. In the year leading up to his death, my brother was clean. He made it through finals and wanted to treat himself, making the fatal mistake of using his normal dosage, and ended up overdosing. Even after his death my father and stepmother were in denial. They wanted to wait for a full autopsy before concluding that it was in fact an overdose that killed him (there was a needle in his fucking arm).

A few of my brother's classmates decided to have a memorial service for him, and the school supported them. Now, because of their deep denial, my dad and stepmom didn't tell the school what was the cause of his death. This resulted in a memorial service wherein there was to be no mention of his overdose, the dangers of heroin, or anything. I found out about this by talking to one of my brother's friends a few days prior to the service. This infuriated me to the point that I refused to attend. I confronted my father and he gave the same response of ""we don't technically know what killed him..."". This enraged me and I stood by my decision. I refused to take part in a memorial service that was disingenuous about the true cause of his death. I considered going, and when it was my turn to speak, telling everyone there the truth. When I played the scenario out in my head I saw a huge scene being created, so instead I just decided not to show up.

To this day my stepmother has not forgiven me. She hates me and doesn't want anything to do with me. My father came around in time, and while he disagrees with what I did, he doesn't hold it against me.

The thing is, from my perspective, they are both partially responsible for his death. They never urged him to seek appropriate treatment, and practically enabled his addiction by always making sure he had money, a car, and his own place. And don't get me started on what a ludicrous idea it is for a heroin addict to attend pharmacy school.

AITA for not attending?

TLDR; My brother died of a heroin overdose. A memorial service was organized wherein thanks to my father and his wife, nobody involved knew that's how he died. I refused to attend and sit there pretending that he just up and died... AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

They leave their shoes, old underwear and clothing in the common spaces. I can’t use the fridge/freezer for my food because it’s jam packed with their stuff. If I do want food, I either go out or cook and store my food at my bf’s. They never take out the trash. They just leave the trash in the floor so their dog gets into it and there’s loose garbage on the floor. Sometimes they have three bags of trash on the floor. I got tired of cleaning up after them so I stared only using  the trash bin in my room, so I know the kitchen trash is theirs and I haven’t contributed to it. They never do dishes or clean up spills. They use my bathroom even though we each have our own bathroom. I have talked to them about this dozens of times. They clean that day and then it’s back to the same old the next day. I’m tired of living like this but I’m locked into a lease. I’m going to “live” at my bf’s house and pay my share of rent because I’m not allowed to sublease. Since I won’t be there using utilities, I told my roommates my plan. They said I can’t do that. It’s unfair. I’m being “a bitch” for  making them pay for all of the utilities. AITA?

by2gnm	2019-06-08 01:26:34		AITA for being upset that my Assistant Manager talked to me?	"So I’ve only been working at my job for a week, it’s retail and my first job. She called me in and she said it nicely but she was saying how the store was messy and I’m supposed organize before we leave. Well I was with my co worker last night and we both have the job to organize it. I had my co worker check if it was good before we left and she said yeah it was. I spent a long time organizing it too.  So I didn’t really have any idea what she was talking about?

Then she tells me that my register was under 12$ two days ago and over 10$ last night. I understand that point because I fucked up but i’m still new at this shit. Also my co worker was 10$ over two days a go. Then she tells me that I can’t be in the back chillen. I was chillen in the back a lot yesterday and my co worker was too, we were both chillen in the back for the same amount and I didn’t think it was a problem because I’m new and I don’t know how long I can chill but I was just going by what my co worker was doing. 

Then she told me that I can’t keep asking them for help because they have their own shit to do. My co worker and my assistant manager. I was really annoyed at this comment because I don’t ask them for help that much. I asked them for help a lot in the first few days because the register is complicated af and I dont know where everything in the store and it’s not like they trained me before just fucking throwing me out and in the beginning they encouraged me to ask questions so what the fuck?

Also, I felt like I was getting the hang of things and it started to make me feel bad about myself because she’s making it seem like i’m helpless and I didn’t really ask for a lot of help the past two days like at all. Like maybe just quick questions like “Do we have this” because it’s impossible for me to answer shit that I don’t know and it was very seldom.

Like okay? So if I don’t know anything you just want me to bullshit the customer? I don’t know what the fuck I’m supposed to do then if I’m not even allowed to ask like 2 questions. Because that’s about how much I was asking. even if I didn’t know shit I think it’s fucked up cus I’m trying my best and I can’t really help it.

Also today she was chillen with my co worker in the back while I was out there alone so I don’t understand why she was talking shit. 

Then when someone asks me a question I answer it and she comes in and asks the person if they need help and it makes me feel bad because it makes me feel like they think i’m not capable of shit when i’m fucking trying but I get anxious when I feel like she’s breathing down my neck which makes me not capable.

I keep mentioning my co worker because she DID THE SAME SHIT AS ME and she didn’t get talked to???

by2f2o	2019-06-08 01:21:22	Silver_Mood	AITA for kissing my ex-girlfriend at her wake for her late boyfriend (died two days before).	"My ex-gf and I never had a real breakup. We've long considered each other to have a special relationship, but we're afraid of losing it so we date other people. 

We dated the last year in college, but never got serious.

It was a casual but intense relationship. After college we 'broke up' but kept in touch. There was no animosity. We just both moved back home kept in touch and lived our separate lives. We still kept in touch and have admitted we've never had an emotional connection or sexual chemistry with anyone except each other. But we always say circumstances kept us apart.


She has been dating this guy for the last 5 years (we're both 29). Over the course of their relationship, she's been very close to me. I know everything that goes on in her life. 

Her bf knows that I'm her best friend who lives far away (she tells him) but he doesn't know we dated for a year. I've met him twice and we get along great.

Anyway, two days ago he died in a car crash. It was horrible for her, I can't imagine how hard it's going to be for her now.

Immediately upon hearing I went to her city and stayed with her for a while. Her friends and family were there but she gave me by far the most attention.

Last night, at the wake (at his parents house not hers), we were in the kitchen chatting and hugging, then I'm not sure who initiated (maybe we both did) but we kissed. 

Now I'm not going to lie, I am very attracted to her and it could be all the emotions coming back but no part of me didn't not want to kiss he. She's gorgeous, cute and feels perfect in my arms.

Anyway, her boyfriend's friend walked in on us and went ballistic on us. We tried to get him to calm down but he ended up telling everyone and making a scene.

I left right after, but everyone at the wake was calling me an asshole, some even threatening to kick my ass saying I'm taking advantage of her, a grieving widow.

The funeral was today, and obviously I didn't go.

I texted my friend 6 hours ago saying I'm terribly sorry for causing this and that I hope she remains strong during such an awful day. She never replied which is fine, I don't expect her too right now.

However, i got text from her mother earlier telling me never contact her daughter again.

I apologized and told her the emotion of the situation caused us to act irrationally, and that it doesn't mean anything.

Another mutual friend messaged me on Facebook saying that she can't believe I'd be such a cunt and the advantage of someone who's grieving.

I know I kinda fucked up and I should have stopped up. But do I deserve all this hate?

It's not that I was taking advantage, I know how this comes across to everyone who's also grieving too. I didn't know the guy well, but I do feel his loss knowing so much about him too. He was effectively my best friends husband (they didn't believe in marriage and they did plan to spend their life together).

I'm very worried about her though.

by2e5j	2019-06-08 01:18:19	burneraccount18473	WIBTA if I tell my friend her boyfriend is cheating on her?	"Buckle up, this story is convoluted! There are many characters so I will assign them names. My ex boyfriend is ExB, my ex girlfriend is ExG, and my friend is Friend. 

As of right now, ExB and ExG are dating. They've been having a will they-won't they thing for years, even while I was dating them one after the other. To make this even more confusing, Friend has hooked up with (but not dated) both of them as well. So our judgements are very clouded. 

I am not friends with ExB anymore but I am super close with ExG and we hang out a lot with Friend. The other day, Friend mentioned to me that she sexted ExB while she was very drunk, and ExB (WHILE SOBER!!!) sexted right on back. He was apparently very into it, too. I won't get into details, but in my view, it was EXPLICIT cheating on ExG.

I can't get behind this. I hate knowing this, and since ExG and I are close, I really really want to tell her. I think it will come out eventually, but that the longer it takes to come out, the more it will hurt her. Friend, on the other hand, is adamant that I say nothing. She thinks it will only hurt ExG and that she can just keep it a secret forever.

This would be an easy NTA, I'm pretty sure, except ExG KNOWS there's something going on, she just doesn't know what. She knows that there's a *thing* and she is desperate to find out about it, which makes me pretty sure that she will eventually know it. But ExB and Friend have a strange relationship, wherein they are best friends but have this very imbalanced dynamic. ExB is paranoid all the time that something will happen to him and ExG, and as a result, is super anal about anything that could get in the way of their relationship. Especially something like this.

If I end up telling ExG the truth, ExB will know that Friend told me (a breach of trust) and stop being friends with her, and therefore she will stop being friends with me. And if Friend tells ExG, that's still a breach of trust in ExB's eyes and he still won't be friends with her. Again, condemning me. 

I think the solution is for ExB to come clean and deal with the repercussions like a responsible adult (he is 19, ExG and I are 16, he should be able to be the adult here), but he is super immature, hence why I broke up with him. So I know he will never do that. 

The question is, will me telling ExG and possibly ruining her relationship to ExB, his relationship to Friend, and Friend's relationship to ExG really be worth it? It seems like it's not my place and it would be more trouble than it's worth, but I really do think she deserves to know."	No A-holes here	0	0

As I was perusing the menu, one of the male workers at the cafe proceeded to make a clearly, snide, snarkful and mocking backhanded compliment, or more precisely remark, about my pink Jeffree Star fanny pack, stating with a smug grin “I like your ‘bag’”. He was clearly singling me out and be rude to me! On top of that, the witless and good for nothing bartender lazily and DELIBERATELY filled my iced tea up ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP. He knew what he was doing as I had clearly observed the deed from Bar as made the drink. Couldn’t even put a straw in without the whole iced tea overflowing from the cup!!! Then as I paid for the drink, as a little, “help”, I put down 0.00 for the tip with a comment of “crappy bartender. Learn how to make drinks properly and not purposely fill a drink all the way to the top”. This piece of scum has the audacity and nerve to lecture me on “respect” when he clearly demonstrated NONE WITH ME TO BEGIN WITH. Then one of the workers at the cafe carelessly bumped into me and I dropped and spilled my drink, making a scene and embarrassing me in front of the entire cafe. The bartender, made another drink, FILLED ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP AGAIN, and I angrily demanded a refund, and told him to hurry up and stop wasting my time. He then became unreasonably upset, lectured me about being “respectful”, yet while he had none to begin with for me! 😡😡😡. Gladly lectured him about his lack of professionalism and told him I don’t care if I’m “not welcome here anymore” as this is the most crummy, disgusting, discriminatory establishment on the face of the earth!		1	0

by2a3m	2019-06-08 01:05:30	mmmmaplesyrup420	AITA if I told two women who lost children that grief isn't a competitive sport?	"I was in school to be a funeral director. Most people who know me know this, and it has led to people coming up to me to ask funeral questions, usually about funerals in their families.

So I'm at a family event, and my cousin (D) who had a stillbirth comes up and asks if she can speak to me in private, so we go off to one side and she says that the funeral home who cared for her boy is scamming her, the grave wasn't correct and, what course of action should she take. Of course I look at the pictures of the grave, see that not only is nothing spelled right, but they didn't even build it correctly, so our conversation goes inside the house where I can access the internet to help her craft letters to the funeral home, the cemetery, and the council for funeral directors who might be able to help straighten the whole mess out. Her loss occurred several years ago now (probably like 2 years). But she's only now dealing with the grave because they hadn't decided if that was the route she wanted to take, and the funeral home is still involved since they're claiming she didn't pay even though she did AND SHE HAS A RECEIPT.

Since we were now in a public area, another family member who also lost a child came in, because she used the same funeral home and had similar issues (big surprise). Both family members don't know each other that well, but the second family member (V) lost her one year old to SIDS 10 years ago.

They both started discussing their losses, and V said to D ""I don't know why you're even bothering, it wasn't like you knew the kid."" At this point I tried to leave because I knew it would go south fast, and I had seen enough issues in the funeral service that I knew it would get physical. D ever the saint, just said ""V, this isn't appropriate, although I understand you're still grieving, understandably"", and V JUST KEPT GOING ""you need to let it go"" she said.

At this point, D has begun to lose her temper and is saying that they both are grieving and always will be, but that it isn't right to make it into a competition. V then shoots back with ""if it were a competition, I'd win, right (mmmmaplesyrup420)""

I said ""I understand you both have suffered loss the likes of which I will never comprehend, but it isn't right to compete for grief, Nobody's going to say you're grieving more or less than the next guy, and just because one of you is grieving on a different timeline, doesn't mean your grief is less valid, nor your loss easier or worse."" D seemed okay with this but V was very offended that I said that, called me an ass, and left. Her mom initiated a very angry phone call with me, where she basically told me I minimized the grief of V, and D shouldn't have argued.

I came into the relationship with children from a previous marriage.    His family never really accepted them as “part of the family”. It was obvious when Christmas cards would come in the mail addressed to only our (shared biological) child.   At Christmas my children sat and watched the biological grandchildren be given lots of gifts while they (I shit you not) were given coloring books. Final straw for me (it was NOT about money, it was about making my children feel inferior in some way); my husband concurred his families actions were inappropriate and we decided to skip further Christmas Eve celebrations to avoid this problem.    It was brought up, but no one else saw it as an issue.    It’s been years now and we haven’t had much contact with his brother outside of a funeral but have maintained contact with his parents who still, despite being confronted, failed to acknowledge my children’s birthdays (one, mind you, who is a day before their biological grandchild), cards would arrive for holidays addressed to only the the biological grandchild. (Can you feel my years of seething?!). I keep things cordial for my husband.     A few weeks ago we receive an invitation to his nephew’s graduation party tomorrow, addressed to “Mr and Mrs So and So and biological child”.  No mention of my children.  I emailed sister in law and said we would not be attending and signed it “husbands name, my name and all of the children”.    Didn’t get a reply.  Husband received a text from brother saying “you’re going to miss my son’s party over a misunderstanding “.     
I am refusing to go.  Husband wants to go. Am I the asshole?


Tl;dr husbands family has disregarded non biological grandchildren/ niece/nephews for 11 years. Excluded them from high school graduation party invitation. I refuse to go.

Edit: random grammar and BIL told husband the misunderstanding wasn’t meant to exclude anyone, of course everyone is invited.  I just cannot get over the invitation and past behavior to even conclude it was any form of misunderstanding and not outright exclusion."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"My boyfriend used to date ""Pam"" & broke up w/ her a year before I met him. I didn't know any of these people before, didn't even live in the same state. Yet this whole time, Pam has been trying to bully me. My bf & I live together now (been dating 8 mos) & Pam calls ALL. THE. TIME. w/ emotional meltdowns.

Pam has many mental illnesses including bipolar, BPD, anorexia, depression, etc.  She's been in mental hospitals & blogs about it.

Pam has lots of men around her finger, bc she's crazy AND EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL. Lots of men have trouble resisting that combo. So she's always having meltdowns & calling men to come do things for her, buy her things, etc. She is a legit model, has been in music videos, etc

And my boyfriend lets her keep calling. He says it's only because he feels sorry for her, that even though they're not together anymore he still cares about her & won't hurt her when she's just troubled & vulnerable.

So Pam stalks me online & calls him sobbing that he'd move on w/ ""someone like me,"" such a ""downgrade"" compared to her that it makes her feel worthless. And it's true I'm average looking & 20 lbs overweight while Pam is proudly anorexic & could be a supermodel. Anyway...

I broke my phone & my bf said he had a drawer full of old phones & I could use one. So I picked one & charged it

It turned out to be an old phone of Pam's & everything was still logged in. And yes, I snooped and I'm NOT sorry, she's been stalking & bullying me when I never did anything to her, never even met her.

But the worst part was not actually anything Pam wrote. She's nuts, that's no surprise.

But her messages w/ a couple we know, ""Jack & Jill."" Jack is wealthy, Jill is also a model, & they mostly talk about money & luxury vacations, which I know nothing about so they intimidated me. But they were actually really kind to me, said they were happy to meet me, & they knew I made my boyfriend happy. Always gave me a big hug when we visited.

Well Pam's device updated to very recent convos, w/ many disgusting comments about me, FROM Jack and Jill, TO PAM 

Jack said I was so disgustingly ugly that the sight of me alone made him puke. ""How could he stand to have sex w/ anyone as fat as her."" That if my bf was so desperate for sex, he should have tried w/ Pam instead of me. Jill agreed I was fat, ugly, but said the worst was my personality. She said I was a negative, constantly complaining person that was ""ugly on the inside."" Confusing since I'm a super upbeat, positive & laid back person & rarely complain ever. Jill also said I was a jealous hateful bitch & was jealous of Pam. I can guarantee I NEVERRR mentioned Pam to them, & I'm not jealous of Pam AT ALL, she is so creepy. 

When I saw all these comments, I was so humiliated I threw up

Now, nobody knows that I snooped like this. Jack's actually my bf's longtime best friend. AITA for snooping and... what should I do?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

The situation: we have a bridge connecting the 2 sides of the upper floor of our house. Below the bridge is the living room with a couch and a table behind it running the length of the couch. On the table my parents keep 2 decorative plates on stands. My Younger Brother (10-YB) is sitting on the couch putting on his socks to go out. Impulsively I threw down my sweater at him as a joke. He shouts at me and I turn around to walk back to my room. As I'm walking to my room I hear a loud crash of glass and hear my YB shout ""the plate got broken!"" My mother naturally rushes into the living room to see what happened and I come back to the bridge to look down at the living room. I see one of the decorative plates shattered and my sweater lying in between the shards. YB begins to blame me for breaking the plate, saying when I threw the sweater it ""bounced off him"" and into the plate. This couldn't have happened as I saw the sweater land next to him. He continues to blame me for the broken plate.   He clearly tried to throw it back up onto the bridge, missed and hit the plates. My parents demand that we both give our money that we got to recompense for the plate. Wibta if I refuse to give the money because I didn't break the plate? 

TL;DR : brother breaks parents decorative plate. Parents demand cash from both of us as recompense.

by27eo	2019-06-08 00:57:18	MentalEase	AITA- For not letting my BF have a sleepover with his side piece?	"First time poster!

So to sum it up fast. My BF of 2 years and I are in an open relationship. We don't date other people but we are open to have sex with whoever. My BF is in a kink dynamic with his ex. They broke up 7 years ago and I don't see her as a threat. However, I have one thing I'm not comfortable with him doing with another and thats sleeping with them. Like cuddling, sharing a bed, normal sleeping. 

I think mostly because sharing a bed with him and knowing I always get to sleep beside him is something I really value about our relationship. 

She lives out of town and he was going to see some friends in that town, and drink. Then wants to stay at her house instead of his friend's house because he is a tad inconsiderate about having sex with his girlfriend when people are staying the night. I told my boyfriend that I'm not comfortable with it and that its a big boundary of mine. I do have anxiety and so I know I would be up all night having a panic attack about it alone in our house, in our bed. I was open and honest about it. He explained to me that it's hard for him to have to balance everything and that he feels bad making her drive every time they want to bang. He also recently canclled on her because I was sick at home. I tried coming up with a plan for him. Like we go to our friends together and then I DD home, and she can come during the week when I'm working late so it works out for everyone. She has a kid and no child care in the evening during the week so that didn't work. He said it sounds like I'm saying that I take a backseat to her even though he's constantly accomidating me. I feel like he should because I'm his girlfriend and she should have to take a backseat to me. He feels like I'm being the asshole by demanding that she take the backseat to me and that he is running out of steam trying to please me.

by26tz	2019-06-08 00:55:34	nomercy57	AITA for telling a bad joke and standing up to my older cousin?	"Stay with me here, it’s a long post, and the title can be misleading.

Some context: my cousin, in college, is a brat. Let’s call her Jane. She’s an intelligent girl with crazy good grades (she’s in university of chicago), but she has no resistance when she’s being unreasonable. Her mom doesn’t really do confrontation, and my family doesn’t intervene because they’re not her parents, so she just is generally rude. 

I, however, do call her out, as I am younger than her with a headstrong personality. 

This is not the situation, but more context. A couple years ago, at my other cousins birthday party, Jane was getting pretty upset that one of my cousins friends (like 9 years old) took the last burger with Bleu cheese on it, so I told her to drop it. After all, she’s a little kid. She stalked off, mad. Later, at Hanukkah, me, my younger cousin, and Jane all got little incredibles figurines in our gift bags from my aunt. We were too old for them, but it was still a laugh. Anyway, my younger cousin and I traded, because she had dash and I have violet, and we like each others more. Long story short, her violet gets taken by Jane, and I confronted her. She called me a dick.

Anyway, that was a lot of context, I know. Anyway, here’s the story.

We were at a little family get together at my aunt’s (Jane’s mom’s) house, no occasion. Jane was talking about her friends, and her mom brought up this one boy who she likes. Jane starts talking about him: he’s nerdy, funny, whatever. All the while, insisting he’s straight, as my family makes jokes about how he has long hair and a high voice. My family is *not homophobic. Not even close.* anyway, I made a non offensive good natured joke of the same type as they did about his seeming gay. Obviously not, and not homophobic in any way. Anyway, she stalks back to her chair and covertly kicks me in the knee. I stare at her, she stares back. She says “what?” I said “why did you kick me?” She then proceeds into a tirade about how it was homophobic, I have no right, and I’m a little kid. I got pissed, and said that this was the second time she had yelled at me at a family meeting. She gets on the defensive, looking around at my family for encouragement, which she doesn’t receive. My dad eventually says enough, and tells me to drop it. I leave the room.

Am I the asshole for telling her off? I know it wasn’t a great joke, but she singled me out because she doesn’t like me.

Edit: for all the people asking what the joke is, I don’t remember. It was that bland. Something like “oh yeah, he looks gay”. Nothing vulgar or really objectionable."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

After she left my husband asked if we always said that and I told him that yes we did and I always tell my other two best friends that I love them as well. Basically he thinks it weird and ‘throwing it around like that degrades the meaning’. I told him he could think that but that I didn’t agree.

by25ss	2019-06-08 00:52:17	mallism5	AITA for not going to my younger cousins high school graduation?	"So tonight was my (27f) younger cousins (18m) high school graduation. I have a pretty close small family and we all live relatively close to one another (30 minute range). His graduation ceremony started at 7 pm. Normally this wouldn’t be an issue; however I have a 4 month old son who usually goes to bed between 7-8 pm every night. Most nights he screams and whines for the last hour or so before I give him his last bottle which would be right as his graduation would be going on. On top of his normally crankiness my son is also getting his first 3 teeth so we’ve been having some even extra cranky nights lately. 

About a week ago I messaged my Aunt and explained to her why I wouldn’t be able to make it. I told her I really wish I could go but it would be a terrible experience for both me and my son and I most likely would miss the entire graduation by stepping out of the gymnasium so I wouldn’t disrupts everyone else trying to watch their friends/family graduate. She replied back saying that it was fine and I could just come to his graduation party in July.

My husband works night shift and every weekend so if the graduation was Monday thru Thursday he would’ve stayed home with our son in a heart beat so I would’ve been able to go. My mother is our usual babysitter(Monday and Friday mornings while I’m at work) so I didn’t have anyone else who could watch my son because she obviously was attending the graduation ceremony.

Today I came home from work and my mother attacked me saying I should be going to his graduation . She informed me that my aunt has been messaging other family members about me and is very upset that I’m not coming. I explained the my mom why I wasn’t coming and she said that I was being selfish and self centered. She said that my aunt was already upset with me prior because I hadn’t had my cousin as a groomsmen in my wedding last year and now that I’m not going to his graduation I’m going to start a “world war”. I explained to her that my husband (32m) didn’t want him as a groomsmen because my younger cousin is usually cocky and mean to him at family events. I told her I supported my husbands choice and that it was his wedding too so I respected his choice in not having him part of the wedding party. My mom then proceeded to tell me that I always side with my husband, which I replied “well yeah he’s my husband so most of the time I will side and support him because we are married. “

After my mother left today I was extremely upset over the whole situation and felt guilty. My husband agreed with my decision and said my mother was gaslighting me. Sorry for the ramble but I just need to know if i was being irrational and selfish about the whole situation."	Not the A-hole	0	0
by25jm	2019-06-08 00:51:26	SunsetHorizon95	WIBTA if I go behind my mother's back to ask money to hire a nurse to help my grandma or suggest she puts her in a retirement home?	"So let's go... my mother and I live with my grandparents, both elderly. My grandpa is doing fine - some very small memory lapses aside - but my grandma is not doing so well physically. 
She has a hernia that is very prejudicial to her balance, so she needs help going in and out of bed, and she doesn't always put enough strenght in her legs to stand up properly, so sometimes she falls. 
Something that makes everyone worry is the fear of she falling down and breaking a bone. 
And that brings me here: I see this taking a toll on my mom and my grandpa. Sometimes they get stressed and end up screaming at her - I know they don't mean it, they know they don't mean it, and she probably knows too - still, I notice this is being very stressful for them. 
None in the house is physically strong enough or prepared to deal with this - my grandpa used be physically strong enough to move her, but he is aging too. 
The way I see it, there are two solutions to this: 
1- Putting her in a good retirement home, where there will be prepared personal to assist her, and visit her regularly 
2- Hiring a nurse. Which would be expensive. But we have a close relative that is in a better financial than us - he even helps with some of the medicine. But mom would never bring up the situation and idea up herself, so I would have to give him the suggestion behind her back. 
Will I be the asshole if I do any of these? What do you suggest I do? I get they wanna keep her at home and are doing their best, but I'm worried for her physical integrity and the mental toll it is taking on them.

EDIT: Folks my mom cares a lot about my grandma and my grandpa loves her - he has loved her for decades - but sometimes they end up screaming because the whole situation takes a huge psycological and emotional toll. It is stressful. 
I have brought up the issue to my mom, and she said that she's been considering the options since a couple of days ago, because grandma needed help when  mom was ill and weakened herself - so we ended up having to call the relative (my uncle) to help us. 
However, she said that she feels she doesn't have the right to decide alone - so she is scheduling a meeting with her two brothers to discuss the possibilities.   
Please do not get the wrong idea. Both mom and grandpa love my grandma and care about her greatly, but we've gone through a lot recently, and that took a toll on everyone, especially my mom, since she feels responsible for all of us."	No A-holes here	0	0

"I'm 17f and have never had a job, my reasoning is I have a medical mystery disability, constant pain and fatigue (other issues), walk up stairs can make me extremely tired as reference (I may have multiple sclerosis or muscular dystrophy or a nurological problem) thing is it's not to an extent that I couldn't work an office job, I'm still productive and go places but I have to use a rollator (walker with wheels and a seat) but for walking more than 30 minutes I use a wheelchair but someone has to push me as I cannot because weak muscles but I'm still very functional. 
Unfortunately at 17 the only jobs I can get are working in fast food or cafe or other manual labour jobs. But my body cannot handle that stress, thankfully my parents fully understand and are supporting me untill I'm 18 and can get an office job, but my boyfriend (who is literally 10 days older than me so yeah) is very upset. (He has a job in fast food so want me to have a job as well) He knows my issues and that I can still do *very few* thing and says that I'm just being a little lazy, he knows I'm not lazy but what he's getting at is I'm using my disability as a way out of getting a job. But I still refuse to get a job as there is nowhere that would hire me. A few other friends and family are disappointed in me for ""not even trying"" and at this point I'm not looking for a job as I know there's no where that'll hire me.
I also don't got college (16-18 school in England) as I left early for my medical reasons and my boyfriend uses this as a good opportunity to get a job.
Basically I'm refusing to waste time and stress over looking at jobs I cannot physically do or that won't hire me. 
(I do lots of chores at home daily and have to buy my own phone and other none essential items so I'm not spoilt)

So am AITA for refusing to even bother at this point to find a job?

When I sent her the email she was nice and responded and later on she sent 2 more emails. I responded to both saying something similar to thank you for the help I appreciate it. 

The third email was saying it should be on that page and I should ask a friend for help. By this time I had finished the online form and was doing other things. I felt she was patronizing me because she sent 3 emails and I responded with thank you, I appreciate your help 3 times.

Now what’s the WiFi password?!”

Instead of telling her the WiFi password, I very slowly step away while I’m texting it to her, and then I begin walking normally once it said “Delivered.” Before I get out of the door, she says “Wait.

I moved in with my boyfriend(Josh) and his roommate (Matt) about 2 years ago and everything was great and we all got along well, they were best friends. Then my roommate gets a girlfriend(V) whom my boyfriend does not like from the beginning and she and I are ok for a while. However we get into an argument because she says she’s going to get a cat (I am highly allergic and my bf hates cats) and I told her she can’t just get a cat without asking us first and we will say no. Plus my dog will likely kill or injure it. She loses her shit and screams at us saying she can do whatever she wants because it’s her house too. (She punched holes in the wall which I didn’t find out until much later) Eventually Matt talks her down and that was that but I distanced myself from her a lot since then. 

We all end up moving in with a friend (Joe) into a 3 bedroom apt because rent would be a steal. Things are great, but V and I are alone one day and she tells me, “I’ve only wanted to really physically hurt you once, when we had the fight about the cat. I wanted to shove my fist down your throat and beat your ass so hard and the only reason I didn’t was because Matt was there and it was damage our relationship, if he wasn’t there I don’t know what would have happened.” I’m going to be honest I don’t know how to fight what so ever and she has been in plenty of them. So after that conversation I didn’t and don’t feel safe around her alone and I don’t want any conflict out of fear she may hurt me when we are alone in the apartment together. And I don’t want to tell Matt because I know he’s going to try to fix it which will not go well. So I just stay as civil as possible. She uses a lot of cocaine and I think she was selling at one point. Fortunately V said they plan on moving out at the end of the lease into their own apt. Matt has said nothing to Josh and they used to be pretty up front with each other. 

The lease is ending in a few months Joe, Josh, and I are on board with moving out if Matt and V don’t.

by23cp	2019-06-08 00:45:05		WIBTA if I asked my husband to cut back on his gym bromance?	"So I know guys like to go to the gym together, help each other lift, encouragement to push through and just BS with each other. Sounds like great time, however, my husband (Bob) and his gym bro (Nate) have been going to the gym together 5 days a week for the last 5 years. Bob always drives over Nate's house at 7:30pm take pre-workout and then head to the gym for 1.5-2 hours. If Bob gets home early from work he will wait until Nate is done to go the gym, if Bob has to get up at 3am for work he will still wait for Nate and forgo sleep to go to the gym with Nate. 

Bob and I have recently had discussions how we don't spend a lot of time together during the week because of our work schedules and gym schedules, in a effort to spend more time together I want us to go to the gym together, Bob completely dismissed this idea for the following reasons:

\-Bob doesn't like my gym 

\-I can't lift as much as him (fair point, but I not exactly weak, I think dumbbell pressing 45lbs is pretty dang good!)

\-He doesn't want to watch other dudes check me out (Isn't everybody checking each other out at some point?)

The couple times I have gotten Bob to go the gym with me (mainly because Nate was away on vacation) he complained non-stop about everything (the people, the equipment just everything).

I've been told I need to get over his bromance and that I'm being ridiculous and I totally can see how I'm being jealous and I don't know if it's okay to feel jealous and a little angry that he rather spend time with someone else than me.

Disclosure: I never really liked Nate, there's just something a little off with him that I can't put my finger on. For example, when someone has music on their phone with no headphones at the gym instead of just ignoring it like a sane person he will blast Disney music for the whole gym to hear. While funny, it just seems off. His sense of humor just isn't my cup of tea but I've always been nice to him and never been rude to him. Nate also has a wife a kid.

&#x200B;

So WIBTA if I told him to cut it back on his time with gym bro because it makes me uncomfortable? Or am I being dramatic and jealous? I just don't know if this routine is completely normal or not. Bob is shape but not like cut or anything."	No A-holes here	1	0
by237a	2019-06-08 00:44:42	Charitzo	AITA For calling out a co-workers attitude on a group chat	"A quick bit of context: I work in a local village shop for some money outside of University (I'm 23), and the shop is mainly staffed by 40-50 women in a serious clique who have been there 5-8 years. I started 4 months ago. I've studied Business and Management at a University level, so have some insight on data analytics, management accounting, and supply chain management.

Recently our boss has been overordering drinks in excessive preparation for the hot weather. This has put a big strain on our stock room, and space is super short atm. So, people have been putting cases of drinks all on the floor. Someone had left a cage in the stock room, emptied another cage of drinks, blocked that first cage in the stock room, which incidentally was blocking the whole shelf where we keep our alcohol. The cage that next needed unloading outside was alcohol. 

So, I asked on the group chat if people could please move the cages out before offloading drinks, and told them myself and our boss were working on a solution to the space shortage - We have a larger warehouse around back, so we were creating stock directories of what should go where based on sales turnover.

Anyway, one of the women working earlier that day, let's go with Becky, replied. She said to move the cage, and that it wasn't hard. I replied emphasising I'd already done that, but that it took me extra time because I had to move about 20 cases of stock in order to move the cage, and that that extra work could've been avoided pretty easily.

She came out with ""mate grow up all u gotta do is move it"". I didn't appreciate being told to grow up, so I just replied saying, ""grow up - professional"".

She then said that she's sorry it's beyond me to move some drinks and that yes I should grow up.

I didn't really know how to respond at this point, I didn't really care about the cages or the drinks, more just the fact she'd been so condescending. So, I just said I was sorry if I upset her and that it wasn't my intention, but I would appreciate it if she didn't speak to me like that.  

One of my bosses called asking what was going on, and he almost sounded mad at me. I explained and then he got all defensive saying that could've even been him that put the cage there (it wasn't, he hasn't been in for over a week). I then spoke to my other boss and she was pretty annoyed at Becky, and that she thinks she needs to be spoken to. In fact, Becky had even been rude to my second boss a few weeks earlier, so she was already unhappy with her. 

My colleague I was working with at the time said it was my fault for perpetuating it. 

All in all its left me feeling pretty shitty and demotivated. This is one of the few part-time jobs I've been enjoying and now I have no desire to go to work.

AITA?

by22mu	2019-06-08 00:43:10	PsychologicalAppeal	AITA for not wanting to live with my bf and his sister?	"Some background on this situation is that I (f18) currently live in an apartment with some other roommates for a bit. I have a small dog and a hamster. I’ve been dating my boyfriend (m20) for about 6 months now. He currently lives at a different apartment. His little sister (f18) is graduating high school and wants to move out of their family’s home because their parents are in a toxic relationship and on the verge of divorce every night yet refuse to seek marriage counseling. 

Obviously not a good situation for his sister. None of us have very good jobs right now so it’s better to live with more people for financial reasons. (I’m also paying for college at the same time)

The situation now is: both mine and my boyfriend’s leases are ending and there’s an apartment opening in in late July, decent timing for all of us. Both of them are on board but I’m not completely. 

They’re both super close siblings and I guess with parents like that they have to be to make it through. But being an only child with emotionally abusive parents and no one to confide in growing up i’m severely jealous of their relationship. Not in a hateful way but I do admire it and wish i had something like that. 

The problem is though, whenever theyre around each other they spend more time talking to each other and doing stuff together while excluding me from it. Pretty much third wheeling me in my own relationship. It just feels extremely lonely and i’m always really bummed out when all three of us are together because they almost always ignore me if they’re together. 

I don’t want to feel like this the entire time if we end up living together. Plus the lease would be a year long. Am i the asshole for not wanting to be put in that situation, especially for that long?

TLDR: My bf and his sister are really close and tend to exclude me whenever all three of us are together. Am i the asshole for not wanting to live with them?

EDIT: I realize i poorly phrased this above when I first posted. Im not jealous of their relationship or her, I’m just saddened that I’ve never gotten to have a relationship like that with a family member and I wish that i could be close with my family like he is with his sister."

by21o8	2019-06-08 00:40:16	hikingfashionista	AITA for not giving my spare pair of hiking boots to my SIL even though her feet were bleeding very badly?	"I’m English and was raised in the UK but my parents are Turkish and loosely Muslim. I moved to Colorado 6 years ago to be with my now husband after we studied at the same university together when he was in the uk. We’ve been together for 11 years in total now and I’m currently pregnant with our first child. All in all, I’d say it’s obvious that we are committed to each other and thank God we are both very happy with one another. 

My sister in law in particular however has always had an issue with me. My husband jumped headfirst into my second hand knowledge of Turkish and Islamic culture (being that I was primarily raised in an English environment) but she treats me like I’m an abused mail order bride who can’t speak English. She’s insulting and ignorant, eg. I’m blonde with blue eyes and she’ll drawl at me that I’m ‘so lucky I can blend in even though I’m middle eastern’ and other common comments are her favourite. She also likes to make fun of my nose, how hairy I am, all said in a super sweet ‘jokey’ tone where she’ll compare our arms, features, etc. Never in front of my husband because she knows that he won’t stand for it, always when we are alone. 

My husbands family have a LOT of downtime (compared to us in the UK anyway!) and recently we went hiking. I’m at the stage of pregnancy where my feet swell easily so I packed an old pair of pink timberlands that I’ve already broken in and are super comfy. Immediately into our hike she began complaining her feet were hurting. After 3 hours we stopped for a break and she took her shoes off and we all saw her feet were rubbed bloody and sore. After 6 hours they were bleeding quite badly. My mother in law shouted out ‘Melike has a spare pair! Can SIL wear them?’ I looked at my sister in law dead in the eye and said no, sorry. I want to keep them incase my feet swell up. In the end, her husband had to end up carrying her back down and she was crying because her feet had blistered and bled up so bad. 

My mother in law was totally fine with it but my SIL hasn’t spoken to me since and this happened a week ago. She has been sending around passive aggressive comments in the family group chat all week, including bible verses about sharing and giving to one another. 

I feel like I am probably the asshole because she was obviously in pain to the extent her feet were bleeding something awful, but I also feel justified because she’s constantly rude and belittling to me. If IATA I will know to hopefully modify my behaviour in the future if anything like this ever happens again."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My brothers trying to take away something that’s his we agreed on sharing, so I’m going to take away something that’s mine we agreed on sharing	"So I recently got a VR headset for my birthday. It’s one that requires a powerful computer to be used.

Now my brother has a powerful computer, and I had already been notified that if it was ok with him to use it, I’d be getting a VR for my birthday. 

We spent about a week talking it over, he said it was fine and that we’d have an agreement where his computer, previously in his room, would go to the basement since there was more space for a headset there, and that he could use the headset when I wasn’t (I play for about 2-3 hours a day). 

Today he’s decided that what we’ve agreed upon would be no longer and he kept saying “I don’t care if we had an agreement, it’s mine, I’m taking it back to my room”. I don’t have the funds to get a gaming computer, so my headset is basically useless now. 

So here’s where my petty self comes in, I have a steam account, that I had some games on, and my brother all of a sudden took over and started using it. We had an agreement we’d share what’s on it. 

So now he’s taking away his shared thing, WIBTA if I took away mine? It has his main games on it, the ones he will sit there and play all day long, along with mine which I also play, but it’s solely my account. So I want to take it back and say “I don’t care about the agreement we had, it’s mine”."		1	0

I quit my job two weeks and luckily landed an AMAZING new job that I love. However, I’ve been going over this situation over and over in my mind. 
I worked in the mental health field and had a supervisor who came into the job (we’ll call her Lilly) around this time last year. I had loved my job at this agency, but after she came she complicated it. She would always invite (just me) our for drinks after work and make it be this “secretive” type thing, meaning I couldn’t tell anyone. I tried declining and she was super short with me and at work for a few weeks, asked again and I accepted and then was my “best friend” (her words). We ended up going out for drinks under this “secretive” thing a few times. One of the times she took a picture of us on Snapchat (so I assumed it was for that) and then posted it on Facebook. I was friends with co workers on there (as I could be, wasn’t a supervisor) and my co workers saw it and it made work insanely uncomfortable for me. So I started coming up with excuses to not go out until she moved on to another employee (who we can call Angie). 

Before I left I learned that Lilly moved in with Angie and was asking Angie to hide it and pretty much telling her she would end up losing her job if she told anyone. I know from talking to Lilly in the past she was hard up on money, but this just blows my mind that as a supervisor you would move in with an employee and I know the employee manual specifically discusses not having “significant relationships” with employees as a supervisor. I feel like Lilly has awful boundaries, which is not a great trait in a supervisor for people who are working in an often stressful field and where boundaries are important. 

So, would I be the asshole if I report her? On one hand, it doesn’t seem fair to Angie (who I really like as a person), and it’s not fair for the other staff because I know she treated me differently when we were “best friends” and def treated Angie better than others once they became “best friends” and I was still working there. 

On the other hand, not my circus (anymore) not my monkeys, and she would probably end up losing her job.

"Almost a year ago, someone close (life long family friend) to me passed away. Someone relatively new to my life, found out before anyone had a chance to tell me and just simply texted me he that he had died. 

Am i an asshole for believing that news of people coming into or leaving life should never been delivered over text message? 

Of course, occasional exceptions may apply, but generally speaking...

Edit: alright, so some people are commenting that i need to realize some grieving around his death, i have. This life long family friend has been a quadriplegia for the past decade, before he took his own life. I am glad he got to make that decision for himself and is no longer suffering. I am not upset that he is gone. 

The person who texted me had been in my life for less than a year, is in a relationship with the first responder that showed up. Has absolutely no connection to family friend. Texted me first thing in the morning, made sure i was up and responding back before telling me the news.  If your actively texting why not call?

Every single time I take him at that time they will bark without fail.

My family and I have a beautiful rescue dog. She's a mischievous thing and will get any food left out. My family all leaves for work/school at 8.30 and I get up around 9-10 leaving her alone in the main body of the house for a bit. I'm a MA student with afternoon classes and I often stay up till 3am working so I get up a bit later. 

So my family are rubbish, pure rubbish at putting food away, especially my younger siblings. The number of times I've woken up and the dog has gotten into chocolate or sweets they've left out in the living room in easy reach is borderline incredible. I've told them so many times and it just goes over their heads. I was really worried that she was going to get very sick soon. 

So one day after I caught her eating a jumbo bag of sweets I decided to put the fear of god into my family. I told them she had vomited and been very ill throughout the day most likely because of these sweets. She was actually fine, she seems to be able to eat anything even chocolate several times.

I was supposed to go meet his extended family for dinner tonight since they live far away and don’t visit often. However, right before dinner, I found out that I had lice from my very young sister, and got it immediately treated and removed. Lice-free. I texted him so he can get it checked out, However, I EXPLICITLY told him not to tell his family because it’s a little embarrassing, and then he went and did it anyways. So, I blew off dinner because I was too embarrassed to go. I see how he sees it (he’s trying to keep everyone else from getting it), but since I got it treated and didn’t have it anymore, it really wasn’t necessary to say that I had it at all. Honestly I’m super pissed and see this as a massive invasion of privacy and am considering ending the relationship over this.

She says the right thing all the time, she's on top of her game and when she has to say something not so nice, she doesn't stress (or doesn't seem to). I guess I really admire her so I started googling her at home. ""First Last Name"", ""First Name Maiden Name"", ""First Name Last Name Husbands Business"" finally ""First Name Last Name Son's Name"" (this happened over a period of weeks - I am not a stalker, just love an internet challenge). And Bingo! Something!

&#x200B;

My boss seems to subscribe to something like EST, Landmark or the Silva Method, only worse. So of course I have to read about it too. I mean, maybe its The Secret of her success! But the more I learn, the more uncomfortable I feel. It seems to have a very manipulative vibe. And under that lens, my boss seems more of a narcissistic manipulator.

And I now I feel I can't un-think it.

A coworker was let go recently and I sent a message wishing them well. They fired back with a lot of hate about my boss. And, against my better judgement, I sent him a link to the site, asking What do you think of this? He called me laughing his head off, and saying well that explains it!

&#x200B;

I'm realizing my boss is two different people depending on who you are - if you make her look good, you're a star. But if you let her down, watch out! I think these courses can be dangerous in the wrong hands. I've caught her in lies but I say nothing, but I can't help feel that more people would be better off knowing what kind of person she really is.

&#x200B;

So I shared the link with a few more people. I know it might get back to her that I 'outed' her, but the internet is everywhere and everyone is 'findable'.

For context, I'm very low contact with my own father and my grandfather who was my dad growing up passed away a couple of years ago, so Father's Day is a really hard day for me in any case.

Onto the point of my request for judgement. My husband and I are both from Texas, he is white and I am white passing Arab (Lebanese). My father in law is a die hard devotee of the Confederacy, complete with a room in his home that is a museum to ""the war of northern aggression"" (we cant even say civil war in his home.) I've always struggled with him because he is insanely racist. He used to say the n word regularly until I spoke with my mother in law and told her that our children wouldn't be exposed to that type of language and ideology.

My husband and I have been together for 10 years this year and his dad has always made a point to let me know I'm not welcome, little things like ""I'm gonna sit over here at the white table"" while moving to another seat (in front of his whole family.) His grandma (FIL's mother) found out I was Arab and began exclusively referring to Arabs as ""terrorists."" On my 32nd bday, his dad said ""well, you *look* white, so I guess that's good enough for me.""


My husband struggles with confrontation and so has never intervened and I understand his fears, so I've just put up with it and slowly stopped spending time with his family. I've never asked him not to, though.


This all came to a head when my husband went to his grandparents house on Christmas eve this past year with his parents (without me) and his dad spent about 30 minutes yelling in the car with my husband about how he (my FIL) is a ""die hard white nationalist,"" is ""proud of his white supremacy,"" etc.  My husband has not wanted to be around his father anymore, but his dad is a gate keeper to his mom (whom he loves.) I support his choices and went so far as to spend Mother's Day with his family (**even though it was my birthday**) and was treated as though I didnt even exist. Was ignored by his whole family (except my dope ass SIL) and was even made to sit alone while we ate lunch until my husband came to join me. 

On the way home it was decided that I would no longer be expected to ever be around them again. And then we get a text from his mom asking if we were planning to spend father's day with them or just wanted to do the Saturday before. At this point, I want nothing to do with his dad, much less celebrating him in any way, and fathers day is a really hard day for me and my husband and i haven't spent it apart since my pawpaw passed and I would like to ask him to go with me to visit my pawpaw's grave (in another city).

"UPDATE: We had a long talk about finances and decided that we’re going to buckle down and get rid of our debt. No new cars for now and I’m leaving it up to him whether he still wants to sell one of his project cars. Thanks everyone! 


So my husband and I have an awesome, loving, healthy marriage. We are literal soulmates but of course all relationships have their issues. 

We have some debt that we are trying to pay off. I’m all for doing the Dave Ramsey method and my husband is mostly on board but he has one issue: he loves cars. He has two project cars that he, admittedly, doesn’t spend a HUGE amount of money on but he’s made some modifications where the money definitely could have been better spent. 


Recently he has decided to get into a new driving sport and wants to get a different type of car. I originally told him I’d think about it if he sold one of his current cars. Well, he found a car nearby that he wants to go look at ASAP and already made plans to do so in a couple weeks.  He wants to buy it before he sells one of his existing cars. This car would take a lot of mods to get it where he wants it to be at aka lots of money.  He says he’ll do it slowly over time but if that’s the case then I don’t see the point in buying the car now. 


I’m normally a very chill wife but I absolutely do NOT want him to do this. One of his project cars was a stupid purchase and bit him (and me by default) in the butt financially. I told him it was a bad idea at the time, but we were newly married and I didn’t assert myself enough. I know better now. 

I think this would be a HORRIBLE financial decision and I handle the finances, not him. Not to mention it’s definitely against the Dave Ramsey method. His current cars are paid off so I don’t care if he keeps them or sells them, but I think even if he sells the one car, we shouldn’t buy another and should instead put that money toward paying off debt. 


So, WIBTA if I put my foot down and gave him a hard no? I don’t want to make him mad (and I know he will be) but I really think this is the hill I’m willing to die on."	Not the A-hole	0	0

by1krn	2019-06-07 23:49:38		AITA if I brag about my best friend to my girlfriend?	"Hi Reddit. Long time lurker, first time poster. No one can really give me a real answer for this situation, so I thought I'd turn to y'all. Sorry for any errors or formatting issues, I'm a bit out of it today.

(For some context, I am a girl).

Backstory: my best friend M and I have been friends for a little over three years now, and last April we decided to get ""married"" (we exchanged stupid vows, completely platonic) for that *""get married on 4/20/19 so your 50th anniversary will be 4/20/60*"" meme. We're still best friends, but we call each other our wives and have a sort of platonic flirtation-ship going on. That's the extent of it. Neither of us feels anything romantic for the other, and so far, it's been harmless.

Until today, I guess.

I was texting my girlfriend (we started dating 6 days ago) earlier, and she mentioned that she thought M was really cool, and that I was lucky to have someone like her in my life. She knows I call M my wife all the time, and she's never said anything about it, so I assumed she was okay with it. I agreed with her compliments, of course, because I love M, and I took that opportunity to brag about her. M's been in many different theater productions and is super talented, so I like bragging about her to my friends. I brag about all my friends, but since M is my best friend, I guess I tend to brag about her more. No one's ever complained before.

I said something along the lines of: ""Sorry for bragging about my wife, I could go ON and ON about her,"" to my GF, which I thought was a fairly harmless statement (as my GF has said that about her own friends before, and she knows M and I are completely platonic). However, she left me on read, and after half an hour, she went offline. It's been a few hours now, and she still hasn't replied, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to apologize or not. I can only assume she's mad, since she's never left me on read and then went invisible like that before. 

So, my question: am I the asshole? Should I apologize? Is bragging about your best friend too much to do to your girlfriend? Is my girlfriend being childish about this? I don't like separating my friends from my love life, but should I? I don't want to lessen the closeness I have with M, but I don't want to compromise my new relationship. Please help."		1	0

by1k30	2019-06-07 23:47:44		WIBTA For Snapping At Potential Wedding Photographers?	"So my wedding photographer dropped out a few days ago, no big deal, it was circumstances beyond her control and my wedding isn't for 5 months. She was a friend so she was doing it for a few hundred dollars plus accommodations which still ended up being around 800$. I want to make it clear that I do not expect a free wedding photographer. I am not a choosy beggar. 

&#x200B;

Mom is reaching out to local photographers, I don't live in the area I am getting married in, but I decided to try some out on my wedding planning website. I picked photographers that said their range was 999-2000, which is my new budget for a photographer since I understand I will have to pay a professional more than my friend. The replies came pouring in, which was a relief since I am suddenly without a photographer.

&#x200B;

My relief was short lived. Literally none of the photographers that have responded are actually in the 999-2000 range. Which started my frustration, because I chose them because that's what it said on the website. To be fair, most of them have been kind in their responses to my ""you are out of my budget"" response. A few have actually offered to work with me, and I think we are going to be okay.

&#x200B;

BUT A FEW OF THEM HOLY SHIT. 

&#x200B;

You would think me not wanting to pay 5+ grand for a ""wedding weekend"" package has shamed the entirety of the photography profession. I know we have a small ish budget (around 13,000) but I don't need to be embarrassed that I can't afford what they are asking. Especially when I specifically chose people based on their stated range, which was a whole lot less than 3-8 grand. Anyway I have about seven angry photographers, who I have apparently personally offended by stating they are out of my budget and I really, really want to send them an angry bitchy message. They aren't being nice, and I feel like shit. I feel like the photographers I can afford aren't good enough, and that makes me feel worse."		1	0

So a few months ago I bought my best friend and I tickets to go see our favorite band tomorrow for her birthday. We have been talking on and off about it since I bought the tickets but a lot more in the past two weeks. I picked up a good amount of OT to pay for the gas(it's  gonna be about 350 miles total for my trip to her, to the location of the concert and back, and didnt want her to pay since it's for her birthday), and to buy myself some merch which is never cheap. I have been messaging her today and she told me she's breaking up with her boyfriend tonight so I asked if she wanted to have some wine when I got there. Her response: yes, but I'm completely broke. I am honestly so frustrated because she knew about this for months and didn't save any money. She went on to tell me how her boyfriend milked her dry from her giving him rides and paying for groceries, but honestly all she would have needed to save is like $20. I've been looking forward to this, and worked hard to have extra spending money for the whole weekend, so I have the money to buy her a shirt but I really don't want to at this point.

by1jgs	2019-06-07 23:46:00		AITA for calling out my (23F) boyfriend (24M) for getting drunk in front of my family?	"I feel a little backstory is necessary for my sake: in college my boyfriend drank excessively and it really made our relationship rough. We would fight (verbally, not physically) all the time because it really made his anger flare. 

Two years later, we have a wonderful relationship. He fixed a lot of his personal issues, moved in with me and my family, and only drinks occasionally. When he does drink now he is actually very friendly, fun, and nice. Not sure how that happened but it did. However, I still get this uneasy feeling whenever I see him drinking and it makes me super crabby. Just brings back bad memories I guess. 

Anyway, today we planned on going mini golfing after dinner. He downed this giant IPA that was 9% alcohol and the equivalent of about 3 regular-sized beers. He mentioned that he felt drunk but I let it go because he likes trying unique beers and we had about an hour before leaving. But we sat down for dinner and he had another large beer in front of him. 

We were at the table with my younger brother and his girlfriend. I lightheartedly asked “are you getting drunk for mini golf?” and he replied saying he’d only had two beers. I reminded him that they were enormous and that I didn’t want to mini golf sober with a drunk person, to which he replied, “then get on my level.” So I shot back with “well one of us has to drive and it can’t be you.” 

I went up to my room and he followed me and said I was rude for doing it in front of my brother, which I agree was kind of petty, but I almost felt like I needed to say it in front of someone else to draw attention to how silly it was that he was getting drunk before our mini golf date. It made me feel as though he needed to pregame to make it “fun”. Not to mention, I didn’t like how he seemingly assumed that I would be his designated driver.

by1jeg	2019-06-07 23:45:48	Jukerist	AITA for telling my sister (21f) she needs to stop having her boyfriend (22m) over at our house?	"My sister got into a relationship 5 months ago and they really drove into the deep end. They're constantly together, never leave each other's side, even when they're not together they're texting/facetiming. Once my sister and I visited my brother (who we barely ever see) and she spent the entire trip in a room facetiming the bf. It really hurt my brothers feelings. It's gotten to the point where everyday when I get home from work, bf is already there and stays until late at night.

Now about this bf: He's a walking red flag. No job, no education post-highschool. I'm not an education snob but if they're going to get serious, he needs an income.
Other red flag- he behaves like a 12 year old. He's talked about stuffing donuts up his asshole to me (because they tasted good), he's used the n-word in conversation (he's a white dude) and he's just generally very immature. 

Finally, my sister and the bf are insufferable when they're together. They ignore everyone else in the room and again, the bf talks like a 12 year old so I find it all unbearable.

Side point: my entire family agrees with my views about them and their relationship, so I'm not alone.

The events leading to the argument: we had some family coming in from out of town, who we only get to see a handful of times throughout the year. I was excited to spend time with them. Also relevant: I had seen my sisters bf pretty much every single day for a week straight, so my tolerance was pretty thin at this point. The out-of-town fam arrives and it's going great and we're hanging out and then, you guessed it, the bf shows up. My sister then proceeds to snub the fam and talk to the bf. It just wasn't nice and the bfs presence made the night awkward for everyone. 

Finally the night ended and I decided to tell my sister (gently) that the amount of time they were spending together was alarming for such a young stage in their relationship, and if she decides she wants to spend time with him, then she has to find appropriate situations to have him over, not during a big family get together. She became furious at me and told me to that I was a prick who was just saying this because I wanted to hurt her and I'm an asshole.

by1i0g	2019-06-07 23:42:17		AITA- pointed out a license plate in parking lot rage incident	"So, I’m waiting in the parking lot at the grocery store and witness one of the strangest incidents of “road rage,” or in this instance, “parking lot rage” that I’ve ever seen. 

Basically a couple in a white car is being closely followed by a older (70s) German couple. Both cars are advancing into the lot, when the white car slams on its breaks when it sees the first spot is open. The Guy driving the German car honks the horn, and starts yelling in German (with the windows rolled up). The white car parks and they are PISSED. Middle aged working class suburb types. When the German car pulls back around, the woman from the white car walks up and yells “FUCK YOU” right into the guys closed window. She goes on yelling about how she’s entitled to the space, etc etc. the German guy appears to almost get out of his car, but I don’t think ever actually got out. Then the German woman gets out of the car and the guy goes to find a spot elsewhere. She tries to apologize and explain but the white car couple is NOT having it. 

So finally the German guy is back in the picture, reunited with the wife. When they are crossing to go into the grocery store, he is still clearly extremely pissed. He pulls a grocery cart into the road, but only slightly, in anger. 

So now the white car couple is like strategizing angrily by their car. And they start walking towards the entrance and pull out their weirdly gigantic phones. At this point, I’m a bit of a distance away, but all it looked like to me was that they were trying to instigate and catch him on camera doing something crazy or illegal. 

There’s a bit of a verbal boxing match in front of the store, and finally the German couple enters followed shortly thereafter by the white car couple. 


About 5 minutes later, German man comes out of the grocery alone with a pen and paper in hand. He walks over to the scene of the incident, and starts writing down THE WRONG LICENSE PLATE. I was walking by to put my cart away, and, I don’t know what took over me, but I pointed to the actual white car and said “that’s the wrong license plate, that’s the car.” He starts ranting to me, alternating between German and English about how he honked because the white car slammed on the breaks (true) and then they yelled fuck you in his face (also true). It was a bit difficult to understand, but he said that the guy said he worked for the FBI and could find him and he didn’t know him (hence, writing down the license plate). He said he was a war veteran, and almost died for this country, and then the guy threw the FBI card in his face like he was a criminal. 


Now I have no idea how much of this was true (the FBI part) I couldn’t hear that much of that conversation.

"I've searched past posts, and there have been several ""get off my lawn"" questions, but in those cases, the kids' behavior were extreme.   I have a few facts/complaints I could mention about the kids on my lawn, but I don't want that to be a deciding factor.  I want a clean hypo where the only question is whether I, as an owner of a house and lawn, am an asshole for not wanting neighborhood kids on it.

Young kids (ranging from 4-9) make no distinction between my house and their houses.  Sometimes they stay on their property.  Sometimes, it's all one big playground.  Sometimes I'm home.  Sometimes I come home to find them on my lawn.  

It feels ""weird"" to me.  I never did that as a kid.  If a ball rolled over onto a neighbor's lawn, I politely and modestly retrieved it.  If they happened to be out, I'd apologize.  

I want to know what the default behavior should be.  I have tried to dig deep into my soul, and I can't tell if I'm just being annoyingly territorial and/or selfish.  I can't tell if I actually fear eventual property damage, or if that's just pretext to justify my annoyance."	No A-holes here	0	0

I was taking lunch and walking down the street to have a smoke when a dog comes flying at me. Apparently it ran from a car that had pulled into its driveway and was parked (and off) by the time I got near it. It gets inches from me and I have to stand on one leg to “dodge”/“block” its mouth. 

An 11 or so year old kid walks over surprising casually and gets the dog. At this point it’s only probably been 10-15 seconds. The kid apologizes several times and I tell him “it’s not your fault, your parents should have a leash.” He apologizes again and at this point his dad is standing at the rear of the car. I tell him it’s not his fault, his dad should be apologizing and make sure to give the dad eye contact for the latter part. The father quickly turned away and walked inside, his kid in tow apologizing again. 

I was furious. Adrenaline in me (I’m easily flustered I guess) I went straight to my car and scribbled a note that his child is more of an adult than he is. He is a coward and should be ashamed. He failed his child as a parent and that he’s lucky I didn’t kick his dog. 

It’s been an hour and I’m cooled off but still feel I need to leave a note with some shaming aspects to it.

Edit: I guess I wasn’t clear:

 I never actually left a note. I scribbled it and left it in my truck.

Also the father didn’t apologize. The kid did three times.

by1fq4	2019-06-07 23:35:26		AITA for Calling Out Family While Intoxicated and She Left Her Wife	"First post here, long time lurker.

My older cousin and her wife adore my sister and think she's amazing.
S- Sister
C- Cousin
CW- My cousins wife

I thought they were amazing people, though CW can be a little unstable, and the perfect couple. They've been together for like 30 years (since freshman year high school). About a year ago S started telling me all these horrible things that C would tell her about CW and their relationship. I'm not going to go into specifics but it involved CWs pill problem and an inability to keep a job more than a few months, among other things. All of it added up to C shouldering much more than her share for the majority of their relationship while she lovingly supported CW. 

The more S told me, the more angry I got about the situation, but there was little to be done. S was being told these things in confidence by C, so I couldn't very well say anything to her about it.

4 and a half months ago, I had started a new medication and had a reaction. I rememeber taking my meds that morning, working out, and reading as I watched T.V.. I woke up the next morning, groggy as shit to find half-projects all over my house, the dishes half done, soaped up and waiting to be rinsed in my sink, my cat's box half cleaned with the bag of shit next to it and the scooper still in it, 4 BOXES OF MAC N CHEESE, just the noodles made, sitting in a pot on the stove. 

And an angry VM from CW on my home phone.

Apparently I had also posted a bunch of call-out posts on CWs facebook. Rude shit about her problems with pills and keeping a job and how she was disrespecting and not appreciating C, and how disgusting that was. I threatened to come to their state and ""to teachhhes thattt bict what FoR"" 

I called CW immediately and explained the situation and apologized until my eyes bled. It was a weird conversation where she started out really mad, but then said she forgave me and she wasn't mad anymore. Then she started talking about how she had wanted to leave C for several years, blamed C for her pill problem in depth, and just generally talked shit about C and my family and how horrible they are, for about an hour. I tried to be gentle and encouraged communication and possibily couples therapy. But it really just seemed like CW was reacting to my horrible behavior and was a little on edge. I called C too and confirmed everything was okay.

3 days ago I got a call from a furious S. C and CW are separating and C blames S for telling me private things, and won't speak to her anymore. S is ready to never speak to me again.

I definitely fucked up...but I also feel like this wouldn't be an issue if they didn't have such problems?

I have far less experience in this game compared to her (which she knows) and whenever I make a mistake in any of the games we play she has a tendency to get incredibly mad and yell extremely loudly, cursing at me and the likes. This is a very common thing and she always seems to calm down relatively soon afterwards so I always just put up with it until she's calm.  
Until the other day. The last 2 weeks (and next 2 weeks) I'm sitting my college finals. I'm currently under a lot of stress as it is, and have other forms of stress upon me right now causing more discomfort. So when I came to play this strange new game mode with her after a long day I unfortunately made a mistake in the game we were playing and so she goes on an incredibly loud tangent about how bad I am. I leave the game and call after saying goodbye when the game ends and now things between us have been relatively awkward and uncomfortable between us.

Okay so he just got off a bad relationship. He didnt feel loved by his partner and his partner always made him feel like he was never enough. He told me all this because we dated for a bit back in college and we had moved past it and become mature adults and very close friends.

So one day when I’m talking to him I blurt out that my friend who’s close to our age is having a pool party and a lot of my girlfriends are going. He immediately asks to come, hoping he could hit it off with someone there. I say okay at first, but I really didn’t want him to go. A lot of my friends are very judgmental and petty and they would look down on him, especially since a good chunk of them are 5”7 and above. I tell him that a pool party wouldn’t be the best place to try and hook up since we would all be barefoot and a good chunk of my friends won’t even look at guys shorter than them, so he wouldn’t even be able to dress up and wear boots or something to meet them so they can look past their initial bias and see he has such a great personality.

The man is very personable and my husband enjoys his company a lot.  Unfortunately,  his wife isn't so great, at least where I'm concerned.  She seems to have an intense dislike for me although I've done nothing to her. 

To give some back story,  his wife has always seemed to have some kind of issue with me that I've never understood.   When we were first introduced at a company picnic she acted civilly enough while the guys were present.  After they left, she walked of midsentence and gave me the cold shoulder for the rest off the day.    More recently,  her husband invited our family to their child's birthday party.  I didn't think much of it until we got there and she started being absolutely hateful telling her husband in front of me that she wouldn't have someone that looked like me around. She continued on saying that it was disrespectful to expect her to be around someone like me.  I'm not sure what she meant by this but to keep from ruining the child's party, I got my husband and we left.    
Of course, this has caused some tension in my husband's relationship due to embarrassment on his friends part.

So my friend Kelly is getting married, and even though it was scary, I was planning on going to her wedding with my boyfriend, Mark. I was actually looking forward to it. 
For context, if it matters, Mark and I have been dating for about a year, and Kelly knows about Mark. They’ve never met, but she knows about him. 

The invitation came in the other day and I didn’t get a plus one. I didn’t really want to go alone, but I wanted to see her get married, so I posted a previous AITA, and people recommended asking to attend the ceremony, and skip the reception, since it made me uncomfortable. 

I called Kelly to congratulate her again on the wedding and tell her how honored I was to be invited. I reminded her I’m kind of introverted, but that it was very important to me to see them get married; and I asked if it would be okay if attended the ceremony but didn’t attend the reception.

So girl that I knew from high school graduated college and came back to the city. She invited me out for lunch twice and I gladly accepted. During each of these hangouts I didn’t think I was being flirtatious with her like that, but apparently she caught feelings for me along the way. Perhaps I should’ve been more careful because I knew she liked me back in high school, but I never saw her as anything beyond a friend. 

I admit, towards the end of the second lunch, I was telling her cheesy pick up lines (which I see as pretty fun to do, so I do it to my female friends) and I should’ve picked up on it when she was flirting back. A few days later she asked me if I was trying to get with her with all this flirting, and I said I only saw us as friends. She got upset and said that I led her on and that she liked me, etc etc.

by1blf	2019-06-07 23:23:56	justlane	AITA for leaving a bumper sticker on my mom didn’t like?	"When I first got my car (a blue, 2002 Ford Focus)I bought a bumper sticker along with it. It was white, and said “Save the planet, Kill yourself” just a funny saying that I enjoyed. I stuck it on my car. Just a forewarning, my dad payed for my car, my dad helped me put the bumper sticker on, my dad payed insurance when I was out of a job, and the car is in my dads name. 

My mother, did NOT like the bumper sticker. And she was very vocal about it, telling me that I could be pushing a person over the edge and they could actually kill themselves, or a cop could see that and arrest me. I was mad, and I didn’t take it off. Because I liked it, and occasionally I would see people in cars behind me point to it and laugh. 

My mom continued her rants on how bad the bumper sticker was. I tried explaining to her that if someone has a “TRUMP 2020” sticker on their car, I don’t have a right to request them to take it off simply because I don’t agree with it, and I tried telling her a cop won’t arrest me for it. She wouldn’t have it. 

I went out to my car one morning to find my bumper sticker gone. Shreds of the sticker were left, but the thing was mangled and thrown in the trash. I was livid, I called my mom and we got into an argument, she said she had a right to peel it off because I’m still her daughter, and my dad said I should just pick my battles and step back.

"So, I have vitamin K deficiency, nothing life threatening but if I want to make sure my blood coagulates properly i have to take medication thru an IV - imagine getting in a car crash and dying because your blood just doesn’t want to stop pouring out - But like I said, it’s nothing to worry too much about, but I do have to go to a hospital to take medication every few months when my lvls of Vit K get too low.

It only takes about 5 minutes to finish the IV bag ( it’s a small one) but it takes 1 to 2 hours for me to be seen by a nurse because they prioritize other more serious cases. I don’t mind that and understand that there are a lot more people that need their attention more than me. 

I usually just mess with my phone, but this time my battery was low and I needed to call my parents to pick me up afterwards, so I decided to play with my Nintendo switch while I wait.

After about 30/40 minutes into me playing, a mother comes, taps me on the shoulder and says “you really should be more sensitive to the people around you. There are children here that are sick, and now they have to look at you playing that. Also, there are people in pain while you’re having fun”.

I got embarrassed, apologized and put my game away. But now that I think about it, I don’t know if I was on the wrong here. I mean...was I being insensitive by playing? The game was muted and the controllers were docked, so it wasn’t like I was just flailing my hands around, but I can see how that can be kinda dickish to the people around in pain.

TLDR: I was in the hospital playing on my switch while waiting and a woman called me insensitive.

EDIT: so, just to clarify some things, I’m 21 F but people constantly mistake me for 16/17, the mother in question had what I assume was a 12/13 yo boy with her, I don’t know what they were in for, but I think is safe to guess he had a pretty bad flu.
Yes, there were 2 women inside de medication room in obviously a lot of pain, they were complaining about the delay, cursing at the staff and yes, they were seen by the nurses before me."	Not the A-hole	0	0
by1a6a	2019-06-07 23:19:55		WIBTA if I told my black friend he supports slavery by wearing certain brands of clothing?	"So I have a african american friend who is a really great guy, but recently he has started really getting into racial relations and the history of black people ect. I think that is an awesome thing to learn about as a lot of young people don't understand what really happened all those years ago. However he has also began playing the race card alot, especially around slavery, often times very unnecessary and against people who obviously aren't going to dispute anything he says in fear of being called racist. I have tried to pull him up a few times about it, asking whether it maybe better just letting things go, and that despite history most people aren't against him in that way now. Almost always he has said ""you just don't understand because you're white""... 

Anyway last week he got really angry at someone who said something about slavery and he came over and blasted to me about this guy for about 45 minutes. And i couldn't help but notice my friend is always wearing Nike, Adidas, Vans ect. All of which are some of the worst brands in modern day slavery. I have out of frustration almost burst out and told him he is being very hypocritical and by wearing those brands he also supports slavery. I know that would make me an asshole, but I feel like I need to burst his bubble somehow and show him the world still has these issues going on, and right now his ancestry is history and slavery still affects some people in a very real way. He is really starting to push away some of our other friends and people in our lives with his very over enthusiastic opinions on his ancestry."		1	0
by1a3b	2019-06-07 23:19:39		AITA for complaining that a strip tease advertised as Magic Mike was actually the Full Monty?	"A while ago a burlesque/strip tease show came to our area and had a lot of advertising. The ads all featured conventionally very attractive people doing elaborate, sexy dances. It was presented as Magic Mike but with more ballet/ballroom  inspired dancing. 

My husband and I were excited for a sexy night out. Tickets were $40 each. Parking was $20. We spent $80 on a babysitter. 

We get there and several of the main performers were extremely morbidly obese. As a result of their size, their movement were extremely limited and they struggled with simple movements.

Even amongst the rest of the cast, they were out of shape and it showed in their labored movements and everyone was out of tempo with each other.  


There were two people on the cast who were extremely in shape. These were the only ones who kept all their clothes. 

Later a friend of mine was talking on FB about having gone to the show. I said I was disappointed, we had expected a coed Magic Mike, and instead the cast couldn't dance, and weren't people I wanted to see naked.

Afriend of hers to asked what I meant. I said several main performers were 350-450 lbs and had very limited mobility.

Well that lead to a barage of angry comments about how terrible I was. I was informed that this was a ""body positive amateur performance."" This was apparently listed in a section on their website that I didn't know existed. It was not stated in ANY advertising we saw.

I told them that I don't mean to disparage the morbidly obese, but the advertising lead me to believe this would be super hot in shape people who could dance really well. 

Some insisted that looks are subjective and who am I to say a 400lb man's naked body is any less attractive than what I was expecting? I am clearly a bigot to think that I can declare anyone unattractive when it is just my personal preference. I was also told I could not comment on their mobility because I was not their doctor. 


The other argument was that it was just wrong of me to say I found their body types disappointing and expected super hot people. It was fair game to complain that they couldn't dance, but I crossed a line by saying I found their naked bodies disappointing. How would I feel if someone said that about me?

I mean,  if someone put up a poster of Chrissy Teagan to advertise for a strip tease, I would EXPECT them to be pissed if I then walked on stage instead. I get the appeal of body positive shows but that was NOT what we signed up for. 

Seeing as how this was not a hill I was willing to die on, I apologized unequivocally both for what I said about the dancers, and for hurting the feelings of anyone reading the post. They continued to berate me, so I just bowed out at that point.

Let me preface by stating the following: I was always my grandma's favorite grandchild. And she makes no secret of it, drives my five siblings insane. I've lived in her apartment on several occasions, and we ~~have~~ *had* an amazing relationship. 

The same can't be said for the relationship between her and my mom (her daughter in law). Throughout the years, it has always been cordial, but there's a tension, and it only increased as a result of their opposing political views (particularly in the latest election). However, my mom does a ton of shit for her. Books her metro tickets. Helps her plan meetings/appointments. Drives her to dialysis. Managerial financial help. The list is long. G-ma's other children come nowhere near providing the level of support my mom has provided (why she takes it upon herself to do these things, I don't know- my mom's a doctor and has plenty on her plate to keep her busy).

There were several minor incidents in the last year which resulted in growing tension and started to make me see my grandmother in a new light, though I chalked them up to old age and differing political views. I will omit these incidents for brevity's sake. The triggering point: close to a decade ago, my grandma had given my mom a ruby ring passed down through the family (my dad being the oldest of four). I don't know much about jewelry, let's just call it the ""A stone"". Well... g-ma was having some of her necklaces cleaned and asked my mom if she wanted the ring cleaned too. Long story short, a few days later, my mom looked at the cleaning certificate and figured out that my grandmother had removed the ""A stone"" and replaced it with a lower quality ""B stone."" She then proceeded to give the ""A stone"" to my aunt (on a different ring).

I haven't seen my mom cry many times, and it absolutely tore me up. She refused to take back the ""A stone"" and gave back the ""B stone"" as well. I haven't said a single word to my grandmother since then. AITA for cutting her off so harshly? 

I feel particularly guilty because she was a major part of my life growing up, and she supported me financially in many endeavors (education, travel, etc.). I am being stubborn for no reason?

If it makes any difference, the other members of my immediate family speak to her on occasion (though not like before), they have not cut her off completely like I did."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My friend and I are into a sub-fashion which is a street fashion in Japan based off of 1800 European styles plus a cute aesthetic and I really hate saying the name cause it's *not* sexual. But it's called Lolita. (if you're gonna google it google Lolita Fashion)

Great resource: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwnmGod0OqM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwnmGod0OqM) ,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKg8kl\_fFuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKg8kl_fFuk)

(I'll be happy to answer any questions BUT that's off topic).

It's a very *out there* fashion and I don't mind it. I'm a pretty social person and while I'm not okay with people taking pictures without asking (look at you taking a picture of an underage girl like that's not creepy) I'm a-okay with taking pictures with people who ask and talking to people. My friend on the other hand, is not okay with that. She just wants to wear what ever she wants and get on with her life. Okay, fair enough. But she can just get really edgy.

""Why do people keep on staring at us??""

""People keep making dirty faces at us""

""I swear that guy is a perv""

&#x200B;

Okay. *REALITY CHECK.* You're wearing a huge poofy dress and look like you just stepped out of a story book. It's not normal. Any time anyone asks her about what she's wearing she goes on this tangent of her sob story and how people should just accept others and this is how she feels beautiful. And when they ask me I'm kinda like, ""cause...it's cute and i like how my dress goes boing boing"" like there's nothing to it for me but she's just *soooooo dramatic.* And I don't wanna make it feel like I don't care about her deeper emotions. I just want to explain to her that, right now, what we're wearing isn't the norm and it's weird and she's gotta get used to it. It's not her job to explain it to everyone. I used to think everyone was frowning at me too, but in reality it's just anxiety and edginess.

&#x200B;

She's also lowkey rude and mean to kids imo. I tend to wear sweeter, cuter prints. So a kid will see me and kinda loose their mind like, ""MOM I WANNA TAKE A PICTURE WITH THE *mOtHErFuCkiNG* PRINCESS"". I love kids, their excitement and pictures so I don't mind. But my friend get's kinda defensive. A lot of guys think it's a fetish so I understand that but *kids?* She'll say things like, ""it's rude to take pictures with strangers, you made her feel pressured to take a picture with you"". I know she's just looking out for me but I can speak for myself, you know?

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I gave her (imo) a ""reality check""?

The first 18 years of my life were filled with complete and utter chaos of living with a bipolar over medicated mother. So many over doses, so many psych holds, multiple partners on the side, abuse resulting in jail time...the list goes on.
Due to issues above and 18 years of trying to get her help she wasn’t willing to help herself so I had to cut her out and move on for my own safety.

30 years old now happily married completely healed from all of the trauma(as much as I feel I can be) and I recently found out my brother was purposely making up elaborate lies about not speaking to our birth mother anymore when in actuality he has been the entire time and even created an email in my name to communicate with her to keep her calm. I honestly understand his stress and doing everything he can to keep her quiet because she can be terrifying and cause complete horror in his life, it’s just the plain and simple fact of his elaborate lies to cover his tracks for no reason, no one would judge him for wanting her in his life, and also for not respecting my boundaries of cutting her off and giving her access to my “email” , when I don’t want her to have the privilege of even that.

by127f	2019-06-07 22:58:36	ellieofus	AITA for telling my parents we are not enjoying our holiday?	"A bit of background first. My sister and I, we live in London and have been for the past 4 years. My parents and my youngest sister live in Italy and my uncle - my dad’s brother - live in Dublin. 

Now, for this week we planned to meet in Dublin and spend the whole week together. Me and sister#1 like to take photos so we asked them if it would’ve been possible going around - both the city and some other place outside of the city- to take pictures. We were told yes of course, we would do day trips. 
After 3 days in Ireland it became clear that the reality of the situation was going to be a lot more different. 
My uncle lives at about 1 hour away from Dublin and he refuses to have 6 (5 + him) people in the car, so me and sister#1 were forced to ride the coach to and from the city (1.30 hours drive plus 30 mins walking)  when we went to visit Dublin. 
No more outing were planned nor were they possible because we don’t fit in the car, and in the only day in which we’ll have 2 cars we are forced to do and go were my aunt and cousins want aka a bus tour of the city, something we really don’t want to do. 
On top of that when we went to the city we were forced to rush around because my cousin arranged for his 18 years old daughter to hang out with us and show us around (we are basically strangers and the age difference is 10+ years) and she just decided what to do and where to go without asking us. 
Anyway, at the end of the day everyone else went home with the car and me and sister#1 were forced to take the coach, and when we got home we told our parents that if we knew how things were going to be we 1 would’ve hired a car and 2 would’ve brought some books and comfortable clothing to stay home and just read by the fireplace and relax, instead of expecting outings and tours and all sorts. 

My mom got really mad, told us we were ungrateful, we made our dad feel guilty, we ruined her holiday, we weren’t invited and we shouldn’t have come (my uncle insisted we came, and have been asking for years, my mom asked us to come too, it was supposed to be a family trip) and while we were at it, we shouldn’t bother with going back home in September and cancel our trip (impossibile the plane is booked already) and that we can see each other every 5/6 years. 

We just said that if we had knew we would’ve been prepared to have a different kind of holiday but apparently that makes us selfish and ungrateful.
Now I feel bad for my dad and my uncle, because really it’s not his fault.

I know for a fast my brother makes well over $500k so honestly this is nothing for him and it wasn't my fight but I stepped in and told my mom she should worry more about herself and getting out of poverty and less on how my brother spends his money because he's doing much better than she is. I was the villain and my brother just said to stay out of it as he took the abuse. Idk it wasn't my fight so I should have stayed out of it I guess but my moms living in poverty and wants to tell other people how to spend their money it's laughable	Asshole	0	0

At the time, me(23 M) and my wife (21 F), were out with my brother (21 M) and his gf (19 f) at a wendys getting some dinner. My wife was pregnant, and far along in the pregnancy and really showing. She acknowledged this and just accepted it. Her pregnancy belly was quite far out and caused her to waddle in an obvious way. 

She went to the washroom and were sitting at our table having a good time, when my wife sits down nearly in tears and quite down, like her puppy had just died, I asked her what was wrong and she said those guys over there (looked about 18-19 or so) made fun of her as she walked by, her words ""they said look at that fat penguin"" and were all laughing. These kids were wearing obey hoodies, and hats, some had justin beiber like hair etc. 

I looked at my brother and nodded my head and he got up, and we decided to walk over. Now, to paint a further picture, me and my brother aren't small guys, were two big native guys, I'm 5'10, he's 6'0, and no lie, he's naturally built like a fucking gorilla, huuuuge upper back, big hands, and just, you get the picture, I don't have quite the same stature but I'm not a scrawny guy. 

These guys were laughing still and as we approached there table (there was 4 of them), we had on our most intimidating warrior, dont mess with me faces (were just two teddy bears but they dont need to know that), my brother has his arms crossed, and they all sink into their chairs and look down, we don't say anything, after a moment of silence my brother leaned down and said ""that's what i thought"".  We walked away and sat back down, they got up and left. 

Should be noted it wasn't our intention for it to go that way, I was planning on talking to them and get them to apologise but as soon as we got to the table they looked down and sank in their seats. In my head i saw it going differently but realised they were cowards who talked about a pregnant woman but retreated when confronted by another guy. And just let them be scared instead. 

I've recanted this story to people and some of said we were in the wrong and wondered if we were the actual Assholes in the story."		1	0

We settled on the plans about 3 weeks ago and I booked my flight and the Disney tickets about two weeks ago. This week she texted me saying she couldn’t go that week because she “has to go home to Skype her dad for his birthday on September 1st and thought Labor Day was September 6th and she doesn’t want to bring her laptop or potentially miss his skype call.”


So I discussed options of just Skyping him from the hotel, telling her she could skype him on her phone and I’d make sure she didn’t miss the call. But she said she can’t go that weekend. She didn’t respond all day today to my asking about alternate dates. She also won’t answer my phone calls about replanning the trip. It’s been 3 days since she dropped the can’t go that weekend bomb on me. 


Tonight I called to cancel my flight. The flight was $355, the insurance was $23 of that. I got $173 back in a travel fund so it’s toward another flight and was charged $150 for a cancellation fee. 


I sent her a Venmo and Facebook money request for $150 since it’s her fault that she didn’t look at the dates and I had to cancel the flight and since she’s been so unresponsive. She hasn’t acknowledged it at all yet and I’m sure she won’t and won’t pay it either. 

TL;DR. Booked a trip to Disney for a friend and I after planning it out over a week or two. Two weeks after I booked it she tells me she never looked at the dates and can’t go that week. My flight cancellation fee was $150 and I sent her a Venmo request for it.

by0zkc	2019-06-07 22:51:24	Flashyjelly	AITA For not tipping?	"Before some of y'all jump down my throats, let me clarify I am specifically talking about non-chain food places that are self service.

&#x200B;

I recently got into a discussion with a friend and I commented that I don't like tipping in restaurants (because I do not feel like it is my responsibility to pay their salary, that the employer should, nor should I be paying them to do their job that they are hired to do). But I do tip because I know it's expected. However one place I don't tip are in local self serve restaurants. Where I'm located at it's becoming more common for you to serve yourself. So you place your own order, get your own food and bus your own tables. I don't tip because I am doing the work, which I don't care about, but I don't see why I should tip them for again doing their job, particularly because I am serving myself. At my old job they pushed customer service (retail) and we would have to do carry outs and load things up for customers all the time, despite it not strictly being in our job description, but  never asked for tips because it's just a part of doing the job. I don't get why in small restaurants it asks if you want to tip, especially when all they do is take your order (and probably run a rag over the table) and that's it. However she was appalled that I don't tip. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

by0x62	2019-06-07 22:44:45	IrishHog09	AITA for getting annoyed at my mom	"So my wife and I just had our first child, which is my mom’s first grandchild and my sisters’ first nephew.  My wife and I live 6 hours away from both of our families.  My mother is a widow, and my sisters are both older than me and single.  These three are pretty much a package deal, you want to see one, you usually get all 3.  They all love our son, which is fantastic and my wife and I love that they do.

A few weeks ago, we were all together at sister 1s house, and my mother asked for a weekend in June that she could come see us (meaning the baby).  I told her I’d look into it and let her know.  Last week, my wife and I decided that the weekend of June 30 would be great; it’s our wedding anniversary and this would allow us to go to dinner alone to celebrate.  Mom said she and sister 2 would come either Friday or Saturday morning, which I said sounds great.

Today, she tells me that she has to work on Friday, and that they’d be coming on Saturday morning instead.  She said their plan was to drive to sister 1s house on Friday, which is halfway to us, and all 3 come on Saturday morning.  Here is where the potential AITA comes in.  I said to her, “so all 3 of you are coming now.   It would be nice to be asked sometimes if that is fine, we were only planning on you and sister 2.”.  Mom proceeds go to lose it on me, saying how sister 1 always drops stuff to help me however she can (this is true).  I told her I’m sorry if I came across rude or ungrateful, it’s just annoying to have it be assumed that we want all 3 at the same time all the time (this has happened a few time).  She gets off the phone with me shortly thereafter and now I’m sitting here feeling awful that I’ve just been super hurtful to my mom, but I can’t decide if I should feel bad or if I’m slightly in the right.

I’ve already apologized profusely, so this post is more for my own feelings than wether I should call and apologize.

On the last occasion I was uncomfortable that a senior staff member kept telling me stuff she knew about the candidates ((from outside the recruitment process)) . TI'm interviewing again with her and it's all internal this time. I had some wine and not sure how that affected the conversation. I said that i was uncomfortable with extra info aside from the application and interview info.she was very cross and felt as a manager she had a good idea of who would be the best fit and I needed to take that into account. When I pushed back shel was insistent that her view on 'best fit' should be a big consideration   Because the interviews are scheduled   I've agreed to do the interviews but have decided to resign as I feel I can't do my job properly.

If anybody is familiar with band kids, you’ll notice all of us are very close to the band director, this then causes some of the students to think that they can be disrespectful to the teacher. There was this group of kids in my band that were just the most disrespectful people I’ve ever met as they caused absolute hell for the BD. They would slap his butt, be uncooperative, talk back, and just all around refuse to listen. One day one of the kids gets chastised and starts crying, saying, “Why does Mr. G hate me so much!” Everyone kept telling him stuff like Mr. G is just an asshole, unhappy with his life, etc... Me being sick of his shit, told him, “He doesn’t like you because you’re a complete asshole to him.” That was immediately an unpopular opinion and it then deemed me the asshole of the band.

by0utf	2019-06-07 22:38:19	tasty-tea-tree	AITA for not changing my email signature to our rainbow company logo during pride month?	"So I’ve noticed that a lot of companies are getting hate for jumping on the band wagon during pride month by displaying a rainbow version of their company logo. The criticism is that this is the bare minimum, it’s a shallow effort to improve public image, and they’re not going anything else to actually support the LGBT community. 

I believe that my (small software) company falls into this category, and I have no interest in changing my email signature because of this. The part that really rankles me is that it’s the 7th of June and this only started popping up in people’s emails today, as if it was an afterthought.

I myself date both men and women, but I’m not someone who shares personal details or opinions about anything online (my first Reddit post here being the obvious exception). And by anything I actually mean anything. I never post. I just lurk. All the time. 

Anyway - there wasn’t an official announcement about the logo at work, so when I noticed it I asked my work mate about it and he got a bit defensive. He said that it’s just a way of showing support, and asked why I hadn’t changed mine yet. I changed the subject rather than risking a possible confrontation. 

I’m not trying to be a hater here, but I feel that I look like a dick to my work mates now because of this. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

by0pw4	2019-06-07 22:25:26	A_Dumbo_Octopus	WIBTA If I threatened to file a restraining at a kid who has a crush on me?	"  There's this kid in my school, who we'll call Z. Z and I are both 14, and he has had a crush on me for a while. He confessed to me a month ago and I calmly turned him down, saying that it would be better if we tried know each other a little more and be friends. Instead.

  After that fateful day he would follow me around EVERYWHERE. And I mean everywhere. He followed me on the way to class, to the cafeteria, and he's just been stalking me, thinking I don't notice his stares. And I thought, no big deal. He likes me. Besides, he's on the spectrum. It's just an innocent little crush.

  Boy was I wrong. He became downright obsessed, trying his hardest to get me to like him. I mentioned that I played Splatoon 2 ONE TIME, and suddenly he wears splatoon merchandise to school every day. I talk about pokemon with my friends, he brings a bunch of pokemon plushies to school. He paces around any room that we were in togeAnd this goes on for a while. At this point he's being a little weird.

  Then came the REALLY creepy shit. I fall asleep in my English class a lot, and my friends have told me about how Z stares at me while I'm sleeping and once even tried to put his arm around while I was napping! He started taking pictures of me without my consent, and according to one of my friends even went into the girl's bathroom to take a picture of me. When I came to school with braces, Z just took out his phone and said ""Smile"".

  He does this every day...I don't feel comfortable in the same room as him, and my friends have volunteered to escort me to all my classes just to avoid him.

  I've told my teachers about him, and they only told him to stop. When he kept doing it, only one of my teachers actually cared. All of the others said that, because he was on the spectrum, he didn't know how to share his feelings. But Z is absolutely scaring the hell out of me. I don't feel safe because Z is always watching. 

  My mom said that I could file a restraining order on him, but I personally think that that would be way too harsh. Then again, he's been stalking me for a while now.

So, reddit, WIBTA if I threatened to file a restraining order on him?

by0mmt	2019-06-07 22:16:54	hesterprynnealt	AITA because a drunken hookup put me in the middle of my friends’ co-dependent non-relationship?	" 

**Tl;dr**: Friends of mine have been involved in a co-dependent non-relationship. The guy and I drunkenly hooked up, and now I’m being ostracised by a whole social circle. 

Friends of mine, “Kate” and “Gabe,” have been in a strange co-dependent situation for two years. It’s clear to me that Kate doesn’t want to actually date Gabe but wants him around for company, errands, and emotional support—to be her “bitch” (her term). She started sleeping with our mutual friend (“Rob”) a year ago and stopped sleeping with Gabe. But she keeps Gabe around like a boyfriend without benefits, because Rob is an overgrown child and can’t provide the practical support he does (cooked meals, career collaboration, car help, etc). 

When I told her I found her behaviour toxic, she lashed out at me, saying I was “a parasite on her and her boyfriends” (at the time I was in a relationship, which I kept very separate from them). I distanced myself but still saw her socially and stayed close with Gabe.

This spring, I attended a party at Gabe’s. Kate left early (to go to Rob’s) and Gabe and I, fucked on various substances, end up having sex—something he agreed was “obviously” going to happen at some point. I’ve been emotionally disoriented following a difficult breakup, but to me, the encounter was fairly meaningless. However, Gabe said he’d have to tell Kate. I was annoyed by his obedience but not that concerned. He has casually seen other people over the last year, while still catering to Kate, and she’s been nominally ok with it. That evening she was outwardly encouraging him to sleep with other people. 

When he tells her, she freaks out at me, kicking me out of all our mutual group chats and blocking me everywhere. I see it as a reprieve. I want nothing to do with her again. And shortly after I get drawn into drama with my ex and overwhelmed by work deadlines and don’t reassess the situation for two weeks.  

When I do, I realise I never heard back from Gabe, that he and a group of friends surrounding Kate (closer to her but people I’ve known for years) have cancelled their RSVP to an event I’m hosting without sending messages, and that they've all stopped engaging with me on social media (ether unfollowing or conspicuously not liking anything). I was supposed to sublet a flat from G&K’s friend in another city in July but that guy stops responding to my messages after this incident. G&K continue to be pictured across social media together. 

When I have the emotional bandwidth, I send Gabe a restrained message saying I find his behaviour hurtful and that he knows I wasn’t acting alone. He ignores it.

I’ve accepted Gabe is lost while he’s under Kate’s thrall. It’s sad but I probably don’t want him my life anyway, if he’s this spineless. But I’m wondering if I’m the asshole: 4-5 people have cut me off in the aftermath. But if I was in the wrong, surely Gabe was too?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
by0m2w	2019-06-07 22:15:29	DunktatoOC	AITA for shouting at someone in the middle of class	"Background: I have math class with a chill teacher and a pretty loud class. There are two people who sit near me that drive me up the wall. 

These two people one day decide to start annoying me. Let's call them 1 and 2. NOTE: I don't care what I wear as long as it's comfortable so I wear similar clothes every day
1: He wears the same clothes every day
2: He wants everyone to be similar because he's always doing and wearing the same things
1: Fascists want people to be similar
1 and 2: *Whispering to me* Fascist!

This sort of thing continued for nearly 2 weeks. I routinely asked them to stop, and they refused. This was really getting on my nerves. I even explained to them why I was so mad about them calling me a fascist

Me: Don't joke about fascism, fascist leaders kill people and some  people that believe in fascism sometimes do terrible things
1: you would know, you're a fascist
Me: *louder*I'm not a fascist, stop calling me that!
Teacher: Please be quiet.

They start pointing and laughing and I know full well she could hear what they were saying because she was RIGHT NEXT TO ME. This routine of her telling us to both be quiet continued until today. This is a math room, so there are graphing calculators.

1:Fascist
Me:Shut up!
2: Fascist!
Me: Stop calling me that!
Teacher: *gestures at us* This area, please be quiet.

1 now gets a brilliantly stupid idea

1: *passes me graphing calculator*

You know what the graphing calculator said? Fashist. I'm not misspelling it, that's exactly what it said. 1 even acts like they spelled it right. when I read that, F-A-S-H-I-S-T, I can't control myself.

Me: *Shouting very loudly* STOP CALLING ME A FASCIST!

To my teacher's credit she just told me to be quiet but 1 acted really hurt. After class people were telling me I shouldn't have snapped like that.

by0ls1	2019-06-07 22:14:42	asilverspxxn	AITA for crying when a boy wouldn’t kiss me in a school play because he hates me?	"Ok bit of backstory: I liked this boy, let’s call him Declan, last year a LOT, and he had a crush on one of my good friends let’s call her Daisy. Daisy would talk and talk to me + our other friends about how much he liked her, their first kiss, etc. Yes, she did know I liked him, but I know now she wasn’t doing that to be bitchy or rude- to her, she was literally just talking to her friends about a boy.

Fast forward like half a year, they start dating, and doing a lot of shit in front of me that was making me very uncomfortable; ex. touching/kissing/bf-gf stuff. Now, I didn’t want them to stop dating bc of me or anything, god no- I just didn’t like all the PDA happening directly in front of me and I knew she knew I liked him. Alas, it didn’t stop, and I became really upset. 

I started talking to one of our mutuals about it, let’s call her Anna, and she would listen and give me advice. Now, I wasn’t talking to Anna to talk shit or anything, I was talking to Anna because I needed someone to talk to. But unbeknownst to me, Anna was going back to Daisy and telling her everything I was saying, but leaving out crucial details. For example: if I said I thought it was weird for Daisy to kiss Declan directly in front of me, Anna would go back to Daisy and tell her that I thought her dating Declan was annoying. Totally leaving out the why, and the context, and everything.

Eventually everything caught up to me, and me, Daisy, and Declan all had a horrible falling out. Fast forward to now, we’re all in the school play, (yes things are still awkward), and me and Declan have a kiss scene in front of Daisy. You might think I’d be happy, but honestly I feel miserable, and more like I don’t deserve it than anything. That didn’t matter though, because even though we had to kiss, Declan hates me now, and literally refused to kiss me. Instead he gave me a hug and patted me on the back. Everyone knew our history, and everyone knew what he was SUPPOSED to do. I felt so embarrassed I went backstage and cried. I know i was rude to Daisy and caused drama, but i couldn’t help but be really hurt. Am I the asshole?"	Asshole	0	0

One guy, let’s call him A, had convinced me and my other friend (B) to join him to the party but B and me both were quite reluctant to go. We agreed after all and went to the party. Once there, we were dancing and stuff but didn’t really enjoy ourselves. Since we found the party boring we all agreed we would leave at 2:30 am. Coming close to 2:30 we lost A because B and I went to get some drinks. When we finally saw A on the dance floor, we saw him making out with a girl. We were rooting for him so B and I figured we could stay a little longer. We didn’t talk to A anymore at this point till we left since he was with this girl all the time. Once it was 2:45, B and I decided we should go to our bikes and wait there for A. Time passed quickly and before we knew it was 3:00, but still no sign of A. We decided to leave him at the party and go home since it was already way past 2:30. Once I got home I found my phone full of angry messages of A that we left him behind.

 He gets VA disability every month and for right now, that’s our main source of income. 

I took a year off school due to some crazy unexpected health issues that also had a huge impact on my self esteem. I’m back in school now and expecting our first child in December. My husband is starting college as well, and working part time. We do not struggle financially but we definitely aren’t in the greatest position. 

I’m planning on finishing my degree and going to medical school. With the baby on the way, I’ve decided I want to stay at home full time and be a student/stay at home mom. 

We’ve talked and he doesn’t mind that or the fact that we essentially live off only his income, but I feel super guilty. I am afraid he will look at me as lazy and start to resent me if he gets burnt out. I could work if I wanted to, I just don’t see the need right now with everything else going on. 

We aren’t in any debt (paid off cars, no credit card debt) and both have the amazing opportunity of free college (parents started me a college fund, husband has his GI Bill)

by0ja4	2019-06-07 22:08:17	LongSpot7	AITA for asking an employee to wear a bra next time? (potentially NSFW)	"I go to the same barbershop for several years and they hired someone new today. I usually get my hair cut by a woman but I ended up with the new woman today. I'm a man.

My standard routine is a trim on the sides, then a wash, then a cut on the top. Everything was going well until the wash. I don't know if many of the men here have got their hair washed in a shop before, and I don't know if it's the same for women, but you lay back in a chair with head over a sink. You're facing the ceiling while the barber/stylist washes your hair, reaches around, etc.

She's washing my hair and extends from the left side to reach the right side. Her chest is right in my face, clothed, but I could tell she wasn't wearing a bra. At the risk of sounding vulgar, I felt a nipple rub against my lips through the clothes. She was also well endowed.

I didn't want to make a scene so I continued with my wash and cut. When she brought me to the front to pay and outside earshot of customers/employees, I mentioned what happened and maybe it'd be better to wear a bra next time or instead of reaching across my head, just move around and work on the other side.

To put it short, I'm banned from my barber now due to harassment. There's no cut corners in my retelling, that's exactly how it happened. I tried to be discreet and I could tell she was about ready to slap me.

So I (29F) met this guy (30M) on tinder like 2.5 weeks ago while I was in his town for work. We never met up but started chatting and that evolved into calls and texting all day. Well I grew so found of this guy over the past couple weeks I paid for his flight to see me. Thing have been insanely amazing and I’m pretty crazy about a guy I’ve never met. 

Fast forward to this week. My tensions were high being so nervous of a number of things; a stranger at my house a week, disappointment, rejection.. and our conversations haven’t been as romantic or lovey as normal. I will take the blame for that since I think I have been on edge. It’s been really bumming me out because I have no idea how to gauge my own feelings upon his actions/behaviors. Like should I lean into this or should I stay super hesitant? I was head over heels and now he’s more distant so I feel like I should be guarded. 

He’s flying in Saturday late evening and we have plans to go directly to a bar and break the ice. He texted me this morning asking when the cruise I planned for Sunday (He said he has never been on a boat so I set it up as a surprise but ended up telling him about it) was because he was invited to a water park with a friend he knows here in my town. Ouch. 

Immediately I get super butthurt like, what kind of feelings or intentions does he have if he’s considering dipping out the first full day he’s here visiting me? Like let’s say we hit it off in person just like how it’s been in text/phone and have a great evening. He’s okay with waking up early and leaving for the entire day? THE VERY FIRST DAY WE HAVE TOGETHER?

I was a huge idiot and got emotional and overreacted so no matter what I’m definitely the asshole but I wanted to know if my original feelings are valid?

I was living with and discussing marriage with a girl I'd been dating for around 3 years.  She went off on a school trip around the end of February/beginning of March  and when she came back,  things seemed off.  It was just little things, like she started texting ""luv ya"" instead of ""love you"" and stuff like that.  I finally asked her what the deal was around the end of April, and we ended up ""taking a break"". I moved out, but we still hung out almost every day, still went on dates, still had sex. 

I had bought her a new cell phone around the time she got back, an LG V10 (believe it or not this is important). Around the end of May or so, the phone malfunctions and bootloops endlessly, as they are known to do.  She gives it to me so I can try to warranty it or something to get some of my money back, while she buys herself a new phone.  I did some research and discovered that the bootloop could be temporarily bypassed by freezing the phone, so I decide to give it a shot so I can try to pull her pictures and stuff off and generally just try to win some good guy points.  It works, and as soon as I boot it up she starts getting messages from ""David"". Lots of messages, of the not so innocent variety. 

I pop open the messages to see that they go back all the way to her school trip. She's been seeing this guy in secret for months, both before and after our ""break"" while also giving me the runaround and acting like we're on the verge of getting back together.  It's also clear that he doesn't know about me at all, every time he tries to make plans with her while we were doing somrthing, she was just making excuses like ""spending time with family"". 

I shoot him a few texts, tell him who I am,  that I just discovered I was being lied to, and that I suspected he was being lied to as well.  Turns out he was recently divorced because his wife had been cheating, and he was horrified to discover that he had been the ""other guy"".  Long story short, we both washed our hands of her and went our separate ways, but literally every female I know has told me that it was not my place to tell him and that I should have left well enough alone.  I even had to leave my job because the women there ostracized me so heavily because of it.  The way i see it, he deserved the truth and I helped him dodge a major bullet before it could hurt him like it hurt me.  Clearly she was the asshole for cheating, but am I the asshole for exposing it?

Edit to answer some common questions:

>Why did you tell everybody?

I didn't.  I told one person at work, because I thought they were my friend, and who doesn't need a friend to talk to when shit like that goes down?  That one person told everyone else in the office.  We also lived in a really small town at the time, and gossipers gonna gossip.

>Why are you calling her your fiancee when it sounds like you never proposed?

When I said we discussed marriage, I meant that we had sat down and decided that we were getting marries. Plans were already in the works and a date had already been set.  I've always believed that a step that big should come from mutual agreement rather than springing it on someone and putting them on the spot for an answer. Maybe I'm wrong.

>What did you do to make her cheat on you?

Well, to paraphrase her reasoning, we had been together for a while and the relationship wasn't ""new and exciting"" anymore. She met a dude that made her feel the new and exciting feelings again so she decided to fuck him. Also, fuck you for asking that."	Not the A-hole	0	0

by0h61	2019-06-07 22:03:24		AITA if I call corporate and complain about how I'm treated at these two different fast food places?	So first off I guess this is pity to begin with, but the manager at a local burger king I frequent often is always rude to me. She's always in a bad mood no matter when I go in there. Maybe she hates her job? I don't know her personal life but it really bothers me that she is like that. I can't really complain directly to her, so my only choice would be to call corporate. Now do I think calling corporate will solve anything? No. It'll make me feel better, and I don't really want to get her fired, but I feel like she'll just get in trouble and that won't solve anything. Secondly I also frequent this deli place, but I usually place my order to-go on the phone. I've had terrible service in the past with this place because I'll go down to pick up my order and it's never ready. The employees have never been friendly to me either. I don't know what causes this since I try to be polite to everyone, but it's like they have something against me. I suppose I could complain to the manager, but realistically I doubt complaining to the manager or corporate would do anything. I just don't like being treated so poorly every time I go in there. As you can see both of these cases have similarities, specifically people's attitudes. It doesn't matter which place I go to, it feels like everyone is pissed off and angry. I shouldn't have to order a to-go order, go down to the place to pick up, and then be made to wait 30 minutes when you told me it'd be ready in 10 minutes. It's just irritating. Do I sound like an asshole? Yes, but I also think that what I'm expecting/asking isn't much. Would you continue to go back to a place and give them money if nobody was friendly to you?		1	0

He's a massage therapist and we intend on making a room in our house a room where he can see clients. I thought it would be common practice for him to have his Degree on display in his office/therapy room so his clients can see he has a degree in massage therapy and where he got it.

Well, his mum proudly has his degree displayed on her living room wall, and I mentioned that he should go to his mum's and collect everything he would like to bring with us, including his degree. 

He says he will photo copy it. And I said, why don't you take the actual degree and give the copy to your mum. And he just doesn't want to take the real degree. I think it's sweet that she has his degree on display, but he's a grown man and I think it's time he takes important documents with him. I suggested we take a family photo, me him and our child, get it framed and gift it to her to replace the degree on her wall. He liked the idea, but still wanted to take a copy of it instead.

by0elp	2019-06-07 21:57:17	burthdaythrowaway	WIBTA for asking to reschedule my birthday surprise?	"On mobile, FTP, LTL.

So my boyfriend has been planning my birthday  for a few weeks now. He refused to tell me what we were doing until midnight on my birthday (today). We're going camping!

Now listen, I *love* this idea. I've never been camping before and I've been dying to go for the last year. He picked a great spot, and we would be visiting some amazing ruins and a gorgeous lake. But I have a few issues.

• I am on my period. I have endometriosis, so my periods are actual Satan *(i.e. cramps from hell, back pain, nausea, fatigue, depressed and irritable).* He has known for the past two weeks that I would be on my period. My roommate was kind enough to offer a cot and air mattress to help keep me comfy, but I would hate to return them with bloodstains. I go through a pad an hour, there's no way I wouldn't bleed through unless I layered up like it's below freezing. Aaand I wouldn't be able to enjoy the gorgeous lake we're going to.

• I would have to do most of the packing, since he's working until midnight and I would prefer to leave early. I could wait for him to get home, but then we'd be up til at least 3am.

•  I would have to go grocery shopping for snacks and food to make because we haven't been shopping for a while. We both have dietary issues, so this will be more expensive than just grabbing some trail mix and hotdogs. Not to mention I have no clue what I can even get as far as easy food to make on a campfire that won't kill us. If I eat anything too salty my kidneys will go commit die and my feet will blow up to like 3 times their normal size. Who wants to go hiking with water balloon feet?

• Between gas and mileage (we would be taking my car), food, and buying extras to keep my health under control, I would end up paying more for this trip than he would. He's not put any money into this yet, but he would be paying for the camping fee. He would probably be fine with giving me his card to do the shopping, but he didn't really offer. And I still don't know what food to get that won't kill us.

• I wanted to do things today, my dudes. I wanted to dye my hair and do some fun things while he's working, but I have to leave soon if I want to get started. 

Y'all, I feel like I'm paying for and doing all of the work for this birthday surprise. Would I be the asshole if I told my boyfriend I want to reschedule this trip so he can actually plan it instead of me doing all the work? This doesn't feel like a birthday, it feels like I'm just running errands all day to prevent this from going up in flames. I know I would end up having fun, but I feel like I would enjoy it more if we could do it another time."	Not the A-hole	0	0
by0e0k	2019-06-07 21:55:46	les-s	AITA for uninviting my dad to my graduation?	"My mom left my dad when I was 2 and we moved from IL to CA. She raised me and my (half) brother on her own and he has always sent around 500$ a month for my child support. When I was 9ish my dad got married and didn’t tell me, I was supposed to go visit him that summer like I had done before but he cancelled and my mom told me later on why. When I was 11ish I went to visit him and finally meet his wife. After I got back my mom heard from our other family members that she had been bad mouthing me to everyone and calling me a spoiled brat and she wanted my dad to stop sending me money because she thought my mom just uses it on herself. His wife doesn’t work, as soon as she got married she quit her job from what I know. Since then the relationship with my dad has gotten worse. 

Last year, my mom got deported. The agreement was that I would stay living with my brother and aunts (from my mom side) here in CA so that I could finish school here. We didn’t tell my dad right away, and when we did tell him he decided to let me stay here and I would get the money. And of course his wife found out too and starting talking badly again about us saying that now my mom was gonna use my child support money for herself and that she deserved to have been deported, We obviously don’t like her and she’s made it clear she hates us. We even have to argue with him a lot of times to keep sending me the money. (Which goes towards my school stuff and bills, unlike his wife thinks) And tons of times he’s threatened to come pick me up from my brothers and take me to live with him because I’m still 17.

About a month ago, we arranged that he was gonna fly in for my HS graduation, so that we could see each other. He then called my mom to tell her, and she made it clear to him that he was going for me and his wife was not going to be invited to the graduation ceremony. The other day when I talked to him he started an argument with me, when I mentioned to him that the day after my graduation I have a MANDATORY work training to go to (I just started a new job) and that I wanted to know what his plans were going to be so that I could plan my days and make sure I was free the time he was going to be here. He got mad and I let him know that if he was gonna be fighting with me, he wasn’t going to be invited to the ceremony because it’s my day. Today I texted him and asked what the plans were. He told me “You do your things and I’ll do mine” I asked him if he was going to my graduation, He said no. I then told him off over messages on how badly he always treats me and that I don’t like that he never defends us to his wife and always has to be threatening me and my mom with the money. (Which he still hasn’t sent for this month and it’s been a week) He got more mad and I told him that I didn’t want to talk to him anymore and that he shouldn’t bother going to the graduation.

"So this is a point of contention between myself and my husband that has reasserted today. We have a friend who's birthday it is tomorrow. The friend is a guy that we have been friends with for years, but we hang out as a couple with his girl and kids. I would say the friendship 60/40 in favor of my husband if you had to break down who he was more friends with. I'm not sure if its relevant but I want to make sure you guys have all the info. 

So I have been for lack of a better word nagging my husband for upwards of 2 weeks that we need to buy this friend a gift. I was trying to leave plenty of time if he wanted to order something online and have it shipped. I've been throwing out small suggestions that are in our price range ($20.00) but he was all nah, don't worry I will think of something. Suggestions included glass pipes, adult games, D&D Dice, and various other interests. Cue to today the day of the party, and hes goes out shopping. He goes to one store then messages me that he can't find anything and hes defaulting to beer or giftcard. I then start throwing out suggestions again.   
Me: What about a new Transformer?  
Hub: No he has too many and I wouldn't know what to get him?

Me: How about a new tabletop game? Settlers of Catan?

Hub: Has he even mentioned that?

Me: No but he like D&D and board games, it might be fun for him to try?

Hub: Nah, I'm just getting him a playstation giftcard.

This is where I get annoyed because this is what I wanted to avoid, and I messaged a snide comment about putting some thought in a greeting card then if thats what hes getting. He followed up by saying maybe I should not be a bitch. Its just IMO giftcards are not a personable gift, yes they can help someone get something they want, but to me they say that ""hey I didn't know what to get you"" or ""Hey I waited last minute and got something on the way"" or ""hey I haven't been listening for years and have no idea what you like"". To me a gift is something that you give someone that you put so much thought into that when the person sees it, they think of you. It doesn't have to be expensive but it does have to show that a value your friendship and I listen to you when you talk about your interests. 

He says that he would rather get him a giftcard so that he can get what he would actually want and not something he doesn't want. And it provides the opportunity for him to get something that he wouldn't normally get for himself, even if only partly. 

Now I see his point, and I get it for people who you are just acquainted with but are friendly too. But these are good friends, in fact they have been rather great friends over the years and I feel like we can do better. And I'm rather angry/annoyed over this. And this argument comes up every time a gift giving time occurs. So tell me reddit, Am I the Asshole for being angry over giving a giftcard?"	No A-holes here	0	0

&#x200B;

So, I have this friend from about 15 years and we are very close. Close enough that I'll be one of hisbest man at his wedding in a few days.

To give some context, this friend comes from a VERY rich family, and he is a doctor. Once a week he needs to go to another city, about 120 miles (200km) away from where we live, to attend medical appointments.

Recently (about 4 months ago) he aproached me saying that he  needed help because he has lost his driving license because of too many tickets and this job pays him good money and could not risk it to lose it.

So he asked me if I could drive for him for about 2 months, until he could get his driving license back. He explained to me what I would have to do which is take his car at 10AM, drive him to said city, sleep at a hotel, drive him to another city close by on the next day in the morning and wait in the car for about 3 hours while he was working there and then drive him back to our city.  So I basically would have to spare a full day plus some hours just to help him. He said that he would cover all the expenses and that he would ""give me some money later"".

He said that he didn't want to hire a driver that he didn't know well and I said that I would help him.

To give some more context, I basically work from home and altough I live a confortable life, I struggle  financially  often.

&#x200B;

So, this brings us to TODAY. It has been 4 months since this started and I gave him several hints that I was sacrificing some of my jobs performance just so I could help him. Recently I asked him how was his license situation going and he said that he had discovered that he lost it for a full 2 years and not 2 months.

&#x200B;

He never brought the finalcial compensation subject anymore and neither did I. Yesterday was my birthday and this may be silly but I was expecting at least a ""thank you gift"" I don't know. He does say that he is grateful for what I am doing often though.

&#x200B;

I had problems in the past with saying ""NO"" to people and some friends think that I am ""too nice for my own good"". I had doubts about the value that he gives to our friendship is not the same that I do.

I think that I may be in a abusive friendship and want to stop helping him so I can focus on my own stuff. But on the other side I don't want to leave him ""short handed"" because I said that I would help him.

A bit of backstory, my Grandfather unfortunately passed away a few months ago due to long term complications. The last time I saw him was a year or so ago at my mother's wedding. I didn't attend the funeral because I couldn't bring myself to go to it I didn't want to seem like a prick but I just couldn't. I've been unemployed for about a year due to severe depression and anxiety and it killed me when he passed.

Now comes the complicated part. My aunt (Grandfather's daughter, mother's sister) and her husband have always been well off for money and have always seemed to be my Grandfather's favourite. It was hard for my mum because she loved her dad but he never seemed to care about our side of the family. Never visiting my family when he was in town even though he would visit my aunt and other things like that. He lived quite a way away with my step nan so it wasn't easy for us to see them. Despite all of this I still loved seeing him when I was a kid and to see what his illness had done to him when I last saw him hurt me. 

The problem that I pose is that would I be the asshole if I asked if we were mentioned in the will at all? I have a feeling that we aren't and I don't want to sound like I'm 'jealous of the money' but if my aunts family get all of his wealth (which was quite a fair amount due to trading in the 70s and 80s) I feel as though it would just be unfair. My home life isn't the best and my mum tries her best to provide for me and my sisters and I just feel a bit stressed about the whole situation.

I'd have no problem if all of the money went to my step nan as she has another grand daughter from her daughter he unfortunately passed a few years ago and that money could help her and the child in so many ways.

My [19F] sister [17F] and I are fairly close and I think we have a good relationship. She talks about a lot of different guys to me, and often says things like “I fell in love today” “I have so many boyfriends” and “I have a crush on him.” It’s all light-hearted, but the point is she jokes about being interested in many people all the time.

There’s this guy she’s talked about for about a year now, she always says she has a crush on him but he had a girlfriend the entire time she’s known him. She would tell me about conversations she had with him where they were both flirting, nothing too heavy just lighthearted chatting. He kept telling her he was gonna break up with his girlfriend, and over and over again it didn’t happen. Finally, he told my sister that he was breaking up with his girlfriend for real and he wanted to go out with her. He broke up with his girlfriend yesterday and him and my sister are going out tonight (him and his girlfriend dated for a year and a half). 

So anyway, in the car, my sister and I were joking and laughing about him/their date tonight when I said “you know you might be/probably are a rebound for him right?” She got very very mad, told me that it was an insensitive thing to say and how I must think she’s stupid enough to not have already thought of that. I honestly didn’t think it would be a big deal- yeah she’s talked about this guy for a while, but she talks about a lot of guys a lot of the time, and I even thought she was talking to someone else more seriously. I told her I was sorry for hurting her feelings but I wasn’t sorry for what I said, because I would say it to any of my friends in this situation. This made her more mad, she said I wasn’t truly sorry and that I wasn’t trying to understand where she was coming from. She was saying things like “I don’t understand how you thought that was okay” and “your timing, tone, and delivery were all terrible.” 

I thought I was right, but now I feel sort of bad. I really wasn’t trying to hurt her feelings or ruin her date night, I was just trying to warn her in case she got too attached to the guy. AITA?

I got pretty upset with this and pulled him aside and asked him to please not take any and wait a couple hours at least until the xanax is out of his system. He told me i’m overreacting and he’s “done worse”, and basically completely dismissed my issue.

Minerva doesn't work. She says at home to ""take care of"" the house and the 3 remaining children. Which she really doesn't do, if you could tell from the quotation marks.

Paul makes decent money. Enough to pay the mortgage, bills and buy food. 

Minerva and Paul used to stay in different cities during the week because of Paul's job, but not anymore. When this started years ago, Minerva decided to get SNAP benefits and claimed that she and Paul were ""separated"", and she had 4 children at home. 

One of those children came to live with me, another went to live with another relative. I've never asked for and have never been paid a dime. This was 6 years ago. And she is still getting food stamps. Minerva and Paul have never separated. At times, there were only 2 children in the home.

"This happened just now in a library at my university, and kind of had a bad feeling in my gut afterward, so came to Reddit to get answers! Also sorry in advance if I don't follow any formatting rules, first post here—hope I'm NTA for that!

For context, I'm a design and marketing intern at a tech company in the Bay Area and I'm working remotely. My final task this week was to take organic, stock-like photos of our hardware so after going through iterations in the morning, I planned to go downstairs to a location that I booked to take these nice product photos (it had white walls, white tables, great lighting, the works!) and naturally, asked a stranger to watch my stuff while I went down to do this. I've been at this library every single day this week, and the people around me tend to be here throughout the whole day working, so I thought it'd be nothing out of the ordinary. He agrees and I take off on my way. I go downstairs and take some crisp stock photos (very proud of my work, I consider taking Shutterstock photos full time and shoot this down immediately). Anyway, I come back an hour after I left (booking ended) and walk upstairs to my table, where the same batch of people that trickled in in the morning still are. I say ""thank you"" to the nice man who watches my stuff, and he gives it to me in the middle of the library, making sure his voice is loud enough so everyone is looking at us.

""You left for so long,"" he said. ""I needed to go to the bathroom. Really urgent, but I had to wait for you.""

I drop all of my things and apologize, giving him all of the variations of ""I'm sorry"" that I know— I genuinely am. I thought he'd be there the whole day like people are?

""It is your bad. I could have left but I waited for you. I'm never watching other people's stuff again.""

At this point, I'm embarrassed and don't know what to do in this situation, so I just sit down and say sorry several more times.

""Don't be a selfish asshole,"" he says as he packs up his stuff in an overexaggerated huff. ""Everyone of you fucking students these days-""

The people around us step in and tell him to leave, some of them laughing. They tell him to leave me alone and that he could've just asked others to watch my stuff while he left. He is silent and leaves for his ""urgent bathroom"" trip. Opening my computer, I'm also greeted by souvenirs that he left for me I guess in his fit? There are several new notes that he left on my notepad along the lines of what he said, I'm logged out of all of my Google accounts, and he sent my coworkers messages on Slack, telling them how much of an asshole I am.

It's silent now but I'm still taken aback by the whole situation. Should I have prefaced it by saying I was going to be gone for a long time? Should I have asked someone else? Should I ask people how full their bladders are before asking them to watch my stuff? Am I the asshole?"	Asshole	0	0

by07uw	2019-06-07 21:40:04	Samsaisdead	AITA for not staying home on my friends birthday when she had plans without me?	"So last wednesday, it was my best friends birthday and we got the results for our final exams. I asked my best friend if she would like to go out for a drink to celebrate both occasions and she politely declined because her father was in town and she didnt know what he planned for her birthday. So I eventually went out with different friends and a few classmates we met by coincidence. We drank a few beers in the local park, talked, nothing special.

She started texting me during the evening and was mad I was out with them and cancelled our next meet up. She was disappointed that we didnt bother inviting her, to which I responded that she had specifically told me that her father was in town and she didnt have time. 
Then she claimed that the plans we had made would have been right after school (which is not true btw, I only have time in the evening and she knows that)

So I explained that not only was she clear about being busy, I myself was also just a guest and not in the position to invite people.

She became really mad and said that I always blame other people. So I apologised and offered her a drink or a coffee and a minute to talk about that in person, which she refused.

In addition I offered to inform her about every plan I had from now on so she could participate or ignore it, but she just went on a rant about how I value my freedom more than this friendship, called me a bad influence and toxic person in general and blames me for ruining her birthday.

I told her clearly that I value my freedom a lot which doesnt invalidate our friendship, and that I'm not going to allow her to take control of my social life or who I'm friends with (for clarification, she was already mad at me when I became friends with a girl I shared a room with during a trip, its not the first time something like this happens)

Its the second big fight in two months and this time she blocked me when I didn't answer, I'm really unsure about the whole thing. Am I the asshole here?


Edit: Thank you all for your opinion, I really appreciate it. I miss her dearly, but I guess I really dodged a bullet here."	Not the A-hole	0	0
by07iv	2019-06-07 21:39:09		AITA for cheating on my unfaithful gf with her Dad?	"My gf (23F) and I (25M) have been dating for 3+1/2 years, since she was 19 and I had just turned 21. Got to know her family pretty well in that time.

I'm bisexual. I'm not out to anyone. Her Dad is 'straight'

On the last day of Jan 18, my gfs mother died. For a time, we saw my gfs father every day. The summer of that year that year, I was hanging out with FIL alone a lot.

I was a gym rat for years, but had stopped going after MIL died and hadnt got back into it. I was starting to lose some definition. One night I was at his house (alone) and was complaining about how I was losing muscle and needed to get back to the gym. He told me to show him. I took off my shirt. He grabbed my arm and squeezed it saying it looked good, and then ran his fingers down my chest and patted my belly. It felt sexual. That night, I went home and felt angry at myself.

So on Thurs last week I was on Facebook and I saw that someone had commented 'sexy' under my gfs profiler. Our relationship had been okay, sex life fine etc.  The only men that comment things like that on her photos are me and one of her close friends (who is gay), so I was immediately suspicious. I resolved that it was a mistake.

That night I couldnt rest and something felt off.  She had gone to do laundry + left her phone. She had an unopened SC from a guy she was friends with in college who I havent heard about since she graduated. I opened the pic and it was a dick. I went on her FB messenger and found strings of sexts between her and the same guy, who I  recognised from photos in the chatlog. Except he was using a different mans picture in the profile picture and a fake name (the same profile who had commented)

We broke it off. The most notable part about this is that she seemed relieved about me finding out, which I think infuriated me more.

I txt her Dad the following day (Fri) asking could we talk. When I got there I told him everything about what happened with gf and he was pretty upset that we were finished. 

Then again on Sun I asked could I come over, and he said yes. At one point, he said he was getting cold so he turned up the thermostat, and about a 1/2 hr later he said he was too warm, but instead of turning down the thermo he took his shirt and pants off. 20 mins went by and I said I was too warm, and he encouraged me to take off my shirt and pants. We were both naked. I was hard, he was semi but we ignored it.

We got chatting about gf and I was upset. He began rubbing my leg and I kind of leaned into it so that his hand was on my cock. Pretty soon he was sucking me. During the night I sucked him, we kissed, He sucked me, We jerked eachother and fingered eachother.

I am genuinely at an emotional crossroads and I dont know how I look from the outside. I loved my girl so much and I feel lost without her but I Have such a connection to her Dad both sexual and emotional.

Tl;dr: fucked my gfs Dad after she cheated on me."		1	0

I've actually gotten really good at shutting him down. All I have to do is giving really sarcastic ""OMG ARE YOU SERIOUS"" or a really condescending ""WOW..... THAT'S AMAZING"".

A couple of weeks ago I got called into the HR office, Mr. One-Upper filed a complaint against me. He said that I was harassing him with a barrage of micro aggressions. 

Now I have resorted to harassing him with kindness. I'm always calling him buddy, champ, pal, or bro. Constantly giving him high fives and ""way to go's"".

The dog is 5 months old and it's been here for two months, and our roommate has failed to potty train it so it pees and shit's indoors, and if it happens to shit outdoors he just leaves outside and doesn't clean it up. We told him he needs to housebreak it because we are sick of cleaning up after a dog we did not agree to.

To make matters worse he leaves for full weekends at least twice a month and doesn't return until Monday without notifying anyone, expecting us to feed, water, and clean up after his dog. This week he left on Monday without saying anything and we all work full time jobs so the dog get peeing indoors, so today I took the dog to the pound.

by065h	2019-06-07 21:35:34	ijustwantmytuesdays	WIBTA if I didn't join my boyfriend and roommate's DnD game, possibly ruining it?	"I live with my boyfriend and three roommates. For the sake of the story, my bf is Keith and our roommates are Arnold, David and Adam.

My boyfriend and I work together and have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off. Tuesdays are the best because it's a full day of no worries at all, and I can do anything I want all day. I play a lot of World of Warcraft and the raids also all reset on Tues, so it works out well because I can play as long as I want. My Tuesdays are sacred to me.

Arnold and Keith love to play Dungeons and Dragons but haven't in a long time as their old group disbanded. Arnold came to us saying he wanted to start a campaign with all the people in the house. Adam said no but the rest of us said sure.

I've never played DnD before and have just mostly wanted to try it for the sake of trying it, but I'm not usually into tabletop games so I don't know if I'll like it, I made sure to tell them that. They said that's fine because it will be a casual game. I was under the impression that this meant it'd be cool if I wasn't interested and decided to leave later on.

My boyfriend told my today that they have all decided DnD is going to be on Tuesdays. I don't know if you know about DnD but the games are LONG. HOURS. All day events, especially with these guys. I said I wasn't too sure and my bf said Arnold has been pouring his heart out into writing this campaign every night after work. He said that since Arnold is the Dungeon Master, Keith, David and I will be the only players, and it will be too hard without me. I asked if they have friends that would play, he said maybe, but it works better with me because we're all in the same house, and he wants to play with me because I'm his gf. He said he hardly even sees a point in playing if I don't, so all of Arnold's work is for naught.

I suggested Wednesdays and he said no because they can't play all night because of work in the morning. 

I said I don't want a rigid schedule of having to play a game I might not even like every week, all day, on my only real full day off, and I want to be able to take days off and such. He said then there's no real point in playing, because that's not how DnD really works. They don't want to do it after work on our weekdays, which I can understand and also agree with.

He's pretty upset about it mostly because he thinks it will crush Arnold. (He's not making a huge deal out of it or anything he's just upset.) I understand, and have tried to compromise, but I really just want my damn Tuesdays to myself. If this was any other day I'd be fine with it.

I feel like this was all a misunderstanding and that I was under the impression this would just be for fun so I can try it, and they were under the impression I was joining as a permanent party member.

Thinks faded out because he only seemed interested in sex and would mistreat me. He first had sex with me when I was very drunk and with his friends. Cheated on one of his girlfriends with me when I had no idea they were dating. Said he felt no connection to me, so when I graduated, I moved away. I talked to him sometimes over text. 


After two years he had a new girlfriend I hadn't physically seen him in two years. He blew up my phone six months into their relationship. He tried cheating with me and sexting which I obviously refused. He also asked for photos of me, hooking up with other men, which I declined. He keeps sexual pictures of me even years later.

He asked if he broke up with his girlfriend if we would be cool. He told me they broke up a couple of weeks later. I kept ignoring him, and he sent tons of texts saying he missed me. He got a new girlfriend a month then. I didn't talk to him for another year. He texts me again trying to cheat and trying to face time me he still keeps old photos of me.

Even after four years of not seeing him and blocking him, he still tries to email me, asking if we can be ”friendly.”   I blew up at him and called him a waste of space, awful person, sociopath, and monster now he hasn't messaged me in months. He also told me if I keep putting him down, I should stop messaging him. This guy could get with many other women. He has a high partner count and has lots of women flirting with him. So he could easily get sex somewhere else.

by058r	2019-06-07 21:33:13	robert_ah_booey	AITA for not wanting a relationship with my dad	"I'm 47M and my dad is around 63. He is not my biological father but he married my mom when I was a baby.
He was a pretty shitty dad. I don't have any fond memories of him. He never came to any games of mine, never played catch, never did typical dad things. What he did do is drink a lot, beat the crap out of me and my brother, and cheat on my mom repeatedly.  He's since been married 5 times and fucked up every one of them by drinking and cheating.

My mom eventually had a nervous breakdown because of my dad's behavior and had to go to a mental hospital in a different city and ended up meeting a guy and staying in that city so my brother and I lived with my dad.

My dad was a real asshole and I did my best to avoid him growing up. He kicked me out of the house when I graduated high school.  I left, joined the military and have only seen my dad a handful of times in the past 30 years. I have two sons, 15 and 10 and he hasn't seen either of them for 10 years. He doesn't send them birthday cards or anything. 

I live in another state than my dad now, have a wife and 4 kids (two bio, two step) and though I struggle sometimes, I am doing pretty good considering what that asshole put me through growing up.  I just basically do the opposite of what my dad would do and things have worked out pretty good so far.

I told my wife I would be ok never hearing from him again and would likely only come to his funeral to pay my respects but that is about it. He always treated me like shit and everybody around him.

I really don't want my wife and kids around this guy but he calls me today (first time I've heard from him in years) and he is drunk (as usual) and he starts going on about he is sorry and he knows he treated me badly, etc.
I told him it was ok, everything is cool, no hard feelings (all true) but then he started hinting about wanting me to come visit him.
I just have little interest in doing that. He is a powder keg and I don't want my family around that stuff. I'm very protective of my wife and kids.

I do feel bad for him on some level, that after all these years he finally figured out you can't treat everybody around you like dogshit and expect them to give a shit about you. I think he is old and lonely and now wants to have some kind of relationship but I don't really want to. The way I see it is he didn't make a few minor mistakes in his life, he made several HUGE ones and fucked up lots of peoples lives, over and over again and just because he finds himself all alone, should I just forget everything bad he has done and pick up like we are Andy Griffith and Opie?

by04jq	2019-06-07 21:31:29	Carrot897	AITA for telling my partner I'm not interested in a certain topic of conversation	"My partner studies music production. His entire day is occupied by creating beats or learning about music, sounds and sound engineering. He also loves to talk and I find myself in a conversation out of the blue, even when I'm in the middle of doing other things. I love when he shows me his work and lets me fiddle around with his programs/ instruments. 

Anyways, he often wants to talk about what he learned and other little discoveries during the day but I find it so difficult to concentrate on what he is saying when he starts to explain things such as how sound is absorbed by certain materials, how a song is structure, how he finds out what note a sound has, what a note is etc etc. I'm just not interested and once he starts I have no idea how long the explanation will go on for, not to mention the conversation is in italian... a language I've been speaking for only about 2 years and so I really need to concentrate to be able to take everything in. I find my mind wandering and notice that I have a hard time paying attention during these conversations. 

Today I asked him if it was really necessary to explain the particulars of his music studies as I find it uninteresting and hard to follow along. This turned into an argument and he went on to say that I don't support his passions, what's the point in saying anything if he can't talk about what he does all day, what's the point in saying anything at all, I'm going to lose the people i have in my life if I treat them in this way and am not interested in what they have to say etc

Should I bite the bullet and act interested even when I'm not? Am I an asshole for not trying to be more involved in this area of his life? Did I go about this in the wrong way? Help!

EDIT: after reading a lot of YTA responses and few NTAs it really put things into perspective for me. I made peace with him and have had a bit of a change of mindset that i believe will make listening to such conversations less of an ‘effort’ for me. I also asked that he try to explain these sorts of things in english so that it may help me to focus and that he be more attentive as to when he brings it up (i also need to communicate to him when i’m in the middle of something and ask him if we can talk about it afterwards).

by03wd	2019-06-07 21:29:45		AITA for making my own plans for my own birthday?	"So today is my birthday (Yes, I'm on Reddit, waiting for people to arrive / festivities to begin) and some shit has gone down that has, to be quite honest, pissed me off.

&#x200B;

Last weekend my parents asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday. I absolutely love sushi, and I knew immediately that I wanted to take my parents to a Japanese restaurant for hibachi/sushi. For my birthday, I want my parents to try some sushi, since they've been resistant to it their entire lives.

&#x200B;

Enter: My fiancee.

&#x200B;

Fiancee tells me she is annoyed that I made plans without asking her first. She says that she wishes she was able to spend time with me 1:1 on my birthday. This isn't really possible with the dinner plans that I made with my parents (fiancee is invited, duh) because we both worked all day and dinner is pretty much the rest of the entire night. She called me on her way home from work to remind me, yet again, right before dinner, how annoyed she is with the fact that I made these plans without asking her.

&#x200B;

My argument (in less aggressive words) is essentially ""Fuck what you want, it's MY birthday, and what I want to do on MY birthday is go out to dinner with you and my parents."" I didn't say it in those words... I said it in MUCH nicer ones, regardless of how hard that was for me.

&#x200B;

I clarified with my fiancee - She did not get a reservation at a restaurant or anything like this. She had no specific plans in mind, other than that she wanted to ""spend time together, just the two of us"". I did not somehow shit all over plans she already made or something like that. We also aren't exchanging gifts this year, since we're saving for our wedding... literally NOTHING was planned by my fiancee.

&#x200B;

Am I missing something here? I get that my birthday doesn't give me the right to be a complete dick to people, but I don't think that's what's happening. Last I checked, regardless of my relationship status, I don't need to check with ANYONE when deciding what I want to do for my own damn birthday.

&#x200B;

I also asked my fiance ""So what exactly was you plan, even if I consulted you, and the result was the same? That I still wanted to do this sushi dinner with my parents?"" I argue that talking to her really wouldn't have made anything any different, because this is what I've known I've wanted to do for a while.

&#x200B;

To be honest, now I'm pretty mad that she's making me feel like my birthday is about HER and what SHE wants to do. I'm not going to let it ruin the night, but honestly, it kind of struck me in a bad way.

So a little bit of back story: I have worked for a food processing company for just over a year and a half. I moved up pretty quickly from my initial role and run my own department. I was due to talk about in increase in my salary June 1. 

We have two main offices, an upstairs and a downstairs one. While separate, everyone works together closely and everyone socializes with one another. These offices are on top of each other and in by no means far away from each other. The people that work in these offices are admin roles, sales, accounting etc and pretty much everyone is equal. The owner and GM have their desks in the downstairs office rather than having their own office (space issues). I have my own office away from these two main offices but work with the other managers. 

Anyway, it’s been becoming increasingly apparent over the last several weeks that the owner or gm has been buying lunch for the downstairs office and themselves once or twice a week on the company dime. No other managers just get invited and it’s only been them. While I really don’t care about getting a free lunch, the exclusion bothers me. Everyone is more or less equal in their positions so what makes them different besides me or the upstairs office managers? As I said before, I was due to discuss a performance review and the owner nor gm have yet to approach me to discuss. This is another story to be told but I haven’t said anything this week about the review because we’ve had discussions where they’ve asked me not to remind them (had to before) and that they would remember. 

I walked into the downstairs office on Wednesday and the office was in the boardroom eating McDonald’s. I was filing a report in the office and was seen but was not offered or invited. This pissed me off because it made me think I’m valued less and that they hadn’t bothered to remember my view BUT I decided to let it be. Then today...I was in the boardroom waiting for a meeting my gm scheduled at 1130, he then walked in with a bunch of KFC and the owner followed in with bags of McDonald’s. The gm had forgot about the scheduled meeting HE scheduled... and then proceeding to offer food to me but only because I had been sitting there. 

The owner also texted me 10 minutes beforehand asking me if I wanted a cheeseburger. I figured he heard this from someone who worked downstairs (owners nephew) that overheard me bitching on Wednesday. Today was just the icing on the cake for me. I declined the food and walked back to my office. I’ll admit, I was pretty fucking insulted and was mad enough that I just left for the day. If I had more of a backbone, I might’ve just quit. 

But as I sit on my couch and write this, I feel pretty asshole-y and maybe I’m overreacting. Would anyone else be bothered by this?

bxzw0a	2019-06-07 21:10:04	Desert229	AITA for asking my girlfriend to not smoke laced weed?	"My girlfriend (24) and I (28) have been together for about a year now, we are very much soulmates and we're deeply in love with each other. 

To the problem: she likes smoking weed about twice a week to just relax and shut off her head and it was hard for me to accept because I had some bad experiences with friends getting too addicted to it and letting their lives go to shit (doing harder drugs later on an losing jobs and stuff). So it has been subject of discussions before but we agreed on her just letting me know whenever she smokes weed so that in case is getting too much/out of hand, I have a chance to tell her that it's too much for me. 

Now people might think I'm a controlling person but weed is literally the only thing where I wanna be able to veto. We live a very open and free relationship and we let each other do whatever we want. We have a deep trust and even share our sexuality on a regular basis and are happy with it. 

 Right now: Currently we're on vacation in Poland and a friend (let's call him C.) of a friend (let's call her O.) offered her to smoke weed. He was nice enough to tell her that it is laced with something but he doesn't know with what. Now both of them have smoked it before and felt fine afterwards. So my girlfriend came to me to tell me that she's gonna smoke this laced weed now. That's when I asked her not to, because I'm worried about her well being. She didn't accept my reasoning and said that if I'd forbid her to smoke she's gonna hate me for the rest of the night and wouldn't talk to me. 

I tried to explain her that I'm just worried about her health (she gets sick easily and had chronic stomach issues and other things). But she completely blocked me out and just said ""I guess I'm a horrible person for caring more about my freedom than your opinion"" and left. 

AITA?

EDIT: To make it more clear: This is just about the situation about the *laced* weed. No-one knows what it's laced with."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Today a man called from a company that claimed it would solve ""all of my mother's tax problems"". Well she did have a problem with her taxes, but I took her to a local CPA and the problems were resolved. I have the letters acknowledging it from the state and federal government.

So I told him that I wasn't interested and hung up. He immediately called back and tried giving me the pitch of how much debt was owed and how much trouble my mother was in, and how they were a free company.

I asked him to send something via mail that I could consider and he said ""how can I know what you need done if you don't tell me?"" At that point I told him that we did not need his services and hung up.

Well, he called back a THIRD time and got really aggressive and sarcastic with me. He was not taking no for an answer and trying to talk circles around me. I could see how my mother could be easily frightened into agreeing to use their services. Finally I told him that our problems were being taken care of and goodbye and he retorted back ""yeah, sure you did"".

I googled the company and found that it was not a free service like he claimed, that they acted as ""vultures"" towards already frightened people and that basically it's all a scam.

I'm just so annoyed that someone like that is out there and worried that he'd call back and my mother would answer. 

So my question is- would I be the asshole if I blew a whistle into the phone if he called again?

I wouldn't do it to other telemarketers, just him."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Well I am related to medical field and yesterday at a party I met one of my cousin who is around 20-21 years and I think I met her last 3 months ago.  I noticed she has gotten a lot plump so I asked her had she planned to get so much weight or was it not planned?  And then I immediately said,  if it is not planned,  get yourself checked for PCOD to a gynaecologist as you may not remain fertile.  You should lose weight.  I am used to being straightforward.  She immediately made the saddest face and said - 'Dude you are so insensitive. Why are you also saying about my weight?  I thought you would be sensitive person!'  And then she didn't talk for whole party.  Look I said all that because PCOD has a complication of infertility and one of the treatment options is to weight reduction....  So I just said it.
EDIT - ok.  This is having a little bit of misunderstanding.  I DID NOT say this. In front of everyone else.  I asked her to come sideways in a little privacy and then told her this.  I thought it would be obvious since you don't discuss this in open party.  But I guess I needed to clarify it.

"A couple days ago, I was hanging out with some friends and we were just talking about Pride Month because it's June. We were talking about sexualities and who was what. One of my closer friends, (We'll call her Macy) told me that this girl who is also a ""friend"" of mine, (we'll call her Fox) pretended to be bisexual. 

I was confused and a little upset so I asked Macy how she pretended. Macy said:

""Fox said she was bi, so I made her a bi flag. When I gave it to her she said, 'What is this?' and I proceeded to tell her it was a bi flag.""

Nothing wrong there, right? I thought that as well, until Macy said, ""Fox told me she was actually straight and pretended to be bi.""

Now I was REALLY upset, but there's more. Fox even DATED TWO GIRLS. 

 The whole week, I didn't really want to talk to her and I just needed some time away from her. She seemed to notice that I wasn't talking to her lately, so yesterday, she decided to text me.

""Hey are you okay? You seem upset with me.""

I decided I should just be honest and get it over with so there won't be any drama.

Well, that didn't go as planned. She told some of her friends, including mine, and now there's this big drama now. 

Fox was telling my friends that she actually ""was"" bi but just didn't like girls like *that*. All my friends except ONE took Fox's side and defended her. 

(NOTE: This was offensive to me because I'm actually bisexual and there are so many girls who say that they're ""bi"" but don't actually like girls. It just makes people believe that people who are bisexual, aren't bisexual. )

bxzrri	2019-06-07 20:59:40	throwaway928374797	AITA for asking my partner to miss one night of (potential) work for a special performance I’m a part of?	"Hey all, LTL, FTP, on mobile, etc. Throwaway account because parter knows my main. 

My partner (24) and I (22F) have been friends since high school, but only recently reconnected and started dating. It’s been absolutely wonderful, and I love them with all the love I ever loved. Truly, they’re the best thing that’s happened to me and I never want them to be out of my life. They’re also an extremely talented concert (and otherwise) photographer, and very recently got a contract with a media company that would help them more easily gain access to shows and venues. Of course, I’m incredibly proud of them and excited, too! It’s a wonderful opportunity! That does mean that they have to be away several Fridays/Saturdays a month, but my job lines up with that so it hasn’t been an issue at all. 

However, we recently ran into a small complication. For a bit of background, I’ve been a singer since I was a child. I’ve been in countless choirs and choruses, plays and productions, special groups and weird amalgamations of musical people. Through the years, I found a music camp in my home state that was an amazing experience, and I continued to attend throughout high school. After graduation, I was able to become a junior counselor. However, now that it’s been another four years since then, my time as staff might be coming to an end. You can only be hand picked to become a member of the senior staff, and only about 1/3 of the eligible junior staff are chosen. That being said, this camp only runs for one week a year. At the end of that week, we all go to that years chosen high school and put on a huge concert, it’s all a lot of fun and the entire experience means a lot me as the people I met have gotten me through a it over the years. But with the question of being chosen for senior staff, there’s a chance that his will be the last concert I’m ever able to partake in, making it even more important to me. 

Keeping all of that in mind, while I know how important being able to attend shows is for my partner, I feel like it isn’t too much to ask that they try and keep the date of the concert open instead of automatically accepting any show assignment, as it happens to be a Friday. My partner kind of pushed it off and said that we’ll go to lots of things together in the future, and stood by that when I mentioned how much it meant to me. I dropped it, because I don’t want to seem manipulative or guilt-trippy or anything like that, but I really feel like it isn’t too much to ask for something that means so much to me. 

I’m so conflicted here. So Reddit, AITA?

I cannot stand to hear people’s problems anymore. I know that just because you broke your leg doesn’t mean someone’s paper cut doesn’t hurt but still. WIBTA if I tell them to stop coming to me with their problems and go talk to a professional? I can’t take it anymore it’s causing me to resent them. I care about them, but at the time I don’t care about their internal struggles as I am focusing on myself. I’ve told them that in the past but they aren’t really getting it. I get visibly annoyed when someone says “ okay I just need to vent a little” because half the time it’s about getting cut off on the highway or someone buying the last danish at the bakery!

&#x200B;

Current SO has grilled me on ppl that like/comment on my social media posts/comments, so much so that I'm wary about posting status updates. They have asked me flat out to block friends who I have not been sexual with as well as prior FWBs; these went from allowing me to talk to the person before blocking, to requesting I just ghost them without warning. 2 nights ago I was asked to ghost 2 ppl without a word. I obliged, but I feel like it is emboldening my SO to demand more and more control over me. 

&#x200B;

A few days after we started dating, they requested I go through my phone and delete any pics or videos of ex's and prior FWBs. This request wasn't a big deal to me as I rarely (haven't since we started dating) go through my 3K+ camera roll to look at that stuff. I did some cursory clean up but it's tedious work looking through all of it. Today I was asked if I had finished the clean up and I said no. This started a semi tense back and forth. They eventually said delete them or we're gonna break up. I explained that I didn't care about the photos (they've been deleted at this point), but I cared about having someone else's will imposed on me.

bxzp5f	2019-06-07 20:52:55		AITA for cutting a friend/co-worker off?	"I left out quite a lot since theres a limit.  

Almost a year ago I started an apprenticeship at an insurance company and in our country it’s  mandatory to go to school twice a week. I’m quite good in what I do and my boss always praises  my work in front of everyone.  Basically me and this other girl (Sarah) start at the same time and we both go to school together and also are in the same class. We get along  well since we realise we have a similar personality (at least I thought so). So to me we are friends and not only colleagues.

She does shitty things and I find myself dumbfounded. Example: we’re talking and she just cuts me off and talks with another co-worker. Or I’m cracking jokes with my boss and she sits there and looks annoyed and doesn’t wanna really talk to me afterwards. In school she talks in her native language (many classmates are the same nationality as her) and I sit beside her so I find it rude to be in a conversation with two people and talk a language that the third party (me) doesn’t understand out of nowhere? I also help her with all the schoolwork and whenever she asks me question I answer and she then acts like she already knew the answer.

We get a task to call clients and to set an appointment with them. We‘ve done that a lot and I‘ve always completed the task but Sarah never once even started it. She found excuses and just lied that they didn’t want an appointment.This time she also has to tell the boss how far her and me got with the task. I have to keep her up to date and she sends boss an email about it. I tell her that I didn’t call anyone yet since I was occupied with another task I got. She says ok and goes on with her day as do I. Later in the day boss sends me the email she has send him with basically telling him I didn’t give an update on the task. And I‘m like????? So I ask her via text and she ignores me for a whole day and later when I try to reach out again she goes „I can‘t always keep running after you for updates“ (she never did).  I’m ready to throw some hands atp, since I did tell her but she lied to our boss trying to make me look bad. When I ask her whats her damn problem she goes „You heard our boss criticise me today“. I‘m like fuck this, if she‘s doing this out of spite just because our boss did that whatever I‘m not gonna be the bigger person so I leave it there right? She goes on to ask me where our plushie mascot is (I had it last but told her I brought it back to work which I did) so I tell her it should be at the office. She tells me okey and later my boss asks me where the mascot is since it‘s still with me as Sarah told him. Im MAD MAD and next day we have school and she just acts like nothings wrong and tries to have a conversation with me (not school or work related) so I ignore her.  When it‘s about work or school I answer normally but I cut off all friendship talk.  AITA?"		1	0

"A little over six months ago I cut off a lot of people who I was “friends” with in high school. I did so for a few reasons but the most being that none of them ever talked to me or invited me places with them, basically ignoring me outside of school. When we graduated I eventually got so sick of seeing them together without ever inviting me that I cut them off so I wouldn’t make myself jealous or stay invested in people who “obviously” didn’t care about me. Looking back there were better and healthier ways to handle this, like y’know actually talking to them about how I felt. I know that part was me being an asshole. But now, the guilt has caught up to me and I want to apologize and explain why I just stopped talking to one of the girls who I was close to. We never really hung out but we did talk very frequently. She is probably the only person I would consider to have been an actual friend in that entire group. I want to apologize but I also think that coming back into her life randomly after six months and giving a long winded apology is kind of a dick move. I don’t know if she wants to talk to me anymore, and I don’t want to force her to talk to me. I also don’t want it to seem like I am pushing the blame on her friends and victimizing myself. I just want to apologize because I was an asshole, but would reaching out after all this time of ignoring her make me the asshole again?

EDIT: some more info for you guys. By cutting them off, I left the (dead) groupchat I was in, I unfollowed them all on social media and I ignored all text messages my friend sent (she was the only one who actually contacted me at all after)."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"A couple months ago, I submitted an application to be an artist for my town’s chalk art festival. I had the option to sign up a “registered assistant”, so I signed up my close friend that I’ll call Sue. Eventually, I got an email back that my application had been accepted! Leading up to the festival, I was super excited and spending a ton of mental energy to plan little details of the piece. This would be my first time creating something publicly, so I desperately wanted it to turn out great. Sue was also excited, but didn’t contribute to planning/buying extra supplies. She also told me that she could only make it to one day of the two-day event. 

I thought it would go without saying that I would lead the project and basically direct my friend on what to do. But when the festival started, I realized that Sue expected this to be an equal collaboration. She kept throwing out suggestions on things we could change, and I kept rejecting her suggestions as politely as I could. She started getting frustrated with me for being so controlling, and by the end of the 12 hour day we were both feeling pretty sour.

Unexpectedly, we finished the piece on the first day, and ultimately Sue did almost 50% of the physical work (staying out in the sun all day, on our knees, rubbing our hands on the pavement to blend colors until our fingers were cracking). Considering how much she contributed, I can’t help but feel like I was being a selfish butt for not giving her more of a say in the piece. She also said that I sucked the fun out of it. I do take my art seriously because it’s one of my few sources of pride, but now I’m wondering if I let my pride get the best of me."	No A-holes here	0	0

I currently live with my mom and pay 150$ rent and buy my own groceries. My bf lives with his mom because he got kicked out of my mom's house.

I'm currently on mat leave but it will end in August, I will then return to school full time and try to graduate this year. (This means I'm taking on 4 extra classes)

My boyfriend is very hands off with the baby because he has the mentality that ""he works all day so I should be the one taking care of the baby""

He is expecting me to return to work after my mat leave is done, however I don't think I will be able to do full time school, part time work AND full time parent. I know some superhumans are capable but I know I will end up slacking on school work and will need an extra year.

I am expecting some Student Loan money but I dont know how much extra I will have after tuition. So I dont know if I will be able to continue to pay rent and groceries. I'm sure my mom will understand if I cant pay, (she is team unemployment) but she thinks my bf should also support me financially during this year. He will argue against it since he doesnt live with me.

So WIBTA if I didnt return to work and basically mooch off my boyfriend and mom for the year? I feel like I am, but at the same time really want to move forward with my life and be able to get a job where I can afford to move out!

bxzkvj	2019-06-07 20:42:20	voordeel	WIBTA If I rejected my boyfriend’s sister live with us?	"I’ll state some basic information before everybody read this.

My boyfriend has a 40ish y/o big sister, for some reason she hasn’t gotten a single job over 15 years. She won’t listen to her sister or brother ( which is my boyfriend ), not even her mum. My boyfriend’s family tried everything they could have done to help her. Still, she’s not going to get a job & living her life with her mother’s deposit. 
I’m going to list some of her behaviour that me and my boyfriend can’t stand:
* She has a serious attitude to everyone in the same house. She doesn’t care about anyone and how hers behaviour affects others. 
* She doesn’t care about hygiene. She’s not going to do the basic housework, like ditching the trash & washing the dishes. Seriously there’re cockroaches everywhere!!!!! 

Alright here’s the thing, my boyfriend and I have discussed about our future ( something like where shall we move or are we having cats in lieu of having babies. ) However we realise that if my boyfriends mother died, we may have to take up the responsibility of giving her rent, food, utilities ... something like that. 
I do think two of us will have difficulties with these extra expenses.

From my perspective, I really want to have a wonderful life with him. If there’s any extra expenses, I would love to I spend on my study & career, or spend on my mum, instead of a complete fully functional human.

I said that I don't think I should pay for the cost of repair because I didn't cause the problem. My roommate/friend told me that ""we share expenses in this household"" which makes sense for groceries, water, electricity, and whatnot, but not for single person issues. AITA?

We've had our arguments but always come out the other side. When we were teenagers we were never apart. We were always out drinking, partying, shopping etc. Over the past 7 years we have drifted as I'm not in to that lifestyle anymore yet she is and she has done mannnnny questionable things such as having an affair and has always used me as her cover story without me knowing until a day or so after. Around a year ago, she rings me absolutely petrified, saying she thinks she is pregnant. I reassured her that whatever her decision, she would be absolutely fine and that I'll help her in any way that I can. A week later she calls and says that the news has settled in and she's keeping the baby. I congratulate her. We didn't see each other much during her pregnancy but kept in touch often. I helped to organise her baby shower with her other best friend and spent a fair amount of money on the shower and present. The whole time I was there I was made to feel really awkward and as if I'd been invited just because we had been friends for so long, not because we are actually friends. I kept asking to see her scan pictures as she'd been for a 3D scan and she kept brushing it off but then I saw her showing other people. I made my excuses and left after about 2 hours. I messaged her a few days later and no reply. I continued to attempt contact every few days for the next 9 weeks until I went on Facebook one day and saw that her baby boy had been born 3 weeks early, 3 weeks prior to her posting her news on Facebook. This absolutely knocked the wind out of me because I was finding out on Facebook that my best friend had given birth 3 weeks earlier and I had no clue about it. I still to this day have not had a response from her and I have not liked/commented etc on any of her posts since therefore by default, I have not acknowledged the baby. I am absolutely heartbroken that she didn't feel our years of friendship meant anything to her a mere 30 something weeks after she rang me crying because she'd found out she was pregnant.

bxzjae	2019-06-07 20:38:19		AITA for telling my sister to stop being a c**t?	Me (freshman) and my sister (sophomore) recently got into a fight because I called her a cunt. I tend to be conservative and lenient with how I use insults, and I know myself she deserved it. She has been forcing me out of conversations with some of my friends, bullied my friends for no reason (telling them to stfu, yelling, basically being indecent) and overall being inconsiderate (screaming, yelling, swearing out the ass, being rude to all her friends, etc.) she has constantly bullied me about my past and who I hang out with, my grades (which aren’t even bad b+, A, etc) and has told me I’m too blind by myself to care about other people, but I try to stay considerate of other people despite what she says. Me and my parents have been dealing with this for roughly ~5 months. So when I heard her bullying some chick online “tell her she’s ugly, fat”, I told her straight up “can you stop being a cunt?” I rarely use cunt as an insult, but this time I deemed it necessary. “Rude” would not have worked. She got very upset, but I didn’t really mind. But later that day at dinner, she was eye-Rolling, being stuck up, and just acting superior to the whole family. I told her to stop being so inconsiderate, and that’s when she screamed to my whole family how “he called me a cunt! He called me a cunt!” Ever since then I’ve been on bad terms with my family and it has basically ruined me, with her staying the same way and me getting outcasted and thrown under the bus yet again. I had a long talk with her about how she needs to stop being bossy and rude, she said how “I’m the same” called me an asshole, and locked me out of her room. So reddit, AITA? I was just trying to help her be a better person, and I know there was probably a better way to call her out, but I knew this was probably the most efficient way.		1	0

Myself and a few other friends have a group chat. Today, a friend sent an image of an anime girl, then said ""Oops, wrong image.""

I saw this and sent a screenshot of me finding both images by reverse image searching on Google Images.

After that, everyone started to laugh until he came on and saw my screenshots. He then blocked and unfriended us all and cussed me out in DMs, then reblocked me.

bxzi2p	2019-06-07 20:35:18		AITA For being “selfish”	"I’ll try to keep this short, so please ask for clarification if needed.

I attend University full-time as a student and I am back home for the summer. During this time I’ve applied to 50+ jobs with no call back, and I’m starting to run low on cash. I am registered to take a class as a guest student at my local community college during the second half of summer, but because of my lack of employment I am a couple hundred dollars short of tuition. I planned on asking to borrow money from my dad to supplement the cost. There’s only one problem: My mother also planned on asking my dad for a couple hundred dollars for a casino trip with her friend. I was upset with her because she just asked for $200 last week for the same thing. She doesn’t have a gambling addiction by any means, it just so happens that two separate friends invited her to go to the casino on different weeks.

This conflict caused an argument where she said that I was being “selfish “. Not only for wanting to borrow money from my father, but for not wanting to share the few snacks I bought for myself. 

(I bought Cheez-itz, fruity pebbles, and pizza rolls only for them to be eaten entirely by my parents, but that’s a separate AITA post) 

She said that it was “her husband “ and she’d get all the money she wanted and tell him not to give me a dime if I kept being “selfish”. She also said “if you wanted money, you’d get a job” like she hasn’t been unemployed for the last decade. However, that’s where our problems overlap.

When putting myself in her shoes, she’s in the same situation as me: Unemployed and in need of money. So I need an unbiased opinion;

Also English is not my first language so sorry for some spelling mistakes.

&#x200B;

For the whole year I've been doing simple chores like hanging out the laundry, laying the table and tidying up my brother's room and I've never once complained about it.

&#x200B;

Now I some context for the post.

I've finished school earlier than my brother because my school makes you start an internship right a month before the school ends.

Now my agency is really far away and I need to do 1 and an half hour to go there and to came home.

I work for 8 hours and when I came home it's really late (around 8 pm) and I'm pretty tired since I get up early to take the train.

So it's been 2 weeks since I started internship and my parents never asked me anything apart from setting the table for dinner.

However yesterday I couldn't go to the agency because all the trains were cancelled.

So I though I could took this opportunity to relax and going out with my friends since I couldn't see them because of work.

Well as soon as my parents knew I had the day off they asked me to do a list of chores that include: Washing the floor of the kitchen, typing up my brother room, do the dishwasher (we have 2 of them), setting the table for lunch and hanging out the laundry.

At this point I (18F btw) told them I could setting the table for lunch but I asked them if my brother (16) could do the rest of the chores.

Now I know they don't sound all this hard to do but I just wanted to relax and I though that since my brother has NEVER and I mean NEVER do any house work, he could start learning.

They then started get angry at me because he needs to study and he is tired when he got home from school.

This made me livid. I told them that I did all that when I came home from school and they never once though that I could be tired too, they then said that I am the older sister and he is still too little.

HE IS 16 YEARS OLD. I think he is well enough above the age to do some chores, like at least clean up your room, I don't think he needs someone to do it for him. Needless to say that in the end I did all the chores because ''He needed to study''.

Also going to add the fact that my parents privilege him because he is pretty good at school (always straight A) while I'm more on the average (C) and they value that a lot."	Not the A-hole	1	0

bxzdbx	2019-06-07 20:23:38	Jin105	WIBTA for not inviting my mom to my graduation ceremony because of my boyfriend (gay)?	"Hello r/AmItheAsshole

This is my first  post on reddit (1Karma)! Obviously I don't know much about posting here so I'm trying to do my best.

Here it goes:

I'm (M/19) what you would probably call a Highschool student (just before when you would go to university) and almost done with my final exams (only 2 oral exams left), which means that the graduation ceremony is right around the corner. We get to invite people like family and friends to come and have dinner at our school and also to watch us get our certificate. I did ask my mom in advance whether she would like to come. Today I mentioned to her that I have also invited my boyfriend, with whom I've been in a relationship for a year now (weekend after the ceremony is our 1st anniversary). Obviously she wasn't happy about it and told me that she wouldn't want any of the family members there being  exposed to the ""gays""

&#x200B;

A little about my family:

We're from China and I came to Switzerland at the age of 3. They have a very traditional mindset. When I told my mom I had a boyfriend there was a lot of drama. The usual stuff: ""That's wrong!"" ""What's wrong with you? Let's go to the doctor"" etc. It was a really horrible experience but I didn't let it get to me and continued dating him. We never talked about it again. I also have a brother (16) and a sister (9) who don't really have anything against it (or they are just silent about it, because we don't really do much together). However I love them both a lot (feels more like I'm a cool uncle). My parents never really cared about the things I do in school. From a young age I've learned that it is very important to get good marks and I guess this has been burned into my mindset. They were rather annoyed when they had to attend a teacher-parent appointment. I never tell them much about the stuff that happens in school (teacher, marks etc.). They know that I wouldn't do ""dumb"" things so they never ask.

&#x200B;

So after I told her that my boyfriend would also be there she told me that she wouldn't want anyone of the family there if he's going to be there too. I'm now planning on just inviting my boyfriend to the ceremony. I just had the image that I should be inviting my family to this important ceremony. Unlike my parents my boyfriend has shown more interest in my school work and supported me in that department more. However we've only been together for 1 year and I got my family forever.

&#x200B;

Edit: I did invite both of them (mom and boyfriend). The only one who has a problem with it is my mom and she told me: ""I don't want our family to be there if he's going to be there."" making the choice without my brother and sisters opinion.

He keeps trying to talk-yelling at me but I interrupt him and say sorry but let’s both just go back to eating our food. This angers the man and he gets up, walking to our table and starts talk yelling at me about how I don’t know who he is and I should be more respectful Yada yada, I talk-yell back at him that I don’t know who he is and he doesn’t know who I am so he should just sit down and go back to eating his food.

I've been working and essentially supervising an assistant, and she's been fantastic. My issue is with my boss. I wish to move full-time into this new role and  have expressed that several times. I've put in extra hours and a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. The extra stress has literally put me on anti-depressants. I am not being compensated for this extra work. 

On top of that, I am now essentially supervising this other employee. She has been told to come directly to me for projects and help, and I have been put in charge of training her. I recently was even asked to fill out a performance review for the assistant. I gave her a glowing review, and discussed it with our boss.

He promoted her, over me. She's now a one-person department, and he gave her a lot of my duties. 

I honestly feel so angry and disrespected. I have been at this job over a year and haven't been promoted, and he took the training plan I drew up and intends to go through it with her himself.

My new-ish neighbor (they moved in about a year ago) has an old taurus sedan, which for the longest time they drove on the regular.  There was always another car, always different and a late model expensive make like a lexus, or lincoln.  Anyways, one day they parked the car on the street, and it hasn't moved in over six months.   They have a driveway they could keep it, but they are using up public street parking.

I don't really know my neighbors enough to be comfortable talking to them about it.  So I called the nuisance line on it and it is going to get a 10 day move or be moved warning.

 We have 3 fairly social guys living in the same house, so parking can be an issue at night.  Should I have confronted the neighbor first?

"I (26F) have been asked by my sister, Joryn (39F), if I and my unborn daughter would like to go on a birthday cruise line trip to help celebrate our mom’s (59F) 60th birthday in June 2020 next year. She has offered to pay flight, boarding, and I’m assuming most meals, for my then infant daughter and I. I am currently 5 months pregnant with my boyfriend, Daniel, (30M) and I’s first child. Our daughter is due in November, and will be 7-8 months by the time June 2020 rolls around.

Joryn has also invited Daniel, however she asks that he pays his own way by reimbursing her. I discuss with him, and he declines, as he will not know if he can be free during the month of June 2020 between job/master’s degree. I am on board with his decision.

Now, growing up with my family was nothing short of great dysfunction. My father was physically and emotionally abusive towards me. Shoving, screaming at me an inch away from my face, barging in the bathroom while I’m undressing for a shower to beat me, calling me an evil bitch. This happened from age 4-19. My mother as a witness, either turned a blind eye, or made a lot of excuses for my father. 

On this trip, it would be my infant daughter and I, our parents, my little sister (22M), and Joryn’s family (Her husband 37M, sons: 1M, 5M, 8M, 10M 13M, 15M, and 22M, and also infant foster girl). Joryn and her husband have their fair share of dysfunctional issues, they’re like a circus. They can be very rude to waitstaff and take advantage of customer service. I’m pretty sure me agreeing to go on this trip will result in me being guilted into babysitting some of her boys. 

To imagine being on a cruise ship for a week with my chaos-addicted family, honestly seems like an absolute nightmare of a situation. I am already battling pregnancy depression and anxiety, and have no idea what stresses postpartum and caring for baby will bring. Also, Joryn and I have a rocky relationship. When I was 14, she accused me of trying to seduce her husband. I also feel her resentment of me having a girl of my own (She always wanted a girl, but has 7 boys). Excepting this cruise trip gift from Joryn really feels like a bad idea, because any gift from her can be used against me, especially something as massive as this. 

However, I only will ever have one mother, and she’s been wanting this dream trip for a long time. What sucks is that I can’t even explain why until it’s too late, as it’s a year from now. I live with her and it feels quite deceiving that I can’t discuss this with my mom at all, without ruining this last minute idea of a surprise trip that Joryn threw on me. I think my mom would be extremely hurt as to why I wouldn’t take the offer of a free trip. Please give me some perspective, because I completely dread the idea of going with every fiber of my body."

I just moved a long distance across the United States and had to leave my most prized possession behind: my baby grand piano. I moved in with my boyfriend, have a great job, and love my life here. There's only one issue.

My partner's friend lives with us. 

For full disclosure, this friend and I have had many arguments over how to keep the house, who should be doing chores, who should be cooking and when, pretty much anything you can think about in terms of roommates arguing. 

Anyway:

I bought a very expensive 88 key keyboard after moving away so I could keep playing and mixing (I use the keyboard to mix with electronic music as well). I spend an hour or two at the piano every day, and keep it at the same height, in the same set up, with all the functions set the way I like. I keep my sheet music neat and orderly because it is one of the things I care most about, as well as the iPad I use for composition and lessons. 

My roommate uses the keyboard without asking ALL THE TIME. He adjusts the height, settings, and volume. He eats and drinks next to and AT it. He uses my music and has torn at least four pieces of beginner sheet music, and some of the music is even missing. He uses my iPad, leaves it with no charge, and leaves my stool at different heights. I mean, in my opinion, complete disrespect for the keyboard. 

And hen he just DROPPED THE KEYBOARD ON THE FLOOR trying to adjust height again. I have asked him SO MANY TIMES to stop using it without asking and to please only adjust the settings and height if I am around to help him.

I get he's excited to be learning music and all, and I'd be more than willing to teach him how to use the thing, but he just WILL NOT respect it. 

So I kinda flipped a switch when I watched my iPad and keyboard and all associated equipment fall on the floor. I stood up, walked over, and told him to ""get the fuck out of here."" He apologized, but I was fed up. I've told him so many times as respectfully as possible to please treat the piano carefully and he has not once made any effort to change the condition in which he leaves it. I yelled for probably a good 10 minutes about how disrespectful he is and how angry I am. 

I moved all the stuff from the common living space to my bedroom and re-set it up the way I like it. 

He told my partner, and my partner agrees he shouldn't be allowed to use it, but he and his girlfriend are throwing a fit about the whole thing. He said he is going to stop paying rent and move out, and I said I'd gladly show him the door. It got heated and we both said unacceptable things, but he nearly broke about $1500 worth of equipment which is special and important to me.

bxz1tm	2019-06-07 19:55:41		AITA for taking my hat off my gf head ?	"Repost because the original was deleted. 

Throwaway because my friends use reddit. So My friends and I took a trip to six flags today and my gf had a head scarf on her head to keep her hair down so it wouldn’t fly all over the place. When we got on one of the rides , it had blown off and she couldn’t keep her hair down with anything else. So instead she takes my hat off my head and uses it to keep her hair down. 

Now since I’ve had my hat on all day my hair was a mess as I had hat hair. So I ask her for my hat back while offering to buy her a hat from the gift shop so she can keep her hair down. Also I had just bought the hat that she Took from me and I was afraid she’d let it fly away on a ride. She refused to give me my hat back and refused to come with me to the gift shop so I could at least a purchase one for me. So at this point I’m pissed because she was making a scene when I was trying to take my hat back after offering to buy her a new one. 

So I ended up going to the gift shop by myself ,as she stayed with my friends , purchasing a hat and when I got back to the group , I asked her for my hat back one more time to give her the one I had just bought because I’d rather her lose that one then the one I actually have. She also used some products in her hair so I didn’t want that to get into the hat either. This is when she starts making and scene as I make an attempt to grab the hat. She starts hitting me and moving away from me. So at this point I’ve had enough and I take the hat off her head and give her the one I bought and she storms off with a couple of the girls we were with to the bathroom. It’s been two hours since then and we haven’t spoken to each other and I’ve made attempts to talk to her but she just ignores me.

bxyzcr	2019-06-07 19:49:26	BigPizzaisgood	AITA Siblings Making too much noise at 3am argument	"Hello everyone, last night, my siblings and I got into an argument. My brother has the habit of slamming doors extremely loudly, it's so loud it shakes  the house, he likes to work on his car a couple of hours after he gets home from work.  He gets home from work around 7-8pm at night and he starts to work on his car from 1:00am to 3:00 am in the morning. During this time,  he comes in and out of the house,  and he slams the garage door that is connected to the house very loudly, it doesn't allow me to sleep. After he finishes working on his car, he takes a shower around 3am in the morning. My sister is also a night owl and showers late around the time too. The issue is my sister takes long showers in the bathroom, and makes alot of noise. And the shower head slams into my wall, my room is extremely very close to the bathroom and the walls connect. I have asked my sister in the past if she could shower earlier, because my sister has no reason to shower at 3am in the morning. She sits at home all day and is on her computer. (she is 29 years old).  She hasn't had a job in years and my mom spoils her alot. I feel she has all day and evening to shower.  My brother has a bit of anger issues, which I believe why he slams doors and if I try to talk to him he gets defensive, and condescending. Last night,  I couldn't sleep because my brother was slamming doors, and afterward, I tried to fall asleep and my sister took a shower. I got pretty annoyed, and when I walked out of my room. I saw my brother, sitting on a chair, playing youtube very Loudly, that the whole house can hear. Waiting for my sister to get out the shower,  I felt they are being inconsiderate, because my mom and I are trying to sleep.  I also needed to pee, but I didn't want to wake up my mom, and use her bathroom. I expressed my concerns to my brother, when he saw I seemed upset. And he said ""there only one bathroom for us to share jesus christ!"" and when my sister got out the bathroom, I asked her, if she could shower at a different time, and she could very agitated with me and started to yell at me. I started to yell back and was pissed off. She said I'm a dictator. because I can't tell her when to shower. I felt, that's true, however, she makes way too much noise and wakes me up and her showers are usually over an hour long. I feel she should try to compromise with me. I also beliee my brother might have a personality disorder, because he always seems angry.  Am  I a jerk, for asking them to shower at a different time?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bxyxh9	2019-06-07 19:44:53	Kchris0710	WIBTA if I mowed my lawn at 7am?	"Resolution: thank you everyone for your comments. I was raised on a farm (my allergies evolved when I was a teenager to much worse than what they were growing up) and I was taught to do everything I can do myself for myself. I have never paid anyone for something I could do so I seriously NEVER thought of paying someone to do it. I am asking a few of the neighborhood kids if they would be interested. I need to have it done by tomorrow morning so, if no one is interested on such short notice, I will be waiting until about 8:30. Like everyone mentioned, 7:00 is early for a Saturday morning and that's what I came here for.

Context: I am allergic to the sun so being out during the day has a real affect on me. I break out into itchy hives that then turn into patches eczema. My neighbor kind of got after me about the state of my lawn, which I totally get, it looks bad. It isn't overgrown but is definitely the homely lawn on the street. 

Because of my sun allergy, as well as many other allergies to pollen, grasses, the general outside, my eyes tend to swell up and my eczema gets really bad so my fiance usually handles the outside chores.. he hasn't been able to get outside because, for the past week and a half, he gas been working from 6am-8:30/9pm and is very tired by the time he gets off of work. His boss told him to expect these hours (with only Sundays off) until he goes on vacation on the 26th of this month (we are getting married on the 29th and then taking a mini vacay after). 

ANYWAYS, I really do want our lawn to look nice,l but being in the sun, on top of all of my other allergies *and especially so close to the wedding* i don't want to mow our yard in the afternoon or mid morning when it is too hot to wear long sleeves.

Now his friends suggested him to go hang out at the beach tomorrow and he agreed and I’m angry. When I suggest doing something it’s bad but it’s all good when friends suggest. I confronted him about it and he said that I would want to swim and then he would just sit like a loser in his shirt at the beach waiting for me. I told him that wouldn’t happen because I wouldn’t want to go swim alone but if I really really wanted, that would be just a quick run in the sea but he still doesn’t want to go to the beach with me.

This isn’t the first time he’s doing something with his friends that I suggested doing but he disagreed with my idea.

I've tried calmly bringing it up in the past, saying ""Aren't you a bit young to be drinking so much?"" And ""This can't be good in the long run.""

But all she gives me is the ""My body, My choice."" Response and anything after that she gets irritated and I back off.

I respect it's her choice, but as a friend I'm scared of this getting worse and i wanna be more upfront and tell her that this choice of hers is dangerous and with alcohol there's no guarantee that it won't get worse. I wanna know before i do if this will make me TA."	No A-holes here	0	0

The custody is 50/50, a couple of days a week and every other weekend.  It was a bit overwhelming for me to go from living alone to having a family.  I am very much an introvert and I found myself needing a little time away from everyone while working through the adjustment.  I chose to work one day a week (aside from my full-time job) to do something alone and productive away from the family.  My boyfriend said he was ok with this when I was applying for jobs but now that I'm working he asks me when I think I will be home (hours are based on the amount of work and are not fixed) and he gets upset if I don't estimate the time correctly and will text me repeatedly asking when and when if I'm later than what I guess.

bxytpm	2019-06-07 19:35:40		AITA for taking my friend's seat in a car	"Some context to this situation. We (myself, another guy, and a group of girls) were talking at the school festival  when we were headed to the parking lot to get into a car and head to McDonalds. I did not realize that:

a) they were planning to go to McDonalds
b) there was not going to be enough seats in the car

In the end, somebody was going to be left behind, and I decided to take the initiative to get in the car. The other guy really wanted to go to McDonalds with them and we all felt bad; however, they simply preferred to have me there opposed to the other person. One of my friends decided to get a McFlurry for the guy but once we came back it had already been half an hour and it had melted already. During that timeframe, our main friend group already left to Wendys so my friend was just left wandering around the school festival alone.

Now, I know what you may be thinking, I’m an asshole for taking this guy’s seat, but allow me explain myself for a second. I am not going to try to shift blame or accuse of anyone else, but when I decided to enter the car nobody else objected. I am just wondering if I should truly be feeling guilty for being the one responsible for denying my friend some fun. I am unsure if this is a huge factor in whether or not I'm the asshole but my friend already knew that they were going to McDonalds and was infact suppose to be in the car with them. In addition, only one girl knew the guy, and one other girl hated him. While one girl liked me (non-affectionately), and the rest did not mind me. Logic tells me that it was ok for me to take the seat, but a couple of my friends and some decent people are telling me otherwise. What should I have done in this scenario?

TL;DR There was a car full of girls and there was only one seat left, and instead of relinquishing my seat to a friend, I decided to take the seat for myself."	Asshole	1	0

"I've been close with said friend since elementary school and she just graduated from university. Her younger sister planned a surprise party where they go out for dinner and stay in a hotel booked and paid for by their mom.

Younger sister made the plans in a Facebook group which I wasn't initially a part of and said she needed a couple more people for the reservation. My best friend added me in the group and said that her and I will fill the last spots. This was after the plans were made and everyone had agreed on what was happening, which made me feel a little weird to begin with. 

Days later, younger sister posts that she over booked and there isnt enough room for me (just me) in the reservations because I didn't respond to the messages. Which is totally fair. I guess I just assumed that my best friend saying I was going would've been enough but I should've just said it myself.

To me, hearing there wasn't enough room for me just meant that I wasn't going, but my best friend kept saying it's fine if I go and they'll make room etc. But I didn't take it seriously because it's not her party and not her hotel room she's paying for. The last time we had a conversation about it was around a week ago.

Anyways, tonight is the night of the reservation and my best friend texted me to ask if I can pick some things up for the party. I wasn't even considering at this point that I was going to the party since there is no room and I don't want to feel unwelcomed so I made plans with some other friends. I told best friend that I feel uncomfortable going if I'm not on the list, I know it's my fault but I don't want to go if there's not enough room. 

She said she thinks it'll be fine and I should just come. Apparently she texted our friends mom just now and asked if I can come and friends mom said it's all good. But I can't shake the feeling that I'm unwelcome and intruding on these plans at the command of my best friend who doesn't see an issue with anything.

I don't know if I'm over thinking it but now I just really don't want to go. I recently went through a break up and I've been really depressed and reclusive and my best friend knows that. I think she's trying to help by making me come out but the thought of going to this thing tonight is almost sending me into a panick attack.

For a little background, I was 14 at the time and am a big fan of Funko Pop! figures. This took place several months after my birthday. My family has been always well off so money was not the issue.

For my birthday that year, I asked for only 3 funko pops and nothing else. They are about 9.99 US dollars for anyone wondering. My birthday comes and goes, and I receive lots of love and nice presents from my parents. The several months go by, and the funko pops had not come in the mail, which my mom said she ordered and were coming. We both do a little investigating and find that her credit card got rejected and the purchase did not go through. It took me by surprise when my mom brushed it off basically said forget it. I questioned her about this she said something along the lines of ""You don't need them."" At that point I got upset (not screaming or crying, but noticeable.) 

This was not about the gift itself or receiving to product, I was was upset about how my mom ""took back"" gifts she tried to order and how she disregarded my feelings.

The first time we dated she put me through the ringer and consistently said a bunch of fucked up shit and even cheated on me. She was in a really bad place, and recently contacted me claiming she’s better and wants to prove it to me, so I reluctantly agreed with boundaries and rules set so that she knew what I was okay with. 

I recently asked her if she wanted to go to a sporting event, and she happily agreed. I found us some really nice tickets, and asked her if she wanted to split the price (since they were pricey and I’m gonna be driving us ~ an hour to the event, paying for food/drinks/etc). She immediately got an attitude, said she no longer wanted to go, and didn’t talk to me for hours. When I finally got her to talk, she revealed that she had been talking w/ her boss about it instead of communicating with me, and that it was because I asked to split the tickets, and that her previous ex had asked her to do the same, but she ended up footing the whole thing. I told her I wasn’t her ex, that comparing us was unfair to me, and that I was mad because she didn’t communicate with me about her issue (which was a problem we encountered the first time we dated). 

She believed I was mad because she wouldn’t split, which I was upset about but not my main reason for being mad (which again is lack of communication) and called me broke.

"Preface: I am the second oldest (22F), and most of my life growing up, me and my older brother (23M) we're pretty close. Sure, we had our arguments here and there, but beside that, we always had each other's backs. Now, this all began a bit when I was college, and more after I met my now ex-boyfriend.

For a while, we attended the same college before things went down the crapper. However, it all started a few days after New Years Eve in 2016, I was in my dorm relaxing after having watched some T.V. in the lounge room, when I got a call from my mom via Messenger that my brother had ran away from a place him and a friend were sharing at the time. I had freaked, but she assured me that she had called the police, that he would be found, and I just need to continue with my studies. When we did attend college together for a bit, things were... Normal. Even after I left college (dropped out), our mom put us and my little siblings into group chats on Messenger (like when she had to get surgery), so I kept in contact regularly.

That, was when things really plunged down... One night after getting off a closing shift from my first job, I had called my mom and talked to her about things. That was when she dropped the ball and said that my brother had to be air lifted to the hospital because he had tried to swallow a bunch of pills while at work, and one of the pharmacists called 911. Apparently, he was getting back at his ex after she had broken up with him for being overly centered on himself (I never asked for the full story, was too worried about whether he would survive.). I also found out my mom and him weren't on speaking terms after she blocked him on Facebook for calling her selfish, after my little sister explained things.

I haven't blocked him on Facebook, but I'm really scared about what he'd say to me if I did message him after all these years. So, Redditors, AITA in this situation? Even if it's been forever, would I still be the asshole?"	No A-holes here	0	0

He offered to take our yard for 25 bucks. We don't have the greatest living situation, but we had money to spare at the time, so I thought nothing of it.

I told him that times are tough right now and I may not be able to give him anything in the future. He said he understood. 

A couple more visits where he knocked on our door and we did not answer, either because we were getting ready to leave or other indispositions. I did answer once and said I didn't have any money to spare, and I had (truthfully) spent all my spare cash on car repairs. He says ""Oh don't worry you don't need to give me an excuse."" Today he knocks on our door and he says he really needs some cash, just a couple dollars. Aside from my daughter's piggybank, all of our money has to go to rent, and I have no cash besides. I tell him I can't spare anything, and give him no excuse. He begs, but I tell him I truthfully cannot. He says ""Man, fuck you."" And storms off.

I know she's broke since she's always complaining about it, yet she doesn't want to work. He's also extremely frugal and doesn't spend more than what they need to survive.

One day, I was really excited to go out and spend time with her. Yet again, she cancels and says she's broke and feels guilty about me paying for her, as she always does. I don't mind paying but I finally flipped out this time. I'm so sick of her playing the victim, as if she's incapacitated to work. I told her to get a fucking job. I went on to say that how lazy I thought she had become and how sad I thought her life was, being dependent on her boyfriend who can barely take care of himself. She's not a mother or a home maker, she doesn't even clean after herself. She blames ADHD for her behavior.

My wife and I are both in their early twenties so she is in an entry level position at her job and I am a student as mentioned above. I don't understand how they think this is okay  or maybe I am in the wrong here. Please help. Would I be the asshole if I told her aunt to drop her kids off with some food for them to eat over the days they are here?		1	0
bxynju	2019-06-07 19:21:01	thrrrroowwwwww	AITA I continued texting another man when I was getting to know another	"So I met a man on tinder. First impressions suggested successful, educated professional. We hooked up on the first date after work. Our second date was on a Friday evening which ended on a Saturday night. He appeared to be enamoured with me. While I was half asleep he stroked my head and before I left he asked me to be his girl. I said lets see how it goes. 

The third date he gave me his house keys. And on the fourth he started telling me my family were bad for me and that I should abandon them. I was seeing red flags but I ignored them.

I saw him the next Friday evening after I'd had a few drinks with colleagues. And while I was in the bathroom he went into my phone and read a text message exchange that I was having with another man and he saw a dick pic that was sent to me but I never asked for. He became super aggressive towards me. And then spent hours arguing with me. At 5am I woke to him trying to use my hand to unlock my phone and when I woke next at 9 my phone was disabled for an hour. This was literally in the space of a week and a half.

bxymvf	2019-06-07 19:19:20	stoner-bug	AITA for refusing to sing at a bombing memorial?	"So I went to a memorial of victims of a bombing in my country, with a choir. We were stopping there on our way to a concert. No one was aware we would be singing at the memorial. 

When we arrived, the environment was somber and reverent. My director had us sing without permission, and we sang fairly fast paced songs, against the advice of the directors husband as well as many choir members. 

When the choir began to sing, I chose to step away and pay my respects silently. I was extremely uncomfortable with singing in the reverent atmosphere, and it felt disrespectful to me. 

I grieve very much alone, so being alone and silent was the best way that I could see to honor the dead there. I spent the duration of the set silently thinking about the tragedy, honoring the dead, and sending up my prayers and respects for them and the families they left behind. 

I didn’t think it was a big deal, but my directors husband came to me afterward and asked me why I had declined to and argued with me saying that not singing was disrespectful since we have paid respects to and mourned the dead for years through song. So, in light of that, AITA for choosing not to sing?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxymov	2019-06-07 19:18:54	throwawaybcanonymity	AITA for it watching football with my GF	"So, in concise detail:

My GF likes football a lot and there was an England game (or national team) that she wanted me to watch with her. We'd video call then watch on our devices. I however am not a huge fan of football, I've never liked and only started picking it up very recently because she likes it so much so I'm not that passionate about it.

Anyway, my GF asked me to watch the football with her. However, I had recently done an expedition for gold DofE (basically a lot of walking up and down hills, rubbish food, cramped tents, tiring for 3 days) and was completely exhausted both physically and emotionally. I said explained that I wouldn't watch the game because I needed to catch up on sleep as I have school the next day so needed to rest.

Anyway, as a result of this it started a huge argent about how I don't care about interests and never do what we want to do and am generally not a great BF.

So AITA for not watching football with my GF.

P.S: England lost 3-1 which may have contributed but even still."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxylx6	2019-06-07 19:16:54	Neverintothat	AITA for not allowing my wife to babysit the neighborhood kids for free during the summer.	"We recently bought a old house in a new area of town that is considered economically depressed in a brand new state.  The house is nearly 100 years old and gorgeous even before we fixed it up. We spent a year fixing it up, adding a pool and an awesome backyard with a stilt play house and stuff to do for her son. 

My wife and her son are extra extroverts so they made quick work of making nice with the neighbors. I was all aboard for the introduction grill where she invited our immediate neighbors over for a get together and I admittedly had a great time. I am an introvert though and I like alone time and space. 

My wife and I both work full time but she is taking some PTO during the summer since her son is off school. He will have some time at a day summer camp every couple of weeks for music and science. During the weeks she’s home, she works part time from home and has been spending the rest of the time getting to know our new neighborhood and babysitting for free. 

My wife loves kids. She always wanted more but can’t have more. 

Before we met and after her divorce, she struggled financially and she said she likes helping out because she knows what summer care can cost. She got a promotion about a year after we met and now with that and both our incomes we do really well. 

It allows her son to have friends and kids to interact with most days when he is not at camp. She will take them to the library and local events. She lets them play in the pool with him and her. They play in the backyard and I have even come home to find her feeding them an early dinner because one of the parents got caught up at work. 

The neighborhood loves her. Mostly because she is giving her time and energy and our money out for free. 

I know a lot of people in our neighborhood struggle but I think it is too much. 


Eventually it will end in August when he goes back to school but I am not sure I can survive this all summer. We do get breaks on weeks his summer camps are in and she goes to the office. 

I asked her to limit it to the two weekends a month or something more reasonable but she doesn’t want to.

In our old neighborhood, we rarely talked to anyone and had no close friends. 

I put my foot down and told her to stop it. 

I reminded her my new job paid for this nice house and may say should matter a little more and now I feel like a jerk. 

I know I am an asshole for bringing up the money thing. I have only recently begun making more. 

But I really don’t think I am an asshole for wanting the peace and not wanting strange kids in the house. The liability is high. I don’t like kids that much. We are opening our house to people we barely know. 

Would I be the asshole for apologizing for the money comment but refusing to for all the kids?"	Asshole	0	0

bxylnz	2019-06-07 19:16:17	IlistentoMCRtoomuch	AITA for leaving my sick mother?	" 

Unfortunately, my father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, so about 5 months ago I packed up a bag to help my mom take care of him. We were hoping to get him put into a home but unfortunately he rapidly deteriorated and suddenly passed away last month. I was hoping I'd be able to move back to my apartment, but my mother wasn't dealing with the grief very well and she became sick so I was willing to stay to take care of her.

I stay, and she ends up not wanting me to move out because she doesn't want to be alone, and she's very sick (A twisted spine from scoliosis, and osteoporosis, so she can barely walk). Then she ended up getting even more sick. It affects her eyelids so she has limited vision. I'm fine with that under the condition that my fiance is also able to move in with us. She agrees.

All the way back in January, I had plans this month to go see two youtubers, and go to Disneyland. My mom wanted me to give up these trips because she didn't want to be alone. I offered for my aunt (her daughter, who lives in town) to watch her, but she 'doesn't like her.' I even offered to pay for a care taker for a few days but she doesn't want a stranger in the house. I told her I'd even pay for her to go stay with my biological father (her son) in Texas, but she refused that. Then I finally offered to bring her along on the trip, but she complained that she would be stuck in a hotel room the entire time with nothing to do.

I initially agreed to cancel the trips. But these past months have been the hardest months of my life. I haven't been able to go out at all, see my friends or even my fiance because my mother is too scared to be alone and she gets lonely, and I spend every second of my free time with her but she still complains I don't spend enough time with her. I need a break.

Yesterday I told her I'm going to go on both of my trips. She is now guilt tripping me. She's adding to that guilt by saying well I have no choice but to go into a home now because if I'm alone for 5 days I'll die. She cries and says she never ever wanted to go into a home. I told her I still want to be able to move in with her and to take care of her, but I need a break. I want to be able to have some independence and enjoy these trips I've had planned for months. She still refuses all of my accommodations (which are still being offered as options).\]

Last night was the show with my two favorite youtubers. I offered her accommodations and she refused them again. She told me she's sick and she needs me and she could get hurt while I was gone. She also said she's scared to be all alone and she was going to get very lonely. I went anwyway. The show is two hours away and I was originally going to spend the night and come back the next morning, but instead after the show I came back at 12 AM. She was fine. She's making me feel bad about it this morning (she was scared, lonely etc..).

We were each other's first relationship so it's been hard and we've been staying in somewhat contact since we broke up since we both still have feelings for each other. Fast forward to a few weeks ago and my coworker invited me to her wedding. I had a plan in my mind that if I took my ex then maybe that would start the ball rolling to us getting back together eventually. She straight up said no and I was debating on going or not and discussing it with my friend who kinda invited herself. Now my ex hates my friend they're just opposite and don't like each other as my friend said bogus stuff about my ex when we were broken up.

My sister and I used to be very close, but for the past few years we’ve been like oil and water. She’s one of the most generous people I know, but can also be overbearing, intrusive, and emotional. She doesn’t respect my boundaries, pushes for us to hang out more than I’d like, and has a history of overplanning holidays and celebrations. I can also be pretty controlling when it comes to what I want to do, and have been known to be a little “my way or the highway.” 

She reached out about having a “low-pressure, no big deal, just the three of us [me, her, and our mom] pre-wedding hang – whatever you want.” To be honest, what I want is to do nothing at all, but fine, hopefully doing this will quell their frequent complaints about not being invited to the ceremony.

When I made my boundaries about start/end times clear (9 pm with sleepover to 7 pm the next day), she got upset that it wasn’t enough time.

bxyjcr	2019-06-07 19:10:45	ResearchAnalist	AITA for having a confrontation with two 15-year-olds to defend girlfriend's honor?	"Hello, curious what Reddit's take is on this incident that happened a few months ago - I live in NYC (I'm from here too), and I'd been dating a girl who's from upstate, but living in the city now as well (relevant to the story, I think) - I'll call her Gina. We were on the train between the York and Jay street Metrotech stops when a couple of kids, maybe 14 or 15, began bothering riders for money for their ""basketball team."" Tired old hustle and I've seen it a million times. When they asked me, I shook my head, or said no, and turned back to face Gina. The kids were sitting, and I was straphanging over them but to their left. They began muttering some taunts I don't remember exactly, and then began doing the same to Gina. When I heard them begin talking about her, I lost it and told them to shut the fuck up. I don't remember everything that was spoken, and while it was testy, there were only a few words exchanged before I put my hand on Gina's back and suggested we move down the car (to avoid further confrontation with these kids). It was at this moment the doors began to open to the Jay street stop. Instead of walking down the car, Gina, in her panic, left the train entirely, even though we had several more stops to go. Of course, I followed her out, and had only just stepped out of the car when I noticed the two kids were right behind me, trying to get in my face. I turned to face them, but aware in the moment that I was 26 and much bigger than either of these children, and also in a very public place, I invited them to come with me to find a policeman so we could settle our dispute. They suggested instead that I follow *them* to their cousins, so that they all might jump me. After doing that back and forth for a little bit, they realized I wasn't going to follow them, and they weren't going to hit me by themselves, so they scattered and ran away. By that time, Gina was nowhere to be found, so I got on the next train and exited at my home-station stop.

&#x200B;

When I finally linked up with Gina outside the subway station, I was furious at her for ditching me out of flustered embarrassment and behaving as though I was the asshole, and not just a guy trying to do right by her by not allowing two ghetto punk kids to mouth off within earshot. Her view of the debacle was that I had behaved like an emotionally immature child for engaging with them. That incident ended the relationship for a time, but we've since reconciled. However, thinking back on it, I'm not so sure I was wrong. What does reddit think? Am I the asshole?

I know this may sound like he doesn't like me as it sounds like hes avoiding me and all but whenever i do hang out with him during or after college me and him have a great time, we laugh and enjoy our day then we go our seperate ways.

He has met up with me and a few of my buds before on the weekends but it's a rare occurance to see him but when he does come we have a blast.

Although this sounds great it's also exhausting trying to get him to come out, on the one hand we have a great time together but i feel like i set up these meets only to be dissapointed.

I'll miss him for sure but i've just told him today that i don't want to talk to him after he cancelled plans again so i laid out my frustration on him saying things like 'your a waste of my time and energy' and 'you don't value our friendship' i know it's harsh to say it but i've just had enough, i've snapped and i don't want to continue talking to someone who's just going to let me down all the time especially now when were done with college and have free time so no last minute excuses.

bxyh88	2019-06-07 19:05:39		WIBTA for sleeping with my brother’s ex?	So my brother had a gf probably about 5 years ago. They dated for 6 months until they broke up and decided to be friends. My brother took it hard since he gets really attached, but then he said his whole perspective changed and he let all his feelings go, and since he has stated they are much better as friends and lost his attachment to her. He realized he shouldn’t have caught feelings for her and that she was not the relationship type. He knows one of his biggest flaws is catching feelings. Out of all the gfs he’s had, I know for a fact she is the least he’s attached to in that way. He’s moved on, he has a gf I know he’s in love with right now. They’re still really good friends, and if I had to say who his closest “girl friend” (as in friend thats a girl) it’d be her. She has gotten around a bit since their break up, sleeping with at least 3 of our friends over the 5 year course. He has never seemed to mind, and still treats her as the same neutral friend regardless of her current sexual activity. This is where I come in because a brother changes things I think. I know this girl has had it out for me for a really long time. I get the vibes, the looks, the touches, and I actually consider her a good friend too since me and my brother share a lot of friends, and our friends mix together when they’re all together. Well, last night there was a party thing and we talked to each other for awhile and I had to resist going in for a kiss. She kept touching my arms and chest and holding eye contact, and I can’t lie I was turned on. Something about her has always hit me in weird places. She’s certainly different in my kind of way, and she’s really naturally pretty and has a very nice body. Pretty much I walked away to pee and the intensity of the situation fizzled out and I decided not to make a move and to think about this more. I’m someone who is guided by morals and logic. Thinking about my past relationships, it would hurt if my brother ever did anything with them. It would feel like a delegitimization of that entire time of my life, because as people we like to hold our memories dearly. With that said, I know she is different. I would never go for any of his other exes, nor have I even thought about it. This girl is just around all the time, and she is persistent, which is my biggest weakness. I have pushed her away before, but she doesn’t give up. I know if I see her again then it’ll be back to a 1 on 1 conversation where I’m stifling a boner. This is the only girl I’ve contemplated treason with (breaking the bro code) and it’s testing me. And if someone thinks I should go for it, would it be best to ask him, to tell him afterwards, or just hope the info never gets leaked to him? The last one wouldn’t sit well with my conscious. I’m really close with him and I know I could talk about anything. But our relationship is good because we don’t do shit like this to each other. I’m in a dilemma. Please give me insight.		1	0

Now we are great friends and hang out with each other everyday and he is a great guy. But, there are times he has these major major mood swings. Now, I know people have bad days and stuff. Also, I am not the only one who faces these things. A lot of my friends have also noticed this. Coming back to my part, there will be days he will be the sweetest person you ever know while other days he would just pick on small things. Like my nail paint or like why my hair is wet after I took a shower or like this one time a friend of mine really liked my outfit and wanted to borrow it, she was complimenting me and stuff and he just goes ‘dude it’s not even that great’ then like 2 days later he is like ‘you look really good today I love your outfit.’ 

This really caused me to get pissed at him and stuff. But, what really set me off is that after of all this he would apologise to everyone (sometimes to me) and would say that free__soul never gets offended or pissed at me, so how should I know that anyone else felt bad. 
And he is just like ‘you love me the most you can’t not talk to me and I was just joking.’

"So long story short, I live with my parents and they are currently in the process of fixing up our house and then moving. Due to this, they're getting rid of a lot of furniture, etc. My BF's family is not doing well financially, so we've given them multiple pieces of furniture and other things free of charge. 

Now to the chair. The chair is a piece of furniture that we've only had for two years and it is still in brand new condition. It's one of those big sofa chairs and my parents decided to get rid of it bc it won't fit their theme in the new house. I (20F) want the chair for my first apartment but will not be moving into that until the Spring 2020 semester so I asked my BF if I could put it in his room until I could officially take it. He agreed, and I jokingly told him I wouldn't want any of the animals on it if it was in his room. His family has 5 inside dogs and 2 inside cats. 1 of the cats is ours and stays in his room. His dog is an extremely old Chihuahua that has started using the bathroom around the house (due to old age), does the thing were she drags her butt across the floor/furniture, and is just a gross old dog in general.
 
Today, we brought the chair to his house and his dog immediately tried to get in it. I told her (the dog) no and my BF got pissed and said ""well she's going to be in it while you're not here anyways"" and I tried discussing it with him about how I already told him I didn't want animals on it and I wanted it to stay nice looking. He then asked if I would be okay with our cat being on it. I said no (she'd shred it), and said no animals on it in general. 

He is currently pissed saying it's his room so while the chair is here, it's his rules. I get that, but my BF has never been like this about anything and is refusing to budge. I then tried to compromise and told him to at least not let any animals on it until I got some throw blankets to cover it with. He didn't go for that either.

Im half out the door because why would we stay for someone's funeral!? I straight up tell my parents, im uncomfortable I don't want to be here. But lo and behold they decide to stay. 
So here I am sitting in the back of a church with a fucking CASKET in the middle of the aisle, and this guy's entire family. Im so uncomfortable and mad I'm near fucking tears. So we sit there, go through the mass, listen to this guy's family cry about him. I stayed in the pew during communion, to my mom's dissapointment.

He practically raised me and made me who I am today. She’s recently moved on in her last year and a half from his death almost 4 years ago. I have made an effort to become friends with the new man and for the most part things are okay.
 I’ve also tried to figure out what I wanted to do with my life and what career I’ve wanted to pursue for about a year now. I dropped from a computer science major and took a break from school after the first year because it wasn’t what I wanted to do. Recently I have developed a plan to join the military and go for my schooling with the missile program as my main goal. My mother and I’s relationship fell off over the last year because she distances herself from my sister and I. I have made it clear many times how I have felt about the distancing, although this was to no avail.
 Today I finally told her my full plan for moving out and how I’d try to go about my military career if all goes well. I told her that I’d like my distance from her now, as well as I’d like her to not visit me, see my graduation when the time comes and that I’d like to keep our “visits for holidays” to a minimum. She’s completely forgotten about her children, yet tells me she misses her kids.

bxya3u	2019-06-07 18:49:10		AITA for not wanting to babysit for a couple who lost their other child almost a year ago?	"I feel a little bad so I just want to see what you guys think.

So there is an event next Wednesday that my boyfriend bought a ticket to. He was planning on going with his coworker, but my boyfriend just signed up for a new class which is on the day of the event, so he was thinking of just giving his ticket to the coworker so that he can bring his wife instead. However, they have a 1 year old and have troubles finding a babysitter (we think). My boyfriend asked me if he could recommend me to babysit so the wife could go.

Now, I don't babysit anymore. Haven't for over a year. Ever since I got a full time job, it's just too exhausting to leave work and then go babysit. Kids are exhausting. Even babies. There's a reason why I don't have any right now, I just think they're too tiring. So I stopped babysitting. I told my boyfriend pretty much exactly this (full time job now = don't babysit). I also had plans that Wednesday to bake my boyfriend's birthday cake - since he'll be in class so I'll have time to surprise him with it right before his birthday that weekend.

Well, after I told him no, I felt bad. So this couple lost their oldest son (I think he was 3) almost a year ago. My boyfriend said that since it's coming up on the anniversary, he worries about the couple and just wants to be able to get them out of the house as much as they can. Total guilt trip. I feel bad but I just really hate babysitting and I'd feel weird taking money from them (He's kind of a boss of sorts to my boyfriend, we're both adults, I don't know).

I feel like an asshole, but I also feel like it's my choice. But I guess I also don't know who I'm being an asshole to because this isn't an idea the coworker came up with so it's not like I'm letting him down, he knows nothing about this conversation my boyfriend and I had. If the coworker had asked me, I probably wouldn't have been able to say no. But since it was just my boyfriend checking in with me, I said no."	No A-holes here	1	0

bxy7mu	2019-06-07 18:43:19		WIBTA if I asked to pay less or no rent because my shower was broken and there was a dead rat in my wall for three weeks?	"Long story short, I had a water leak from shower. The handyman of the building checked and said something was leaking in the wall, and that I couldn't used the head of the shower, only the bath. He said the plumber would come by two days later. He did not. A week after I was told the plumber might pass Thursday or Friday. He passed by Friday mid afternoon, sightly opened the wall to check what's wrong. When he did, the landlord was in the bathroom too and he stepped back because of how bad it started to smell. They started to whisper. I overheard the plumber telling the landlord that it might be a rodent. Then the landlord told me they couldn't open the wall because they wouldn't have time to close it because it's Friday evening. He said the plumber would come again on Monday. Landlord called again and said on Tuesday. 
When they left, I cleaned my entire apartment because of how bad it smelled. I had to sleep with my windows opened because I couldn't breath without coughing otherwise. On Sunday, I had worms in my apartment. I texted landlord to tell him something was probably dead in the wall and that he had to pass on Monday because it's not acceptable. He told me he would send a guy to open the wall, and that he will be here by 8:30am. The guy opened the wall, and there was a rodent too decomposed to be clearly identified.  The landlord ended up coming by 11:30. 
The rodent was gone but the smell still here. They ended up closing the wall the day after.

Since the shower was broken for three weeks, and the landlord knew from the plumber that ""it might be a rodent"" (and also the smell) that something was dead in the wall and didn't treat it as an emergency, I want to pay less rent. Would I be the asshole?

bxy6xz	2019-06-07 18:41:39	BrokeAndOverIT	AITA for getting mad at my kid for asking for help	"My daughter is 15 and ALWAYS waits until the last minute to do a project. This time it was a cooking project. They had to video tape themselves making a recipe and then bring the food in for everyone to taste. 



It’s the day before and she insists she wants no help. I offered repeatedly to help her. My elderly mother who is very very pushy about “helping” in the kitchen lives with us so my daughter said she wanted to wait until she goes to bed at 9 to insure she gets no help. 



9:30 rolls around and she starts her recipe. 2 hours later she’s in my room crying her eyes out because the recipe failed and she can’t take it in to class. Mind you, I’m asleep because I have to wake up for work at 6am.



I tell her no I’m not getting out of bed to help her. She can turn in the video for a partial grade or remake it herself but I already offered my help hours ago. 




She angrily tells me *this* is why she never asks for help because when she does, I’m mean about it. 



Then she proceeds to wake up my mom(it’s almost midnight at this point) who of course wakes up and helps her. Then the next morning strolls around and my mom is bitchy towards me because I wouldn’t help my daughter so she had to do it.



Which in turn, makes me even more mad because 1) my daughter was inconsiderate for waking up her grandmother at midnight 2) she didn’t learn a lesson about managing her time well 3) everyone’s pissed at me now 



So then I talk to my daughter and tell her to cancel her sleepover this weekend because she needs to clean her room to make up for this cooking project fiasco. She says I’m punishing her for needing help and that’s unfair. I tell her no, I was going to let this be a natural consequence—she waited until the last minute to ask for help so the natural consequence would be a partial grade or her staying up all night to finish it. But because she selfishly woke her grandma up, there needs to be some kind of consequence. Refusing help and waiting until the last minute isn’t ok and I don’t want this habit to continue(this isn’t the first time she’s waited until the last minute and needed us to bail her out). 




I told her today before she left for school her room has to be completely clean(including under the bed and her closet—because she has a habit of stuffing everything there when I ask her to clean it) by Saturday night. If she needs help, she is more than welcome to ask me as long as she doesn’t wait until the last minute again. If it doesn’t get done, I’m canceling next week’s plans too(we have plans to go to Busch gardens and Water Country next weekend) because she WILL LEARN how to manage her time if it kills me. 



Now my mom and daughter thinking I’m an asshole but I do believe this is a hill I’m willing to die on.

There's a whole gang of people here that leave their dishes up. Sometimes for days. So I give them a one shift rule. If its still there the next shift, I take the dishes and shove them into the dish cupboard and forget about them.

There's approximately 200-300 dishes in there now. Its all because of me building up over the past 7-8 years.

People also put their dirty dishes on the dish rack. Or they like ""rinse them"" to where they are clean enough for THEM but still very clearly filthy (oil spots). I do not give these obviously dirty dishes a one shift rule and immediately chuck them in the dish closet. I used to automatically throw them away.

The person flashed their lights at me like they wanted me to move out of the way and I just ignored them.

Now before you go calling me an asshole, one thing you should know is when she gets mad at anything, she’ll scream into my face. Now I hate people coming too close to me and that crosses the line. What she does causes me to have panic attacks and she makes everyone take her side even when she’s in the wrong. 

She also berates everyone because apparently the fact that she has more money than us makes it so she’s the bitch in Charge. She had a tantrum in public because me and another person can’t afford her fancy tastes and screamed at us and told her we ruined everything for her when we couldn’t afford to go on a trip with a €500 deposit at a €650 holiday that she’d waste away getting drunk off her head. 

Speaking of this holiday, when I was still in the group to go, she told me that she didn’t give a shit about how I felt and that I had to drink with her and had to go out despite my discomfort in large noisy crowds of people I don’t know and won’t know if I can trust. 

She also cried about how I apparently ruined her life because I needed to go home and get something while we were at the beach. 

This person also talks crap about everyone and calls everyone retards and spastics and actually throws tantrums if she’s told off for being a twat in class. When confronted she cries and runs away to tell her mommy. Which then gets me in deep shit because nobody can say a word against her

Most importantly, he knows I am extremely apathetic, I don’t feel any emotion whatsoever. Examples include not feeling anything when family dies, even felt nothing when a guy got hit by a car close to me in the street. There are other bits too, but not best told for now. 

However, recently I told him I saw a therapist at school who was a little terrified of me. Long story short, she strongly believed I am either a sociopath or a psychopath. She told me the next session she would attempt to diagnose me, I never went to another session with her despite repeated emails. 

That was 4 years ago, I told him recently when he asked had I ever seen one. He was enraged to say the least, saying its unfair of me to have this potentially dangerous mindset and not get help for it. I’m selfish for putting others in danger and not helping myself by not going for therapy. 

They are good arguments, but, here’s where I disagree. I do not want any kind of diagnosis, ever. I go to an amazing university and have incredible career prospects, I don’t want that ruined by a diagnosis. Yes, it might be sealed on my medical record. But, even if it is leaked about me, it could ruin my career and life. I have gone years without a therapist, I don’t think about killing people or harming them. I admit, I only think about myself most of the time and find it hard to judge people’s emotion. No one in my family knows or other friends apart from him and hopefully never will.

This cousin has always been overbearing, despite being the drug addicted, alcoholic of the 17 cousins. He has been so far as to start a fight with 6 guys because he thought one of them made a pass at me (he got the wrong bunch of guys and my family was swiftly removed from the bar because of the actions of my cousin)

Last year we were at a house party and talking about my future wedding. He asked what my new surname would be as my fiance has gone from his deadbeat dads name to a hyphenated version of his stepdad and his mothers maiden name.
I explained that I intended to keep my name as it is (a factor that my fiance isn't overly happy with).
My cousins response was to blow up at me, shouting in front of friends and family that he would force me to take the new surname.
I went and cried in a bathroom, his (now ex) gf told me he was an idiot and called a taxi for me, my sister and her friend.

A few weeks back was my brothers wedding and the surname issue came up again. Cousin slung a drunken arm around my fiance and said he'd be there with his gun to make sure I did it and again later, told me he'd slit my throat if I didn't.
At this point, my mum overheard, told him he was way out of line and took my to the bathroom so I could have an anxiety attack.

I don't want to upset my family, as it would definitely upset my grandparents, his parents, siblings etc. But I cant stand the thought of having him there, knowing about his threats and having him spoil my wedding, like he nearly did for my brother due to drinking heavily before the ceremony and chugging from his hip flask during."		1	0
bxxwqj	2019-06-07 18:16:51	doras51	AITA for leaving a restaurant and going somewhere else to eat when my family didn't show up on time?	"Hi, 

This happened the other night and I'm really wondering if I overreacted or if I was justified. 

My brother was in town to visit (here several times a year). He, my parents and I were discussing the night before where to eat via text. We had agreed on a restaurant. Great. I then said I'd call them the next day when I got off work to iron out the details. 

So I did. They said ""Let's meet at 6 at (restaurant)"". Cool. I got my wife and my 10-month-old son loaded up in the car with milk, baby food, diaper bag, new outfit, and made the 10-minute drive across town to the restaurant and made it there at 6. Called my mom because I didn't see their car and I go ""where are you?"" 

She goes ""Oh, we haven't even left yet, I guess we got sidetracked with talking, ha ha!"". Best part is they live 10-15 minutes out of town and who knows how long it'll take them to get out the door and on their way. 

So I thought to myself ""Fuck this shit"" and told them ""Eh, you know what, we're not eating with you, see you some other time"". So the wife, kid, and I left the parking lot, went through a drive-thru at a fast food joint and went home. It really pissed me off and felt super disrespectful. I feel like if they can't even respect my time, especially when we agree upon a time less than an hour beforehand and knowing I have a baby with me that doesn't like to sit around much as-is, knowing that my wife packed up all of the baby bag and food and got him into appropriate clothes and into the car all for them to not even follow a simple timeline, then they can pretty much screw off. 

Was I an asshole or was this justified?

Edit: Ok more info. They aren't usually late. 

Last time, and a time or two before, my brother didn't bother to tell me he was in town for the week so I didn't see him. Whatever. 

I think I got especially pissed at this situation because my family couldn't figure out what to do the night before and was la dee daa-ing around via text. First they wanted to meet at their house. Then the restaurant. Then I said I wanted to meet at the restaurant because it's easier with a kid. Then I get ""Why?"" like they don't know we get off work at 5 and my kid goes to bed at 7:30. Then my dad sassed off and said something to the effect of ""It sounds like you don't want to really see us at all"". No, we just don't want to do Tour De Southern Illinois with a fucking infant.

bxxueg	2019-06-07 18:11:26		AITA for saying that you would think differently about money if you were the one earning it?	"My bf and I just moved together. He is still going to school cause he had some problems and therefore he didn't finish school properly and now he obviously wants to have more options for his career later.

In Germany we get social welfare for having children until a certain age or until they've finished their apprenticeship. His dad still gets 200 € for him and we agreed that I'll get 300 € until he starts working.

Now, it's the first month and I got 250 €. Obviously I said something against it and it started a stupid discussion about money in general and how I think his family is poor. My opinion is that if you're struggling at the end of the month with living expenses then you're poor. But he said it was just because his father didn't know how to deal with money that they sometimes had to struggle at the end of month and he is still paying debts for the divorce. Also he thought it was an insult to say they're poor which I couldn't completely agree with.

So at the end of the discussion he said he hates to talk about money so often and that he also had to discuss money with his father often enough and it shouldn't have such a huge impact on a romantic relationship. Therefore I said that if he's not the one earning it, it's obvious he doesn't care about it as much and he seemed to start crying and said I should stop talking because I've already hurt him enough.

I called Sunday morning and let the company know that my pump has failed and needs to be replaced. They told me that they couldn't come out Monday but would be out on Tuesday. I thought this was a fairly quick turn around and decided I would use water sparingly in the meantime. Monday morning comes and I receive a call that they can not come out Tuesday and instead would be out Thursday. I was admittedly upset but 100% kept cool and agreed to the new time. They also told me that they would need to pump the waste from my tank before replacing the actually pump inside. I expected this and agreed.

On Thursday I get call about 8AM they are on their way. They guy comes and pumps the waste. After he pulls out the pump and confirms its dead. I am with him when he calls the technician where he confirms the pump is dead and needs to be replaced. The tech says he can make it out early afternoon. Not idea for my work schedule, but they are flexible so I decided this is more important and call in to let them know I need to take PTO. The guy who pumped the waste then gives me my bill for waste removal of $665 which was expected.

The tech arrives about 3PM I walk with him to the backyard. He spends less then 30 minutes before he says ""Yes the pump is dead"". I tell him to replace it, but he responds oh I don't have any replacements with me I will have to come back tomorrow. He then hands me bill for him coming out with a minimum fee of $265.

Next day I get no call. I decide at 9AM to give them a call and ask when they are coming out. Remind them that I must go to work at 2PM as I don't want to use another day of PTO. I also voice my frustrations to the scheduler. I apologize and let her know I am not mad at her, but need to voice my frustrations. She understands states that ""She appreciates me being polite about it."" I truly tried my best not to take it out on her cause she did not having anything to do with the whole process.

Tech comes back out and replaces the pump hands me a 3rd bill for $900.

My issue is why would the second tech come out knowing the pump needs to be replaced without a replacement pump with him on the truck. He spent about 30 minutes, charged me the minimum, and did nothing but confirm what was already confirmed that the pump was dead. That second visit for $265 was totally unnecessary and I feel it was almost to the point of predatory in nature to get another chunk of money out of me.

Am I the asshole and completely over reacting? I'd like some opinions before leaving a negative review for the company. $265 is not a small chunk of change and I feel that 2nd bill was a total waste and unjustified. I told the company the pump was dead. The first tech made a call which I present to hear which he told the second guy the pump was dead and needed to be replaced.

But my friend always makes these bold claims about the weed she’s giving me.  She’ll say “this one is that *good* good.”  Or “this is the one with the purple hairs.”

I love the weed and it’s perfect for my needs, but it is not anything special.  Every single time it has just been schwag.  She’s not much of a smoker herself so I don’t think she knows the difference.  I don’t want to embarrass her or come across as ungrateful, but I was wondering if there is a way to tell her that her weed is just schwag.  I don’t want her to be overpaying thinking it’s something it’s not.

bxxs8j	2019-06-07 18:06:30	LunaLove2802	AITA for asking my professor to continue with the lecture?	"Last night I was in class which is about 3 hours long. In the middle of our lecture he went off on a tangent (he does frequently) about when he used to coach football and then about an experiment him and some friends once did. I do believe he was getting to a point that was relevant to something in the lecture but after 10 minutes of rambling, I raised my hand and asked if this all was relevant and if not if we could continue with the lecture. 

He was very surprised and said no one had ever asked that before (he is 70 years old and has been teaching a long time I presume) so I began wondering if I was out of line. My original thinking was that I was there to learn the material and he was in essence wasting my time and money by talking for so long about irrelevant things. 

He did immediately end the story time and finished the lecture without further tangents. So, was I the asshole here or was it reasonable of me to ask what I did?

Edit: Thank you all for your input and time. The results are pretty mixed so I don’t know if I really got an answer other than some would see this as rude and others wouldn’t. From my teacher’s reaction my guess is he is on the side of not rude but I will talk to him to be sure he didn’t feel slighted and explain to him my reasoning. This may actually help him understand my POV and keep things mostly on topic in the future. Thanks again, Reddit!"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I know this may sound like he doesn't like me as it sounds like hes avoiding me and all but whenever i do hang out with him during or after college me and him have a great time, we laugh and enjoy our day then we go our seperate ways.

He has met up with me and a few of my buds before on the weekends but it's a rare occurance to see him but when he does come we have a blast.

Although this sounds great it's also exhausting trying to get him to come out, on the one hand we have a great time together but i feel like i set up these meets only to be dissapointed.

I'll miss him for sure but i've just told him today that i don't want to talk to him after he cancelled plans again so i laid out my frustration on him saying things like 'your a waste of my time and energy' and 'you don't value our friendship' i know it's harsh to say it but i've just had enough, i've snapped and i don't want to continue talking to someone who's just going to let me down all the time.

Me and my best friends are both 20 years old and we have been best friends preety much all our lives. Last year when I was sleeping over at his home and we stayed up very late playing video games ( and this story is very important) he had an epilepsy attack  and right now he is using Depacine Chrono pills daily. The experience of being woken up by him shaking was the scariest experience of my life and I had a hard summer trying to cope and help him return to a normal life and we managed to get through it.

Now to the story at hand. 1 year has passed since that seizure he had and for 1 year we have been hanging out but I have refused to sleep over at his home or really stay up late with him because I am scared of reliving the same moment of seeing him have a seizure again. He is preety contempt with it and basically doesn't care whether it will happenagain or no, nor does he really take care of his health that much. 

Now this summer has come and me and my other friends are thinking of going to sea as a summer vacation after our final exams end but I am scared to invite him because we will go to a different country and he has not been out on the sun very long and we will be up late every night probably and I don't know how his brain will react.

But hear me out. I have a friend, who I would consider my best friend, that I have been close with for about 4 years.

 Recently, I started to realize that I do a lot more for her in our friendship than she does for me. She doesn't have a car right now, so I stop at the store for her or if she needs to go somewhere I'll take her. I let her borrow some money a few months back, and she never repaid me, but offered to pay me in babysitting. I'm ok with that.

 Yesterday, her kid had a field trip that was in a nearby city, maybe 25 miles away or something. I took her to the field trip, went to a store and walked around for an hour or so, and then picked her up from the field trip and took her home. All in all, it took about 4 hours.

I asked her a week ago if she would watch my 4 month old while I got my hair done today. This was a big deal for me. I haven't got my hair cut or anything professionally in at least 2 years. I was excited. 

So, I dropped the baby off and get to the place, and she sends me a picture of my daughter crying and says ""yeah I don't think the color part is a good idea today. She's freaking out."" It seems like anytime I ask her or she offers to babysit, one of my kids always does something that she can't handle, and she guilts me and rushes me to hurry up and come get them. 

I'm really angry now and I told her it was fine, but I am mad and that It is really shitty that she always does this to me, when I feel like I go out of my way for her anytime she needs me. And that Im done doing that. She's pissed at me now and idk if I'm wrong or right, to be honest."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxxo1u	2019-06-07 17:56:54	whateveriswhateveris	AITA for refusing my husband’s friend a place to stay in our house?	"One of my husband’s best friends (let’s call him Henry) has been having a pretty tough year. He’s gotten the short end of the straw in certain situations and has been struggling a lot with depression. He won’t seek therapy about it, and he’s become so overwhelmed with life that he decided the only way to heal is to start all over and move back to his hometown (which is really far away from here).

In an effort to keep Henry from going away, my husband offered him our guest room for a reasonable rental price, assuming I’d be ok with it. Henry was very enthusiastic to hear this and accepted his offer. However, once my husband told me what he did I wasn’t on board with the idea.

Before my husband and I were married I lived in a student house along with Henry and a handful of other folks, so I have a pretty good idea of what life with Henry would be like. After my husband and I got married I moved out of that place and together we bought our own house. 

Anyway, because I work fewer hours than my husband I’ll be alone with Henry more than I would care to. Henry doesn’t get out much so he would primarily be in our home except for when he’s at work (and his shifts are pretty short). He can be a bit annoying to be around as he’s always enquiring “whatcha doin’” like a puppy and wanting to be involved in everything. I worry that my husband and I wouldn’t have much privacy because of his somewhat invasive nature.

Henry is also a very sensitive guy and I would have to change a lot of my habits at home to accommodate him: one example being I’ll have to quit practicing my guitar on my amp or playing music in the living room because Henry is very easily bothered by noise. Henry also has a history with my best friend “Miranda”, and without getting into it she was really hurt by him and doesn’t want anything to do with him. Miranda comes over a lot, and I know she won’t anymore if Henry’s with us. 

I could go on, but simply put, the idea of having Henry around all the time seems too stressful for me. Sure, he’s my friend too, and I want to help him out and genuinely feel bad that he’s having a hard time but that doesn’t mean I would want to live with him again. I expressed this to my husband and now he and Henry are upset with me. Now Henry is for sure going to move away because I said I didn’t feel comfortable opening our house to him.

I work with a small team who has a big deadline today. I’m effectively an assistant for the department, so the deadline doesn’t effect me very much. Since everyone is stuck at their desk all da, it was discussed that the boss would order lunch online and a friend from another team would go pick it up. I expressed interest in joining in on the order to both my boss and one of my teammates. 

I checked back in with the closest coworker a few minutes later and was told they weren’t ordering from the restaurant. So, back to my desk and resign myself to my original lunch plan. 

Fifteen minutes later, the person from the other department showed up with food from a very similar restaurant (same menu, both are excellent) for everyone except me—and I overhear her say that the boss had placed the order for everyone. 

I’m feeling hurt that I was excluded especially because I had expressed an interest in it and had means to pay my own way, and I almost want to bring it up (as it isn’t the first time I’ve been left out). However, food was brought to the busiest people who might not have had other lunch plans. They are the ones under pressure, not me.

Hello everybody – the last few months have been interesting.
To start, my friends and I have spent a lot of time hanging out together. Sometimes, we’d go out on adventures around our towns. One of the people in our group, Nick, was always a bit on the wierder side. He was spontaneous and often do weird things that we were not down with. In December he went through a rough patch when he left the theater at our school after not getting the role he wanted. Nick has always had problems with his self-esteem, so this hit him hard. Due to this loss, he started to aggressively look for a girlfriend. The problem however was that the person he wished to become his girlfriend was a 14 year old neighbor and friend of another in the group, Steve.

As a 17 year old, he pursued this younger girl and at first she was happy with this but eventually she became more hesitant. Nick and this younger girl took a walk late in the afternoon in the girl’s neighborhood and tried to kiss her twice, both times being rebuked. The girl was very creeped out by this occurrence and did not talk to Nick again and Nick did not tell anyone about this occurrence, not even Steve. However, before anyone of us learned about what had happened Nick got a new girlfriend Rachel. Nick would bring Rachel to many gatherings at others houses, never his own, and make out and touch each other while we were very near them. We repeatedly told them not to and one day when we made them to make a promise to not do that type of things in front of us, Nick started yelling at us. He did somewhat stop this behavior but Nick and Rachel still spent most of their time at gatherings not talking to us. It was obvious that they were abusing these meetups to do things that their parents would not let them do at their own houses.
Eventually Steve learned about what had happened with the girl and was angry. He eventually confronted Nick (after a lot of prompting from us). When he confronted Nick, Nick attacked Steve and said many horrible things and said that he did not want to talk to us anymore. The next day Nick started dming the rest of us and told us he wanted to talk to us again. We all gathered and discussed it and agreed to just exclude Nick for a bit. We thought he might be added back, but until then we were going to tell Nick to stay away. Nick did not take this news well and did some more passive aggressive stuff later.

For example, there was a school event group (where people and camp out and fundraised money) that included Rachel and Steve (who was still friends with Rachel). Rachel wanted to include Nick because she is dating him and Nick supplied tents for the camping out. However, Nick did not know Steve was there and when Steve showed up Nick left in his car and texted Rachel that unless Steve left they cannot use his tents. Steve texted me and I gave him the tents so Nick lost all leverage. After having seen how petty Nick still am I or the group the asshole for how we handled the situation."	Not enough info	0	0

bxxkq0	2019-06-07 17:49:25		AITA For Cutting Off My Best Friend Cuz of His Love	"Long story short, I met a new student at the beginning of the school year (August). We automatically became close, really close, we'll call him Brian.

Let's move forward to October. I'm going through a lot of personal shit. I took the leap of faith and I told/shared everything with Brian. Keep in mind we had been friends for only two months. However, he was there for me and helped me greatly.

Let's fast forward again to around April. Brian and I are very close, and our friendship is skyrocketing. However, I found out in mid-April that Brian, for six months, had been messaging a close female relative of mine (who also goes to the same school) a lot, we'll call her Panda. I found this out through Panda's best friend. The next day I found out he had/has a major crush on her.

Before I move on, I need to explain my relationship with Panda. Panda and I are relatives who have lived close. We aren't siblings, but due to how close we lived, and because of our culture, we are practically brothers and sisters, which Brian knew. However, we can't stand each other. I can't stand Panda because of her fake, manipulative, and flirty shit personality. At the beginning of the year when I was telling her info or ""tea,"" she was great with me. I actually thought we were chill. In fact, I completely jeopardized my relationship with another one of my friends in defense of her. It all spiraled down when I refused to tell her something that the boys knew. She promised to stop talking to me and called me a ""switch up"" and ""fake."" We haven't spoken to each other since January. I still miss the times when we were chill. Even her best friend (the one who told me about the texting) told me that she is fake. If you ask her the reasons she hates me, she doesn't have one legitimate answer. I do, but they are all personal (Brian knows them).

When I found out he had a crush on her, the number one thing I felt was that I felt betrayed. I couldn't believe that for so many months when I would tell him all my personal shit, he didn't have the decency to tell me his shit. He eventually found out that I knew, and instead of talking it out, he told me I was being an asshole. I agree, I stopped talking to him and I made things awkward, but I felt betrayed. We eventually talked and became chill, but I warned him of Panda's personality. She even used him to get texts from another boy in our class who called her a ""slut.""

I've started getting uncomfortable again because I saw texts of him begging her to forgive him because of jokes I made of Panda. Another thing that hurt me was that Brian is still hiding everything about this situation from me, where I never did the same with my major shit.

I'm now completely annoyed and now I mock the situation (w/Brian and close friends), and sometimes to the point where it hurts Brian and he tells me to stop, but I don't. But he knows this comes from my hate of Panda, and hurt of him not trusting me.

bxxklp	2019-06-07 17:49:15		AITA for ruining the Minecraft server I made for my, “friends,” and I?	"So some backstory. I’ve known these guys for years and hung out with them for a while. We did the normal things that friends would do; play games, go to each others houses, et cetera. In the group we’d all have our rolls. One was good at video games, one was funny and so on. I was mainly the guy who was smartest when it came to schoolwork but in social situations I was as dumb as can be. Because I was dumb I would get berated and criticized for thoughts I would say out loud as somewhat of a joke. It made me feel really bad sometimes and made me feel mentally stressed as well. Sometimes the stress was too much and I would do the best I could to annoy them as payback for all the insults and  abuse they would put onto me. And in the end I could never follow through with my desire to leave the group. 
In the beginning of the summer I downloaded Minecraft and made a post about it on Snapchat. My, “friend group,” eventually got it as well and wanted to start a server. The thing is, I was the only one who could run a server without connection issues and the like. So I agreed to make the server. A couple days went by and they had already beat the Ender Dragon multiple times while I was busy with finding a job. To this I felt a little left out but it was no biggie. I asked if I could move my base over to where theirs was located and they said it was fine. In between doing so I decided to explore their place a little bit to see their improvements. A lot of shenanigans go on and eventually I’m sitting there getting practically bullied on my own server, getting killed left and right and having things I didn’t do blamed on me. I thought to myself if they were going to have fun then why can’t I? At this I had another little breakdown and began to do things to ruin their base like ruining their farm, placing obsidian everywhere and so on. I then got around to messing with the server settings and credentials, kicking them out and myself to make sure they didn’t realize I was behind it. They already know I’m new to computers and one of them said, “don’t mess with anything because you don’t know what it does.” This made me angry because in reality I did know what some things do and in my head I was thinking that they are deliberately looking down on me. My head went through thoughts like, “After all they’ve done to me and I forgave them they’re going to just bully me again and I can’t get revenge?” At this I go full on and basically delete my server. 


TL;DR
I ruined my minecraft server with my, “friend groups,” hard work included because I wanted to get revenge for how they’ve treated me for the past 4 years."	Everyone Sucks	1	0
bxxk4z	2019-06-07 17:48:27		AITA for asking my ex to follow my rules in my house?	"My ex-husband and I divorced almost 7 years ago due to him getting involved with drugs (heroin.) He didn't go to any court dates for custody, so the judge gave him the absolute minimum (4 hours supervised visits once a week, and I get to choose who supervises.) For the first 6 years, he saw our children (now 9 & 16) about 15 times total, and didn't pay any child support. Also during those 6 years, he was arrested 8 times for drugs.
Recently, he got a job, and pays 1 week of support per month, and pays nothing on back support. Regardless, if he asks to see the kids, I say yes. A few days ago, he wanted to visit but I had to work, so I said he could visit without supervision if he followed 3 rules (he can't leave my home with the kids for any reason, he stays out of my stuff, his new girlfriend isn't allowed at my home.)
I came home that night to find out he took my kids to a playground to hang out with his girlfriend and her kids. Both of my kids told him they shouldn't do that, and he yelled at them saying he was their parent and my rules don't matter.
I was livid! I told him that obviously I couldn't trust him. He said that he was their parent too, and shouldn't have to follow my rules. I said he was lucky I allowed him to visit at all without supervision, and that I couldn't trust him with them if he couldn't follow my rules. He hasn't been an active parent for almost 7 years and he needed to give them time to get used to him again. He scared my daughter by yelling at them, and our autistic son had a meltdown telling me about their Dad's behavior.
I finally told him we're going back to supervised visits since I can't trust him, and now he's bashing me to everyone we know, saying I'm keeping him from his children.

bxxjoh	2019-06-07 17:47:39		WIBTA for following through with calling CPS on my sister?	"I’m going to make this as brief as possible. My (25) older sister (31) has suffered with depression for many, many years. Since she was in her teens. She had her first son when she was 18 and my mother basically raised him for her. Fast forward 10 years later she had another child with a different father, and the two of them bought their first house together. They both are very mentally unstable. Her second son is now almost. My sister and her boyfriend hate each other and admit it openly. She lives in a very small 2 bedroom home and has 4 full grown huskies and 7 cats and has recently taken upon herself to rehabilitate baby raccoons and is currently raising a go fund me page for an $450 incubator. The house is in very cluttered and poor condition via the animals and her hoarding and her depression. Every time I’m on the phone with her she’s screaming I mean mentally and emotionally abusing those kids. I won’t back track too much but it’s important I note that when my sister met her now boyfriend, he had a daughter that my sister HATED, a sweet little girl. My sister convinced multiple psychiatrist that the girl was a monster and my sister had her taken away and sent to her grandmothers. So she’s already involved in CPS because the little girl revolted and tried escaping the wrath of my sister so many times my sister barred her bedroom windows shut. My mother is devout catholic and refuses to acknowledge my sisters mental illness. Even though my mother is incredibly fearful for the children as my sister has told her that she hates her children and should never have become a mother etc.. instead my mom is convinced that there’s demons possessing them and their house and has “SERIOUSLY HAD A TALK WITH MY SISTER” which I thought meant that she was urging my sister to seek psychiatric help, but instead what my mother did was tell her that they’re all possessed and need a safe cleansing and a priest bless the house. I’ve tried for years to get my sister help, she can stay here and I’ll help with her kids (as I’m a stay at home mom and my husband and I are well off enough to help)
I spoke with my mother today and I told her I have had it with the phone calls scaring me half to death and my sister resistant to change and get help, and that I was a day away from calling CPS. Which my mother begged me not to.  She thinks they’ll just come take them away which is not at all how the state judicial works, they’re more likely to implement healthier home values and my sister will need to see a therapist or something. So am I the asshole if I call to get my sister and the kids help? I could go on and on into more details about my sisters unhealthy home life that puts the kids at risk but I think this is enough.

TLDR: my sister is in need of serious psychiatric help for her and her kids sake and my catholic mother is convincing her that it’s demons possessing her"	Not the A-hole	1	0

My family is very upset with me, and say I'm being unfair because my sister traveled to attend my wedding last year, but mine was on a weekend and was much closer to her so it didn't require entire days of traveling. I know her wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event, and I am sad to miss it, but repeating an entire year of school would be a major setback for me.

AITA for not going to the wedding?

&#x200B;

**Edit**: Just wanted to answer some common questions from the comments instead of replying to each individually.

It is not possible to go to the wedding in one or two days. I am not going to post exact locations but I live across the country and the wedding is in a small town that there are no direct flights to, and only a few flights per day. The flights, layover, and driving to/from the airports is an entire day of travel. Paying for the flights is no issue for me, but the schedules make it not possible.

I spoke with the director of the school about making an exception to the attendance policy, and they are not able to due to state laws. If they go against the laws the entire school could lose their license so obviously they're not willing to do that. The class schedule has been set with the trainers and other students for a year and they are not able to offer make-up classes.

About the finances, if I were to re-apply to the apprenticeship it would cost me about $2000 in class and book fees (online classes so I have to re-buy all the access codes... thanks textbook companies) and over $40,000 in lost income."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxxi5t	2019-06-07 17:44:11	OpalBooker	WIBTA for taking the neighbor’s cat to the humane society?	"I know the title sounds really shitty but bear with me. I’m torn. 

So we live in a relatively large condo complex with plenty of woods (and coyotes and apparently some bears) around. There’s a cat that roams the neighborhood named Nessa. She’s very sweet, even to me as someone who generally isn’t crazy about cats. She “belongs” to a couple who live up the street, but I use the word really loosely. 

I’ve never once seen her owners leave food or water out for her, much less let her into the house. Last summer was brutally hot and it poured rain. These people left her outside while they went off to Florida for two weeks. When they got back, another neighbor confronted them. They claimed that she broke out or the house by ripping through a window screen. I don’t think that’s possible, but I didn’t exactly do a walkthrough of their property to check. Anyway, I don’t believe it. 

She also seems extremely underweight, I wonder if she maybe has worms or something. Her hipbones jut out and when you pet her you can feel every one of her ribs. She’s at least two or three years old but she’s just so tiny. 

I can’t take her in myself, but it feels wrong to just leave her to fend for herself. I bring her water and tuna whenever I walk outside and she’s lounging on my porch or in my garden, but it doesn’t feel like enough, especially for such a sweet cat.

bxxh7h	2019-06-07 17:41:42	WasIBragging	AITA for mentioning my DJ friend?	"https://imgur.com/a/OwXhlki

I dated a gal for a number of years (a couple years back). Recently, she’s been traveling the world (again). I’m abroad for the first time. 

I met a guy who DJs (like many in the girl’s/my city). I introduced her to him at some point. He was just booked to perform in a nearby city.

Yesterday, I sought her advice on hostels and provided context. This read as a humblebrag, one might call it. 

Hours later she admitted perhaps it read wrong (as opposed to me being intentionally braggadocious), but isn’t convinced. I say “I don’t accumulate “cool” points that I can redeem before/when I die... you have more going for you than me... I have a number or flaws such as <A>, <B>, <C>... you aren’t impressed by the party life anyway...” Then, a girl blew me off tonight—I screenshotted the messages and shared them, making the point “no, I don’t think I’m cool.”

Still, she figures I was trying to “grandstand” by mentioning the DJ.

Who reads my message in a poor light? AITA?

"I like to think of myself as a nice and patient kid, but there are some triggers that throw my head off the wagon. One of these triggers are drugs. I'm in a tiny class for teens with trouble in school (there's only six students) and me and this other boy are the only ones who don't smoke weed. They're all pretty fun and decent people for the most part, and we usually get along well and joke around, even if we aren't exactly friends. However, the people who smoke weed won't stop talking and bragging about it. I get uncomfortable and ask them to stop because they know it's a trigger, then they lecture me on the benefits of weed, then I lecture them on the cons of it, and it keeps going. I'm 420 friendly but only if you smoke responsibly and you're the legal age to do it if it's legal in your state, but my classmates don't do that.

I finally lost it when one guy said ""It's pretty fun driving while high."" I straight up shrieked ""What?!"" And he repeated himself. It got really awkward because I was obviously horrified. For background, a family member (I won't disclose his identity) drove while high when me and my two brothers were in the car and a girl at my old school died in a crash with a high/drunk driver. They told me that it wasn't a big deal and I put my head in my hands and started crying. I told them they had no right to put their lives and the lives of others in danger and that I couldn't believe them. I don't remember the specifics of the conversation after that because I was so emotional but it ended with me screaming that they're selfish assholes and I hate them. I stormed out of the class and hid behind the school for the rest of the day.

Now it's the next day and I'm three hours late to school. I'm ashamed and anxious to show my face there again. Those guys are my entire social group and they probably hate me now. Am I the asshole and did I over react?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

Immediately he tried to impose his own way of teaching and grading on us (the students) which was very different that anything we had ever experienced. You were expected to do things his way, and even if his was was wrong, which people pointed out to him, you were still expected to use it. R also took points off for scratch work that he didn't like, and tried to take off as many points as possible on the tests, quizzes, and homeworks. Every student he had with no exception was subjuct to this.

R also took forever to grade our assignments. We took a test the week before spring break, and got it back ~6 weeks later. He also refused to go over it with anyone. R never offered help outside of the classroom and was hostile whenever asked for extra help.

The administration took notice and we were informed that R was not coming back next year. Needless to say, we were overjoyed about this. Since the announcement, R completely checked out, he just wrote notes on the board, barely talked during class,and went to Disneyland instead of going to one of the review days for exams.

Yesterday, as I was walking out Of R's classroom for the last time, I called ""See you next year!"" over my shoulder. My friends have told me that I'm the asshole for this, but I don't think so.

"Context: this happened awhile ago and never really was resolved Ive moved on. However I do miss the GF a bit as Ive known her my whole life but thats just nostalgia. (we are also in highschool...)

It starts off when his GF called me after their camping trip in which she was freaked out about my friend (who we'll call Harry) jumping the gun by admitting he plans to marry her. After she tells me this, she asks me to talk to him. Now I know this is where I fucked up I should've told her no and that she had to deal with her own problems. But I also always try to be the best friend I can be also considering that I would also be saving Harrys ass I thought of it as a win win. So next time me and Harry hang out I tried to explain to him that were just too young and that he's freaking his GF out by talking about marriage this actually goes relatively well (Or so i thought). The next day I see my boy Harry and ask him whats goin on he replies with ""why are you so interested in our relationship anyways."" I don't even know how to respond so I just tell him the truth of his GF asking me to do this. Turns out that the night I told him to cool it they had a huge fight where in the end they both decided to cut me out of their lives because she told him that she was ecstatic to marry him and told him that I was jealous(This wasn't really a surprise she's a known perpetual lier).

Some background: I was seen as a strange kid growing up to the point where I would sit by myself in a corner waiting for recess to end.

After changing schools I gravitated towards the misfits and it's been like that ever since.

I'm currently going through therapy and seeing councilors while my roommate of 6 years is helping me keep my ego in check.

Its just something that just clicked when I thought back to the question of ""why I always befriend the weird ones?""

Gonna try to get back to work now. Later

Edit: holy shit I didnt expect anyone to answer so fast.

To answer your questions about whether or not I was actually friends with them. Yes we were as close as can be, we all loved the same shows and games. They got me into anime and even though they were all eccentric and I'm a bit much I saw them as family. A lot of them I met in high school and college and we kinda lost touch. My roommate (65f) would always bring up about how strange all my friends were and to try and make friends with more stable and normal people. So I dont really go out unless it's for work or errands.

"Long post- so we’re planning my sons first birthday party and as we get the guest list together (immediate family only) we realize between the two of us we have too many guests for the size of our venue. The issue with that is we only invited immediate family so we can’t see anyone that we could cut from the guest list without seriously hurting (immediate family being both our parents and all our siblings) My husbands sister is 8 people just on her own.
My husband and his sister don’t get along hardly anymore as we lived with them for a short time and it put a strain on their relationship (they lived in our house and took. Their time moving out) and he especially hates her step children, they are very disrespectful and In general unpleasant to be around. So my husband suggested asking his sister not to bring her step children who are all 13+ and husband as there are 5 of them and it will take some strain off of the party both space wise and financially.  We got in a little spat because I think that they’re still kids and it would be kind of bullying to not invite them when my two young nieces are still invited but after talking I don’t see any way around cutting our guest list... so my question is is this an asshole thing to do?
TLDR: guest list is too long for my babies birthday party husband wants to cut sisters step-kids out of the invite list to make it a little better."		1	0

bxxbsh	2019-06-07 17:28:16		AITA For throwing things at a cat?	"I'm so sick of outdoor cats. I'm so mad. I was walking my dog yesterday evening (I walk her later in the day to avoid other dogs as she is a dog reactive dog) I turn a corner and bam. 

Sitting there just staring at us, an outdoor cat. His tail was tapping the ground in such an asshole way. 

My dog, Lucy, a husky, loves cats in a not so positive way. Shes chased them out of our backyard before, she goes ballistic when she sees them on our walks, I'm pretty sure if she ever managed to catch one she would try to kill it. 

Most of the time the cats she spots are further away so she doesnt get as crazy, but this time the cat was literally 2 feet away. 

So, of course, she goes crazy. Meanwhile I'm backing away, trying to drop treats and turn her around and distract her. Nothing is more important to her than this cat.

Usually, after seeing this cats scamper off scared and Lucy and I can resume good behavior walking. But THIS FUCKING CAT starts coming at us in that slow menacing walk cats do. This cat isnt even large! 

I know cats can do some damage. So when I see this, turning our backs to it is no longer an option. I start shouting at it, shouting at the windows for someone to get their freaking cat before my dog is stratched up and that cat is dead. 

Mind you, we live in a city. I understand the need for barn cats in the country, but the cat was posted up in front of an apartment building. 

Meanwhile this cat is creeping closer and closer, its hairs so tall and it starts to hiss. I can't walk backward fast enough, and there is a busy street crossing without a stop sign or signal for pedestrians right behind me. 

So, I start throwing things at it. I wear a fanny pack so I grab at anything. Loose change, a roll of unused taped up dog bags, and finally my hand sanitizer. 

Finally someone comes out, right when the sanitizer hit the cat. It was his cat. He manages to wrangle it. And we exchanged some unpleasantries, insults and curse words. 

He called me an animal abuser.

I told him to keep track of his animals and that he is a shitty animal owner.

bxxb3t	2019-06-07 17:26:31		AITA for going into my roommates room?	"Backstory: I am a mid 20's female and I own a two bedroom townhouse. I rent out my second bedroom to another female. We work at the same company but totally different areas, and didn't know each other at all before she answered my add and moved in several months ago (close to a year by now).  Up until now she has seemed totally chill, we've never had any issues. We work opposite schedules so don't see each other a lot, but when we do it's pleasant conversation. Generally we just peacefully coexist. 

Story:  A couple weeks ago, the fire alarm in my roommates room started doing the low battery beep at about 12:45 at night. She works nights so was not home. I am a super light sleeper so of course it woke me up. So I grab the ladder, go into her room and take out the battery, thinking nothing of it. The next day after work I came home with new batteries, and told her what happened and gave her a new battery to put in. She just said ""oh ok thanks"", and I thought that was that. 

Then yesterday I got an email from my townhome association saying they were going to power wash the units this weekend and asking that we remove screens from the windows. So I texted my roomate and asked if she could please take out her screen, and she said she would. 

A few hours later she replys back saying she couldn't get the screen out and had to go to work, but she would work on it in the morning. She Then says ""please do not go into my room, it's disrespectful. Especially when I am paying for the space"". 

I was completely taken aback. The only time I have ever gone in her room was to take the battery out of the fire alarm, and she had given no indication that she had a problem then. I think I have the right to have done that? If the situations were reversed, I would 100% expect her to go in my room. It didn't even cross my mind that that would be ""disrespectful"". Yes she pays for the room and it is her space, but ultimately it is my house. And what was I supposed to have done, not slept and listened to beeping all night? Or am I totally oblivious to roommate etiquite here?

TLDR: Went into my roomates room one night while she was at work to take out fire alarm battery, she said that was ""disrespectful""."		1	0

Sat in waiting room 15 min before being called back at 8:32. Now I'm in the little room and nurse takes bandage off and says she needs to get the kit to clean and remove stitches.  I am left shirtless for another 15minutes.  I have customers I have made appointments with and i was careful to schedule my meetings to account for a 1hr appointment with this Dr. and the drive back.
I poke my head out to the hall and get somebody's attention. After a few more minutes the Dr. , clearly offended, curtly says ""what's the problem"" I, annoyed myself, tell him how long I have waited and he acts like I am the asshat for having to gtfo. Still takes 15 minutes to dress, check out and reschedule. Finally get to my car and make my appointment right on time. 
The Dr. is the type that has an already abrupt bedside manner like every minute he talks to me is a waste of his time. 

Edit: so far all I hear is appointments mean nothing and ""Everybody Knows"" appointments are malleable, and its my fault for not scheduling accordingly?  This is one of the few times I have ever gone to a non Veteran's Administration Dr. in over 25 years. As much bad news the VA gets I can say that I have never had anything but exemplary care.

bxx9wj	2019-06-07 17:23:46	ProudTruck6	AITA for not allowing my in-laws in, because they showed up unannounced?	"Married into an Indian family. Apparently, it's a cultural norm for people to show up unexpectedly like it's some sitcom. It's been one year since we've been married. About 2x a month, dad in law (DIL) or mom in law (MIL) would show up randomly  with food, say a few hellos, and then leave. Doesn't sound like a big deal, but call me an introvert or someone who has a weird mental block, but I prefer people giving me advanced notice. It allows me to prepare myself mentally for the interaction. Plus you know...I have a life. I'm not just sitting here doing nothing.

&#x200B;

In December when I was taking a nap on my day off, DIL showed up knocking. So I get up and it's him with food. Told him I was sleeping, said a few small things, and left. I was feeling super cranky after and texted my wife that we need to stop this. Since she knows her parents best, I let her handle it. She let them know in a gentle way to give us advance before coming and just cited me sleeping as an example rather than the fact I just don't like it.

&#x200B;

Things were fine for a bit, but it started happening again. March was another tipping point when they came to drop off souvenirs my sister in law got us from a foreign country. 100 bucks worth. We weren't home, so dad in law just left it in front of our door. Guess what happens when it's windy and might rain, and you leave stuff outside the front door?  At that point, I told my wife they weren't listening to you, so I was gonna talk. Had a heart to heart with DIL. I said I don't appreciate them coming unannounced. I normally prefer a few days in advance, because I want to make sure I don't need to change plans, but we compromised to 4-5 hours in advance. In addition, he let me know I was being disrespectful to ""elders"" when I don't respond in the group chat if whatever time works, so that's why he or mom show up anyways. I said I had muted the chat, because it was bothering me at work, and agreed that if he just directly messaged me, I'll respond.

&#x200B;

I let my wife know that if this happens again, I'm gonna have to take action to prevent this behavior. Last 3 weeks, they have showed up unannounced again twice. This time more from the mom with dad tagging along. For the last one, wife wasn't home, I was. They knew I was home, because I was watching TV. They kept knocking, I didn't bother opening. They even called me and such. After 15 or so minutes, they finally left.

&#x200B;

Now my wife is pissed at me, cause I was being disrespectful to them, when I'm saying that they were the ones who started it by not adhering to my requests and the compromise we made. She's leaning more on her parents side right now, and ""culture"", but I'm insisting that I'm right at not opening the door, because they continue to disrespect me. Now this news has spread to their relatives, cause they love to gossip, and now everyone thinks I'm an ass.

I get their culture is different, but last time I checked, this is my (our) house, and you respect the rules we have.

Additionally, the post could cause other people to play their cards and I could see the potential for a trend of people all not including some attribute (for instance, dark skin), as something that doesn't make them horny. 

There was a lot of back and forth from this user, to which I repeatedly said she should take the issue up with the other mods. When I spoke with the other mods, they generally seemed to side with her, and that it wasn't a big enough deal to take down the post. 

As someone with dark skin, it really offends me that not only could these people not see how hurtful it could be to me and other dark skinned people, but also that I had overreacted and shouldn't be offended if people just aren't attracted to me because of the color of my skin.

bxx4yl	2019-06-07 17:11:44		AITA for being upset with my new friend about her copying my wedding.	"My fiancé asked to post this, so I will try my best to avoid confusion.

Backstory: 

My fiancé and I met 4 years ago in Los Angeles. Our relationship was great, we were happy, in love, etc etc. I asked her to marry me and she said yes and things slowly got more difficult. My parents married much later in life, 40f/50m where as my fiancé and I are both 30. My dad has been married 3 times any basically thought it was a horrible idea and that she would distract me from work. Additionally I am taking over our family business and as my dad put it “work should be your mistress”.

Anyway, fast forebears to a little over a year ago. I am a recovering heroin addict. I was coming up on 6 years sober and relapsed a few months before our wedding. Originally it was supposed to be where she grew up, it was pretty large, and I messed that up. We needless to say postponed the wedding, I now have a little over a year sober and we are getting married in a few months. So bottom line, my family, as well as my actions have made the wedding difficult from the beginning.

Her family is middle class, my family is relatively well off. My parents however do not want to give any money towards the wedding. Everything feels like pulling teeth with my family. Her family is spending a decent amount of money and we are very appreciative of all of it.

We are getting married now in my hometown (as opposed to hers) which is a very expensive upper class community on the coast, everything is expensive.

Now to the issue: my fiancé is in a grad program and recently met another friend in the class. My fiancé’s friend just got engaged to a man whose family is extremely wealthy. The strange part is that it SEEMS like everything she is doing is mimicking my fiancé’s plans... the ring is identical, she wants to have her bachelorette party at the same place, etc etc... ANYWAY, my fiancé’s friends fiancé’s family is extremely wealthy and handing over a couple hundred thousand towards the wedding, SO basically it feels like their wedding is going to be our wedding upgraded. The venue is nicer, the party is bigger, every aspect is the upgraded version of ours, and not only that it’s happening a few months after ours...

My fiancé and our connection to the city we are getting married in are that I lived grew up there and both her and I lived there. My fiancé’s friend has really no connection to the city except for now my fiancé.

Sorry that was so long winded...

TLDR: I messed up our wedding, my family is wealthy but stingy, our engagement has been hard, and new friend is basically copying our wedding with a $200,000 budget."	Asshole	1	0

bxx400	2019-06-07 17:09:28	itsallisonyouguys	WIBTA if I angry posted about people using my dumpster on a neighborhood forum?	"I purchased a dilapidated house that sat abandoned for a while before it was mine. It's in a neighborhood, but is on the corner of a semi-busy street.  I'm in the process of renovating the house, and as a result there's a giant dumpster right out front.  It's visible from both streets.  From the outside, you'd think that the house was still abandoned, unless there's cars in the driveway.   

The entire neighborhood thinks that it's okay to throw trash away in my dumpster.  And they're really not cool about it. I'm not complaining about things like McDonalds bags.  It's like cardboard boxes that aren't broken down, so they take up tons of space.  Someone put an entire bathtub in it.  There was an old garage door motor (I don't have a garage).  Someone put a half eaten watermelon in it, which really started to stink.  And sometimes they don't even get the trash to the dumpster and just leave it sitting on the ground next to it.    

People know that they're doing something wrong.  They pull the labels off of their shipping boxes and they never do it if my car is in the driveway. And this presents a lot of issues for me - I have to spend money (hundreds of $) every time the dumpster gets filled up, so this is taking cash out of my pocket.  If the dumpster is filled over the top, they can't put the lid on and we have to take stuff out to get it hauled away.  Plus, GTFO of my property, neighbors.   

So, I'm strongly considering posting on Nextdoor about this issue and asking my neighbors to stop putting their trash in my dumpster.  I'd also remind them about 311 large item pickup which is FREE in our city.  (If you don't have it, Nextdoor is like geo-located Craigslist app/neighborhood forum) 

The only reason I haven't done it yet, is that I know I'm going to look like a petty bitch. I know I'm already a petty bitch because if I do find trash with addresses on, I go and return their trash to them. I also feel like it will have the effect of defiant people being like, I'm going to take my trash there right now. 

BUT, it's my property, it's my dumpster, and these dickbags are costing me money and holding up my construction.  I feel like it's justified, but I also feel like IWBTA.  So WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxx2oy	2019-06-07 17:06:29	confusedsil2222	AITA for sending my sister-in-law a wishlist of what my daughter wants?	"My 11 year old daughter is an avid reader, but she’s a bit picky about her books. When people ask about gifts for her, I normally say a gift card to a bookstore so she can buy her own or I have her make a wish list. My brother-in-law got married a few years back and his wife is a nice woman. She also loves books, though she’s a bit obsessed with a certain genre: Little House On The Prairie, Anne Of Green Gables, that era, etc. She got a few books for my daughter the first year they were married and my daughter gave them a shot but it wasn’t her thing. My daughter still politely thanked her. Still, it’s stayed a tradition and she kept it up, this time throwing in movies. My daughter never told her aunt that these were never her thing, she was polite and sent thank you’s. However, she’d either return them if possible or I’d sell them/donate them. She’s more into fantasy, future or modern-day stuff. Which is fine. I told her as long as she just kept thanking her aunt, it’d be fine.

Then her aunt invited her horse back riding. My daughter is petrified of horses. She had lessons a few years ago and had a bad experience. She asked me to decline on her behalf, and I politely did. My brother-in-law is really close with my kids (he takes them for lots of outings, with his wife too, but she has told me there are times she feels like a third wheel because it was the three of them for so long and then she just appeared. I’ve told the kids to make her feel more included and they do, but it’s still hard) and I know she just wants to be too, so I suggested a movie my daughter wanted to see and offered to buy them tickets. She said she was offended that my daughter never invited her over to watch any of those movies she gave her or talked about those books she gave her. I gently explained that they weren’t my daughter’s cup of tea and tried to explain what was. That made her even more offended. 

Daughter’s birthday is coming up and I sent her my daughter’s wishlist of books, with a note saying that of course these weren't nessecary but just what she did like. Apparently that rocked the boat even further. Sister-in-law is being passive aggressive about it, but she’s acting like I went too far. Should I not have said anything?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxx2j7	2019-06-07 17:06:08		AITA for wanting my husband to keep in touch while he is out of town?	"I feel like this is going to come across as a shitpost, but I swear I really am looking for an answer if I am in the wrong.  

My husband and I have a pretty perfect relationship, with the exception of one issue.  Every single time he goes out of town, he will go hours (sometimes up to 24) without reaching out to me at all.  No texts, phone calls, emails, nothing.  In the last 8 years, we have never had a successful trip where I feel as though he has kept me in the loop.  I’m not asking for anything crazy.  Just a quick text every 2-3 hours letting me know how he is doing.  

Everything exploded last night.  He is currently on a fishing trip, and went seven hours with no contact.  It’s always hurtful, but it especially was yesterday as it was my birthday, and I am currently on bedrest with a high risk pregnancy-not to mention I have to keep up with our 2 year old all by myself.  He was totally unapologetic and said he was “sick of always feeling like the bad guy,” on these trips, but he wouldn’t feel that way if he kept up with my simple request.  

He was not actually fishing yesterday as the tournament doesn’t start until today.  He left his phone to charge on the boat and went to the pool with his friends.  Had he told me his phone was charging and he would talk to me when he got back, or if he used a friends phone to send a quick text halfway through, I would not have been mad AT ALL.

We dated for about 3 years before we got the saddest puppy I had ever seen. I took weeks off of work to help the pup settle in and get house trained. I also skipped lunch from work everyday to go home and let her outside so she would be comfortable. Most of the training, exercise and play time were all me. I feel like I raised this dog, even if she helped out a little bit. Another year and a half later and we have a home together in my hometown, after moving from the college town where we met. I caught her in bed with another guy and kicked her out of the house that night. I immediately packed up all her things and told her to pick them up ASAP. Part of the agreement was that I would let her see the dog, on the condition that everything was done on my terms and schedule. Since we broke up she has: taken both cars since they were in her name, given my car to the guy she cheated on me with because he wrecked his drunk driving, bad mouthed me to people at work (all three of us work in the same place), and even tried making me jealous by texting about how great her new boy is. I originally let her see the dog for walks and playtime, but last time I let her she brought the guy she cheated on me with to my home. For me that was the last straw, and it’s been over a month since she’s seen the dog now. She’s even tried texting my new roommate, who is my best and oldest friend, to get him to betray my trust and let her in.

bxx0rn	2019-06-07 17:01:52	Dman7419	AITA for wanting to tell my wife she spends too much	" 

My wife and I have been married for 12 years. We have differing views about spending money. We have no debt, am saving for retirement and together make over $300,000/year. I noticed on our credit card that she bought 3 purses that totally almost $5000 in one month! Now she doesn’t spend that excessively every month, but she certainly never denies herself anything either. I on the other hand focus on saving and investing money for retirement. I can confidently say that I spend less than a quarter on myself compared to what she spends on herself. 

This is not a ‘keeping up with the Jones’ thing either as our circle of friends and family wouldn’t buy item’s like this. It’s not that we can’t afford to spend money on frivolous things like clothes and purses that celebrities buy. I guess that it just doesn’t align with my worldview. I understand the dopamine rush in buying things, but to me it lasts a few days and then you need another hit. It doesn’t seem like a long term solution to happiness. 

Back when we made less money, we use to have an understanding that if we were to spend over $500 on something frivolous that we would talk about it together first, but that seems to have gone by the wayside. Am I the asshole for feeling purchases like this are over the top even though we can technically afford them?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bxx00p	2019-06-07 17:00:15	stlshlee	AITA for not wanting to attend a funeral?	"Sorry if this is confusing but here we go.  My MIL has a friend that she met when they both worked at the same place decades ago.  I personally have never met this individual or anyone associated with her other than my MIL.  Unfortunately her friend's son died just died of cancer, he was in his mid 50s.  The wake is Sunday and my SO has said that he wants to attend, which makes sense because he knows the friend.  He has asked me to attend with him.  

&#x200B;

I personally prefer not to go to funeral homes in general, they make me uncomfortable, not because someone is dead but because in my opinion everyone there is basically avoiding the subject and trying to make weird small talk and the smell literally makes me sick to my stomach.  

&#x200B;

I told him I would think about attending but in reality I really do not want to.  I have never met my MIL's friend or her son.  And I'm already uncomfortable going to these things when its people I am familiar with much less someone whom I have never met before.  I also feel like this should be something for people that actually know the person.  I would also prefer that the first time I meet someone is not during one of the worst moment of their life.

Edit to say I didn't mean to say the funeral homes themselves make me uncomfortable. The funeral social type thing itself makes me uncomfortable.  The forced niceties and small talk and stuff. The only thing that makes not like the funeral homes is the sickening antiseptic smell."	No A-holes here	0	0

My (23) and my boyfriend (24) have been together for five years now. And my mother always feels the need to insert her relationship advice. Sometimes she tells me not to tell him if I bought something (with my own money) or to hide things from him. These are things that she would do in her relationship, but in a healthy one these are things that you don’t do. 

My family has never really had a discussion on our upbringing. And my mother wants to sweep everything under the rug as if it hasn’t happened. And she constantly tries to give me advice, I typically just nod my head and change the subject. But I’d rather her not to give me any advice at all.

"I’m really annoyed and angry and could really use some solid advice.  My cousin, his wife and I are very close, however, as of lately, they’ve been becoming weird and entitled.  They basically live off my aunt, who earns quite a bit of money, while sitting in the corner and judge everyone around them.  

Last year we had a falling out, because we weren’t able to wait for them to go mini putting and they felt like since they had a baby and we didn’t, we had to be flexible.  Also my cousin in particular always criticizes my husband out of no where, to the point where I would just leave their house out of frustration.  

But, after months of not talking, we made up before Christmas and I decided to give them a second chance.  So far so good, until yesterday.  

A few months ago, we were visiting them with my best friend a week before the baby’s first birthday to give them gifts.  My husband was volunteered to hold the baby on his lap because she kept playing with his phone, and both parents were eating.  I even have a photo of him holding the baby normally.

So we were planning on visiting them this weekend since we were seeing his parents who live in the same city for early Fathers Day.  I am currently 8 weeks pregnant, so I was going to drop some clothes off for their daughter I found and they were going to give me their old baby stuff and sell me their bassinet.  Then my cousins wife messages me last night this exact message:

So real talk
Last time (my husband) held (their daughter), he held her directly on his dick and it weirded us out.  Tell him to hold babies on his knee or leg, not penis.  
I couldn’t find a good way to say it
Like definitely wasn’t intentional, but it was still weird AF.

I messaged her after yes never mind we aren’t coming over, and have been upset about it since.  Like if I could show you the picture, the baby was just sitting on his lap, playing in the phone.  They don’t realize I have a picture showing this, but this is insane.  I told my immediate family that if they talk or are friendly with them, I would take that as them taking their side and internalize it.

So WIBTA if I just completely blocked them out of my life without trying to at least tell them I really didn’t appreciate the comment ?"		1	0
bxwys2	2019-06-07 16:57:18	devonha	AITA for not wanting my roommate's boyfriend over all the time?	"First, this happened about a year and a half ago but I wanted to see if I really am the asshole that my roommate thought I was. My roommate and I were previously best friends, and lived in an apartment style dorm, which was a 15-20 minute walk from campus. Her boyfriend lived about an hour away, but worked in our city. I didn't like him and neither did the other two housemates. We never said anything to either of them about not liking him, because he makes her happy and he wasn't abusive or anything, so we knew our opinions didn’t matter.

When the semester started, she asked if he could stay the night when he'd have to work late or if the weather was bad; obviously that was fine with me, and I didn't have a problem with it. He started gradually staying over more and more and it became annoying, but not unbearable. She'd go to work or class and leave him in our room for hours at a time, just sitting there playing video games and not talking to us.

I got fed up after he got so drunk at a friend’s house the night before that he had to call out of work. I came back to my room in between classes wanting a quiet place to do homework for an hour, and he was in there sleeping. We had a ""living room"" area, but the other housemates were watching TV, and I can't really tell them to go somewhere else because I was not able to use my room.

The next day I decided to text her as nicely as possible asking if he could cut down on the time he spends just sitting in our room, because I can't study, sleep, change, etc in there while he's there. I said I was fine with him staying the night if he needs, but I don't really like that he's there for hours and hours without her, just sitting in my room. At first she agreed and apologized, then a few hours later texted me saying she's actually not okay with that and it doesn't make sense for him to drive home or leave when she's at work or in class. I essentially agreed and said nevermind. (Which my boyfriend thinks was being too nice, and I almost instantly regretted agreeing with her, I wish I'd have stood my ground a little better).

After another few hours, I texted her back standing my ground a little more, pretty much just made my point again, and she texted back saying he's not comfortable in our apartment anymore, doesn't feel welcome, and won't be staying over anymore. Her and I have really not talked much after this, and she'd avoid me, I'd avoid her, etc. A few months after this, I texted her apologizing, and saying I'd like to move past this and be best friends again, and her answer was pretty much ""we'll talk about it,"" but nothing ever came of it.

For context: I've been on tinder for quite some time. It has happened once before that my date did not resemble her pictures at all. That time I ended up sitting through the date link a gent. It was an uncomfortable experience that I did not feel like reliving.

Today I matched with a girl on tinder, she seemed cool/cute and after a morning of texting she agreed to get lunch together. When she showed up she did not seem at all like her tinder pictures. I tried for about 3 minutes to not be the shallow guy but gave up (because I am a shallow guy).

I took out my phone and acted like my brother had texted me for help with his sick dog. I appologized and ran off, mostly because I wanted my excuse to seem legit, but also because I wanted to leave the date asap.

Looking back at it, I don't know how to feel about it. Clearly she put me in an uncomfortable situation by lying about her looks, but I can understand that she too wants some attention. I think I was justified in leaving her, but my roommate is calling me a massive asshole for literally running away saying she's probably very insecure about her weight and this sort of thing could really hurt her feelings."

They used to live halfway across the state in Seattle and we would see them ~2 times every year. About 3 years ago they discovered the younger cousin has ADHD and some other disorder that I think they said is similar to autism. The other cousin has bad anger issues and is not very empathetic towards his brother.

Recently my aunt had a divorce and decided to move out of Seattle, ending up only a block away from our house. My aunt likes to use the fact that she is a single mother to avoid certain responsibilities, leaving my family and grandma to help her. It’s hard to care for her kids because of their mental issues, and none of us like it. The cousins would often fight each other and it can be hard to manage. We dealt with it nonetheless.

This would be fine but she keeps making bad decisions. We want to go on vacation for spring breaks, and she insists that her family joins us. We used to go to Mexico every year but we haven’t for the past 3 years, and just let her have it. She even got a dog last Christmas, leaving us with more things to take care of. Every couple weekends she has a family barbecue that we have to go to. This exasperating and it feels like we have to help her . She has every reason to need help with her single mother status, unmanageable kids, and diabetes; but I feel like she is being too demanding.

I take almost every chance possible to avoid them, and I don’t feel like it’s helping much. I still see them about twice every month and every time I do they harass me about “leaving my cave” or say things like “we’ve got an anon sighting.” They are so hard to put up with and it feels like it’s only getting worse.

I went to a class the other day and the instructor was a very animated person who was kind and expressive throughout the lesson.

Everytime he referenced a thing or saying that could maybe be in the very slightest bit historically racist or biased to something, he would again specify that he holds no biased view and is open to everyone's opinions/beliefs.

So for last years marching season, I had to do synth (electronic piano/keyboard) in the front ensemble because I had to have a spinal fusion done and wasn’t cleared to march. 

However this year my doctor said I was cleared to march, which made me happy since I wanted to march Clarinet this year. So I told my band director and he said it would be better if I do piano since the show is going to be physically demanding. At lunch, I got a little upset and cracked my phone’s screen protector a little (it wasn’t that bad in fact you can barely tell).

bxwt0f	2019-06-07 16:43:42	Fonduemeinthebutt	AITA for not cooperating with my landlord	I’ve been living in my apartment for over two years now. My landlord and I get along great and I enjoy the apartment which is essentially a townhome with a front porch. A few months back my rent went up due to “increases in maintenance cost” which is understandable and I happily obliged.  However about two months ago some men started to replace the wood and other things on the exterior of the building (starting before 8 am with awful scratching sounds like razor on a chalkboard I think they were taking a razor to the paint or something and blasting music very loud). They started to rip the old wood off and then just left after a few days. I don’t know if they left to work on a different project or what but the front of my home was left looking like a half complete construction site for over two months. The men finally return today and my landlord knocked on my door asking if they could plug an extension cord into my unit to supply electricity to their power tools and I told him no. I know it sounds unreasonable but they’re also doing all the attached apartments and I don’t think it’s fair for me to pay for the power of these large tools when this has been a pretty awful experience from the beginning.

bxwrk9	2019-06-07 16:40:15		WIBTA For quitting while my boss' parent is dying?	"I recently got hired for an easy desk job, which I've been at for about a week now. It's just a way to stay busy for about a month before I enter the military. My supervisor, call her D, has been rude/passive-aggressive towards me from the start. I know that's subjective, so I'll give some concrete examples:

&#x200B;

1. As I'm working full-time, I'm entitled to a 15 minute break every 4 hours. On day one, D told me it was up to me when I wanted to take this break. 30 minutes into my shift, I decided to take this break to take a call from my mother, especially as I had not been able to talk to her since her brother passed this week. I go to D and request a break. Immediately, D responds angrily, saying, ""Oh, you don't get to do that around here. You seem to be playing by your own set of rules, but that's not going to work here."" The implication was that I had not worked long enough to take a break. Taken aback, I replied ""You made it sound like it was my prerogative when to take a break. That expectation was not made clear, so instead of getting angry, you could just communicate that with me next time."" D replied ""I'm not angry. Go take your break, go take your break."" Then walked off.

&#x200B;

2. I take a lunch break at noon. I scheduled a food delivery between noon and 12:30. Because the delivery was going to arrive at 11:50, I asked politely (as I know things have been awkward) if I could leave ten minutes early to get my order. D immediately lets out a big sigh, and says ""You can't just do that. You need to \*sighs exasperatedly again\* respect other people's schedules. You can't just leave ten minutes earlier."" So then I say that instead, I could nip out for a minute and just get the order. D responds ""So which one is it? Which one do you want to do? Just take your break, go ten minutes earlier."" Then D says ""You know, I have a parent that is dying right now."" Then walks off.

&#x200B;

At this point, I was kind of shocked and stood there. A few seconds later, I walked into D's office and said ""Can I say something? You're not the only one going through things right now. My uncle passed away earlier this week, which is why I wanted to call him."" D says ""Why didn't you tell me? Just go take your break"" and sort of dismisses me. So I awkwardly leave and go eat lunch.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I was prepared to quit before hearing about D's family situation. This is not in any way (financial or otherwise) a job that I need. And I certainly do not want to spend 8 hours a day being miserable/stressed during my last month of civilian life. At the same time, quitting would make D miserable, as it would be incredibly difficult for D to find another employee to cover my shifts. At the same time, I don't feel like I really owe D anything. I agree that going through personal crisis calls for some leniency, but I certainly don't think it counts as a carte blanche to do whatever you want. I've also noted that she's only been acting this way towards me. Would I be an asshole if I quit?"		1	0

bxwqxm	2019-06-07 16:38:43	aswedishtiger	AITA: I have a 7 year old son I haven't met	"2007 Served in the Marine Corps from 2007-2012. Served in (2009) Iraq and served in Afghan (2011). Between wars I had met a beautiful young woman whom I hooked up with once maybe twice I to this day cannot recall.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2012 Moved to Atlanta for another woman whom I met through mutual friends and had no plans on moving back to the north so I figured staying down south and starting a new life with a new lady sounded fine plus there was a ton of work opportunity

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2012-2015 Did some work for IBM became really successful and remained in Atlanta area due to opportunity and plain out love it here. Woman I moved here for didn't work out ultimately and it ended poorly but alas single again I buy my own house and pretty much live it up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2017 Knock at my door and it's a deputy from the Sheriff's office. Asks my name and I confirm my identity. He hands me a huge stack of pink papers and says have a nice day. I try to stop him claiming I took care of this 3 years ago (thought this was a bar fight I was in in which I was jumped, won the fight and the judge threw the case out). He turned to me and said ""No sir, not an assault charge. That paperwork is for child support."" My heart sunk I immediately look at the top. My name is there yes but I don't recognize who this woman is at all. I immediately run back into my house throw the papers on my side desk and hit Facebook. Find her, she's gorgeous and now I do remember her. Lives WAY up north haven't spoken in at least 6 years and shortly after the mouth swab proves I am the father

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2018 Paying child support. Feels weird. Ladies at the child support office can't give me the mother's number due to reasons and her facebook was deleted who knows how long ago. Colleagues at work say ""waive your parental rights"" and in her state I'm clear to do it. No relationship with the kid. No knowledge of birth. Not on birth record. Had during time of war. X amount of years have passed since child conceived. All sorts of little things are in my favor and even a lawyer I was dating she confirms I would win.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2019 He just turned 7 and I still haven't met him but FINALLY talking to mother after who knows how long. Child support is voluntary wage garnishment and he has super good health/dental care etc through my company but I feel like I'm paying a bill that I can't enjoy. Can't say I don't want to meet him. Can't say I'm dying to meet him either. 6-7 years of silence and ""here's your kid help me pay."" So awkward

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Note: She was NEVER PLANNING ON TELLING ME. Her job doesn't pay shit so she's broke when he turned 6 the state said ""Ok he needs health care you need to provide it."" and she couldn't so then they come looking for the other parent to help out and that's how the ""Let's find the father"" hunt even began 6 years after the fact. Could've gone my entire life without knowing I had a son

bxwpll	2019-06-07 16:35:29	AddictedToDosXX	AITA? For “Stealing” My Family’s Dog	"To preface, 7 years ago the family’s dog had a litter of 5 dogs the last one being the runt. I immediately bonded with him and nursed him to health. A few months later my mom decided to give all the dogs away except the runt because I would not let her. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago, my evangelical devoted parents kicked me out of their home. For various reasons including drinking, smoking, and not following their religion. I was lucky enough to have friends/family help me out with couch surfing while I got on my feet. 
Well during the time I was getting back on my feet they completely neglected my dog. It got so bad he became obese, had an ear and eye infection, and fungus on his fur. 

Now to present time. I got a lease at an apartment and wanted to adopt a dog but instead I decided to go my parents house and take my neglected dog back. My girl friend and I got my dog all the essentials and I can honestly say my dog is living a better life. But now my mom and sister keep berating me for being a thief and breaking their trust. They have cried telling me to return the dog but I know he’s living a much better life with me being an inside dog.

bxwp7j	2019-06-07 16:34:32	Anal_Wrath	AITA for apparently almost causing a coworker (driver) to quit?	"I work the customer side of this company, handling invoicing, cash, and order reception, basically. The driver is in charge of delivering the product locally (in the city) and to the airport, where the driver gets the tracking number and cost of shipping (that is paid for by the company) and then comes back.

The problem began when the driver was not handing over the money remaining and the receipts with the tracking #s as soon as she returned. I needed the money to make sure the company's cash flow was in order (and no money was stolen/lost/etc) and the tracking #s to send to clients because if I didn't send them first thing in the morning via email, I'd get phone calls urging me for them since they (the clients) had people going to pick up our products at their local airport. And my job is to keep customers happy.

So I have told the driver several times that those items need to be immediately left in the office upon her return and she has repeatedly been leaving them somewhere inside the trucks or taking the money and invoices home with her. Last night she took both home. Which forces me to go after her via calls or text

Apparently this caused tension for her because she thought I was bossing her around and she came today to my boss to tell her she was quitting. My boss asked her not to and then came to me to tell me to lay off because I'm not in charge of other people. Which I'm not. But I do depend on her to actually do all of her job well so I can do mine well. But I am feeling pretty bad about it because she's nice and a good person although forgetful or distracted.

bxwonm	2019-06-07 16:33:11	kalbar3	AITAH for not wanting to pay for damages in a place I have not lived for 3 years?	"Lived with my nieces and our dogs, I moved out three years ago and they stayed. When we lived there, my dog was always accused of chewing, specifically the windowsill. Before I moved out, I clearly remember fixing the chewed spot. Landlord did not come for two weeks after I moved out to assess damages to get my deposit back. I was told by my nieces that out of my $400 deposit, I was getting $350 because of a pull in my carpet and he wanted to also charge me for the blinds on said windowsill, but niece 1 paid for it since the damage was caused by her dog. 

Flash forward 3 years, nieces are moving out. Windowsill and various other wooden objects have been continually chewed since I left. I get a text this morning saying we (as in all of us who had dogs) need to fix the window sill that had been chewed. Now I’m confused because I remember fixing all chewed damage and recall that the chewing continued after I left- in 2016. 

Nieces are sticking together saying I didn’t fix it and the Landlord wanted to charge me for it, but they told him their step dad would fix it so that he wouldn’t take it out of my deposit. They want me to help pay to replace the windowsill. AITAH for not wanting to pay for this?

But she texts almost non-stop, whenever we play any game she usually lags a large bit behind because she's busy texting. This also happens when we're together in real life. I come over every month but she still sits on her phone most of the time.
 When we sit at home, she rarely talks to me and either watches the T.V. or texts on her phone for long periods of time. When we go outside for walks with her dog, she texts most of the time, even if we find a place to sit and talk, and also lags behind sometimes as well. I don't mind enough to point it out, but the breaking point was when I took her to the cinema and for the first half of the movie, she was texting.
When we left the cinema, I pointed it out and she got mad at me and then was in a bad mood the rest of the day.

bxwn93	2019-06-07 16:29:44	SadLack8	AITA for keeping my fuck buddy’s baby after we both thought I was infertile?	"Small backstory: I’m 27. I’ve been seeing my fuck buddy Nate for a year, about every week or so, and I was married for 4 years before him (my husband left me because he realized he wanted to start a family and “he couldn’t do that with me.”) As the title implies, I was told when I was 12 that I am infertile.

I told Nate that I am infertile at the beginning of our relationship. I don’t really date anymore because of what my husband did to me. I told Nate the reality of things; I’m infertile, and I’m exclusive to him (he can see whoever he wants). If he wants to double up on protection, we very well can. If he doesn’t, that’s fine too. He ended up choosing the latter.

Well. I still don’t know how it happened because I was told “with absolute certainty that I cannot get pregnant” (side note, can I do anything with the doctor who’s said this to me; would this be malpractice?). I’ve had pretty bad pregnancy symptoms for at least a month (just didn’t think it was a possibility so it didn’t even enter my mind), so I have no idea how many weeks along I am. My appointment is on Monday to confirm but I’ve taken 3 pregnancy tests already.

I told Nate later that night, and he was less than thrilled. He asked me if I was leaning more towards abortion or adoption, and I told him that honestly, I really don’t think I’d have another chance like this, and I’m thinking about keeping it. He then said and I quote “if you’re keeping it, I’m having absolutely nothing to do with that child; you’re on your own.” I was kinda pissed off because I told him if he wanted to use a condom, he could’ve; he had that choice and he chose not to. He can’t just not have ANY involvement in the child’s life, and I told him this and that he will still contribute financially, and I will take him to court if I have to.

He started calling me horrible names, which is COMPLETELY different than how he normally acts. I no longer felt safe and left his house.

I don’t really want to tell anyone in my personal life, because I have no idea how far along I am, and I don’t want to miscarry and lead to all of this conversation of if I’m infertile/fertile, etc. I feel kind of shitty because I can see his side. But at the same time, it’s MY choice. Wanted to come to Reddit to see if I’m being unreasonable

EDIT: My wording was confusing; I edited for clarity. My doctor told me with absolute certainty that I CANNOT get pregnant. That’s why I added the bit in parenthesis

And also, I glossed over the infertile part because it wasn’t necessary. But it’s not like I was told one time “you’re infertile” and this was the last time this medical complication was EVER mentioned again. I don’t want to get too much into specifics, but I have regular check ups with my primary care physicians, including an ob-gyn. We have always operated under the assumptions that I was infertile because of said condition. Jesus Christ, do you guys really think a lifelong complication would’ve been mentioned one time to a 12 year old and that’s it?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bxwmx2	2019-06-07 16:28:53		AITA for making fun of my flatmate’s apparent habit of cumming into our cups?	"This isn’t really a serious issue, no one is really upset. But I kinda want to know if I’m being irrational or mean to my housemate. 

I’m a woman, my flatmate is a man. Earlier tonight we were talking about  about how some of my male friends said  they use socks to catch their cum when they masturbate. My flatmate said, well, male secret time, we sometimes use cups. I said our cups?

Yes our cups. 

When  asked to identify the cups, or the style of cups, flatmate refused to specify in a way that makes it obvious that no cup is safe. Glasses, mugs, tea cups, all are potential cum catchers. I guess I was hoping that he had a favourite I could just avoid? But it’s clear that I have drunk from at least one cup that has had my flatmates semen in it. 

What is more worrying is that flatmate is really bad at dishwashing in general, and I often have to rewash dishes after he has done them. That said I believe him when he says he pays special attention to the fun cups and washes them straight away. 

So I started overreacting a bit in a way that was intended to be funny, talking about how considerate I was for not cumming in any of our shared resources and mourning the fact they I could never drink liquid again. My flatmate got upset, and seemed a bit hurt. He says he won’t tell me  secrets like this if I was going to be weird about it. I think I got him in a vulnerable spot, he’s sensitive about his sexuality in general.  This is something I am aware of and try to be delicate about, despite however much shit we give each other in all other arenas. I have unwittingly really hurt him on this topic before. 

I should note I have no concerns about STDs from this, and I occasionally sleep with men, so have come into much closer contact with semen and have lived to tell the tale. I was just a little taken aback and was trying to be funny about it. I’m certainly not going to stop using the cups, dishwashing liquid being a thing. So while I would have preferred not have known about this,I don’t think my flatmate is an arsehole, but am I an arsehole for making fun of this when I know he is sensitive about sexual topics and was clearly telling me something quite personal? I still think it’s quite funny, but am I being a dick about it?"		1	0

So Sarah invite a bunch of people to her birthday party though a group chat. I noticed Henry wasn’t there so I texted her to ask about it.

"First off, this a person I've known since I was 6 years old, so about 28 years now. I know this person. I know how they act(I've lived with them.) I know the things they do on a daily basis(as they would know what I do on a daily basis too.) We've been best friends for A LONG time.

Recently he's been acting super flaky, blowing off our plans, and has been ignoring my messages(Not a ton of messages, a few on Facebook every few days if that.) He will see the message (""Seen at whatever time"") but just not reply.

So I'd check his steam profile. Sure enough. over 200 hours in Rimworld over 2 weeks. at least 2-3 hours of League of Legends every night(he has about 4-5 matches played every day in his history.) Yet, he's apparently ""busy"". Too busy to respond to a quick message(after waiting over 1 week for a single reply(and not getting one)) and when he blows off plans he just says ""I've got to deal with some shit."" So vague.

So again. I checked his gaming history and I'd bring it up to him(in the past.) ""How can you be so busy, but have 200+ hours in one game, and 2-3 hours a day in another game... And EVERY time I open Facebook, you were online 1m ago... But you can't just send me a simple short message letting me know what's going on?

Then he would get all angry and flip it around on me. Telling me I'm the bad guy for looking up his gaming history and that he's allowed to be busy, and you know... All that...

Am I really the asshole in this situation? I've been giving him PLENTY of space. Keeping my messages short and few... But still when I bring up to him that I feel like he's avoiding me... He turns it all around and flips out on ME as if I'VE done something wrong.

Have I done something wrong? I mean... It takes about 30 seconds to look at someones gaming history. It's not like I was out here peeping into his bedroom window or some shit. I wanted to know if he really was as ""busy"" as he said he was."	Asshole	0	0

They recently got back together about a month and a half ago, but worth noting during their time apart she was dating other guys and sleeping around freely. 


So since she got back together she had a seriously discussion with the boyfriend about being in a serious relationship. During this time he revealed to her that he has a child with an ex. He is 31, about 9 years older than him and she has stated previously that a child is a deal breaker for her but now she doesn’t care about it. When I was talking it over with her following this I stated that I didn’t think it was a good idea, she is going to have a masters degree next year and has a promising career so I don’t think she needs to be bogged down with some guy who I know nothing about except that he has a kid and is quite a bit older than her (for some reason she hates saying anything about the guys she dates). During this discussion I asked what she liked about him, she had no answer other than that they have a strong connection. I tried to exist on the question because a guy who you claim to love, and gave up on your major deal breaker for should have something you like. She got very offended as I tried to simplify the question and stormed off to bed (I was staying at her house at the time for a few days). This was about a month ago and she is still seeing the guy. AITA for asking a question like that and not wanting her to date him? I haven’t mentioned anything about my distaste for him since and we haven’t talked about it much other than her mentioning them going on dates etc.


Btw this has nothing to do with jealousy I’m gay not interested in her at all in that way, and we have been close friends for a while. I’ve had to bite my tongue plenty of times while she dates losers."		1	0

bxwgnt	2019-06-07 16:14:10	wanker105	AITA for getting mad when my housekeeper took my dogs out without their coats?	"I am 25M and the owner of 2 whippets. For those of you who don’t know, they are similar to greyhounds, have a very thin coat, and need something warm to wear when they’re out in cold weather.

I know it is June, but it is still quite cold where I live. As a human, I don’t go outside without a jacket, and I put coats on my dogs as well when I walk them.

I live in an apartment owned by my dad, and he hires a housekeeper to help me around. In the afternoons when I’m at work, the housekeeper usually walks my dogs for me.

We had a wonderful lady, who recently went into maternity leave, and now we have someone new to replace her temporarily. She is nice, a bit ditzy though. Monday was her first day with us. I told her that my dogs need coats when outside. I showed her how to put the coats on. The dogs don’t mind, they know the drill. She said she understood.

Yesterday, I decided to come home for lunch. I saw her walking the dogs without coats on. I immediately stopped her and mentioned to her that they were shivering. She apologized and said she forgot. I asked if she has been putting the coats on during the week and she said she has been.

I was suspicious of this, so I checked the security cameras after work. It turns out that she has never once put coats on my dogs when walking them. I was appalled and called my dad, who promised he would speak to her.

This morning, she approached me, annoyed, and said she had been reprimanded my by dad and is now being put on probation. She said she can’t believe she’s “getting in trouble over some dogs”. I told her its not that, she deliberately didn’t follow an instruction and then lied about it.

My dad says being “put on probation” basically means a three strikes and you’re out kind of system. It is in use by the agency that we hired her from.

Am I overreacting? Or was I right in going to my father about it? AITA or is she?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxwfzk	2019-06-07 16:12:24		WIBTA for asking for a free haircut?	"Hi reddit! I need your advice. Would a be an asshole (or rather a r/chosingbeggars) for asking a hair dresser to cut the hair for free that I am going to donate?

I am going to cut 45cm (18 inches) of my hair to donate them. I thought about selling instead (in which case I would of course pay) but came to the conclusion that knowing it'll help someone with cancer or alopecia to get a wig for free from charity is worth more than the money I'd get for selling, which won't reflect the time, effort and costs it took to maintain long hair.

The thing is, that I am a full time student and, while I'm defenitely not starving and doing fine, try to be mindful with my spendings. That includes usually cutting my hair myself. However, I'm afraid to do that now, because I'll cut them really short (little under the chin) to get as much lenght as possible (accidently going shorter would make me really insecure because it would look awful for my face shape). If I did it myself I'd have to cut a little lower to allow for some correction and hence sacrifice a couple inches that could otherwise be donated.

When I donated my hair three years ago and went to one of the cheapest hair dressers near me to cut 35 cm, I was charged 45€ (because excess lenght and a new surcharge because ""it's a whole new style"" or something). Although it was more than expected, I would never complain about the pricing of a haircut. However, it kind of hurts to not only give up my long hair (that I love) for charity for nothing in return, but to pay a (at least for me) considerable amount of money to be able to do so. 

That's when I got the idea to ask a hairdresser to cut it for free. In my mind, it'd simply be a single straight cut (no washing and drying, no layers, nothing more), that couldn't possibly take more than a couple minutes. They'd help me support a good cause and of course I'd understand if they said no if they were busy with paying customers. 

The thing is, that it is known that hair dressers aren't paid very well. And since I am very uneducated when it comes to that profession and cutting hair, I am afraid that I'm missing something or underestimating the work and that asking this would be offensive or disrespectful. Maybe someone who is a little more knowledgeable or works in the industry has some insight for me? I am genuinely curious if that'd be an assholish request."	Asshole	1	0
bxwfqn	2019-06-07 16:11:48	PointlessAcorn	AITA for asking my boyfriend not to eat dessert at home? Q	"My boyfriend and I have been together 4 years, living together for 2. In the time we have been together, we have both gained weight; I have gained more than him (or at least I’m shorter and it shows more). I am unhappy with my weight. I know that he is mildly concerned about his but not very, and I have no issue with his weight at all.

I have been trying to lose weight in the last year by making healthier choices. This is for my health but also because my lower self esteem has affected our sex life. Some of these changes have purely affected me eg getting skimmed milk in hot drinks and drinking less alcohol. Some were decisions we made together eg getting less takeout and using frying sprays instead of oil etc. He said he was glad to be saving money by getting less takeout. 

A few times during that year, he has come home from drinking with friends and suggested we order my favourite takeout. I have expressed to him at the time (and again in the mornings) that I find it inconsiderate of him to tempt me when I’m doing well. In terms of takeout, he then gets pizza for himself which he knows I won’t want. 

A couple of months ago, I lost motivation to eat better when he went away for business. I was under a lot of stress and slipped up and then let it snowball. He suggested last week when he returned that we both try to start our routine again because he’s concerned he’s gained weight. I agreed and have had a great week so far. 

Last night, after dinner he suggested we go to the shop and get dessert. I was annoyed. Dessert was one of the main contributors to our weight gain, mine in particular. I told him he was being inconsiderate and that tempting me a few days into trying to make better choices felt like sabotage. He was upset with me and asked if that means he can never have dessert now, since I’ll be tempted. He said it wasn’t fair of me to tell him not to have dessert at home since it’s his house too. I told him that we could get dessert together if he gives me a heads up ahead of time so I can plan my calories to accommodate it. I’m short, so it means skipping breakfast or lunch but I’m happy to do that so we can have a treat sometimes. He said he wants to be able to be spontaneous and that he won’t know when he wants it ahead of time.

I told him I have no problem with him having dessert while I’m not home or outside the house. I’m happy for us to plan to have dessert together now and then. I can’t tell him not to have dessert while I’m there and can’t have it, but I find it inconsiderate and a bit of a dick move. He agreed not to do it but I can tell he thinks I’m wrong.

bxwfk8	2019-06-07 16:11:21	Fragzilla360	AITA For not wanting semi-strangers at church to touch my 15 month old daughter?	"The title is worded a bit weird I know.  But here's the deal.  My 15 month old daughter is super cute (#shamefulbiasedhumblebrag) She definitely got the ""attractive"" genes from my wife and not from me lol.  I'm not ugly but I definitely have a face for radio. She's biracial (i'm black and my wife is white), so she has a nice light brown complexion with thick, curly, jet black hair and striking bright blue eyes.

&#x200B;

We go to a super WASPY church in an affluent yet surprisingly progressive suburban neighborhood where like 98% of the congregation is white.  There are some African Americans here and there, but none too many. My wife and I picked the church to get married in because it is beautiful, the congregation was very welcoming and etc. etc. Not long after getting married, we had a daughter and we pretty much started taking her to church with us right away.   

Like I said the congregation is very welcoming and on several occasions recruited me for church stuff (most likely because I was the only black guy under 80 there  \~ i'm 40), but I would always turn them down because as an introvert I don't really want to do any of that stuff lol.  I just want to go and be left alone. That being said, they know who I am, i'm generally friendly with everybody and i'm at least on a named basis with most of them. 

&#x200B;

After we started bringing my daughter to church with us, people would naturally want to come up and see her and for the most part they have been really respectful with keeping their distance, saying nice things and going on about their day.  But lately as she has gotten older, started walking and talking and generally looking like a little kid rather than a little baby blob, people have started to get really bold with their interactions with her.  They will come right up to me or my wife when we are holding her and start grabbing her hands, touching her clothes, pawing at her and trying to touch her hair.  

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago one of the ladies from the choir came up to us after the service and tried to touch her face. That's when I instinctively pulled back (I was holding her at the time) and said, ""I'm going to have to ask you not to do that.""  I must have said it in a way where it could have been construed as aggressive because she kind of recoiled back.  She looked a little embarrassed, but she smiled and still reached out and grabbed my daughters foot, shook it like she was shaking a hand and walked away.   My wife told me later that I kind of shouted it, but I didn't hear it like that.

&#x200B;

The following week (last week) we saw her approaching after service and my wife and I acted like we didn't see her and just made a beeline out of the building before she could get to us (the service was packed so she was weaving through the crowd while occasionally stopping to talk to people) so we wouldn't have to interact with her again.  We just didn't want to have another awkward interaction.

bxwfbq	2019-06-07 16:10:46	goblinol	WIBTA if I abandon my friend to live with 3 strangers?	"Background: my college has a hell system for housing where you're required to live in college-owned housing unless you get lucky in your fourth year housing lottery and get off campus status. The reason for this system is because the college makes bank on how much they charge us to live in dorms; they only release students off campus when they literally have more students than dorm space.

Two of my friends and I entered the lottery to live off campus, and lost. I was told by the college I was unlikely to get off the waitlist, and should plan accordingly. We grabbed my good friend(who I'll call Ben) who's a junior since the best college-owned housing is for groups of four, and registered for a college-owned apartment.

Flash forward a few months to today and the college let me and the original two friends that we have permission to live off campus. Depending on how what place we're able to find, it will be 2000-5000$ cheaper for the school year.

If we go, Ben is still registered for the same space, and is going to get paired with 3 random students. He's extremely introverted and understandably distressed by the situation. I feel especially horrible since I proposed we lived together in the first place; if not for me, he'd prolly have gotten a single dorm room somewhere.

WIBTA if I accept the offer to move off campus and save myself a ton of money at his expense?

EDIT UPDATE: It looks like Ben would be able to get a single, the same as if he'd never entered with a group. He'd still prefer to live with us in the apartment, of course.

For some background: My BF and I have very demanding jobs and work long hours. He is a doctor and I am in finance. I have had to work late these last two weeks because we are going away next weekend and I did not want to work during our trip. I have been coming home at 10 most nights, whereas he gets home at 7pm. Since he has to get up really early he will  stay up with me until 10:30 or 11 and then go to bed. 

&#x200B;

My BF loves watching TV. He works really hard, so when he gets home he likes to veg out in front of the TV and decompress. I like some shows but hate sitting in front of a TV for hours on end every day. So I only like a handful of shows, and we have two shows that we both love. I have asked him repeatedly to save those two shows for moments we have together, and watch something else when he is alone.

&#x200B;

Yesterday he asked me if he could watch one of our two shows and I asked him not to, because I was not home. Well that did not go well. He did watch something else and he enjoyed it, but got  upset with me and said that from the time he gets home until I get home, he feels like he is waiting for me and has nothing to do. I told him he could watch any other show, or do any other activity, but he thinks that is unfair to him.

I feel like it is not a big deal to set aside two shows for us to watch together. He thinks im being unfair. I would really like to see things from his POV and understand if I am being TA. So, AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bxwcu6	2019-06-07 16:04:58	throwaway17358649275	WIBTA if I stopped my housemate inviting his friend over anymore?	"I (F22) live with two housemates (both M22) in a flat. We've been living in this flat together since October, but had already lived together previously from 2016-2017 with no issues.

&#x200B;

One of the housemates always invites his friend over. Several times in the past I have been extremely pissed off at this friend for using the toilet and leaving his shit in the bottom and toilet paper without flushing or even bleaching at the very least. He just does his business and leaves. We only have one bathroom between all of us and as I mentioned above, it's already a sanitary nightmare.

I have tried gently bringing this up with the housemate and explaining that it's his friend and they're responsible for cleaning up after them. I usually get a ""sorry"" and then he'll clean. But then it will keep happening the next time anyway. Sometimes they'll take a shit in the toilet then everyone leaves the house to go out for the night so I have to deal with it. I've tried telling him off more assertively and insisting he tell his friend to clean up. I've tried messaging the group chat. I've tried embarrassing the lot of them by entering the room and announcing that whoever left a shit in the toilet needs to clear it up and they all get sheepish and embarrassed.

&#x200B;

But it still happened today.

I've been ill the last few days due to exam stress and problems with my meds , so I'm not 100% as it is. I entered the bathroom and was hit by the most disgusting smell and found the toilet bowl smeared with shit with even more + toilet paper at the bottom. I gagged and threw some bleach in before sprinting to the bathroom next door and throwing up in the sink. Cleared the sink up with bleach and stuff but afterwards I was a sick headachey mess. I sent an angry text to my housemate demanding he clear it up immediately to which he saw the message but did not do anything. Right now they've left the house and I had to bleach it a few more times and spray air freshener so it didn't stink of shit in there.

I'm at my wits end. I would not consider myself as having an OCD or being a germaphobe, but they act like I'm overexaggerating how disgusting it is that flushing/cleaning a toilet is not their problem?

I'm equally unhappy with said friend because at times him and housemate are so loud I can't sleep/study. This especially aggravated me last week the night before an exam when I had to yell at them after they ignored my FB messages to ask them to be quiet. My housemate knew I had an exam and I asked for him to keep it down, but all you hear is them playing games on their laptops and yelling ""OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"" every few minutes or blasting music.

"Once my friend got married and bought a house he and his wife seem to have entered a deep depression which has caused them to neglect there home and animals in a way that makes me sick. The home is filled with trash, the fridge always smells like rot when you open it, there toothbrush stand has mold on it and only about 20% of the floor is visible in their bedroom. I have spoke with my friend about this alone and in a serious manner on multiple occasions because I do care deeply for him and want to offer help so that he can get off his ass and clean his home. They have a border collie which they never walk or play with, they just put it in its cage while they go to work, let it out when they get home while they sit and get high until bedtime where they put it back in the cage. Because of this lack of mental and physical stimulation the dog acts up by barking and just being very “in your face” just begging for attention if you come over. To solve this they bought a husky to keep it company and now that dog lives the same life as the collie. I have told them that these are two of the most physically demanding dogs and at the very least they should fence in there backyard so the dogs can come and go as they please but they don’t see it as an issue.  My friend even approached me at one point and asked me for help cleaning the home and of course I accepted. He and I spent 5 hours cleaning and we only cleaned the living room, kitchen and first hallway because of the severity of the situation. Sense then the home and gone back to its previous state of horror and I recently had to tell my friend I can no longer watch his animals when he leaves town because his home gives me anxiety and just makes me sad because I can’t help but think he is struggling with something really bad. I have told him to reach out if he ever needs help but I don’t want to press too much and make him feel I am attacking him. 

I feel stuck, I can’t go to that house anymore and they never want to hang out anywhere else but there, I feel like to maintain my friendship I have to suffer through the shit I feel every time I am at his home. We have been friends our whole life so I am hesitant to pull away but at this point I feel like I have done all I can and am now only losing from the friendship and not gaining and because of that I am thinking of pulling away.

I considered him sort of my kid brother. And I used to help him with stuff he would need- course material, tips for classes, advice on exams and college life.

When he started working he asked me for money. I was also saving up but he had student loans so I would loan money to him so he could adjust. This went on multiple times but he would always pay me back a couple of months later.
He would call me out of the blue asking for money and I always paid. 

We developed a deep bond but sometimes he would just refuse to meet me even if he was in my city after months. He would say he had friends to meet/or wanted to go to some event etc. 

Then one day there was natural disaster and my bank was affected. That was also the day I was moving into a house. In my country at least brokers are very rude and despite my explaining this broker refused to understand and threatened to throw me out of that house. 

I called up friends frantically for money since I had only 3-4 hours. My first call was to him but he did not pick up. I left a message saying it was urgent and to pls call me. I did not say it was for money. He said he will call me back in a while. 

I waited for his reply or call but nothing .somehow I got the money and could pay the broker. 

After about a week I texted him. He replied saying he had fever. He asked me the reason for calling. I said it was sorted.

I have 3 children who each play 2 sports at different times of the year. My son plays hockey in the winter and baseball in the summer. Me and the mother of all 3 children are divorced. We also put him in a couple of mini camps throughout the summer for hockey for skills and to stay sharp. 

He was recently asked to try out for a upper tier summer league. He obviously wants it badly. Try-outs are $80 & if he makes the team registration is somewhere between $6-800 (U.S.) depending on the team, as well as 2.5 months of out of town tournaments every weekend. I told him he has a month and a half until tryouts and is now out of school for the summer. If he found a way to earn the $80 for try-outs and made a team I would pay my portion of his registration. 

It isn't exactly about the financial burden of the extra try-out money (although the shit gets really expensive real quick), it's about him working towards a goal and being invested in it. It also isn't exactly fair that we put him in a third program when his sisters are not in 3. I gave him plenty of ideas to earn money such as extra chores, asking his nana & papa if they had any work that he could do around their place, as well as asking his mother or flyers to mow lawns in the neighborhood. I think it's instilling responsibility, and showing him to set realistic goals and work hard to achieve them, but my ex-wife thinks otherwise. What do you say?

bxw3nr	2019-06-07 15:43:00		AITA For wanting my husband to cut contact with a clingy ex girlfriend	"My husband and his clingy ex broke up in 2012 and we started dating about a year later in 2013. Later that same year, my husband (then boyfriend) posted a picture of us on Facebook for the first time. A few days later, clingy ex who is friends with him on Facebook comes out of the woodwork after a year of no contact to call him and wish him a happy birthday. I don't care at this point. I'm not a controlling person and have no issues with him remaining friends with an ex.

In summer of 2015, we got engaged. Of course it's posted on Facebook. A few days later, clingy ex calls him again. I start thinking it's weird that she only contacts him when she notices his relationship milestones on Facebook but whatever. Clingy ex also gets engaged that autumn and married the following January (arranged marriage). We get married in February of 2016.

Shortly after we got married, she started calling my husband to cry on his shoulder about her unhappy marriage. Apparently the man she married is gay, she knew this before and chose to marry him anyways. She wanted to meet my husband to talk about it. I feel bad for her so I agree and they have lunch. Husband comes home and tells me what happened and said that she confessed that when she called him after out engagement, she had originally intended to call him to ask him to marry her but chickened out. After this meeting, she started calling my husband several times weekly and sometimes daily to complain about her marriage, her family, and divulge a bunch of personal issues she has (abuse from her childhood, etc.). At this point I put my foot down - I am officially not okay with her continuing to contact my husband. He pushes back saying she's in a bad spot emotionally and needs support because she has nobody to turn to. We lightly bicker about this for the next week or two and I give up.

Cue last night. He said she called him and said she wanted to divorce her husband and that he (my husband) had to choose between me and her. He said he told her he already made his decision when he married me, and that he would block her. I asked him to also block her on Facebook but he refuses. I get mad because this woman keeps popping up as a topic of conversation in our relationship and I am feeling disrespected by her and him both. He says I'm being unreasonable because of her situation and I tell him her situation is irrelevant because she has zero business using someone else's husband as an emotional crutch and then confessing that she still wants to marry him no matter what her situation consists of.

Feeling great"" to things by the lines of ""Imagine being as beutiful as me and to had been crazy for the same guy for over 6 months lol"" ""I wouldn't go back with him, not even if he was half as beautiful as I am"", and just things which message could be conveyed as ""I´m way too pretty for any man"".
7. I talked with her once she had an anxious breakdown and well, she has always asked me to be honest with her, even if she is the one who is wrong. So I brought up the theme and told her that self love wasn't the same as starting to enter the ""Arrogant part of the scheme"", just as a big ego was to be expected.
8. She basically was like ""Fuck off"" and won't reply to my messages or attend my calls.

bxw2tj	2019-06-07 15:40:53		AITA for not giving my coworker credit for a sale?	"I work in sales. I am in charge of one section and my coworker is in charge of another. There are various sections managed by different people. We are expected to sell products within our sections, but encouraged to help other people (from other sections) to sell our products and to sell anything from any section. 


Usually if I have a sale on a product in someone else’s section, I’ll give them the sale out of courtesy. We all have goals to make and I would appreciate it if someone helped me if I’m having a bad week. We are not required to do this. 


I have a coworker that happens to have a difficult section. Her products are hard to sell because not many people know about them. I make a point to show them because I like them. Most of the time I give her the sale if she is there. Sometimes even if she isn’t because I know she has a difficult time. She does the same for me but to a lesser extent. I really don’t mind this and I encourage her to sell my products and even help her. 


Yesterday I showed her products and ended up having a fairly big sale in her section. Earlier that day I had a big return and I was on negative numbers. I needed the sale so I kept it. She came up to me after and said, with kind of an attitude, that that was a big sale and she hadn’t sold anything that day. She said she needed to sell things from her section. I told her that she knows I would have given her the sale if I did not need it, but I found her attitude kind of entitled. I’m not required to give her all the sales I have in her section, just like she doesn’t give me all her sales in my section. 


She left after but I could tell she was angry at me as she is kind of sensitive.

"So My fiancé and myself are planning our wedding, we have been doing all the normal stuff like looking for our venue and writing out the family and friends we want to come, but I have one cousin out of my very large family I am morally split on wanting to invite. On one hand he is my cousin and I love him and always will, but in the other hand he is a damn nightmare. Our whole lives he has ruined every party, get together, wedding, and funeral he’s ever been at, when we were around 5-10 he would lose his shit at birthdays because they weren’t about him and wanted us to give our gifts, he would blow out the candles on everyone’s cakes with a very spit filled breath. At the last get together we were out with a big group of motorcycle friends in the sand dunes for Veterans Day and he threw a handful of sand on the Marine Corps Birthday cake, in front of probably 50 various vets and ran away crying because he got yelled at. The last time we all saw each other we as my grandpas funeral and all was ok until he called his Brother-in-law the n word with a hard r and called his own sister a n word lover and again ran away when he was about to face her wrath.

I don’t want to invite him on the basis that his track record isn’t good, and never mind he’s an on again off again addict, I just don’t want him to come up to my state, do something incredibly stupid and get himself in trouble in some way shape or form, but I also don’t want to hurt his feelings or his moms who I am going to invite."

bxw2i9	2019-06-07 15:40:07	nattypatty2010	AITA moving and my boyfriend is ditching me to help his sister	"I am just about to close on my first house (yay!) I am moving about 50 miles from my current apartment, and had planned to start moving (along with my boyfriend) on the day that I close on the house - June 21. I'm moving from a studio apartment so I have virtually no furniture that will be coming to the new house, and had planned to move all the stuff out on that weekend (June 21/22) and then buy furniture and move it in the next weekend (June 28/29). My lease on my apartment ends June 30, and I can't take any days off because of my boss' vacation, except the 21st.

Last night I find out that my boyfriend is planning to leave on June 27 to help his sister move out of her college apartment - 7 hours away - and come back July 1st. Part of this trip involves him going up to watch a drum corps show. He says he was ""already planning to do this"" and to be fair, he probably did agree to do it before I started the home purchasing process, but I'm insanely hurt by this. His sister already has two parents and a boyfriend of her own helping her move out of a college apartment - why does she ALSO need her brother (besides the emotional factor I guess) who is then leaving his own girlfriend to deal with all this alone? And by ""all this"" I mean - moving my shit up and down I 95 AND buying and assembling a two bedroom house full of furniture AND scrubbing my (albeit tiny) studio apartment in effectively one weekend. I am scrambling to find people who can help me, but everyone is either gone or busy so far, and my own parents live 12 and 14 hours away. Not to mention, this would have been the first weekend in the house that I'm super excited to be BUYING - and I wanted to enjoy it with the person I love. Instead, I'm feel like I'm getting totally screwed. It doesn't help that the next two weekends in June, and the first three weekends in July we are going to do family stuff with his family, and I feel like my entire summer is already revolving around them, and I just don't get why he doesn't tell his sister ""sorry but I can't leave my girlfriend alone to move."" I tried to explain to him why this is hurting my feelings, but I don't think he understands that (in my opinion) he should be telling his sister to figure out her shit with the three people she ALREADY has helping her, instead of leaving me in a lurch. I just got on his case about it and told him that something was going to have to give - mostly, that I was going to have to skip this wedding we were supposed to go to the weekend of the 15th, that he should skip the drum corps thing, and he should REALLY CONSIDER telling his sister he can't help her out. He is pulling the ""I agreed to all of this before you started buying a house"" but like... again, this seems to me to be more important just from a life standpoint (and for our relationship since I'm moving in part to be closer to him) than him moving his sister out of her apartment. And it's not like she's being left completely alone - she still has THREE OTHER PEOPLE HELPING HER. AMITA?

&#x200B;

bxw0a9	2019-06-07 15:34:39		AITA for not telling a guy right away that I’m not interested?	"I’m a single mom of two boys. A 6/10 on a good day, so I’m not used to male attention. I also really enjoy conversations with anyone. 

At a baseball game three nights ago, a single dad of a player on my oldest son’s team (the son is also a student in the building I work in) struck up a conversation with me. The other moms I normally sit with were at other events, so I was by myself, which allowed for lots of talk between us. We found out we knew a lot of people in common, and chatted pretty much the entire game (90 minutes). Later that night, he friended me on Facebook. 

The next morning he messaged me asking about my son (he has autism) and his upcoming birthday party. We messaged back and forth for two days, but it was, what I thought, platonic. Discussed kids, being single parents, and the like. Nothing came up about relationships or anything beyond what we had in common. I truly enjoyed getting to know him. 

Last night, we had another game. He put his chair close to mine. Not a big deal, like i said, I enjoy talking with the parents, and I’m not sure this dad knows many of the parents there. We talked off and on throughout the game, while I talked with some of the other parents close by. 

He is taking an interest in my son, which I appreciate. He doesn’t have many positive male role models. He is encouraging his son and my son to be friends. He cheers my son on and gives him advice. All of this is great. In the back of my mind, I start to think he is interested in me. 

After last night’s game, I got a message from him confirming my suspicions. He is interested, finds me attractive... 

I messaged him immediately and explained that at this time I wasn’t interested in a relationship with him since his son goes to the school I teach at. At first he seemed fine,  but then he let me know he was disappointed and that he thought we’d be a good match, but then said he didn’t think he was my type anyway. I reached out again this morning to apologize, but I haven’t heard back. 

I can’t help but feel like I led him on by engaging in the back and forth messaging. I don’t believe I should have to broadcast my interests from the get go, and I also shouldn’t assume any male interest is romantic. So, AITA for not being upfront about this?"	No A-holes here	1	0

bxvyzx	2019-06-07 15:31:44		WIBTA if I didn’t go to the zoo with my family	"So I (18M) have been house sitting for a family friend for a week. I have seen my parents once and while I have been enjoying my space and freedom, it has bothered my parents (I have no idea how they’ll take it when I move out lol).

So today I am finally going home and they are pretty happy about that. Since I’ve been gone, they have kinda kept me out of the loop about what’s going on at home. And this morning they told me that we are all going to the zoo tomorrow. The problem with this is that I already had plans with my boyfriend to go to a little festival that our downtown area holds. The festival is only here for a few days and we already missed it last year. 

Normally I would not see myself as the asshole but since my family has missed me I wonder if I would be for declining. I have asked them if my boyfriend could tag along with us (he would pay for himself) and my sister is being nasty about it. My parents have yet to say anything. 

So WIBTA if I said no to going to the zoo with my family if they don’t let my boyfriend come? 

Side note: normally my family plans these things out at least a week before it happens. And the way my mom worded the text, they already talked about the plans without telling me about it. I would 100% go if I had been told about these plans prior to making my own plans, and my and my bf would have picked another day to do it (we can’t change the day now because he has other plans of his own)"	No A-holes here	1	0
bxvy95	2019-06-07 15:30:05	LJBoweb	AITA for not wanting to air dirty laundry?	"So, I have been with my partner for some time and things are great majority of the time. As with all couples, we have minor arguments and sometimes even major, but nothing we can’t get over and work together to overcome. 

Since we have been together and it comes to our little squabbles, my partner has always turned to her friends/family and asked for advice on how to resolve issues. She would ask if either of us are over reacting, or if she/I am reading too much into a certain subject and unnecessarily starting the conflict. This has been going on since we have been together, and she would always tell me that she had told said friends/family and almost use that to back up her point.

&#x200B;

Now this gripes me for two reasons; 

1)	We can all say some things that we don’t mean in heated situations, of which I am under no illusion that I am in full control of my emotions and don’t ever say anything I don’t mean, I am only Human. But for this to be shown/told to her family and friends I think is unfair on who I am as a person, as 99% of the time I show nothing but love and affection to her and do not want anyone seeing my ugly side when im emotional.

2)	Sometimes it gets me that it takes the word of her friend or family member to make her see sense rather than me. Now I get during an argument that I am the last person she is going to admit that she is wrong to, but she refuses to let the argument go for an hour, both of us cool off and come back and work through it like adults.

&#x200B;

Bonus Note: We recently went on a night out with some of my friends, which she is friendly with and loves them all as much as they love her. Unfortunately, due to self esteem issues, she did not enjoy the night out because she didn’t like the way she looked, and she felt uncomfortable, which is ridiculous because she wipes the floor with my female friends in terms of looks. I then spoke to my friend who said that my partner said she ‘felt left out'. I asked my partner and her reaction was very surprising. She got very wound up that me and my friends were ‘talking about her’ and how now she’s going to feel uncomfortable because my friends would tip toe around her. I explained that my friend pulled me to the side and asked me this and she had not had a conversation with anyone else about it, she was just caring about my partners wellbeing. I also thought, how is that any different to her telling her friends and family about every argument we have? The only difference is that me and my friend were talking about her in a positive way and discussing if she was okay.

&#x200B;

I’ve tried talking to my partner and she has put a wall up and said ‘this is how I deal with things’ which I’ve replied explaining that’s fine and I’ll start doing the same – which from the Bonus Note, I know would get to her.

I had never used dating apps before, in fact this was the first guy that I matched with. Thing is, he seemed perfect. He started acting all committed right off the bat and even made plenty of jokes implying that he was 100% serious and said things like “if we get married” and “how will you tell your parents how we met” and “at what point will you tell your parents about us.” Looking back I was horribly naive, not only because I settled for literally the FIRST guy I matched with but for believing his BS. 

We talked for a month and a half, but still had not met in person yet. We talked on the phone a couple of times, snapped back and forth, texted late into the night? and he continued to drop hints about how serious he was. It got to the point where I didn’t admit he was my “boyfriend” but I would say that were a thing. My naivety and innocence aside, he gave every indication that he wanted whatever we had to escalate also through sexual advances. (We never had sex and never met in person.)

One day however I noticed he was still active on the dating app we met on. Continuing my stupidity, I stopped swiping and didn’t match with anyone else. I texted him saying “soo how many girls are you talking to” and he suddenly got extremely defensive, and commitment act suddenly disappeared. He said he wasn’t dating anyone and I had no right to ask him that. Then he acted like I was some psychotic girlfriend when really I just didn’t understand where we stood and he never bothered to clarify that before. I wasn’t being hostile when I texted him that, I was trying to clarify what our “relationship” truly was and he decided to get all defensive. 

Now, my response to his defensiveness became rude as well and that might have made it difficult for him to understand that I was clarifying, not confronting. I hate how he made me seem psychotic for wondering and it makes me nervous to use dating apps again because now I get anxiety about seeming that way again. 

I started to think I really was in the wrong for asking him that because yes, I was jealous. It didn’t feel fair that he was clearly talking to other girls and I wasn’t looking for anyone anymore. But we never clarified that. And I was seriously misled by all the long-term bullshit he said to me about marriage and what we would do months from then. I was stupid and so new to dating that I genuinely didn’t see through the bullshit. 

tl;dr: AITA for getting jealous over a guy I was talking to even though we weren’t really dating but he made it seem like we would eventually?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

I'm talking at least 6-8 such texts every day. 

He's a sweet guy and doesn't get offended if I don't respond to him, but I feel obliged to because whenever I ask him for help, he does it. And it's not like I haven't taken advantage of his ready availability before - he has been a helpful friend. But the texts keep pouring in and I get so overwhelmed.

"So, for a little bit of context, GF is 20 with limited drug experiences, she’s only ever smoked weed, and was interested in picking up a tab or two for her first music festival.

 I was not going to be with her, and I knew the group she was going with wasn’t the best crowd. I also know this festival is huge, and having my 5’5” 110 lb girlfriend walking around, high out of her mind, in ~* festival clothes * ~ (some daisy dukes and a tube top) just sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.  Also, she has a HUGE fear of touching men, so I don’t know why she doesn’t think she’d bump into guys at a music festival of all places? 

I expressed these to her, and she got incredibly defensive, saying that music festivals were ‘a place of love and acceptance’, and assuring me that nothing would happen to her. We got into a huge blowout, which ended in her accusing me of trying to control her life when I can’t be there.

So, AITA for not wanting my girl to trip for the first time at this music festival?

Edit for clarification: we are both girls, and it is not that I’m worried that she will cheat on me, more so that other people may take advantage of her in this mindset.

Edit 2: Thank you guys for all the suggestions, we agreed to talk about it after work. I have done acid a handful of times before, and I think I’m just going to suggest we do it together before she goes to see how she likes it. Thank you again!"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxvuxe	2019-06-07 15:21:54		WIBTA if I tell my sister that I'm tired of her crying to me about her terrible relationships?	"My older sister has a long history of terrible, toxic relationships. No matter which guy she's dating, there's somehow an argument with the two of them every single day. It's gotten past the innocent family denial of ""Oh, she must have terrible taste"" to just thinking ""There must be something wrong with her if every single one of her relationships goes this sour this quickly"". And almost every one of their arguments, without fail, she'll call me crying, asking me to pay for her to get a taxi/Uber to my place or something like that. It's gotten extremely tiring, and it really doesn't help that she loves to make these calls at 1-3am in the morning (just got off the phone to her at 1:00am AEST). 

And before y'all ask, I've talked to her about her relationships many times. I always let her know that she's in a toxic, unhealthy situation, and that she needs to get out of it ASAP or at the very least work on fixing it together. I always give her whatever helpful advice I think she could make use of or maybe a pointer here and there to better handle the situation. I always try to calm her down and get her head bent around the right way if I think she's overblowing something as well. I've been the kind, secure friend, and I've been the angry, fed up with this bullshit friend...but absolutely none of it has any effect whatsoever besides her just getting mad at me and saying ""she doesn't care what I think"" or that ""it's not my business"". I just feel like screaming in her face for a moment ""It really is my business because you bring me into it 24/fucking 7 expecting me to help you out with it at every turn of my life"". Even through all of it, I've never outright told her to stop ringing me and to deal with it herself before, but lately, I've really, really been considering it. The only thing that's holding me back is guilt...like I feel like I shouldn't do it, but I just get extremely emotionally drained everytime she talks to me about this stuff nowadays.

bxvuj0	2019-06-07 15:20:58		AITAH for being angry at my parents’ favouritism even tho I’m a grown ass woman?	"Background: I’m the youngest of 3 girls (women). My childhood was not the greatest as my mum has a spiteful streak and a nasty temper. I made excuses for her as I reached adulthood because she had various medical conditions which may have impacted on her mental health. She has never acknowledged or apologised for her behaviour tho. I doubt that will ever happen. I’m 38 now. 

My teenage years became complicated by the fact that my parents set up a home for people with learning disabilities. Whilst that sounds great, the problem for me was that this was in our family home. No separate living room or bathroom. I was a teenage girl living with adults who were not my family members and who needed special care. One was the wife of a paedophilic monster. My mum gave me antibacterial spray for the toilet seat, just in case.

Anyway, the living situation was unbearable and I left home at 18. I did move back for a short period but, by that time, my parents had started using my room for their business and filled it with a resident. I did have a mobile home I could live in but it was freezing in the winter.  I finally left home and moved to a new city.

Cut to today, my elder sisters now work as part of the ‘business’. My eldest sister never had to live in the house when it was a business because she moved out before it all started.

Even tho I now work with vulnerable people, and I enjoy it, I don’t feel I can be part of the business because the memories from it as a teenager make it impossible. 

I found out last year that my parents are give my sisters £5k per year as a bonus from the business. My mum has constantly complained to me that they do no work. I also found out today that they are paying for my eldest sister’s family to go to Florida. We are in the UK so you get an idea of costs. 

My sisters both work part time and are paid a full time wage on top of all the other benefits they receive. I have been working full time since I was 19 in low paid jobs. I couldn’t stay at home and go to university and so I’ve only now managed to complete my qualifications. 

When my sisters tell me about what they have, it just hurts. My parents know I don’t have loads of money and it all just feels spiteful. I don’t know why they can’t just share the wealth around a bit. I constantly feel as tho my achievements are not worth the ‘rewards’ that my sisters have. 

At least if the judgment is that I am, in fact, the asshole that might give me a reality check tho and make me feel better about it all.

Recently, she started dating a guy who used to go to my high school and was a complete dick to me. He was kicked out for dealing heroine and weed in high school and continued to do so after.

I kinda thought it would be a job interview - I'd talk to the mom, meet the kids, and talk about future arrangements, you know. As it turned out, however, she wanted me to get to work on the spot. Honestly, that made a lot of sense. What better way to see if the babysitter is compatible with the kids, right? I was shown around the house and then asked to entertain little Peter (who is adorable, by the way). I spent a few hours at their place, and while the mom was obviously around (this being the first time and all), I did almost everything a babysitter is supposed to do. I had a lot of fun, little Peter seemed to like me, mom was very satisfied. She offered $5/hour, which seemed fair (for comparison, that's what you would earn here as a shop assistant or a waiter too, it's good pocket money).  


Now, I was already preparing to leave when the lady told me something about not paying full price for today as this was ""just a training session"". I shrugged it off and thought it was cool, I wouldn't have asked for full price either. It was upon saying goodbye that I realized she wasn't going to pay me AT ALL.  


See, here's my problem with that: I understand that this was my first time there, that she wasn't completely free to do whatever she wanted, and that this was basically to see if little Peter and I would be able to hit it off. But I still spent a lot of time and effort doing what I will normally be doing in the future. It's like not getting paid for your first day because you're still new? It wasn't even like I had to be supervised every second: I was looking after and playing with her kid while she was doing housework and chatting with friends. Plus, she never told me anything about not getting paid. Honestly, I would have been okay with a free first session if she had been upfront about it. But now I feel a little scammed - scammed out of 10 dollars, might not even worth the disappointment though.

I supported her and told her I was happy for her. They got engaged.  She was talking about how I better not miss her wedding, etc. 

10 months before her wedding, my dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She knew about it and never said anything. I messaged her and told her I was disappointed that she never acknowledged it. She immediately responded and apologized and told her she was busy and that she didn’t want to lose me as a friend. It took me a couple weeks to respond to her because I was upset, but I did eventually and we talked again. So things were fine or so I thought. She continued never mentioned getting married once. 

Then one day, our mutual friend (who lived in a different country and would have never been invited) messaged me and said “omg, did you see (friends) wedding pictures on Facebook!”  I said huh I don’t remember seeing it. So I go to my friends profile, and I eventually discover she is hiding her tagged photos from me, so I can’t see her wedding photos she was tagged in, and I’m on a limited profile. 

I was shocked. At this point, we were friends for 6 years. Never had a big fallout fight or anything. She always talked about how I was going to be invited. Even her other friends were invited, so it was not as if it was a small family only wedding.  

I was angry and I messaged her a long message saying how upset I was she hid the wedding from me and made it so I couldn’t see her pics. I asked her why did you do this to me? I thought we were friends. I feel like you’ve intentionally hid a big part of your life and you weren’t honest. I was never insulting or cussed at her, I was just hurt.

She never responded (she saw it) and after a couple days I blocked her on social media and never spoke to her again. 

However sometimes I wonder if I overreacted. I was really hurt by what she did, but I don’t know if I was right to lash out. Was I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxvs4s	2019-06-07 15:15:19	techieforgetti	WIBTA if I lie about my salary to my family?	"Tl;dr at the bottom

I’m in college, and I’m studying software engineering. I’m working an internship with a company that I’ve worked with before, and (since I’m almost done with my degree) there has been hinting at an employment offer when I finish. This particular employer sources a lot of talent from my school and is known to grant payment in excess of six figures. My resume is pretty awesome, so I intended to also apply to other places, but I still live with my mother, my grandfather, and younger brother. Any time I have ever gotten a job, I’m always hounded about how much I make. Then, my mother used that as a reason not to pay for my food, or clothes, and even requested that I pay for my place on family vacations. Now that I’m 21, she’s said that she wants to buy a bigger house for “our family” plus her boyfriend and since my credit is great, she has asked me to co-sign the mortgage! She rarely paid the prior one on time. All the meanwhile, he boyfriend pays ZILCH for anything in the house and she takes full care of him. When I asked why, she said it was because since I’ll have a “fancy computer job” soon and don’t plan on having children, she wants me to really start contributing by paying 100% for everything in my life incl. insurance, AND pay on utilities, mortgage, grocery, and any surprise expenses like car maintenance or home improvement. But I’m in serious student loan debt because she insisted she’d pay for my college but didn’t so I didn’t have a chance to save beforehand, and I want to pay all that off and then move out because I get no privacy at all, am not allowed to have a lock on my door, and don’t even get privacy in the bathroom as my sister will barge in (for example) to use the restroom when I’m in the shower. When I make a call or text, my mother and grandpa will demand to know to whom, and all my free time is taken because my mother will go out and demand I stay to provide care for my grandfather. And with grocery, they’ve never purchased any of the things I like, and eat it and complain that they don’t like it as much as their option of choice if I buy it for myself. 
One of the few at-home joys I have is making video game environments with UE4. I’ve gotten pretty good at it too.
So, it’s Me versus Mom. Would I be the asshole if I lied to my family and claim I took a job I loved as a game dev for a pittance so I can dodge paying for my mother’s whole household and secretly spend the bulk of my money at a different high paying job to pay off my huge loans early and move out?

Tl;dr: I’m going to make a pretty nice salary straight out of college and want to pay off my loans and move out of my mom’s house. My mom would obstruct that goal because she thinks I should pay for most of the household since I plan on being child and husband free. The household sucks for me. WIBTA if I misrepresent my career and earnings by over -75%?

bxvqsv	2019-06-07 15:12:03		AITA for leaving my boyfriend?	"My boyfriend(now ex) we had been together for two years, and even lived together for a good year and a half. He broke up with me and we lost the apartment, moved back with our parents then got back together when he wanted. 

I’m totally in love with him and it just seemed he was only used to me. (I’m his first relationship and took his virginity) Well, he stopped putting effort into our relationship and just said “before college starts I want to focus on myself.” 

But to me that doesn’t make sense? If you want to focus on yourself and do things for yourself then you shouldn’t be with me.  He doesn’t want to focus on me and doesn’t want to see me more than once a week but doesn’t want to breakup. I realized over the past two months we had nothing in common anymore, we didn’t know how to spend time with each other without having sex and we are literally complete opposites. So I left him yesterday. I broke up with him over text because I begged him to come visit me after work so we could talk it out but he just said I can’t. I can’t. I have plans with my friends but Sunday we can. He never made time for me ever no matter how important it was. Wtf. So here’s my first question AITA for leaving him over text? All he said to my breakup text was alright. 

I described my Facebook and told him if he wants to fight for me he can text me. Well he left some of my stuff on my porch so I’m assuming that’s him saying no. But I know him too well, he wants me to come back to him. I know he will want me to text him and he will blame me later. So my second question AITA for not wanting to go back? 

Sorry for the long post. But my last question is, I am a relationship person. I’m ready to start a family but he wasn’t. AITA for not wanting to wait a few months to start dating? I feel ready because I’ve felt so held back for so long. I ask this because when he starts talking to me again (because he will) then he will throw all of this in my face."		1	0

bxvnh8	2019-06-07 15:04:10	TacitPoseidon	AITA For refusing to see a therapist?	"I've recently been thinking about something that happened a few years ago. For context: I was already seeing both a psychiatrist and a therapist to help me with my problems, and I was a minor.

During one of my sessions my psychiatrist suggested a different form of therapy. Basically the general idea is that I would sign up for a program that would send a therapist to my home and have the appointment there in a more relaxed manner where it would be easier for me to open up. That didn't seem like something that I would be interested in. I was already seeing two professionals and now I would have to see a third? But my parents were, so they signed me up despite my protests. I told them that I didn't want it and that I thought it would be a waste of time and money.

I remember that before and after he signed me up I had told my father many times that I wouldn't be home if anyone from that program showed up. We lived in an apartment and the doorman had to announce anyone that came, wich allowed me to sneak out through the kitchen door.

The day for my first session arrived and my parents were there to discuss my case with the new therapist and me. I should note that I live in São Paulo, there are smaller towns around the city where people usually take a long commute from, this particular therapist included. As I had previously claimed, I snuck out when she arrived.

When I returned my parents said that she would not return. Spoiler alert: They lied. She came back the next week and this time I wasn't able to sneak out.

This time my parents weren't home. I told her that she was wasting her time and that I was sorry that she came all this way for nothing, but she still decided to try to talk to me. I spent the next hour ignoring her and playing games on the computer. When she left she said she was going to talk to my parents to see what they wanted to do, but that she would recomend giving up on this whole thing.

Was I the asshole for wasting people's time and money?


EDIT: This thread already seems to have died down, but in the off chance that you've found this post now here are somethings that I failed to mention

1. I am still going therapy. I have been going for eight years now and it has helped me a lot.
2. This happened five years ago.
3. I am 21. This happened when I was 16.
4. I am now paying for my sessions. My psychiatrist and my therapist are still the same people from 5 years ago."	Asshole	0	0

bxvj3q	2019-06-07 14:53:47	Wenge03	AITA for thinking my ex-bandmates are arseholes after 15 years and not wanting anything to do with them even on Social Media?	"Right years ago we started a highschool band that went on post high school and into our 20's most of my teenage life was in the company of 3 of them . By the end we weren't bad, maybe not the next Metallica but had a bit of a following and had been offered better gigs in the kinds of places bands get picked up for recording deals and we were getting asked unlike others we knew who could only get 'Pay to Play' . It all happened years ago , before everyone had a mobile phone, but I only found stuff out more recently, some of it from the horse's mouth, some from other people and some from seeing Social media stuff  had tagged the others in in reminiscing over the 'good old days'.

&#x200B;

Short very edited version leaving out loads of tiny niggly things and more personal bits and pieces like getting cocked blocked by one because the other was after the same girl.

&#x200B;

It came to an end with one leaving because of life and adulting and because 2 of them (Best mates Bert & Ernie) refused to play places that served drink and two of us wanting to move on from Youth clubs and under 18 events. Being 20+ playing to 14 and 15 years olds in a community hall isn't really the height of rockstardom after all. It wasn't some sort of Anti-Drink thing it was more a 'those kinds of people' snobbery thing. They even turned down good gigs without discussing them with the rest of us despite it supposedly being a ""democracy"". But they both went on to join/start bands that played the very same places. Only instead of being a covers moving to originals band playing the good slots at the weekend they played, what I would call, one up from an iPod and playlist just so the venue can say they have live music every Wednesday night . You know those mid-week times when it's quiet or the times of the month no one is out because they are skint awaiting their next paypacket and they are trying to attract punters but not spend money on a proper headline act.

&#x200B;

This I didn't find out until about 15 years later despite regularly speaking to Bert . One of our bigger 'fans' hounded Bert & Ernie until they relented to put on a 'reunion ' gig for them. It was some sort of celebration party. I didn't ask too many questions, it was fairly clear whilst they were reminiscing about the gig they forgot they pulled a Van Halen and left one of the original members out of the line up. One of the other guys even had that 'Oh fuck would you shut up, stop digging the hole' embarrassed look. Made worse by the fact I had been in regular contact with Bert, he'd been to my house me to his we'd met up in town text etc and nothing was ever mentioned. Even though he knew I was keen to do something even if was just to rent a hall and jam some old tunes with pizza and beers. This went beyond just having a ringer for a 1 night get together for some fun. It was new tunes and rehearsals were in there too. That must have just slipped his mind anytime we talked for 15 years."

bxvip3	2019-06-07 14:52:40	longinglotus	AITA Friend blew me off (yet again) after planning this for weeks	So my(18f)  friend(17f) recently got her first job, and the past couple of times (maybe around 5 or 6) we had plans to hang out, she cancels last minute because she picked up a shift, forgot we had plans, or overslept. Today we were supposed to go the Relay for Life together (this is my 9th year and would be her first). I borrowed my dads' tent and already had everything packed and ready to go, as we were supposed to go in a couple of hours. When she texted me about it I didn't flip out, I rationally explained to her that I'm disappointed but not surprised as this isn't the first time this has happened recently. She said she didn't have a choice which I replied with, it's not like they were going to fire you because you couldn't pick up an extra shift that wasn't yours to begin with, and she later agreed to this statement. She said I made her feel bad about the situation and she feels like a bad friend. I didn't say this to her, but lately, she's been acting like it. Am I the asshole in this situation?

bxvije	2019-06-07 14:52:13		AITA for distancing myself from my mentally ill mother?	"My parents divorced a few weeks ago. My mother is absolutely hysterical, doesn't want to do chores, makes us kids do everything, and I have to take care of her responsibilities as a mother. She keeps insisting that she's very depressed. Don't get me wrong, I believe her, but she absolutely REFUSES to listen to her therapist. She's basically every therapists worst nightmare. She keeps hyperventilating and then wondering why she can't walk, blaming it on her depression and drained body.

I have talked to her therapist and even she says she's very attention seeking, and if she would just stop hyperventilating and calm down she'd be fine. Nothings wrong with her.

I know this sounds very insensitive but I am 18 years old and I absolutely cannot handle her mental health issues. I basically put up a wall between us and ignore her whenever she's feeling ""bad"". I think it's her responsibility to seek help and go to a stationary clinic, because she needs it.  I, myself am mentally ill because of reasons not relevant now, and I simply don't have the ""capacity"" to grieve with her. I have an apprenticeship to finish which is very hard for me. So I am very occupied with work, school, my two siblings and maintaining my social life. A dramatic mother that makes my life hard doesn't help. That's why I have started to distance myself from her. I feel really bad because at the same time I feel like it's my responsibility as her daughter to be there for her 24/7 and listen to her whenever she needs it. What's your take on this?"

I at first was shocked and thought it was a joke but it was True. So after Months of trying to work the relationship and me finally moving from NJ to GA to be with her, I find out who the other (fat white guy) was ( I am also fat white guy) and she cut my off entirely.

The Dumb guy who wouldn't even talk to me so I can tell him the story IDK if he married her but she won't come back to US. She also can't bring her father and two step sister to US.

My friend, EC, grew up in a really bad home and I did all I could to support her through it. I gave a lot to her over the years - money, items and time. I was there for her always. This was definitely not reciprocal. I have gotten angry with her at times throughout our relationship because she couldn't be bothered to show up for things, would flake out on me, became difficult to get ahold of her, etc. I have put aside my feelings many times to continue the friendship.

I moved out of town for a few years and when I came back recently, I needed a job. Before I moved back she promised me a job, as she recently became manager of a business. She is actually buying the business later in the year. A few days after one training shift she texted me saying it wasn't going to work out, saying I was dealing with a lot right now and it would be better for our relationship if we put the job on hold for now. I texted her back saying I was disappointed and that she was putting me in a bad place, I needed that job and I could have been looking for one before I moved. She didn't respond at all, for over a week. 

So I blocked her number, social medias, etc and I've decided I'm done with her and her behaviour. Should I reconsider what I've done? She was actually one of my only friends and it hurts me to leave the friendship behind, but  I feel like I can't deal with it anymore.

bxvgll	2019-06-07 14:47:14		AITA for cutting off a guy friend that hasn’t taken the hint?	"I (21F) first matched on with this guy on tinder and he (22F) kind of seemed cool. So naturally, we planned to hang out and possibly hook up. However, as time progressed and the more I talked to him, the attraction increasingly began to die down and I only see him as a friend. 

He has said some very stupid things and has this superiority complex. He often just doesn’t make sense, but I kind of ignored it and gave him a chance as a friend because he was going through some stuff and I’m hoping that my friends would also give me a pass on acting stupid, since everyone does it from time to time. 

He, however has just become incredibly annoying. The other night, I invited him over to my house to just chill. We kind of watched TV but we were mostly talking. Of course as friends, we confided in one another about all sorts of things, sexual encounters and whatnot. I don’t mind hearing about that stuff, as a matter of fact, I give him advice too. 

The next day, we plan to hang out again and just chill, because we’re friends. But he keeps talking about having sex with me, even though I’ve told him before that I am not attracted to him and that it’s just not gonna happen bc he’s my friend. He goes into some tirade about how I’m boring and not grown up because I don’t want a “friend with benefits”. He has mocked me before for this; I can’t help that I want something serious. He keeps asking if we can have sex and I literally say no like a few times. He then says some bullshit about how I wouldn’t know that I was attracted to him until I had sex with him....wtf. And then he suggested that he just gives me head when we hang out and that I should just determine whether or not I’m attracted to him based on whether or not I get sexual feelings from it. This made me very uncomfortable and I told him that, but he said that it would be like “science” and that we have to conduct an “experiment” before we can conclude that I’m not into him....wtf. 

I explain to him again that I just don’t find him attractive and that I can’t help who I am or am not attracted to. He gets mad and is like “okay fine then we can only be friends if you don’t talk about the guys you fuck”. I honestly was just so done at that point. 

I feel like an idiot because we’ve been through this before, like two times. And I briefly cut him off because he sent me this really disgusting porn gif on Snapchat and I wanted to yak. But then I decided to give him a chance because he seemed to understand and I thought maybe I was overreacting. 

But I just blocked him on everything and just cut it off because I am honestly not trying to do this anymore. AITA?"		1	0

My wife and I met online. I was actually depressed back then because I broke up with my girlfriend and I tried to score dates just to have some company. So I was matched with my wife.

I thanked my lucky stars. And here we are, married. BIL and I were laughing. At this point, my wife started crying. Later, my SIL calls me and tells me that I'm really insensitive.

A few months ago I found someone on Reddit (how original) who became a very precious and important friend of mine. We were talking almost daily even if we were busy most of the time and I'm very thankful for all the time we spend chatting. In the past few weeks, we had our own problems and didn't speak that much, but I always tried to keep contact but recently they stopped talking with me and doesn't show online in their social medias.

At first, I don't think they ghosted me since we were doing pretty good and I'm aware that they can be very busy and don't reply immediately, but I've seen a few things that indicates that they want to forget everything and move on (sorry for not being able to give more detais, I don't wanna expose them). Since I didn't do something bad (otherwise they wound've told me) I don't understand why they are doing this to me but it's their choice, and I respect that.

Now here comes the problem: I want to say a last goodbye to them. I hate to see things going like that but for the last time, I want to thank them for everything, they helped me so much in this time (when I was in my worst state they were there for me) and for all the time they spared for me, I want to end it all in good terms but if they don't wanna talk with me anymore, I can't do it. Part of me thinks I'm being selfish for requesting they attention (since they are ignoring me already), and that makes me feel guilty and sad, also I don't wanna to spam their social medias with wall of texts saying what I feel because I think this could be harassment, I want to have one last chat but another part of me don't wanna let things end like it since they mean so much for me and we also shared a lot of things about ourselves (and they said they had feelings for me, if that matters).

So I going to ask you: AITA for wanting to say goodbye for the last time, in a proper way, even if they don't want to know?

&#x200B;

Edit: I don't know if I should add this edit, but I wanna thank everyone who spared their time to read my post, thank you very much. I also didn't expect I'd say this, but there is actually an update: They spoke with me and they said how they simply don't feel like chatting with me at all (I'm glad I never pushed them) and how they were dating these last weeks (which explains a lot). I said it was all okay, I never demanded they to talk with me and I want to apologize but they left me on read. Not the outcome I expected, but they were fine (I think they lied, tbh) and reading that made me feel better (well, kinda). I'll make sure to find external help now. And again, thank you all."

bxv3wh	2019-06-07 14:14:56		AITA for wanting my father to apologize to me?	"my father and me don’t get along very well. the biggest problem is that i can’t trust him. we haven’t talked about what’s going on in each other’s lives for maybe three years now. 
anyways the thing is, that he was really nice to me since the last two months. i started to laugh with him, it was nice to have a dad. kinda. i borrowed his camera to film a youtube video (a speed drawing to be exact) and posted it shortly after. gave him back his camera, everything was fine. then, two weeks ago he asked me if he could see the video too, if i could send him a link. i was scared, because i know how my father is but eventually i gave in and sent him a link. i told him to keep it a secret and that this was really dear to me.
he subscribed. i didn’t know what to do. i immediately had an anxiety attack. (you need to know that my father has control over everything in my life. social media is the only place where i can express myself. i was terrified to see him subscribed to my channel, because i think that he’ll start ruining this part of my life now too) i told him to unsubscribe, he lied to me and said he did, but still saw him on my list of subscribers.
a few days ago, one of his friends subscribed. again, my heart stopped and i told him that i wasn’t ok with him showing the video to his friends. 
(note: my father and his friends are really right winged and conservative and i plan on posting videos about the lgbt community, because i’m part of it. my father is abusive and i am scared, that he’ll start making comments about the videos or punish me.)
my father refuses his friend to unsubscribe and i don’t know what to do. he says that i’m stupid for not letting him and his friends watch the videos and that i should apologize instead. they all said that they liked them and that i should be proud, but i’m just not comfortable.
i thought about creating a new channel and i’ll probably take down the videos.
am i really the asshole in this situation?"		1	0
bxv3q7	2019-06-07 14:14:28	jamiebrickwall	AITA for refusing to pay for a case of beer and calling the cops	"This happened a while ago (about 3 months) but thought I may as well post it here.

So its my friends birthday, and we're having a surprise party for him (although thats somewhat irrelevant to the story). We go out for a coffee, to get him out of the house, and on the way back I decide I'll buy him a pack of beer for his birthday, so we walk into a local corner store to pick him out a case. He grabs whatever and we go to stand in line. While in line, the bottom of the case breaks, and some of the beers fall out. The case did not break because of anything my friend had done. It clearly had gotten wet (it was made of cardboard) , or something had happened during transport, and it simply broke while my friend had been standing still in line. In my mind, that’s a cost you absorb as a storeowner. 

Now when we get to the cash, the cashier tells us we are going to pay for the case that broke. Now, this seems wrong as we didn't do anything to break the case, and there was no possible way to avoid it. It wasn't our fault the product was faulty. Now I'm not a very confrontational person in most circumstances, so normally I would have offered to pay half, or just paid full or whatever, but my friend was having none of it. The cash calls her manager, and this becomes important later, the manager is huge. I'm a pretty big guy, but this guy was probably 6'6 and 330lbs. He starts trying to get us to pay.. So we're arguing with the manager for a bit, and he threatens to call the police multiple times. My friend has had enough (its still his birthday lol) and just wants to say fuck it and leave. Now when we try to leave this guy refuses to let us go. He stands in front of the only exit in the store and will not allow us out of the building. He is now illegally detaining us. Now at this point we're both pissed, and my phone is blowing up because we're like 30 minutes late for his party, and I don't see any way out of this, so I decide to call the police cause I'd rather them get the call from me. At somepoint while waiting for them to come, another customer in the store called us assholes because its just $8 and who cares we should stop bullying the poor manager. Throughout this entire ordeal, he claims to have security cameras that will show my friend knocked into something or was swinging the case around.

Anyways, the police arrive, and no security feed is available and the police decide that we were not at fault, and say they are going to let him off with a warning for detaining us 

Anyways, I'm never going back into that store, but I can't tell if we handled the situation poorly or not.

TLDR: AITA for refusing to pay for a case of beer that broke because it was in faulty packaging, and making the store owner take the hit."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxv3ps	2019-06-07 14:14:26	thrownay444	WIBTA for not wishing him good luck for his exams?	"Okay, so I am really confused.

This guy and I met at work last year. We both are more on the introvert side. He's 4 years elder to me. We're both in our 20s.

So after I left that place, we started texting each other more often. This started in last September-October. There would be a little bit of flirting every now and then, but we mostly talked about what was going on in our lives etc. We have hung out together 2-3 times, for movies and coffee (just as friends), but he knows that my feelings for him are quite strong.

The longest we had gone without texting was 10 days until this April, when things got out of hand. One night he was texting me and we randomly started discussing about sexual stuff, something we had never talked about before. I told him that my feelings for him were very strong and he said he felt the same way about me. Said that he wants to make memories with me, even though we don't have a future together. I agreed with him and for the next two weeks we were acting like a couple who is so in love . But then after 2 weeks of this high, he raised concerns over the fact if we were doing this just for fun, to relieve ourselves off of stress , since we both had major exams coming up in a few weeks and were stressed out.

I told him that I genuinely wanted this (whatever we had going on) and that it hurts that he thinks we cannot be together. He then again made it clear to me that even though he likes me a lot , our career paths will make it impossible to be together and that he doesn't believe in LDR. I got slightly aggressive and told him that people who want to make things work, make it work. I told him that he has hurt me by giving me mixed signals all along. After all of this, he started apologising to me. I felt bad for being angry and apologised back to him for being aggressive. The next day he told me that we should not think about what happened between us and just study well. 

After that whole convo, we've barely texted each other (maybe 4-5 times in May and that too very formally). He initiated a few of them and some of them I did. I had also asked him to hang out a few times, just so that we could talk it out face to face and at least be friends, but that never ended up happening.

Now he has his exams going on (he's a surgical resident and these are his finals) and I know it's stressful for him. 
We haven't spoken in weeks and my ego is stopping me from wishing him because he didn't wish me luck for my exam which was a week back and quite a major one.

Would I be the asshole for not wishing him luck for these exams? I keep feeling guilty about it.

Thank you in advance for the responses."	No A-holes here	0	0

bxv31t	2019-06-07 14:12:38	pingerpingu_kinguin	AITA for giving a group member no marks in a group assignment?	"As most of you know, working with other people in group/team environments can be difficult, especially when one person slacks off and does not contribute.

A fellow group member of mine contributed no work to a ~150 page report and as a consequence will receive 0 marks. I would like to specifically emphasis, they contributed **no work at all**.  Tasks were delegated voluntarily at first and this individual said they would complete their task it in good time. But 4 weeks had elapsed since tasks were delegated with no signs of completed work. 2 days before the due date, they had nothing to show. So, upon discussion with the rest of the group, we (I brought the idea up) decided to exclude their name from the report as a contributing author since the report did not contain any of their work (since there was none to include). 

We did notify them before we submitted it, to their disappointment they disagreed with this decision and is threatening to speak to our course lecturer. It must be mentioned that they acknowledged the majority of the work was completed by the other group members, but is disputing receiving 0 marks and would rather a small portion (not a passing grade, but ”20%”) since he ""attended a few meetings"" and ""spent time working on the tasks"". Their reasons for not providing the work on time include having work (as in a part time job), being sick (to which they told us 3 days before the due date and with no proof like a doctor's certificate) and blaming other members for completing their work before he was able to.

For clarification of the last excuse, we (all other group members) asked him, every Friday (for the 4 weeks) if they needed assistance with their work to which they declined offers for help and told the group they would complete it shortly (within the following week for example). 

The way i see the situation is, this individual was given more than adequate time to complete their work, with offers of help which were declined. We (the other group members) were under the impression they had it under control, but as the deadline approached (last week), we wanted to protect ourselves and so completed their work so we could continue writing the report. 

Since I originally brought up the idea of excluding their name from the report and them now receiving 0 marks as a result, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxv2bc	2019-06-07 14:11:00	TaylorTreethorn	AITA for wanting to know to move on?	"I met this girl at the beginning of the school year. She was beautiful, smart, funny, and just all around good to be around. The last 2 weeks of school I asked her out on a date to see “Detective pikachu” and she said yes. Later that week, she said something came up and she couldn’t make it, that she was sorry, and we could do it at another point in time. At this point I’m like, “Ok, things happen all the time.” But in my past I have had problems with female human beings in general. Come to find out that she started dating another person that weekend... but I didn’t know that until yesterday. The whole time, I think she is still into me, and I have a reason... She was allowing me to, I wasn’t being covert about my feelings or flirting and instead of telling me she was seeing someone else, she leaned into it. So I had no clue whatsoever about what is happening.
After finding out what was happening, I confronted her. I said, “After meditating for a while, I have some things I need to say... You should have said something. For the past two weeks I have been feeling emotions that aren’t reciprocated in any way, shape, or form. You had ample opportunities to tell me. Monday in class. Tuesday, while I walked you to your classes. Wednesday, when we were together for 70 minutes. And Friday, when I SAT DOWN NEXT TO YOU AND YOUR BOYFRIEND. You couldn’t have pulled me aside and told me?! Really?!”

bxv211	2019-06-07 14:10:14	Alien-girl-25	WIBTA if I warned a my co-worker about a guy she met on bumble?	"This is a throwaway bc I don’t want anyone who recognizes this post to be linked to my main account. So this all began about 8 years ago when I was 16/17 years old. I hung around with a group of childhood friends including my boyfriend, Joey, all of whom were about 3 or so years older than me. One of the guys in the group, Daniel, acted strangely towards me, he’d try to kiss me, he’d feel my breasts and he’d openly talk about my body. He also made comments such as ‘ everyone prefers me to you’ and ‘I could beat you up if I wanted to’,  among others.


All of this made me very uncomfortable but given the comments he made and the fact he was a big guy and I’m a 5’1 girl I thought it was best to get my boyfriend to talk to Daniel as I was scared of daniel and my boyfriend was closer to him than I was so I told my boyfriend what was going on and he brushed it off as it wasn’t a big deal as that was just his sense of humor and he was only joking around and to just ignore him. Daniel  was very popular and well liked with the guys and nothing like this had happened before so I just thought I was being dramatic. However over time this continued to happen and I told one of the other girls in the group what was going on and she confided in me that he had done the same to her. So she told all the guys what had happened and they were very upset as it came out he had tried this with some of their girlfriends so they all cut him off, one of the girls also told his girlfriend what had happened. 


I always felt bad about this because when he did act like this I never said no or stop or anything I just kinda tried to avoid him as I was afraid of what would happen if I did speak up because he seemed to imply something bad would happen through those little comments he made, though he was never violet and was probably all talk I just thought it was better not to take a chance, That was 8 years ago and I haven’t seen Daniel since.


Anyway 8 years later one of my coworkers who I’m very fond of asked me about Daniel as she matched with him on a bumble and noticed we had lots of mutual friends and I was wondering WIBTA if I told her about the incident because at the end of the day it was partly my fault for not being assertive enough and also it did happen 8 years ago and he’s now 27 and could be a completely different guy for all I know, but at the same time I do find his past behavior disturbing and he was technically cheating on his girlfriend and I don’t want to see that happen to my friend.

EDIT: thank you everyone for your advice, it was greatly appreciated and some of it was the eye opener I needed, I’ve taken all your advice on board and I decided to meet with my friend for lunch tomorrow and will tell her then."	Not the A-hole	0	0

One of my old friends was really close to one of the guys in my friend group and I thought of inviting him too, and I wasn't close to him for the past few years because he was pretty unpleasant imo but as long as he was near my house and close to the other guys in the group it would be cool.
We decided on watching the prestige (a film I and my ex friend had watched) and literally 20 minutes through the film the stupid guy goes (SPOILERS)
 ""you guys must be dumb to not understand that they both are twins""

Now, everyone hates spoilers in our group and I thought it would be best to tell him to leave since all he wanted to do was put a film of his choice.

bxv1ik	2019-06-07 14:08:57	Paydyas	AITA for not wanting to talk with my old friends?	2 years ago I was friends with 4 guys that I have met through my highschool friend. We went out couple times had some drinks they were decent. After time passed these guys wanted troll our class' WhatsApp group a group that we share homework and stuff a place that is quite formal. I rejected and I said no but they got themselves a invitation link anyway as soon as they joined I removed them after seconds they started says very very nasty things to me but the problem wasn't the nasty things they said. Because they were once in the group they had access to all of my classmates numbers this included my ex-crush. They created a different group and added all of them and then they posted all of our private conversations, everything. These conversations weren't about any of my classmates but they were about some NSFW content. Everyone saw them even my crush. The next morning I took this matter to our school administration and they contacted other schools (these guys are not from my school). Luckily my classmates didn't care about the messages too much and it was forgotten after a month. But to prevent this from happening ever again I cut them from my life and never talked to them ever again even when they wanted to apologise. Now 2 years have past and my friend who introduced them to me says I'm overreacting and I should talk to them again. AITA?	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxv0vk	2019-06-07 14:07:14	idkthrowaway876541	AITA for asking my boyfriend to collect unemployment?	"A little over three months ago, my boyfriend lost his job due to his company going out of business. He found out two weeks before he would no longer have a job. As store manager, he had closing responsibilities, so when he didn't start looking for a job right when he found out, I was okay with it. He said he would collect unemployment, so I wouldn't have to worry about him not having money. However, he never actually went in to the unemployment office to get his account set up so he could collect unemployment money. 

The first two months, he wasn't worried about looking for a job because he claimed he had always been able to find a job very quickly. I tried to tell him that that was when he was in lower positions, but now that he had become a manager, there were fewer roles available that would fit the pay he had become used to, and that his job search would not be as easy as he thought it would be. He has only started looking for a job these last six weeks (and he has had some interviews, and has more set up for next week). In this entire time, he has not gone to the unemployment office. 

I normally do not want to be a pushy girlfriend. However, he currently owes me just under $2000. Last year, he said that he would pay me back with money from his tax return. He didn't get as much back from this year's tax return, and had to use the tax return to pay his portion of the rent the last few months. He has now told me that he will not be able to pay this upcoming month's rent. 

My boyfriend had agreed that he would go to the unemployment office a couple of times, but he would make excuses as to why he wouldn't go. He said that he didn't want a government handout, which is why he wasn't going to the unemployment office. I explained that our taxes go into unemployment, so it isn't like it is a pure government handout. He had agreed that he would go in on Monday, but then apparently didn't have time. He didn't go on Tuesday, because he was told that the unemployment office is very busy on Tuesdays, and that Wednesday would be a better day. He didn't go Wednesday, but said he would go on Thursday after he had a phone interview. He didn't go Thursday (yesterday), and when I asked him why he didn't go, he told me to stop asking him about it because it made him feel like I was looking down on him, and that he is just as upset that he doesn't have a job and isn't working. 

Almost every single conversation I have with him asking him to please go in to the unemployment office ends in him saying that I am pushing him and am upsetting him. I don't mean to sound pushy, but he says that every time I bring it up, it is like I am looking down on him. We live together, so I am just trying to help our situation together. This has been a huge strain on our relationship. Yes, I also want to get paid back what he owes me, and I don't want to cover his rent again next month, but I don't think it is too much to ask for him to collect unemployment.

bxuyja	2019-06-07 14:01:22	badson2019	WIBTA if I don't ask my mother to move in with my wife and me.	"My mother's living situation is fairly tenuous right now.  She had been renting from someone for the last several years, but that person passed away and the property ended up being owned by the mortgage company.  My mother has not had to pay rent in ~1 year.  She works full time.  The bank is preparing to sell the property now and my mother will need to find a new place to live.  She says she has too much debt at the moment to be able to afford another lease or mortgage, until October when she has paid some of this debt off.   I don't have specifics on the financials because when brought up I generally try not to discuss the matter as I'm afraid she will ask to live with my wife and me.

My wife and I are in our mid 30's both work full time, and are about to have our first child together.  We waited to have kids until we were in a comfortable spot financially.  I would like to have time with my wife, new baby, and I to just be able to spend time together without another adult living in the house with us.  I also hold a lot of resentment towards my mother for some things from my childhood that I have not dealt with, or discussed with her,  that makes me dislike the idea of her living with us. 

I am feeling guilty for not asking her to move in with us.  She has been widowed twice, losing my father and 18 years later my step father.  She has a friend who is fairly well off with a big house who offered her to live with them until the fall when my mother can get a place of her own.

I have worked my way into a position that I work 4-6 hours a day for the same pay. I go in at whatever time I want (barring any meetings) and generally leave whenever I want. This leads to me only working for 2-4 hours most days and 4-6 if we have meetings. 

Problem: Yesterday I had a meeting at 4pm. These meeting run about an 1-2 hours normally. I recently started some medication that causes me to get really bad stomach aches if I don’t eat on a regular schedule. Because of the meeting at 4 and me prepping for it I went in at about 2pm and room some quesadillas with me so that I could eat before the meeting and not have the stomach pain. 

I got caught up in work, forgot the quesadilla and by the time I remember it was too late to eat them before. So I headed to the meeting. It lasted two hours and I was more or less fine. I started to feel the onset of the stomach pain and decided to eat my quesadilla then head home. My wife calls and starts asking “why don’t you eat here?” I explained the stomach pain, which she’s aware of, and said imma stuff this down really quick and I’m on my way home. She said “why don’t you eat it in the car?”

 I told her I just simply didn’t want to and that I’m just trying to eat this real quick (maybe 5mins max) and go home (20-25min drive). She’s starts questioning me more and more why I don’t eat in the car and that I’ve eaten things in the car before (I do eat it the car and have no problem with it if I’m in a rush). I repeated that me simply just “wanting” to sit down at my desk and eat my quesadilla should be sufficient enough reason. She hung up on me.

If someone sees the car and calls shotgun, everyone must accept the fact that they get the passenger’s seat. However, in the case which I am talking about it was a very unique circumstance. As we were walking out of the house to my friend’s car, a 2018 RAV4, we stopped on his porch because it was heavily raining. To my surprise, my friend calls shotgun before I do (I almost never forget), however no one moves quite yet because we are all hesitant to move out into the rain. The friend who called shotgun even suggests not going! (Unbelievable right). As we sit there, I make the first move and run for the car. I am followed soon my the driver, and as I try to get out of the rain by instincts told me to just open the passenger door and get in. The person calling shotgun has the audacity to look at me through the windshield as he is standing on the porch telling me to switch seats because he called it. After 5 minutes of silent arguing, him and the last friend finally come and  get in the back of the car. My friends claim a level 3 breakage of the shotgun rule.

It's going to be a small ceremony with only 15 attendees and we will all be staying for about a week afterward.  My sister-in-law has been very excited about us getting married and has been asking if she can make matching shirts and bags for everyone going down.  I don't really like the matching ""reunion"" style t-shirts or bags so I have politely tried to redirect or decline the offer. If it was a surprise gift, of course I wouldn't refuse them but if she asks for my opinion, I am honest and let her know I'm not interested.

Today she texted me, ""We need a cute hashtag for your wedding!""  With our wedding being so small, I just don't see the point of a wedding hashtag when I can see posted pictures from family easily and frankly, I'm just not a wedding hashtag kind of person.  I replied with ""We talked about it but are just going to skip it!"" and explained that I didn't feel it was needed because of the small group size.  She responded with, ""I was talking about putting it on cinch bags or shirts."" I  texted back, ""Oh, I'm OK with skipping the hashtag altogether"" and she only replied with ""OK I got nothing then.""

I tend to worry too much over social interactions like this but I'm wondering if maybe I was in the wrong with the way I worded my responses.

At the time I was married, living in an apartment, and starting to want to settle down. I wanted a pet, so my husband got me a cat for Christmas. 

I love this cat very much, she's incredibly sweet and while she was skittish at first she has slowly warmed up over the years as I've gained her trust. 

About a year or so after getting the cat, I left my husband due to some issues with infidelity. I moved back home with my parents to pay off student loans and save up money to have my own place. The cat came with me.

 I'm at the point in my life where I can begin to afford my own place finally. Around a year ago I began dating another man and things are going really well. We're looking at moving in together and generally spend all our time together now. The issue is that he is allergic to cats, and the place we are considering moving would not allow a cat. My parents are not willing to keep the cat if I'm not there, so I'm looking at finding her a new home.

bxuven	2019-06-07 13:53:05	SpopArt	WIBTA if I brought up the amount of time colleagues spend smoking at work?	"Would I be the asshole for bringing up the amount of time my colleagues spend outside on cigarette breaks during paid working time? I'm sorry if its been mentioned before. 

I work in a small office of 20 people. Some of my colleagues smoke and are out on cigarette breaks 4+ times a day for at least 5 minutes. Doing the math, it works out they spend around 20 mins per day, 100 mins per week, 400 mins per month - which equates to 6.6666 hours per month smoking on paid work time. This roughly equates to a days leave time (7.5 hours) per month, which is crazy.

Having been a smoker in my teens, I understand the want to go and smoke so am not disliking them for doing what they enjoy. However I feel it is unfair that those choosing not to smoke do not receive the same break time, i doubt I'd be allowed 20 minutes a day to stand outside for a 'fresh air' break - if you know what I mean? 

Not sure how to approach the situation, however I do feel something needs to be done. Would I be the asshole for taking some sort of action?

bxutnx	2019-06-07 13:48:14	SCPalmers	WIBTA for giving my Uber driver a lower rating because she talked too much?	"This happened earlier this morning. I am running a little bit later than usual, I could take the MBTA but I would probably get to work ten minutes late VS taking an Uber and I will not only get there in time but I could take a bit more time getting ready. I decide to Uber. 

Right before I start doing my hair, I order my Uber. The app shows they are 2 minutes away, perfect. I do my hair, grab a drink and get ready to head downstairs. Checking my app quickly before walking out the door I see the Uber is right down the street, 1 min away, sweet!

I walk outside and wait for a moment. No Uber. Where is this Uber driver? There is a car half way down the block parked in the middle of the street with a lady outside of it having a conversation with the driver. It’s just far enough to where I cannot see the license plate nor the model of car. As I wait for another few minutes I grow increasingly frustrated and wonder what might be going on with this invisible Uber, why haven’t they arrived?

I decide to walk towards the end of the block, maybe they are stuck behind this other car and I can just hop in and we can reroute and be on our way. To my surprise as I walk up I realize that this car that has been parked down the block for about 5 minutes at this point is actually my Uber driver. 

I approach the car and wave to signal that I am their passenger, they wave back and continue their conversation with the person outside of the car. As I hop in they continue talking for another minute or so and then start to wrap up their conversation. As we pull off the driver goes “Small World, I used to work with her!” 

Would I be the asshole for giving my Uber driver a lower rating for having me wait 6 extra minutes so she could catch up with a friend as if she had the day off and didn’t accept my ride?

EDIT: A few things to Clarify here:

1) When I say lower rating I am talking about 4 stars instead of 5 because I do realize this is someone’s job and I don’t not take that lightly. Assuming she doesn’t do this all the time then my review isn’t going to make or break her and I will write why I scored her in that way. People need should know what they may have done to upset their performance and have the opportunity to improve in any job.

2) I did arrive to work late, in Boston 6 minutes is the difference between getting there on time or standing still on the highway."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxutg8	2019-06-07 13:47:38	HitMeWithYourBestBot	AITA(24F) for not feeling responsible for a woman's(25F) mental breakdown?	"This happened a while ago, but I recently ran into the woman & her attitude suggested she still felt justified in her choices & hatred of me, so I want to know if I handled the situation badly.

TL;DR     A girl lied to me about my and my ex's cat being missing and stopped me from finding out by calling me desperate for wanting to visit (my cat). When I found out, I called her out on her lies and she had a breakdown that resulted in her dropping out of university and moving for 9 months. To this day she has not apologised and blames me for her breakdown.

&#x200B;

After a bad breakup, I tried to remain friends with some of the people in my ex's life, because we were like family & had basically lived together for 2 years (years later, they are my best friends & have no contact with my ex). They all shared a home (which I visited every weekend), & my ex & I got a cat, Sabbath (he was a black kitty) & that little monster was a terror to everyone, but he adored me. I mean, he never scratched me once, even when I held his whole body to my face, & I even used him as a pillow a few times. That boi loved me, & I loved him. He lived in my ex's home.

After my ex cheated on me, our friends held off on telling me and hoped he would find a way to make things right, which never happened, & I didn't see them for a long time.

One of our friends had been in a 3-year relationship, & it came out that he had been cheating since day 1. Obviously, everyone lost their shit, & I remained friends with his ex GF. We became a bit of a scorned duo, mourning our exes, and it took me by surprise when I found out she was still hooking up with her ex & hoping to reconcile. Everyone in her life warned her against it, so she just lied to cover it up, & I eventually accepted it in exchange for her being honest and safe (she was driving to him drunk a lot). She agreed to be less shady, & one day mentioned she was going to visit the house to see everyone. I felt ready to see my friends & my cat, so I asked if I could join, and she proceeded to tell me I would look desperate for using my cat as an excuse to see my ex, who was potentially still hooking up with the person he cheated with. She made it seem like she was giving me ""tough love"" & I reluctantly agreed to not go with her.

Weeks later I found out my fucking cat had been missing for WEEKS and everyone suspected I had taken him (& they didn't make a big fuss cause they felt I was justified). This girl knew I didn't have Sabbath, and she hadn't bothered to tell me he was missing, or fill our friends in. Her excuse was that she didn't want to upset me further, and that she had panicked when I mentioned visiting our friends.

We had a huge falling out where I basically said she was projecting all of her ""desperation"" lectures and had intentionally managed her lies & relationships to avoid anyone pointing out that she was prioritising someone who let her into his bed only after he was done fucking other people (which was hella true). She ended up having a full-blown breakdown (showed up at my gate, bashing it and screaming, & only left when I threatened to call the cops) & her family pulled her out of uni & sent her away for like 9 months. To this day she blames me for tipping her over when she was in a ""fragile place"" and she has NEVER apologised to me. She still sees her ex & flaunts her new dude in front of him, but all of her bad blood is with me. Also, Sabbath was never found :(

English is not my first language

I am on a vacation in Italy with my family. And we wanted to go to the pool for a quick swim. It’s a camping place so you can get yourself something to drink or even a quick snack. As a snack they sell pancakes with Nutella and other stuff. But this girl (14 ish) was eating a pancake with her mouth open. The chewing and smacking sound was so loud I could hear it when I was trying to dry on my towel (Around 3 meters away). So I told the girl: “could you chew with your mouth closed, you’re making disgusting sounds”. She cried for some reason, I guess because I was rude or something.

So, my best friends mom is driving my best friend down for my birthday. She lives in Charlotte NC, I live in the Atlanta suburbs in GA. My best friend doesn’t drive, I do. Her mom has a boyfriend in Atlanta, so she said she’d bring her down that weekend since she’s coming down anyway. 

My friend and I were talking and she asked if we could meet her mom at a Burger King off an exit that’s an hour from me, at 5:30 in the morning because they leave early.

They pass the exit to my city as they go to Atlanta and the location they asked to meet at seemed out of the way. 

I said no, because I don’t want to drive an hour at night when it makes more sense to just meet at my exit since they pass it anyway. 

Her mom called me and essentially said either we meet at the location she said or she’s not bringing my friend at all. 

I said that was ridiculous because I live by my exit and know for a fact she passes by it to get to Atlanta because I’ve driven that drive with her as well.

Growing up she always felt like she wasn’t loved, wasn’t paid attention. Both my parents worked full time jobs and my mom was a nurse at a public hospital. I was the silent type or “shy” as olders would call me and she was the talkative, center of the attention type of kid. Whenever she’d act up and have problems with my parents or try to fight me my parents would want me to tolerate her or be the “bigger” one. I’ve done that all my life up until high school. Then i stopped talking to her all together unless she’d come to me to talk. One day while i was high school while she was talking to me about her problematic relationship, i didn’t listen to her and she took my laptop from me and threw it on the ground and jumped on it while screaming at it. I was shook. And that was the milestone for me. The relationship was done for me. She married that guy against my parents wishes and for the first time in my life i saw another guy fight my dad. I hate her for bringing that kinda person into our family. And i hate that guy with no questions. Overall, whenever i see her i try to act normal but it brings out so many childhood traumas. Im in my last year of university and i still see nightmares revolving around her. So, yesterday i came to my parents cabin/village house, and she came her too. She is always disrespectful to my parents and resentful cos “they didn’t love” her. While they always are there for her whenever she and her husband has a fight. And today, my mom was preparing food for her son and it smelled good and I wanted one too. I haven’t seen my parents in 10 months and my mom talked to me in a sweet voice and said she could make some for me too. Then my sister yells like a kid that my mom never talks to her that way and always yells at her and never does anything for her. I couldn’t keep my cool and talked my mind, said that my mom feeds her kid and does everything for her and the baby. She started yelling at me all sorts of things and said she was leaving today. And asks my dad to drive her as her husband doesn’t care about her or the baby. Now it became a huge fight between her and my mom, mom didn’t want her to leave cos she cant take care of the baby and whenever my mom isn’t around it gets sick. Both my parents start saying stuff like our kids don’t care about us and they can’t stay together. AITA and a bad child to my parents if I stop tolerating that shit?

Today I brought my desktop on to my lab because my requirements changed and neither my laptop nor the computers given by the dept. would suffice. I have a 1Gbit ethernet port and found a cable that could sustain such speeds so I was excited  and shared it on our group chat.

My friend couldn't believe it and I told him to come around to check it out, he did then we later brought his disk to download stuff because his connection was capped at 100Mbit but I digress. He also made a rude remark towards me when I asked him to put the chair where he found it, I tidied up the place I work at and the space is limited so I'd rather not have chairs blocking the paths.

Come around lunch time, I asked him if we were to go for lunch and he replied that they had already eaten and it was a while ago. I proceeded to delete the torrent he was downloading along with the files and remove it without telling him anything."		1	0

We have talked about marriage, but he’s recently told me that in the last 8 months, he’s only made about $1700. As a married couple, I know they support each other in all aspects, but I don’t know that we would be able to live comfortably on just my income alone (social worker). And having a family may not be possible either if what he’s generating remains the same. 

Anyway, I asked maybe to reconsider apply to companies in the farming sector. He’s in Africa and there are TONS of agencies and also has friends at these agencies. But he states he wants to work for himself and doesn’t like working under people. I get it but he’s not making any money and can’t even save for his retirement or medical emergencies. I get frustrated trying to explain why concern and frustration with him and just thinks i’m not being supportive and that I have no faith in him. I want to be supportive, but when he told me his income it made it really hard to continue. I don’t know anything about owning a business, so maybe that is normal but I don’t know.

We filled out raffle tix at an event this past weekend (my name and number). I asked her to put the other half of the tix in her wallet because my wallet was in our backpack with all our stuff and I didn't want to dig it out. She took the tix, put them in her wallet, and we moved on.

Two days later, I got the call that we won a prize. I call wife and she tells me, whoops, I accidentally washed my wallet and now the tix are ruined.

Here's where the argument starts: I said okay, then you can go claim the prize with my ID. I don't want to go up there and try to claim them and argue about not having the other half of the ticket and then potentially be sent away without the prize. She said, no, you go claim it if you want the prize. I said, wait a sec, you accepted responsibility for the ticket when you put the tix in your wallet. You could have said nah, I don't want this responsibility, you take the ticket, but you didn't, you put it in your wallet. I would have gladly taken the backpack off and put the tix in my wallet if she said no, I don't want this responsibility.

So now the simple interaction of me taking the ticket up there to claim the prize is complicated by not having the other half of the winning ticket.

Her argument: You want the prize, you go try to claim it, they aren't going to care as long you prove who you are. You're the A for asking me to deal with it.

My argument: You lost the ticket and I don't want to waste my time trying to claim something that should be simple. You're the A for asking me to deal with it.

So reddit, who is the A?

EDIT: Wow, y'all harsh and making a lot of assumptions! This was a silly ten minute argument and we've since moved on because aint nobody got time for that. She took my ID just in case they asked why I wasn't there to pick it up. Of course it's a petty and dumb argument. We all agree on that. The whole point was since she lost the ticket, she should have to try and claim this prize (which was for the children, BTW, not me).

bxujuf	2019-06-07 13:21:30	Casinojerkbag	WIBTAH if I reported an employee for their conduct off hours at a casino?	"I’m sitting here with a potentially very career damaging email and I wanted to know if I’d be the asshole if I sent it. 

Yesterday I went to a casino near a convention center after they had their first summer outdoor music festival and things were going great at the craps table. Now I don’t know if many people have experience at these tables but typically on any dice roll you can bet with or against the shooter along with a number of many other bets. I point this out because this is NOT about people winning while others lose because that’s a normal sore loser thing you encounter at these tables.

This guy walks in and jumps the shooter line, typically a faux pas but nobody really cares including me but it all started to go down from there. He was badgering and belittling the shooter, telling them out loud how much he sucks and other choice words. This almost got him into a fist fight and removed from the casino. He would also talk out loud about how large his penis was and how he’d fuck all of the waitresses.

He got progressively more drunk and gave me the same shit on my throw and here’s where the whole report to employer came in. He decided that I must be a barista and called me as such (because I’m young?) and generally badgered me about it. I mentioned to someone else who was nicer that I worked for a large chemical manufacturer in the area and instantly he became uber friendly towards me. 

He was wearing a company shirt the whole time and several times he referred to himself by his first name so it was quite easy to find him on LinkedIn. He happens to be a higher role at a supply chain consultant firm and while I’m not sure if my company uses them it’s definitely something we do contract out.

bxuhyu	2019-06-07 13:16:31	notafanofusernames-	AITA? I love to give people attention for no reason and then move on.	"I’ve always been a pretty touchy person, nothing sexual, but I love to hug people, hold their hand, poke them, heck I even give my friends messages (again not sexual) for fun. I definitely give people way more attention than they are willing to give me, doesn’t really bother me though. 

I’ve noticed however, that people take me and the attention I give them for granted, as if I’m somewhat disposable. I’m not socially inept in any way, so I can definitely tell people tend to think I’m lesser than them. These people aren’t bad people by any means and I’m sure if you ask them they don’t think of me as any less than themselves, but their actions definitely tell another story. For instance, they tend to think I can’t be serious about things or that I’m incapable of comprehending certain things. (This is definitely not the case, although I’m very private about my merit, I scored in the 1 percentile on the SAT and have maintained a very high GPA throughout college) I get it, I’m an extremely energetic person. 

So here’s the dilemma. I give people so much attention that they think of us as really close friends (or sometimes more than that), but in reality I don’t really care about them that much. I just like giving people attention and I don’t expect much back at all. When I move on, they get either really angry or really upset. They clearly have an emotional investment in me, I mean I’m always there to listen to their problems and give them solid advice. (Raised by a psychologist, she’s taught me a thing or two about helping people through tough times) During our friendship they always seem to see me as the disposable one, always down to hangout or do whatever, but when I’m ready to move on I feel like they’re being disposed of by me. 

Truthfully, I seldom invest into friendships emotionally. I’m quite a private person and I’m not sure these people are aware that I know *much* more about them than they know about me. Am I the asshole for giving them a false sense of friendship?"	Asshole	0	0

"So for a little background, last year my husband and I went through a pretty traumatic experience together that completely turned our world upside down. After some hard work on ourselves through therapy and support groups we've been able to find the tools to help us cope with our trauma.

This is where my Aunt comes in. She's always been rude and crass. But everyone just sort of puts up with it as ""well that's just Aunt Joanne. You know how she is."" For example, when I was pregnant with my first child Aunt Joanne goes, ""let's hope baby turns out like husband cause we all know you're mean."" She laughed, but I didn't find that funny in the least. So this brings us to last year. I saw aunt for the first time since our trauma (about 4 months prior) and her lovely words of wisdom included ""well luckily you're young so you can stop being sad and get over it."" As if someone is supposed to just push all their feelings away and recover overnight. Basically any time I've seen her since then she has some remark to make about the incident and how we should just be happy for what we have and move on etc.  So because of this, I've just found it best to avoid her as much as possible.

The one problem is that Aunt is older, lives in our town, and we have a family reunion coming up about an hour's drive away. She doesn't like to drive and since my family is going to be carpooling to take as few cars as possible my mom asked if Aunt could ride in our car. I told my mom flat out, no. I try to avoid her in open spaces because I don't want to put up with her blatant rudeness, so being trapped in a car with her for an hour sounds like hell. Mom thinks IATA because I don't want to help out her sister, our family and that I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill by taking her comments so personally. So what do you think?

bxue4f	2019-06-07 13:06:00		AITA for not wanting my heritage?	"My father (64) is from a South American country, and he migrated to the country where I was born 30 years ago. Currently we continue living in this country he, my mother (59), my younger brother (23) and I (25).

He was born in a rural area of ​​his country with 5 other siblings, where my grandfather has cattle farms, he left there and went to a big city in another country to study, where he met my mother, they got married and soon time we were born me and my brother.

He got a good job here, with which we were able to get ahead. We never missed anything. We always went to good schools, we could go on trips sometimes, although most of the time we went to their country, since half of our family lives there and he misses them, naturally.

A couple of years ago he retired, and decided that he wants to return to his native country at any cost, to work the farms that my grandfather gave him, and leave them as an inheritance to my brother and me, who would need to live in that country tu run them. He also travels more frequently there and for longer stays.

This has caused a stir in our family circle, given that my brother and I, although we have been present on the farms and have seen how they do various tasks, are not used to that pace of life, we studied things that are not related to livestock or farms, and we do not feel passion for rural life, much less in another country. Especially my brother, who ""hates"" my father since we discovered that he had an affair with another wom

All the money that my father has is invested in these lands, and yet, what my brother and I want is to sell them once he is no longer with us. He has threatened us saying that he will not leave us anything if we do not value him, which I really do not think will affect us, given that we have never seen those farms and therefore we have never felt them. We feel as if they took away something that really is not ours, so we feel it does not affect us.

My brother and I currently have jobs, which although they are not as good as the one my father had and for which he stayed to live in this country, we see it as a first step. However, I can not help thinking that I am fortunate in comparison to many people that my father has these lands, and that one day they could be mine.

I also have a girlfriend with whom I have a relationship for more than 7 years, and we are beginning to think about getting married very seriously. She also does not want to live in another country, since all her family lives here and does not want to be separated from them.

bxudk3	2019-06-07 13:04:21	Mnt20	AITA for ghosting a friend who made me sick while I was pregnant?	"As a backstory, before this happened we had been friends for 3 years. We had fun hanging out together and talked on the phone a couples times a month to catch up. We lived in different states, so we could not meet face to face often. 

When I was 7.5 months pregnant, as a “last hurrah” we decided to have a girls trip in NYC. The plan was I would go there a couple days with my mom and then she would join us for the final 3 days. 

My mom and I’s hotel room had 2 beds, and I didn’t mind sleeping in the same bed as my mom, so trying to be nice I offered my friend that she can stay with us, free of charge (the hotel was around $300 a night, IIRC) so she wouldn’t have to spend her own money. I never asked for money from her. She gladly accepted. I was excited to see her. 

I was already in NYC and 2 days before she was going to come, she texted me and told me that she was sick, but she was doing all she could to feel better before coming. I did warn her, that if she was sick she shouldn’t come because I was terrified of getting sick while pregnant. I did not have an easy pregnancy so to speak - the first 4 months were rough as I suffered from HG (severe morning sickness) and I was terrified of having a miscarriage which I had had 2 before. So she knew I was very careful about trying to stay healthy. She assured me she would be okay. 

She came anyway, and she was sick as a dog. Coughing, hoarse voice, sneezing, her nose was running, she kept having to run to the bathroom to have diarrhea. I was stuck with her in the hotel room when we slept with her coughing, and with it being a NYC hotel room on a high floor we could not even open the windows. She also during the trip kept touching me and got inches from my face when talking although I was sending constant signals for her to back off.  The whole time she was very sick but was almost pretending like nothing was wrong. 

Well, I got sick for 2 weeks with a horrible cold and cough after the trip and inside my head, I blamed here. I was so upset that I ignored her, she texted me about a week after I started and she said “did I do anything wrong? Please tell me” and I didn’t answer at all. We remained FB friends. As a side note, I was also upset she never told me or my mom thank you for anything, so in my head I was upset by this too. 

After I had my baby, so about 2 months after this happened, I wrote her an apology letter and told her I probably shouldn’t have ignored her.  But I did tell her what made me upset. I told her I didn’t want to end the friendship and was hoping we could talk about it. 

She saw it, and never responded. Then a few months later, she presumably blocked me on FB, and I never heard from her again. 

I have had some people tell me I was rude, and other people have said they would have done the same. So, was I being an asshole?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bxub7f	2019-06-07 12:58:10	Papaya_flight	AITA For evicting my in laws from our property?	"My wife's parents (mother and stepfather) were extremely irresponsible (did crack, racked up crazy debt) and were on the verge of being evicted.

This leads us to where we are today. My wife felt bad for them getting evicted with nowhere to go and talked to me about letting them live in a small cabin on our property which we were using for storage. 

J's mother and her husband decided that they did not want to get jobs at all and would just live off of the un-employment they were still getting from their home-state they had just moved out of. J is a stay at home mom and had stated that we only had enough spare gas to make an extra trip to the store once a week. We live out in the sticks so we plan every trip into town and get everything we need all at once. J's mother would still constantly walk over and ask to be taken into town several times a day and when told 'No.' would do things like slam the door on the way out or call J a 'bitch' for not buying cigarettes. 

Since nobody had money to give to J's parents, they decided that they needed to get a job, and J agreed to make extra trips into town to help them look for work. While out, her mother continued to yell at her for offering to buy her new clothes for her interviews or for not buying cigarettes.

We recently had another talk with her parents about what was acceptable behavior and what was not acceptable. Her mother denied that she ever did any yelling and that she ever called anybody names (her husband disagreed). Due to this reaction, we stated that from now on J's mother needed to contact me directly for any financial questions she had (she often asks for cash, which we usually don't have) and for needing anything extra (like extra rides to town). The very next day while I was at work J's mother started to ask her for rides/cash/cigarettes and when she didn't get them she would storm out, slam the door, and then go to each neighbor trying to get things out of them (usually cash). Just two days ago she asked J for $50. J told her she needed to ask me. She sent me a text and I said I didn't have the money for that and declined. She then went back to J and tried to get her to buy her cigarettes on credit and promised to 'pay it back'. She also suggested that I was too good for my wife and that she didn't deserve me.

This last time we talked with them I let them know that they were living rent free, with all free utilities (including internet), and free food, and all that needed to happen was that the attitude had to stop or we would ask them to leave. So yesterday, after this last incident with the money and comments, I told them that I would talk to them today about leaving the property. So, what do you think reddit? Am I the asshole? My wife and I both support each other as a team so she doesn't think we are out of bounds, I'm just curious to see what you all think as well."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So yesterday I was playing baseball with my brother (we figured out special rules that worked well since we were only two people and we even have score system so it can be competitive) I'm much older than him so I do take it easy on him (he can run to bases while I have to walk and I can only go as far as second in a single play, also my favorite handicap is sometimes I bat with a snow shovel or only hold the bat with one hand) But I don't go out of my way to make him win (I do occasionally call it a ball when it is clearly a strike to give him another chance but that's it) because I don't think he should learn that the world will go out of it's way to help him (also I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy winning just a tiny bit) He has won 2 games fair and square and I was very proud of him but most of the time I win. Well he usually gets a bit angry when he loses but this time he was really angry because he was so close to victory. He had a bit of a fit, then took off his shoes and threw them into the tall grass area near the bottom of our yard. He refused to get them and so did I because I wasn't gonna clean up after his mess but we were hungry and went inside without getting them (usually I would make him get them before we go inside but I was so hungry I didn't have the energy to fight with him about it so I just figured I would make him go outside and get him later) Well I forgot about the shoes and we didn't realize until the sun nearly set that his shoes were down there. My Mom and my little brother went to go and look for them but I didn't go out. When my Dad found out he got angry at me and said ""you should go out and help look for them"" I then replied ""no because it isn't my fault that he stupidly threw his shoes down there"" but he said that it was somewhat my fault since I was the one playing with him and made him angry in the first place.

bxuazy	2019-06-07 12:57:38		WIBTA if I didn't let my Baby Mama go to the school enrollment meeting after she wouldn't let me go 4 years ago?	"Broke up with BM in 2014. She was still enrolled in my district which meant I got the calls and the mail sent to me. Well I got her last report card (BM had been hiding all the others from me). Her last report card showed that she missed 29 days of school during the Wed/Thur/Fri her Mom took her to school. And she missed 3 days of school during the Mon/Tue that I take her to school. I wanted to know why she was missing exponentially more school on Wed/Thur/Fri than Mon/Tue.

The truth of the matter is that the BM just takes her out of class alot. Like for movies. Or to leave early on Friday for a weekend trip. Crap like that. I grew up with a work/school ethic where you go to school or work UNLESS YOU CAN'T. Its part of the reason why the BM and I are split up.

Anyway, the next year she didn't want to have me looking at Report Cards. So she enrolled her in this ghetto Catholic school nearby. I ended up moving to a different town (in the metro area). This town has a nice school district. The BM would rather pay $5000/year to send her to this ghetto Catholic school instead of the nice public school because she doesn't want me to get the Report Card to see how much school she is missing.

Here is the first important part:

When she enrolled her in this school, she did it unilaterally without my input, my opinion or nothing. She also didn't let me go to the initial registration meetings or any of that stuff.

Fast foward to 2019. That ghetto Catholic school is closing. So now she wants her to go to the nice public school in the nice district I live in. She lives in the city and I live in the town. She needs me to get her into the nice public school.

So she told me she wants to set everything up and go to the first registration meeting and I told her no. If I wasn't allowed to go to the reg meeting years ago, she isn't coming to this one.

She freaked! How dare I not let her be a part of our child's education? What if I do things wrong? She needs to be the first one contacted and all this BS. So I'm like wait. Full stop. If all of this is a problem now in 2019 for her, why wasn't it a problem in 2014-2019 when she was just unilaterally doing things without me?

WIBTA if I refuse to let her go to this meeting? She is insisting she will just put her in another school and go to court for more child support and a half dozen other threats.

**EDIT** I already decided that I will compromise yet again for my daughter's sake. I told her I would do whatever she wanted me to do to ensure she got to go to the school she likes. So its a done deal. Thanks folks."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"". Her friends who sit at our table in class aren't very intelligent, nor is she. She even thought the capital of China was Japan. What a dumb bitch. Anyways, I turned over to her,.and gave her a stern look. I asked "" excuse me.. what did you just say?"". Keep in mind that I am half Asian,.half white in a Hispanic and black school. She said "" I'm not trying to be mean but you guys look so alike"". Sometimes that is true, but not all! I said "" WELL ITS LIKE ME SAYING EVERY HISPANIC HERE IS MEXICAN AND THAT YOU PEOPLE LOOK ALIKE AND HAVE THE SAME NAME!"" . I assure you guys that I am not a racist and that I said that to prove that it's the same concept as saying all Asians are the same. She said "" WELL some are tanner than others "". WOW!

Am I the jerk? She was asking for it. I'll give you shit if you say stuff like that. Again, I am not racist... I had a lot of people pull the race card on me just because I didn't dignify their racist comment or rudeness. It even happens when I refuse to help them with their work, not because of race, but because I worked hard and that they don't deserve help. I can't be a total racist monster if my friends are of color or different race, I am not using that as an excuse to pardon anything I said, and I am not trying to prove that I am a total angel because my friends are a different color.

"I am currently doing my bachelors and saw that my university is offering an erasmus exchange semester with funding. I was delighted and decided to apply. I got in, I passed the selected at my university and I got ''confirmed'' that I will do an exchange semester in Austria in a University I choose. 

I have asked my erasmus coordinator at my university everything, and she said it isn't a problem, that I will surely get in and that everything will be fine. The university I choose is a partner with mine so I was like awesome, they are in a contract with each other. 3-4 weeks ago I decided to give the university a call to give me some guidelines on what to do next since my exchange should start in November, and then I heard ''Well we don't know who you are''.

After some back and fourth this incomptent erasmus coordinator didn't EVEN CONTACT THEM AT ALL ABOUT IT in any way, shape or form. They haven't heard about me until I CALLED THEM. I called my erasmus coordinator and she THEN applied me to the university , she sent an email to them applying me. If I hadn't called them to check, god knows when I would be applied.

Now apparently the IT section is NOT under contract but other sections are (wasn't told that), and of course due to me being applied so late, I got denied. I meeted up the next day with her and she will now send questions to Uni's in Chech Republic, Portugal and Spain and see how it will go but I am so close to all out scream at her incompetent ass for not sending 1 e-mail in almost 4 months. If the other universities will decline me now due to already right now being June, I will get furious even more.

bxu7g7	2019-06-07 12:47:41	sarah_spelt_weird	AITA for wanting to keep my job?	"On mobile, sorry for any bad format

Long story short, my(F) immediate family owns their own small business. My cousins wanted to open a restaurant, and to thank my family it was agreed they would give them 10% of the revenue. 

I was asked to work at my cousin Robert’s other restaurant, so that he could take time off to help open it with other cousin Bobby. I agreed, partially because my parents asked me to because it would end up helping all of us since we would be getting our share from the new restaurant. 

Well last night my parents showed up to help get the new restaurant ready for opening which was supposed to be this weekend. However when my parents showed up, everyone that my father has beef with in the family (because it just so happens Robert and Bobby are all friends with them.) My father took it as disrespect, since he saw it as a party of everyone who hates him was there, especially one other cousin he has issues with, Steven, was there. Steven and my father have a long horrible history that’s too long to get into here. 
To make a long story short, there was a physical interaction between my father and several other people. My cousins, my BIL who was there, and other cousins who he doesn’t hate but were there anyways so now he hates them too. 

As all of that was happening, my mother told me I needed to leave work immediately and go home. Me, thinking it was an emergency said ok and got in an Uber to go home. I was one of two people working at the time, and didn’t tell my boss Bobby because he was at the new restaurant where everything was happening and figured he wouldn’t have been able to respond anyways. 
Now my parents are saying I’m forbidden to go back to work. It would be disrespectful to them, since hey had gotten me the job, and since they now also hate my two cousins Bobby and Robert. I’m arguing that their petty feelings for others shouldn’t have to influence my career, and while they agree that since I’m 18 they legally can’t stop me from working, I wouldn’t have a home to return to. The thing is I love working there. It’s a great place and I make great money, and honestly dgaf about all of their drama I just want to work.

He’a a big guy with a soft heart which is why I love him. He’s compassionate, kind, loving and caring and even sensitive. 

But here’s the thing. I learned recently that he likes to watch children’s cartoons like Cailou and Arthur sometimes at night or whenever he’s relaxing and it really irritates me. He’s a grown man, why is he watching stuff that 2 year olds watch?? 

So I brought it up to him last night and he nonchalantly said that’s what he likes sometimes because it reminds him of growing up and misses those days. I get that but really??? You still watch that stuff? He might’ve gotten defensive because he brought up how I go on Facebook for my free time (he doesn’t have social media) or watch certain movies or shows that he might not approve of. 

Is this normal for a guy his age to watch that stuff? It’s weird. He also cries sometimes when watching something sad or that reminds him of something. I like that about him but sometimes he can cry at the stupidest things.

Edit:  Since he doesn’t have Facebook or social media he’ll sometimes be passive aggressive with me by making comments of how I’m using it too much or could be talking to him when he texts me. Why should he care that I’m on Facebook and make snide remarks about how I’m always on there? I don’t think that’s fair

My aunt, Beverly, mom, Kim, and sister Anne have made this difficult and I am refusing to go and going no contact with them for right now.  

I have a very close relationship with my niece and almost willing to endure anything for 48 hours for her birthday.  However they have chosen a resort because of Beverly's unique situation that has very sketchy reviews.  However some not the reviews are very specific of the section of the resort which is best.  I explain to Kim that I only wanted to stay in this section and she agreed.  However, after Beverly forwarded her confirmation, Anne and Kim were now eager to book.  I was leaving work in 3 hours and figured it could wait, apparently it could not and they accused me of being selfish for the second time during all of this and ruining her birthday because things have to go my way.  I cannot go into detail due to character limit.  

I am upset because they disregarded my feelings regarding my comfort level and where I would like to stay, they got mad at me for mentioning Beverly trying to scam waterpark passes and last for using my niece to manipulate me into doing something I don't want to do.  

The reviews are specific and I am not attempting to stay at a different place just in a different part and there is no guarantee we would be grouped together as the resort is so large anyway.

Anyways, this guy has become too interested in me. I don’t particularly believe he likes me as much as he acts because come on. He writes very long texts detailing his excitement in meeting me which has honestly become annoying to me but sweet nonetheless.  

Here’s why I feel like I might be an A hole; we have talked on the phone for hours some nights this week, even Skyped a few times. I have been somewhat flirty. And he thinks I like him even though I told him gently that I’m not in a good place to be dating right now. I’ve been on and off with an ex fwb that I’ve been completely in love with for the last year or so. 

I’m not pursuing this ex but I think about him constantly. Also the guy who is currently pursuing me has asked if I talk to other guys. I said no but honestly there are a few others. I did tell him I found it inappropriate to be asking but I figured I should say no to not hurt his feelings. I feel like I should cut him off but I know it’ll be a great disappointment to him. I’m not ready for a commitment.

**Edit**: so I have accepted that I am the asshole in this situation. I feel bad about the situation but I’ve learned my lesson; if you’re unsure about your feelings then you are uninterested and shouldn’t flirt with someone because that may be perceived as leading on.

We already gave him the easier tasks, but I am relatively confident that I could do what he did in the entire 2-3 month period in a couple of weeks. The other friend made basically 70% of out product and I made the entire paper.

When I was 18, which was a very short time ago, I unfortunately witnessed one of my best friends in college (who I lived with for the first two semesters) die. This happened very suddenly and violently. The entire situation of that day and the following funeral services completely broke me. This happened at a point where my father was not speaking to me. He hadn’t spoken to be for about 2 months at that part and had all but “cut me off” financially because I had gotten a piercing a few months prior that he didn’t approve of but, as a 17 year old, I got anyway. When I called my mom to tell her what was going on, he heard me crying on the phone but told her to hang up because they were having dinner and I didn’t talk to him for two days after that. Throughout the situation he said “It’ll be okay” and gave me a hug and that was about it. 
A few months later, I went to go to visit my friend’s grave with a bunch of our mutual friends and for whatever reason my dad thought I was lying about where I was going. When I was offended that he thought I’d lie about something like that and got emotional he said “Oh here we go with the water works, save it” and “people die, get the fuck over it. I’ve had friends die too.” My mom heard the whole ordeal and didn’t say a thing. I left in hysterics, hurt beyond belief and went to go visit my friends. 

Now, a year later, my dad’s friend has killed himself. This is obviously horrible. My mom, however, made a commitment to me which will only take an hour today. She now refuses to go because she thinks “he needs her” and “if I don’t understand that, then I don’t understand a marriage” and “if I don’t get it she doesn’t even want to come.” I reminded her what he said shortly after my friend died when I was an 18 year old still unfamiliar with grief. I said honestly that if he feels that way then he must not be THAT upset and if he is, I can’t really find it in me to sympathize with him. 

She now thinks I’m a complete asshole for feeling that way. And given the circumstances I can see what she’s talking about. But I figured I’d ask, Reddit, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxtyt1	2019-06-07 12:21:25		AITA For making my sister cry?	"Ok, so there is a lot of background here but I'm just gonna tell you the important stuff. My older sister has been convinced for a while that I am the favorite child. My mom and I do have a really good relationship, but it's one that I worked really hard on. A few years ago when I was first starting high school, we fought a lot. However, I realized that fighting was getting us nowhere so I started to focus on just communicating instead. 

Anyway, my sister and mom have been fighting a lot recently for reasons that I do not want to get into (but for which my sister is definitely the asshole). The other day, while talking to my mom, she revealed that my sister had told her that she thought working full time was a lot harder than being a stay at home mom. My sister is starting her first professional internship, so I understand that she's adjusting to working full time. She's graduating next year, and I know she's worried about what the working world is like. However, my mom worked really hard to raise me and my two sisters, and she seemed really hurt by what my sister said. 

So, I decided to tell my sister that my mom seemed hurt by it, so that maybe she could apologize (she's expressed to me in the past) In hindsight I do think this was a bad idea regardless of whether or not I was the asshole, but it happened. Anyway, my sister started crying and saying that my mom always misinterprets what she says, that that would never have happened to me etc. At the time her crying seemed really selfish to me. She was hurt by the fact that she hurt my mom?  If I had accidentally invalidated all of my mother's hard work to her face I would definitely feel bad about it. It seemed really self-centered to me that she was making it all about herself and making herself out to be the victim. I apologized, but I'll admit it wasn't super sincere.

Later that day I was ruminating on it though, and I realized that I might have been doing the same thing? I said something that made her upset and instead of sympathizing with her pain I was just annoyed with her. I didn't mean to hurt her feelings, but I don't think she really meant to hurt our mom's feelings either. So, now I'm wondering if I'm the asshole."		1	0
bxtwu4	2019-06-07 12:15:43	Slotherz	AITA for asking if my girlfriend can come to my good friends wedding with me?	"Ok full story with context.
I am good friends with a couple for around 10 years, the guy is arguably one of my best friends since teenage years (I'm now 29) and the girl I also become good friends with through their relationship.
 
They're getting married and of course, I am invited. The invites come out 1 year before the wedding because it is an overseas wedding and they want to give people plenty of notice. I am single at the time of the invite and I RSVP immediately for myself.

9 months out from the wedding, I meet a girl and get with her. It's a relationship with a real spark, the likes of which I've never experienced and my feelings towards this woman are very strong. We are together for about 2 months before I realise I'd like for her to come along with me to the wedding as a +1. When I plan to ask, I'm not expecting a yes or no, I'm not really expecting anything, I'm only mentioning it super early as a ""feeler"" to see if it was A) Possible and B) Ok with them.
So I mention it during a phone call with my mate and there is zero pressure in my request, the phone call was fairly quick and I simply asked if it was possible to squeeze her in as my +1. It should be said, that the couple knows my partner. She worked with my good mate for quite some time and they both think highly of her and were (at least to my face) supportive of our relationship. His response was *""I'll have a chat with the lady and let you know.""*

2 weeks later I get a text from him saying *""About the wedding, it's absolutely fine if she comes but the final numbers are not due until a few months before the wedding. I'm not trying to imply anything by this, but you two haven't been together long and you never know how the next few months will pan out. I don't mean to upset you by saying that but I'm sure you know where I'm coming from.""*

I was bothered by this and I made it clear, by saying *""I understand that you felt that way, but to me the comment about the length/instability of the relationship just felt unnecessary.""* His response to this was then *""Sorry I hit a sore point, There are heaps of people who we couldn't bring to our wedding so you asking me for a +1 with a new relationship was a bit of a surprise. I would have made that comment about any relationship that had been going that long to any of my mates. Every extra person we have adds to what we have to pay for the wedding.""*

There was no mention of financial burden of bringing extra people in his original response. Had that actually been the case, that’s totally fine. 

They feel like I was out of line asking and shouldn’t have. I feel like there was no harm in putting out a feeler and give them plenty of notice. I was completely fine with a yes or no and felt the comment about it being my relationship being an uncertainty (aren't all relationships?) was not needed. Am I the asshole here? Any insight on this is greatly appreciated because it has hurt my relationship with the couple.

bxtwi3	2019-06-07 12:14:49	Throwaway28734287	WIBTA for cutting off my family	" I came out to my mom as trans (ftm) last year. Her reaction with this is denial. Whenever I'd bring up my distress with it she'd act offend and upset because she didn't want to hear it. It finally got to a breaking point this year where I couldn't stand being called a female and cried. She got upset saying but ""you're a girl"" and ""why did you have to cry now when we are in a rush"" (we were putting away groceries). Anyways after that she started to try a little but she often avoids calling me male and calls me my dead name instead or just her. I also can't correct her because she said so. She also often gets upset for nothing. For example she often asks me what I'm doing and starts yelling at me because of the way I said it despite them having absolutely no malicious intent behind them. One time I couldn't find something and she started yelling at me for her having to get up (I didn't ask her to get up or help because her foot hurt).

Now lets get into the immaturity. She talks about people behind their back and thinks everyone has attitude. I ate something unhealthy once and she whispered to my dad ""that's why she looks like that."" I also had to bring her a cup with a drink and she began complaining about it being too small saying what am I a baby or something similar to that.

When I was younger she would sometimes turn my lights off and close the door when I got in trouble because she knew I was scared of the dark. I once said I was hungry when I was little and she began pulling everything out of the cabinets while screaming at me to eat it all. My dad had to tell her to calm down and hold her back. She'll also brush off my mental illnesses (I don't want to self diagnose but I believe I have depression and ocd). I do experience obsessions,intrusive thoughts and constant worrying along with emotional numbness, worthlessness etc. When I talked to her about the ocd she said ""people are so quick to diagnose themselves nowadays, it's just your personality"". I also brought up the emotional numbness and worries but she brushed that off as well saying ""if you can't cry it's because you don't have to cry"" or ""if you cried and didn't feel anything it's because you didn't have to cry in the first place"". I also bring up gender dysphoria but when I do she says it's caused by my weight. She also criticizes peoples job goals. When I was younger I wanted to be in the police force or a doctor. She now brings this up saying things about how I would be a natural at it despite me saying I do not want to pursue that career. She complains about my brothers job as well. 

Now onto my brother. My brother often lies when asked if he did something and lies about doing/seeing impressive things to people. 

So am I being a brat or over-exaggerating? I mean she's nice sometimes so I feel like I shouldn't be upset about it. I do have friends that let me cry to them and talk as well."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxtsoc	2019-06-07 12:03:39	kawwri	AITA for not wanting to go to Disneyland?	"Last month, my mother surprised me (21F) and my brother (19M) with plane tickets to go to Florida for one week during the summer. We're not fron the US so the tickets were probably a bit expensive. 
So the idea was for us to go to Disney world and Universal Studios for 5 out of the 7 days we'd be there, provided that we'd each pay for our own food and tickets, and we'd split the hotel cost. In total, each of us would have to spend about $1200 + foods for the week.
My brother used up all his savings but still ended up $300 short, so I paid for the remainder of it, adding up my costs to $1500.

My mom was very excited about the whole thing, but tbh I just... Wasn't... But I still played along with it because she seemed so excited and I didn't want to ruin it. 

So anyway, today my mom and I were taking about the trip, and I ended up telling her that ""if it had been up to me, I probably wouldn't have chosen Disney world as a destination"", and she completely FLIPPED OUT, started crying and telling me that I am the most ungrateful person she's ever met, and now is threatening to cancel the whole trip.

Though I still stand by what I said, now I'm thinking maybe I should've just kept quiet and left my mom to be happy, oblivious of my real opinions.

So reddit, AITA?

"I was talking to another co-worker today and asked when our next staff meeting was because we haven't had one in a while. She told me probably not for a while because our other co-worker was in an accident and not coming into work for a while. This was the first I've heard of it. 

She told me that him and another person were hit by another car. She didn't know any details beyond that he was not coming into work but was alive. I said ""that sucks"" and changed the subject. She gave me a disgusted look and said I was acting like an asshole. I asked her why and she said because I didn't seem to care that he was in an accident. I said I barely knew him and have only said a few words to him. She just got up and left the break room. 

I told my partner about this and he also said I was being an asshole. 

I don't know the guy. I've only said a few ""how are you""s to him in passing. He seems nice but I don't feel sad or torn up about it. He's also fine and at home recuperating so what am I supposed to feel? If I was in an accident I'm sure some of my co-workers would be indifferent also.

bxto93	2019-06-07 11:50:08	throwaway547283	WIBTA if I sued my boss for discrimination?	"I am considering suing my boss for discrimination against working mothers. 

My boss starts our workday at 2:00pm and we usually go until 8:30pm. 

It’s not the kind of work that needs to be done late in the day, but we do it late in the day because my boss stays up until early then sleeps until late. 

I have kids and this is not sustainable for me and several other working mothers in the cohort. 

I approached my boss and asked if we could begin days at 9:00am to accommodate the working mothers who need to be home for their kids (there are three of us) and was basically told they understand my concerns but one of the reasons they founded their own company was so they could set whatever hours they wanted.  They said I had the option to not take lunch and leave an hour earlier whenever I wanted to. I felt dismissed and like my problem wasn’t really given a fair hearing (the boss just defaulted to choosing their own individual comfort over three young families with no consideration.) 

I pointed out that it’s an odd and inconvenient schedule for all normal human beings and the boss basically said they recognize its unorthodox which is why they make it a shorter workday to compensate and that people voluntarily sign onto that schedule when they choose to work here and most enjoy having half the daytime free. 

I feel personally targeted and as though the boss is trying to inconvenience the working mothers and make this a hostile work environment for us. 

I was taking the temperature on how the other mothers would feel about coming in with me on some sort of group lawsuit or maybe even just sending a letter from an attorney suggesting the boss modify the schedule. 

 I got pushback from the one I approached who basically said “I don’t love the odd timing either but if you don’t like the schedule, work somewhere else. It’s not my place or yours to tell the CEO how to run the company.”  My husband said the same. I can’t tell if I’m just not communicating affectively or if they really think that.  

So before I press forward I figured it would be worth an unbiased third party’s take on whether or not I’m the asshole here. 

I moved my family for this job and am not in a position to quit without another position lined up. 

It was not clear that this late schedule was an all the time thing and I took the position thinking it was a temporary arrangement for an ongoing big project. 

But on the other side of the veil my coworkers don’t seem to feel as targeted by the selfish (and frankly, patriarchal) scheduling as I do. So I’m not sure anymore."	Asshole	0	0
bxtnai	2019-06-07 11:47:12	tiredlyexhausted	AITA for not wanting to meet my mom’s boyfriend?	My mom and I have had a pretty rocky relationship. She left my dad for another man when I was 5 and I am currently 17. My sisters and I always gave her chances to make up for the past, but we always ended up with disappointment and unkept promises. Over the years, I have never had any interest in meeting the people my parents date. I live with my dad and he never wanted me or my sisters to meet the women he dated either, however, my mom usually got offended when I told her I didn’t want to meet her past boyfriends. So recently my mom bought a house and her and I were on pretty good terms at the time; we were hanging out a bit and I enjoyed the time I spent with her. In the process of her moving, I helped her unpack and paint. Probably a month or two in to her being moved in, she told me she met someone on a dating website. I told her that I thought that was cool and asked her a little bit about him. She told me he was in the process of being divorced and he had two grown kids. I then asked her if she thinks it could be a serious relationship and she told me probably not because she doesn’t want to be involved with someone in the middle of a divorce. A couple months after that, we were texting about hanging out and I asked if we could just watch a movie at her house. She said yes and that she was excited for me to meet her boyfriend. I told her that I didn’t know that they were still dating or that he would be there and then she hit me with “well yeah silly he lives with me.” I got pretty upset at her and upset at myself for thinking that she could change after all these years. I told her I didn’t want to meet him and I hope that she can understand and respect that. She then got upset at me for that and asked “well what if I marry him? (even though they’ve been dating for like 3 months) We haven’t hung out much since that, although she still sometimes asks to hang out (including her boyfriend) and I just decline.

bxth1b	2019-06-07 11:27:05	__hoi__	AITA for renting a house with a friend, even though I had already made arrangements with a different one.	"About a year ago I made plans to go rent a room with one of my best friends. Now last week I got an offer from a different friend, also a close one, to come live with him as his roommates are leaving. 

The “different friend” has a way better offer, very close to the center of the city I live in, close to the bar I frequently visit and for lower rent than I would pay for a smaller place at a worse location. Also I have changed my lifestyle a lot the last year. I’m 2 weeks from graduation from university and I’ve been trying to start a social live again. I kinda let that go to finish my study as I’m very easily distracted and have no passion for school whatsoever. 

The friend I was going to live with lives a lifestyle that I was living a year ago, lots of weed and not leaving the house that often. He also is not very social and lazy and easily dislikes people. If he dislikes a person he won’t join in an activity with them. I don’t mind this, because I accept him how he is. However it will cause problems with the new more social lifestyle I’ve been adapting over the last few months. I recently quit smoking weed after doing it everyday for the best part of a decade because I get severe health issues from it. Google cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome for more info. This different friend I will go to live with now also recently quit and has also been trying to adapt a more social lifestyle for a while now. 

Yesterday I informed him that I plan to go live with the other friend as it’s just too good an offer to stay loyal to our original agreement. Let me add that we hadn’t been seeing places and the agreement never turned into more than talking about it. However he was not very pleased and visibly disappointed. Knowing him I have not heard the last of it yet. I also know that he won’t easily find another person he’d want to live with as he easily dislikes people. It took years for him to trust me and it would really suck if this affected our friendship, he is a solid dude. He definitely feels like I betrayed him.

TL:DR got a great offer from a friend to live with him. I accepted even though I already had plans with a different friend. The friend I will live with now fits my desired lifestyle way better as does his place. The friend I’m not living with now feels betrayed.

bxtge3	2019-06-07 11:24:53	HarryT1235	WIBTA If I stopped talking to a girl that likes me because she keeps getting off with other people?	"(First of all, sorry for the slightly rambling tone of this, it's the end of my first year so I've been going out loads and I'm very tired)

&#x200B;

So bit of backstory first:

&#x200B;

I'm a first year university student and around February/March I met this girl through mutual friends. A few days later she adds me on Snapchat and we start talking. We end up having a lot in common and pretty soon after, she invites me round to her room for a night. We end up making out but we don't have sex because I wasn't really comfortable with it since I hardly knew her. Since then I've stayed over at hers and vice versa a few times and all my friends know about it.

&#x200B;

Now obviously this doesn't mean we're at all exclusive or anything so she can do whatever she wants in her own time as far as I'm concerned. However about a month ago, she gets a little drunk and texts me saying that she 'really likes me as more than a friend but she's in a bit of a 'weird headspace' right now so she doesn't want to date at the moment.' (I paraphrased a little but you get the idea).

&#x200B;

I text her back saying how I quite like her as well and she says she's relieved that I didn't just blow her off and tell her I didn't care or something. Everything carries on as normal but I occasionally hear from our mutual friends that she's made out with someone in a club or had sex with someone random that she only just met and after she told me how she felt, it makes me feel a little jealous and like I'm just another guy that she can just call up randomly to give her attention whenever she wants.

&#x200B;

Pretty soon afterwards, I had quite a few end of year exams to do so I don't end up seeing her for about 2-3 weeks even though we're still chatting loads over social media. She's still going out and getting with people whilst still flirting with me and at this point I'm just a bit tired of it all and kind of want to just stop talking to her.

&#x200B;

I've already turned off her message notifications on social media so I generally speak to her less but I can't think on a non-awkward way to do it and therefore my main instinct is to just ignore her completely.

&#x200B;

The trouble is that next year she'll be living with my best friend so we'll inevitably see each other and I wouldn't want all our mutual friends to think I was an asshole for doing this.

Aaaanyway, when it was my actual birthday i got to hear that me and my brothers would be goïng to asia in the summer instead, problem was that i already had something planned with some friends of mine for 4/5 days and that had already been paid for (100/200 bucks or something) and this was planned months ago but when i brought it up nobody really cared.

Now, i don't wanna sound like a spoilt brat or anything but i don't have a whole lot of money and even though i can probably just ask my parents, i know that i probably won't and end up spending most of my own money.

I initially said OK but then about half an hour later I said I'd rather she didn't stay as the thought of it was making me increasingly uncomfortable. I don't like the idea of a stranger staying in my home, and it doesn't seem that my brother knows her well either. It's not his girlfriend and she lives hours away from him.

    Thing is I had plans for a big NYE party the night before and had this planned since October. He got tickets on Dec. 19th.  I told him I would pay the $100 for tickets the day he told me he got them
     All I wanted to really do was party on NYE and chill at the hotel pool next day. Had it planned for 3 month.  But I figured game would be cool. Then had second thoughts the night before.  I told him I am thinking I will just meet you guys around half time because I don't feel like being locked in for 1pm game kickoff.  Hotel only 15 minutes away from stadium. Figured I would head to stadium after I ate and chilled out for a couple hours.  It's vacation.
     He got pretty pissed when I told him that. I'm thinking to my self...he didn't even ask me for tickets.  Honest mistake...probably, but maybe not I'm thinking.
      So now I feel like he ain't being cool and meeting me in the middle.
       I ended up not going. I hung by the pool.
I got silent treatment from him for rest of the trip.

***The thing Is, this is kind of his way of doing things a lot of times.  I have a hard time believing he actually forgot to ask me prior to getting the ticket.   Especially afte we talked about it after the trip.  He is sticking by his guns and says he asked me. He didn't. 
      I gave him the benefit of the doubt prior to that discussion.  But now not so much.  
       When I think back to when he mentioned about the game in early December, that it was a ""hint"".  A hint that I should get the tickets for him on his birthday and make the arrangements. I would have taken care of that, would not have been a problem. The logical Thing to do would have been for him to straight up say that.  But that's not how he is. I'm supposed to read his mind. 
   Thing is, we allready had a surprise dinner planned for him at the end of the week. So I didn't even really make that connection at the time.
       So then he goes and gets the tickets him self with out mentioning it to me. It's his way of saying he is pissed. Because he never can come out and really say he is in a way that resolves any issues. 
     This is why I said Fuck it. I'm not gonna let this keep happening. If he was not meeting me in the middle, I was not gonna meet him.  I'm tired of it. 
 I love him, but he can make it difficult."		1	0

bxtcdj	2019-06-07 11:11:59		AITA for wanting to see my dog that I bought with an ex?	"Not using my regular account but a throwaway I've used before. 

My ex and I broke up about 6 months ago. I initiated the break up and moved out on my own in a tiny little unit with a communal backyard with no fence. I agreed to let him keep our dog that we both paid equal amounts for (initial payment, registration, vet bills etc) on the condition that he let me see him whenever I please and let me know if anything happens to him. 

That dog means everything to me and if it wasn't for him I would've left more than a year ago, not 6 months. The breakup hasn't been clean at all. There was no infidelity, I just felt after almost 5 years together we were turning into different people and we weren't compatible anymore. What followed was complete obsession on his end, hanging outside my new place, confronting me whenever there was a different car in the parking space and begging for me to take him back. I didn't want to, and was adament I only wanted to speak in regards to the dog. 

Finally about a monthish ago, he met someone else and started a relationship with her and I met someone else and started a new relationship. Its been great since then. I've seen my pooch regularly, albeit never just me and the dog. My ex has always been there.

Earlier this week I asked to have the dog on my own for a few hours, to take him for a walk, play with him and just BE with him. I hadn't heard back from my ex until today when he said ""I don't feel comfortable leaving the dog with anyone but my parents"" (He works off shore, 2 weeks on 2 weeks off). There's a LOT more to that message but character limit.

I just lost it. He wasn't going to let me see my own  dog (who is registered under MY name) because he doesn't feel comfortable leaving him with me for a few hours? Wtf?! I feel incredibly hurt because all I'm asking for is a couple hours to see my boy that I miss dearly on my own and get some quality time with him by myself. 

Now after a few hours and being able to calm down a little, I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for getting angry and telling him he was going back on his word? I said this was a major dick move on his end and I'm offended that he'd think I'd be so careless as to let anything happen to him. He said I could see him while the dog was at his parents but... I don't want to see his parents?! I can't think of anything more uncomfortable than that. 

Am I the asshole? Am I asking too much? If I need to expand and post screenshots of the messages (I was quite agressive) please let me know."		1	0

To give some sort of backstory to this, I’m a small female and I live alone.
A year ago when I was walking home alone at 4am from having ended my nightshift I noticed a man was following me. I did the whole thing where you walk in circles, walk faster, slower and he really was following me. I paniced and called my neighbour (a very large bearded man) and told him someone was following me and if he could meet me by the door to prevent my follower from entering our building and my neighbour opened the door for me.

I’ve gotten scared of men when I’m outside, like if I’m just walking and i see someone walking a few meters behind me I’ll get paranoid.
Everytime I enter my building I do it as quick as I can and close the door behind me quickly.

Today a guy I didnt recognise shouted for me to hold the door open for him and I pretended not to hear him and shut the door, he then started knocking on the door when he got to it and I again pretended I couldnt hear him and walked up the stairs. I told a friend what happend and he said I was being an asshole to that guy. The door has a code on it so my reasoning was that if he lived here he would know the code and if he wanted to visit someone they would have given the code. 

I didnt do what I did to be mean, I did it cause I’m scared of strangers, AITA?

What happened was that I one of us had to cook dinner tonight and my brother suggested to cook the (a bit expensive) fish steak since there is a fairly easy recipe for it (Oyster sauce and onions). He left to play games and I proceeded to thaw the fish and cut the onions. I left them there since it was still too early and the fish had to thaw. As I went up the stairs, he mumbled something but I wasn't able to hear it so I shrugged it off. I proceeded to attend to my auto-play game on my pc (Yes, I am one of those filthy casuals). When I was almost done so I could leave it and prepare to cook, my brother barges in and told me, ""Why aren't you cooking? We had a clear discussion about this!"". I scrunged my eyebrows and told him ""What. Lol. No we did not."". He grunted and left. Soon I went downstairs and found thh things that I prepared... in the trash bin. I went upstairs and asked him how to cook the fish in which he replies by saying he threw it in the trash. I then asked him why and he replied with ""I don't know', whilst focused on his phone with a sarcastic tone.

My brother is 26 years old and I'm concerned if this screams ""I have a problem"" or if he's actually reasonable and that I had no manners whatsoever.

Edit: He ordered a bucket of Chicken online for us to eat and to replace the thrown food. Maybe it was his way of saying he wanted chicken? I would've liked the soggy onions but the juicy chickens were yummy too!"	Not the A-hole	0	0

But every now and again I'll find myself in drama and question whether or not I'm as in the right as I think I am. I'm also an anxious person. With that, I usually talk to others and vent/ask for advice if I have a problem. Usually a few people at least so I can get different perspectives- online friends, irl friends,  even the occasional blahtherapy person. 

In the past when I've been involved in drama,  the other party has called this talking behind their backs or spreading rumors. *But*:

1. I never lie or alter stuff. 
2. I've done it in the past to warn people  (ie: ""I know you think __ is your friend but she said she doesn't like you and said this"") 
3. I find venting/going to people helps
4. In a perfect world I'd tell the person my concerns/issues with them. But I highly doubt that would be well-received in practice. In some cases that devolved into ""rumors"" I did confront the person head on with negative consequences.
5. Practically everyone I know talks/vents about other people sometimes with people. It's hypocritical at that point to complain about someone doing it.

Also as a precursor, I don't get ""called out"" for this in every relationship I have with people. It's only happened a few times with people I've fallen into ""drama"" with, but I still feel the need to question my behavior.

bxt5an	2019-06-07 10:48:20	Sheffistan1095	AITA for outing a persistent harrasser to his ultraconservative muslim family and local asian community	"Context - I'm a straight, white male. I used to work for a business tied to the local asian community

Niz is from a pakistani/asian family who are still very conservative in terms of their values, his sister and mother wear the hijab, older relatives wear burkhas etc) while he, his father and brothers have full-length beards and adhere to the various rituals of their faith without fail, routine prayer etc. Niz is very involved with the local community too so has a presence around the place. He is also in a managerial position effectively direct under the owner, who almost never shows up except maybe once a month and appears content to let his staff manage the place for him.

Niz himself isn't the hardest of workers, he usually lets the staff working under him do the work while he sits around, 'directing' us even though he could've pitched in. Fair enough, we're paid a wage - nothing I can do about it. Niz talks to me quite a lot, seems to come across as more overly friendly to me more than others. I'm a sperg so maybe I just don't pick up on it and cutting a long story short, he soon had me helping him in his office, giving me extra hours for overtime 1-1 with him etc where he was forward with me.

Eventually it gets to a point where things are awkward and I don't know how to handle it. Tries to grope me and I just pull away, walk out, a bit in shock, get sent nudes that include all but the face but they also have a snippet of his beard which from seeing up close I knew was his. I don't want to lose the job so I just try and keep my head down, but it continues - he's more persistent except he's clever in how he does it so he can get away with it. At some point I snap, push him away and say I'm not interested, not gay and to just stop and leave.

His attitude changes, gets progressively worse (difficult work, targeting me, etc) and at some point I try to escalate to the owner (I tried texting a number that I thought was his, turned out to be the 'business' mobile for customer calls)  Niz finds out and pulls me aside and says I'll regret it if I don't shut up. Eventually he made up some bullshit and said I was sacked. I'd been working there for only eight months and I was that stressed out from it I didn't think about the legal options, just being out of work. Right now, I've got a new job that's working great for me but back then I was just in such a state because I felt like I'd fucked up. 

Text him asking why and he gets really abusive and just leaves me feeling shitty. In hindsight I should have gone the legal route but I didn't think they'd take it seriously and was embarrassed so I just decided I would fuck him over as hard as I could, compile all the evidence (nudes, abusive messages, vague threat) and spread them out across the community including to his family. I haven't been there in a while but someone I know with ties to the community said Niz lost/quit his job and his family took him abroad to Pakistan and haven't seen him since."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxt1um	2019-06-07 10:36:07	mikaylamelendez	AITA for still being upset with my friend because of how she left our apartment?	"So this past year for college I lived in an on campus apartment with a friend of mine and another girl I didn’t know. There were always issues with cleaning and I did most of it (I tried to wait them out and hope they figure out that the bathroom smells terrible and we have ants so you need to clean the mess you made on the stove. They would leave the apartment a mess and smelling god awful. I would have to ask for them to clean up their own messes and they would take at least 2-3 days to do it.) 

So the apartment had two bathrooms, a kitchen, storage closet, balcony and a living area (and our bedrooms but each of us is responsible only for ours). To get our security deposit back, we needed to clean to the schools expectations. I said two weeks before school ended that I would do my bathroom and the storage closet if my other two roommates would do the rest of the place (honestly not that hard). They both said that was fine and I let it be. The day of, still nothing has been cleaned. The roommate that I didn’t know very well vacuumed a little so she did something but my other roommate did literally nothing. Her mom showed up and said we need to go and so she just grabbed her stuff and left. As she was leaving I asked if she was going to clean the kitchen and she said no because she was leaving. I told her to tell her mom to wait so she can do her part and I’m not stuck holding the bag. She said nah and I got really frustrated and angry that I had given notice and she just blew me off. I kept saying how I was going to have to clean it and she just laughed and said “your not gonna get over this are you?” And then left. My mom and I spent the next several hours cleaning. That roommate had also left a ton of stuff behind that I had to deal with unless I wanted to get fined. 

It’s been about a month and I’m still fuming and aren’t talking to her. My mom says I need to get over it but I’m still so pissed that I was left holding the ball. Idk if I’m being an asshole or not because to be fair I put more pressure on my friend than the other roommate to do things but at least the other roommate didn’t laugh at my plight.

He was at the time in the process of moving out of the country. When the time came to leave he wanted to break up because he didn't think we had a future. 

So about one year back he left for a country at the opposite end of the world. I still used to text him and chat and talk on phone because I was kinda obsessed with him. 

I tried stopping it once but I gave up after about two months and went back to talking. 

These four friends are in a different city (it will take me 24 hrs of travel minimum). Last month he was coming back to my country and told me that he will be in this city to meet our friends. He asked me to come. 

I said I would only come down if he gave me kisses. He said no. I said okay then I will pass. 

Few days later he texts me saying please come as it will be the only time everyone will be together. 
And then he says he's ready to make out with me but that he is uncomfortable with that. 

I said no, and that I can meet them later even when he's not here. He kept trying to pressurize me but I said no. 

He met them, had a good time and left. I haven't had any chat after that conversation.

Now I am feeling a bit guilty for not going and none of my friends can tell me if I was wrong/right.

bxsxpy	2019-06-07 10:21:31	temporarylabradoodle	AITA for not showing up my last two days of work?	"Hey guys,

Throwaway because my main account got some weird shit on it and this probably has some identifiable information on it.

So, last month, I got a job offer from a company in the same complex where I already work (different company though, other than physical location unrelated from each other). I decided to take it and gave my four weeks notice in the next monday. But, I wanted to take out all my vacation days left before this period was up, so I told them I wanted to take out the days left, and then have my contract officially ended. I was working nights at the time, for which I can't take off because it'd massively screw over the schedule and other night workers, so I said I'd finish my rotation of night shift and then I'd like to basically take off until my contract was up. This would be more like 5-6 weeks notice at this point. 

My boss agreed with this and I sent her the plan I had for that with how many vacation days I should still have. Turns out I calculated things a bit wrong and I ended up trying to take off 2 more days than I had left in my vacation days. I would've had to work these the last two days, Wednesday and Thursday. I told another boss honestly that I was coming back from a vacation abroad the day before than and I'd be pretty beat and not sure if I could get myself to show up for those days but I'd try.

I ended up not showing up for either of these days. I can make a whole bunch of excuses for this but I just honestly didn't feel like coming in. I was in vacation mode, I was tired, and I just couldn't be bothered. I called in sick for them and everything, I didn't just not show without notice. 

I asked some people about this and they seem pretty split on what I did. My parents think I did a shitty thing and should've just shown because it's a nicer way to leave things behind, especially as I'll still run into them in the cafeteria and such. Most of my friends think that because I gave them a heads up beforehand and called in sick properly that I shouldn't feel bad. I'm a bit on the fence myself and keep going back and forth.

​

On Christmas, I lost my cousin who was a police officer. My family was semi-devastated as his mother and father are very close to us (mainly just my parents). When they got the news, they were heartbroken. We are Fijian, and after the funeral, we hold a 13 day long ceremony 6 months and 1 year after the person has died. 

​

Now, I've (19M if that's important) barely knew the guy, but respected him since my parents were close. Me and him never really spoke mostly because he was about 12 or so years older, and there wasn't really anything we had in common, he was a police officer, and I was just a normal high-school (now college) student. However, in January, I got invited to go to Hawaii on a vacation which is this upcoming week. My parents said that even though it falls on the 13 day ceremony, it's perfectly fine for me to go. 

​

However, I realized that when I do take the million pictures I will end up taking on vacation, would I be an asshole for posting it? I feel like even though I'm allowed to go, everyone will see me as TA for being ""heartless"" and going on vacation instead of praying and fasting for thirteen days, which I don't mind doing, but I already got permission and everyone, at least in my family, is ok with.

bxstl6	2019-06-07 10:06:53	LongBeachBlackTips	AITA for asking my GF to take a 30 minute detour to pick up my brother?	"
So, after finishing my nightshift, my plan is to go home and sleep, then go to my GF’s and she will drive us both back to our home town for the weekend and drive me back on Sunday when she returns. 

This is the first time she will drive me back. We have driven back in separate cars, following each other, before. 

Quite often when I drive home, if my brother wants to go home for the weekend I will pick him up as it adds about 30 minutes to the journey, if that. It’s a very slight detour that is very much on the way

My brother texted me asking if I’d be able to give him a lift. I said I’d check but couldn’t see it being a problem

I asked my GF and she immediately started being weird

Here is a transcript of our text conversation

Me: Hey, can we go through X tomorrow as my brother is coming home and would like a lift if possible, but don’t worry if not

GF: Who’s driving?

Me: Well, you, we agreed that, I’m coming off a nightshift and you know how dead I am the next day

GF: it’s a Friday, hope the traffic isn’t too bad

Me: it shouldn’t be, X is only a tiny detour

GF: It’s a Friday, no such thing as a tiny detour
I’ll do it but I don’t really have a choice do I?

Me: If we just stay on road Y then it’ll go straight past X, therefore tiny detour

GF: I don’t ever go on road Y

Me: okay

GF: okay

Me: I don’t see why you’re making a big deal about this

GF: I said I’ll go via X. The big deal is that I have to drive an even longer journey. I have a long and busy day on Saturday. Your brother messaged me saying that your mum said I was driving home, and he asked for a lift. So I’m effectively being guilt tripped into it by your mum. 
Well, not directly by your mum, but she won’t be pleased if I don’t do it

Me: “You’ve not been guilt tripped into anything. If you don’t want to do it then don’t feel like you have to. X is on the way, it’s not a big detour at all. I’ve done it plenty and can honestly say it doesn’t make a big difference to the journey. If you feel you’re being guilted into it then don’t do it”

GF: 🙄 I said I’d do it. You asked what the big deal was so I’m telling you

Me: Okay but I disagree that you’re being guilted into it. When I’m driving home, if my brother wants to come home he’ll ask me. My mum will have told him that I’m coming home this weekend as well. More than likely he’ll have asked her if I could pick him up. She’ll have told him that you’re driving. Hence why he asked you for a lift. It saves him having to get the train and change twice, which is why he prefers if he can get picked up by me on the way. If anything, he’s asked you because I’ve set a precedence of picking him up on the way

GF: okay fair enough

She then has not spoken to me since which is very out of character

H: I'm hiring someone else then.

**M**: Then you're paying 100% for it.

H: Then give me his fucking number

H: Why cant I get things done for the house?

H: You're always mad that I don't do things for the house planning but how the hell can I if you don't let me?

**M**: Because then he'll have to go to home depot and buy all the supplies and I'm not paying someone $40 an hour to go shopping. I will personally discuss with him what we need then go to store and get it so then when he comes over he can start working.

**M**: There are 9 million other things you can do.

H: I could just as easily do that!

H: You are not being a team player

**M**: I want that work done when I am there. End of story.

H: End of story? Who are you my father?

H: If you can threaten that I pay 100% with picking my own person to do it. Then I can threaten the same for you monopolizibg Jacob? Like you are so not being fair. You are not team us. I am so fucking sad.

**M**: You're pissing me off. It's half my house and that work is spending my money, so I will be there when it is completed. Did you paint? Are all the screws out of the wall where we had decorations? Is all that stuff put back up? Have you gone through all the boxes of your extra room? How's the grass look? Have you been putting trash from the garage in the trash bin? Is the bin even out? They come tomorrow. Did you go get boards to reinforce your bed like I said we needed to do cuz the feet slide? There is probably 10 more house things to do that I can't think of right now.

H: You're pissing me off too.

H: Fucking great.

H: Have a good day.

**M**: You need to start taking care of all the little things in the house, not just focus on the big ones.

H: I can't believe I grabbed your jacket to wear today cuz I missed u.

H: It's my house I can do things on my own schedule

H: It's not just according to JASON'S PLAN

**M**: Well I don't want to be surprised at an extra $200 of my money being spent because I was not there to help make a major repair.

**M**: Yea your schedule of ""never""

H: Fuck you.

**M**: Cool. Bye. You did this. Turning phone off till I get to work."		1	0

bxsqd4	2019-06-07 09:56:00	Wh33ze	WIBTA for refusing to edit my friend's novel?	"A bit of background: I'm a freelance editor and writer. One of my novels is with a literary agency who are considering it for representation. It took me a couple of years to finish the manuscript including all the edits. I'm also a translator and I edit academic and fictional work on the side. I'm in the process of up-scaling my freelance business,  building a proper website and charging affordable rates for those who want to have their work looked at with unbiased eyes and provide constructive feedback and editing. 

&#x200B;

I have a friend, whom I've known since I was 15. She's usually lovely but often gets a bit manic and has grand delusions from time to time. English is not her first language, she speaks enough to get by but her grammar isn't good at all and her vocabulary isn't good either. In the past few months she's sat down to write a novel in English, which is great, I encourage everyone to write and express themselves. She sent a bit to read to her friend who told her ""WOW - you're going to be the next JK Rowling, this is amazing and you need to publish it."" Since then my friend has had it in her head that she can send an unfinished and poorly edited novel to US and UK publishers without knowing the industry and thinks it'll be a best seller. 

&#x200B;

I've read the parts of the story she's written, while the idea is good all the rest isn't. I'm proud of her for setting out to finish her work because that takes effort and dedication, and she should be proud of herself. However, I also know my friend is terrible at taking criticism and doesn't like it if people disagree or she doesn't get what she wants. I've had to be very careful and kind when I've looked at her work because I don't want to hurt her feelings. 

&#x200B;

When I've worked with editors before, they've always had quite a brutally honest approach to changes that needs to be made and if you make it into publishing those editors will be even more brutal. I don't feel comfortable editing my friend's work because I wouldn't be able to give it an honest opinion without hurting her and if I went easy on her I'd be betraying myself as editor. She also expects me to edit it for free because we're friends.

bxsop9	2019-06-07 09:49:54	Mox_Fox	AITA for being upset at my friend's advice?	"I recently decided to apply for a job in a different field of work than my current job. This new job is very competitive but has better benefits, greater job security, and many more opportunities for advancement. It's a reach for me, but I think if I try very hard I can make it. I've been studying for a test that will qualify me and reaching out to various people in my life for letters of recommendation to assemble my application. My dad worked in this field and has been helping me, but I've pulled my shit together and done a lot of research and preparation on my own. I'm nervous, but confident.

I've mentioned my ambitions to a few of my close friends and occasionally talk about the process in passing, such as specific things I'm reviewing as I study or sending letters to certain people. 

One of my friends has started giving a lot of unsolicited advice that feels like it undermines my intelligence/preparation. For example, I mentioned that I have been reviewing metric-to-imperial conversions because it's been a while since I've had to use them, and they'll be on the test. He took that as a cue to whip out a whiteboard and explain to me how to convert inches to miles, which I have no trouble doing. When I mentioned I'd sent off several formal requests for letters of recommendation, he asked me if I'd included a resume with them.

I have been working very hard on my application and workshopped the *shit* out of these letters, including a standard work resume, an additional summary of relevant past experiences, skills, and achievements, and sample letters my contacts can use as a starting point. I sent them after giving each contact a phone call discussing my plans and requesting a letter of recommendation over the phone. I'm way beyond remembering to attach a basic resume.

Up to this point, I've been working as a middle manager at a creative/performing arts tourist experience, while he is a project manager at an engineering firm. We are both several years out of college, but he has graduated more recently. 

I don't think he's being intentionally condescending, but it hurts that he thinks I need basic unit conversion or high school level career advice explained to me. I haven't expressed this frustration to him because I know he just wants to help and act as an older brother figure (which I really, really don't like, but can't fault).

She is unable to drive and was wanting me to take her. I told her that I couldn't take time off work to take her (it would have been an hour or so) and that she should take the bus.

I looked up the bus times and she could have taken a single bus, but this would have required her to walk for 10 minutes at both ends of the journey. An alternative was to take two buses with a 7 minute walk one end. I admit neither of these options was very good.

We also have a 12 month old whom she would have had to take with her, and it's raining heavily today.

In the past I have taken time off work to take her, and have always expressed displeasure at having to do so. I've told her she should arrange appointments early or late in the day to minimise the time I have to take off (although it's only a ten minute drive from our house to my work).

She didn't complain but she rang to cancel the appointment and it was clear she was disappointed in me. AITA?

Edit: I should add that my work is very flexible with regards to time off during the day,so it wouldn't have been a problem for them, but even so I don't like leaving during the day if I can help it"	Asshole	0	0

Apologies for bad English, it's my first language I'm just useless at it. This shouldnt be a long post luckily :)

So basically when the brand new iPhone 5 came out my dad bought 2 of them to replace his and my stepmums iPhone 4s
He then offered me and my sister the old iPhone 4s he gave my sister it for free but in order for me to get mine I had to give him my iPod 5

Little backstory I was 13-14 with 4 paper rounds making about £40 a week I was saving up for ages! 
2 of the paper rounds were mine and 2 were my sisters she was too lazy to do it so I ended up taking over so I could make more money 

I understand if he wanted to teach us a lesson about money but why should I be the only one to get this lesson? I was 13-14 and my sister was 15-16 

Their defence was that she didnt have anything to give so she should get it for free and because I worked I should have to pay? I still feel like i was in the right! But just want to know if i was actually in the wrong! 

Thanks

bxsjo6	2019-06-07 09:31:19	throwadoaodo524543	AITA for hosting a friend in less-than-ideal conditions?	"Hi Reddit! A few weeks ago a friend of mine broke up with her boyfriend, as she's moving to another country in a couple of weeks and was thinking of ending things anyway. After talking with my partner, I offered her our spare room rent-free so that she didn't have to stay in her one-bed flat with him. Before she moved in I made it clear that things are a bit hectic for my partner and I at the moment so to a) not expect the house to be tidy, b) we might have family members stopping by at quite short notice (and potentially staying over too), c) the spare room is hers for as long as she needs it, but it would be useful if we could have it back for visiting family this Saturday night (i.e. giving a few week's notice of this, and she does have other friends she can stay with nearby), and d) we don't have alcohol or pork in the house (I know reddit loves drinking and bacon and so does our friend, but we just prefer not to have them). 

I let her know before she left for work today that my partner's mum will be staying over tonight as well as tomorrow, but not in the spare room (we also have a sofa-bed elsewhere). And my friend is seemingly annoyed at me for a) not giving her enough notice (despite saying this was a possibility before she even moved in) and b) annoyed on behalf of me (?) as I'm a little stressed about tidying up before tonight (but I'm still fine with it). 

Whilst she's been here my friend has made a few comments about the house that have made me quite uncomfortable. They give the impression that she doesn't quite appreciate how two very introverted people have let her share their home for over a month, and my partner in particular is feeling quite annoyed. She's not had alcohol in the house, but she has come home very drunk on multiple occasions despite knowing it makes my partner uncomfortable. 

I realise now that she lives very differently to us and that she's probably felt uncomfortable herself with us on a few occasions. AITA for not being a good host?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Nobody else turned up which was sad but I was still hyped see the movie. When I see her she’s wearing jeans and a t-shirt and I thought damn she must be kinda cold but whatever we went in and did the usual stuff and all and now we are in the movies. She asked if she could use my jumper because she is freezing and I declined because I was freezing myself but said she could put the popcorn on her lap to make her feel warmer for the time being. After that she still complains about being cold and it got really annoying so I put the arm rest up so she could sit closer for body heat. Anyways after the movie she asks if I want to go to her home and watch another movie. I was said nah because I was gonna go to the arcade and do some stuff their she decided to come with and we did a few arcade things. I then saw a guy who moved schools a few years back and I talked to him for 5 or 10 minutes until he had to go. I then can’t find her in the arcade so I message her and I am just left on seen. I think she may have left because I was kind of rude about talking to this old friend but I think 5 or 10 minutes by yourself isn’t that long. I think I am a slight asshole but I want to see what others think. Aita?	Asshole	0	0
bxsess	2019-06-07 09:12:52	tallandstretchy012	WIBTA if I tell my fiancé that I don’t want her family living with us?	"

Me (27M) and my fiancé (26F) (I’ll just call her “V”) are getting ready to start looking buy a house to live in after we are married and start our lives together. V has brought up to her family that her and I are looking at houses and her mother got this idea in her head that she was going to move in with us along with V’s dad and her 25 year old sister. She was so adamant about it that she even said the three of them would live in the basement and me and my fiancé would have all of the main floor and upstairs area. She also said when me and V find a bigger place later, we’ll just leave them this house and they will continue to live there and rent from us. For me there doesn’t seem to be a compelling reason they would want to move in. Maybe they want out of the apartment they are renting. 

V’s parents had a house before but they lost it to foreclosure and they have been renting ever since. For the past couple years the father has been the only source of income as an electrician. The mother stopped working for whatever reason and the sister never worked or had a job. They all stay at home most of the time and they don’t really talk to anyone other than family. The whole family has been nice to me from day one but there have been instances of pettiness towards other people when the mother doesn’t get her way. On top of that they have this dog that I can’t stand, and I love dogs. It was never trained or disciplined, and it gets spoiled so it craps all over the place and barks literally non-stop. It also has a history of trying to attack people.

Now V is talking to me about house buying plans as if they will be moving in. She doesn’t see a problem with it because it’s her family. She said they can cook and clean for us all the time. Like wtf? We’re adults and that’s stuff we should be doing on our own anyways. I’m not really on board with the idea at all. I told her the only way it could really work is if we had one of those houses with a basement/ income suite with a separate entrance, kitchen, bathroom etc. (Which isn’t really in the budget) I’m not comfortable with the idea at all. I feel that me and V wouldn’t get the privacy and space we need as a married couple and I wouldn’t be able to have any time alone because someone will always be at home. I also don’t want to put myself in a situation where I have to be financially responsible for them. Most importantly I think my marriage will suffer. I’ve heard stories in the past with parents/in-laws moving in and it usually doesn’t end well for the couple. 

I haven’t had an actual conversation about this with her other than expressing resistance to the idea. Im not sure how to go about it yet but this talk will be happening in the near future. So in this case, WIBTA if I tell V I don’t want this to happen?

Edit: I thought I should clear up a few things about my situation. 

1. We are both western culture/ American where this isn’t normal. If it was a cultural precedent like first gen Asian for example I would understand but still be against it.
2. We are having a longer engagement. This wedding isn’t until another two years. I have time to talk but like you guys have mentioned, this needs to happen ASAP which WILL be happening believe me. 
3. I feel as a couple getting married, we should be able to have serious talks like these without things blowing up. The answer for me is going to be a big fat no. I’m not going to light myself on fire to keep her family warm. I know what I have to do. I just wanted unbiased outside opinions on the matter.

I moved into this apartment in february, and it’s so cheap in a really nice neighborhood, less than 500 and we get four rooms and it’s across the street from my work and 10 min walk to my campus.
Ever since I moved in my roommate has been late on rent, bills, everything.
when we go grocery shopping I pick up most of the food, and last time picked up almost all of it, minus her few things. after almost spending 200 her things ran up to about 50 and her card declined. so I told her to give the cashier her cash and I’d pay the difference. I know, you shouldn’t offer to help unless it’s from a genuine place, but she just doesn’t work that much, when I know she could be.
plus she has a cat that she’s barely home to feed because she’s always at her boyfriends. who she would cheat on in the very beginning.

anyway, she told me a couple days ago that she’s pregnant, and she keeps going back and forth if she’s keeping it... but i’m scared that if she does keep it her boyfriend might move in and then try to raise it here.

She asked me my opinion on if she should keep it and I told her it has to be her choice, but that babies are very expensive.

But idk if she really is going to or not.
I just feel bad because I feel like maybe I shouldn’t have told her that, I just don’t want to be stuck taking care of a baby that’s not mine and having to continue paying so much.

I work from home where I just watch viral videos all day because I am a media buyer. (yes, it's a real thing and I love it). My wife is usually home by the time my shift starts, so she's sitting around watching TV while I work. That part doesn't bother me. What bothers me is she asks me to cook her dinner or go get her something in the middle of my shift. It's annoying because I have to get contracts out fast or handle emails for the company. 

The other day she asked me to go get her phone charger from the bedroom (15 ft away) while I was in the middle of sending out a contract. I told her ""I'm working"" to which she mocked me in the tone of ""oH, i'M wOrKiNg"". I just told her that I didn't feel like she respected my work hours, then put my headphones on so I wouldn't say anything I didn't mean.

It's been a really fun time for everyone overall but with one very unfortunate draw back, we are barely spending any time together just the two of us. We've been here a week and have only had sex twice. I know, that's really not that bad, but it's not exactly what I envisioned on a honeymoon. Instead of waking up and cuddling and spending time with my wife, I usually wake up to her on the phone with her mother or already running off to meet her mother somewhere to do something. Before the wedding it was always to take care of something related to the wedding. Now it's talkin about the wedding. I know it seems shallow and I'm conflicted about it, but I feel very neglected and I feel like we should be making this more about us and spending time with friends and family as an added benefit, but we should really be wrapped up and enthralled in each other this whole trip. We haven't been. The thing that hurts the most is it seems like I'm the only one that feels this way, my wife does not seem to have very much interest in spending time with me almost at all. I'm sure that's an exaggeration, but it just feels really crappy. Thoughts?

Tldr: my wife and I are doing a destination / family vacation / honeymoon all in one.

Last year I was in a really bad spot and ended up being admitted a few times for various medical conditions that threatened my life. I went to part time Uni, essentially withdrawing from two of the four courses for the first semester, and now I have to do a Retrospective Withdraw Without Fail, so I don’t have to pay for those two courses and my GPA isn’t affected. Along with this I need supporting documentation from a professional and the head of my course. It simply had to be a letter saying ‘she was not ok, I think her going part time was instrumental in not exacerbating her condition at the time’ 

I sent an email to my doctor as we are in regular email contact due to the nature of my conditions and I got a reply from her medical receptionist exactly as follows ‘there is a cost of $45 per 15 minutes taken to produce the letter/report. If you would like to formally proceed, please advise and I will make the request with Dr XXXX’ AITA for being pissed off at that, thinking it’s absolutely inappropriate and wanting the letter regardless? I realise that you should get paid for the work you do and don’t want to be a choosing beggar, but I feel the price is excessive and inconsiderate when part of the problems I was having was that I couldn’t afford the medication to keep my heart going at the time and I’m still not 100% financially stable. And that every other professional I’ve contacted for a letter hasn’t charged me anything and has gotten back to me with the letter within a week."		1	0

bxrt3q	2019-06-07 07:45:07	throwawayasshole1233	AITA and by extension my family for them trying to set me up with someone?	"Throwaway here. Ok so ill try to keep it short and simple.

&#x200B;

Background: I (28M) was dating a girl for approx 6 months. Things were pretty rocky & we ended things 2 months ago due to too much cultural differences (this is important later on). We have recently been trying to reconcile things and made a little bit of progress in the past week but are far away from been an actual couple again (haven't seen each other for 2 months) Also the only people who knew about my relationship was my parents and siblings, but they all think me and her broke up approx 2 months ago (again, this is important info)

&#x200B;

So rewind to 2 days ago. I was at my parents house, my dad awkwardly asked me if me and ""*Jane Doe*"" are still together or not to which i replied ""more or less no"".

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few hours and were at a family event - aunties, cousins, siblings the lot and all is well. The next day my brother called me to tell me her heard some chatter between my aunties that apparently there was a woman there that took a liking to me and shes trying to find a suit for her daughter & might possibly want to see if both parties would be up for this ( im from an asian background so this is a very common thing - women in the families playing match makers). I simply laughed it off.

&#x200B;

I thought id mention it to *jane doe* thinking she'd laugh it off like me and it wouldn't be a big deal. I was very wrong. Some of the things that she said were: Your family are all pricks, Your dad probably orchestrated this whole thing which is why he asked you about us ( this is 100% wrong - i know my dad and he would never do anything like that). Your brother should have told them about me. This is why i'll never be taken serious as a non-asian & your family will always try to separate us. This deeply offends me that she judges my family whom shes never met. For context my mother is non-asian and so are my elder siblings yet *jane doe* still has some weird insecurity about not been a first choice because she isn't Asian which is total nonsense in my eyes & the reason my extended family didnt know about us was because we were in the early stages of a relationship and the whole bf/gf is extremely taboo in my culture - you only announce it to wider family once its an official coupling.

&#x200B;

What im tried to tell her is; 1) the aunties in question have no clue about *jane doe -* they think im single. 2) my parents and siblings think me and her are done. 3) i dont see how this is any different to one of her friends thinking shes single and trying to set her up?

&#x200B;

For comparison this is the same girl that told me i had no right to be angry that a guy (that she has no romantic link with - seemingly a stranger) sent her a dickpic on snapchat and i should laugh it off...

&#x200B;

I think of this is an aunt simply thinking im single (i got a divorce a year ago from my previous partner) and trying to set me up with someone - no malicious intent.

I tried explaining this to her that if my entire family knew we were together then this wouldn't have happened and my aunt wouldn't have even entertained that idea with her friend.

&#x200B;

TLDR: My aunt who thinks im single tried to set me up with a friends daughter, my on & off GF went ape shit saying my family dont respect her."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I go upstairs to put my keys in my room and then she walks upstairs with a cup of drink from my fridge. She then asks is it ok to drink it after it’s already been poured...I tell her that you’re supposed to ask to go into the fridge and pour it. Not pour it and then ask for permission to drink it. She then decides to leave my house with no communication and leaves the door unlocked. After a moment, I go out there and ask if she’s leaving or staying and she says “that’s a dumb ass question, if I was leaving I wouldn’t leave the door open, you’re irritating me can you leave me alone for 10 minutes?” I say fine ok and go back inside. Another 20 minutes pass and I go outside again and ask her if she’s leaving or staying. She says she’s just gonna go and I can pour the drink back into the big jug I had it in...

The last thing I said to her was we don’t need to have a convo tonight  but we definitely need to have a convo in the near future. We haven’t talked since and I sent her a text message, no reply. I called her later in the day and she denied the call.

I work at sort of call center for a quite big company in one of European countries. My responsibilities from time to time require answering phone calls, our clients mostly are natives with some exceptions.

Carl and my friend Kevin randomnly combined friend groups. It's been a complete nightmare people dating other people. Carl's sister is involved it's just a bad situation.

Carl has struggled with depression in the past and does therapy. He LOVES positive attention. He used to be strictly against drinking but now all the sudden he realized how much his ""fans"" love it. 

This new group doesn't look out for one another they tell each other what they want to hear. I've always been one to speak my mind and use my own experience to help my friends out. Any criticism to him is very taboo and it results in not getting invited to stuff. He's also trying to get Instagram famous and only posts photos of himself.

bxro2l	2019-06-07 07:25:37		WIBTA if I decide not to name my baby after his father?	"I’m going to try to and lay out the facts as unbiased and simple as possible even though the situation is in no way simple and I am most definitely biased. 

Me (27F) and my boyfriend (31M) have been together on and off for going on three years now. We have lived together on and off for two of those years. However, whenever we break it off, I go back to my family.  I am finishing up my Masters Degree and work part time as a tutor which makes it hard for me to be able to afford a place on my own. 

There’s been a lot of me moving in and out and it’s just a very stressful situation. 

This last December we were broken up but still having sex. Neither of us wanted to be with other people but we weren’t getting along outside of the bedroom. I ended up getting pregnant. Neither of us even discussed the possibility of not keeping it. We agreed we would try and be a team and do this together. (I’m fully aware that a baby doesn’t fix problems and all of that. I’m not against abortion but it’s just not for me. So please let’s not get into any of that stuff). 

I forgot to mention that he had been in the process of buying a house for awhile at that point. Nothing to do with me. He was buying that on his own and would have regardless of our situation. 

We find out that we are having a boy. He wants to name the baby after himself. I have never been a fan of his name in all honesty. I’m not trying to be mean. But I really don’t like it. We aren’t married, he doesn’t pay for any of the baby stuff. Health insurance, medical bills, anything for the nursery etc. He has bought a few onesies but that’s it. 

He put a roof over my head but it’s a constant reminder that it’s not mine even though he did fix it up. 

We got in a fight on Monday and I’ve been at my sisters since.

There’s obviously a lot more to the situation that I can’t convey in one post and this is already pretty long. 

But WIBTA if I refused to name my child after him? I really just want to find a name that we both like and can agree on. It makes me sick to my stomach thinking that I don’t get to name my child and he could potentially be named after someone who has caused so much stress in my life these past years and especially these past 6 months."

My brother died 2 months ago. He is a westerner with an asian boyfriend. When he died I was contacted by his boyfriend. His boyfriends' english is not really good, but we can understand each other very well. As our conversation progressed he told me this

""If i want to be rich....I got married with another guy for a long time ....not with ur brother""

This triggered me a little bit as it was just days after my brother died. I just let it pass though. He also said similar statements when my brother was still alive, wherein my brother jokingly apologized ""sorry for putting you through poverty"".

Today we were chatting again and he mentioned something similar, this time anger got the better of me.

For some context my brother wasnt poor in any way, he was a succesful dentist and have owned several apartments etc. His boyfriend also didnt just marry him for money or something, they are both hardworking with their own jobs etc. I really just got offended by that statement for some reason. It felt like my brother was being insulted."	No A-holes here	0	0

We have a great work relation and everything usually is just great, the issue is, he's extremely religious.
Now this isn't an issue for me, I let him do his bible readings, let him pray and generally I'm really respectful about it.
But the little things are just slowly starting to add up for me.
He invites me to come to church and stuff weekly and I always politely decline.

The 2 days I am at home I love partying, drinking till 4-5-6 AM.
I've never brought this behavior to work FYI.
But this sunday, I had gotten home at like 5:30 AM and went to sleep when a few hours later he shows up at my doorstep with his family, asking if I wanted to come to church with them.
I got a little mad and told them ""leave me the fuck alone during weekends, i was sleeping"".

We havent spoken about this much at work, i apologised and such but nothing feels changed.
I just don't think something like this is normal?

He ALWAYS plays religious music in the car and I normally listen to music or watch a movie if its a long drive.
Couple weeks ago (I had a week off) he needed a ride, I didn't mind picking him up.
Once I arrived (1 hour drive) and he gotten in the car he just straight up turned my low volume music off. 
Not his type of music I guess, so we talked about his week and what happened at work.

Next week we get in the car and after a couplr of minutes, I turn off his music and he flips about it, saying he can play his own music and what he likes.

After all this I'm seriously considering quitting but I'll feel like an asshole if I do, since he's not a bad guy.
He always buys whatever I ask in terms of food and items I need at work.

Edit: I see some people mention telling him I am not interested. I have. Every time. Many, many, many times. I've told him several times not to bring it up again either.

"Dad got last minute tickets for a bowl game that just so happened to be on his birthday and it was his college alma matter. Just so happened to be playing the game in the city we were staying at.
   He got 4 tickets.  I was surprised that he got them.  I did not know he was doing that.  He never asked me prior, but he asked my brother and my uncle. 
   I never said to him that he didn't ask me,  because I figured why start trouble. Plus I thought it would be cool to go.  I am a fan of college football. 
   Thing is I had plans for a big NYE party the night before and had this planned since October. He got tickets on Dec. 19th.  I told him I would pay the $100 for tickets the day he told me he got them
    All I wanted to really do was party on NYE and chill at the hotel pool next day. But I figured game would be cool. Then had second thought the night before.  I told him I am thinking I will just meet those guys around half time because I don't feel like being locked in for 1pm game kickoff
    He got pretty pissed when I told him that. I'm thinking to my self...he didn't even ask me for tickets.  Honest mistake...probably, but maybe not. 
  So now I feel like he ain't being cool and meeting me in the middle.
   I ended up not going. I hung by the pool.
I got silent treatment from him for rest of the trip."		1	0
bxrdob	2019-06-07 06:47:38	JustASan	AITA for not wanting my friend's sister to copy my perler design to make her own?	"I enjoy making perlers at times by finding images of pixelated game characters and using my insight to decide which color beads to use at times. I had given my friend a couple perlers from a certain highly popular pixelated game as a present since it was a fun hobby for me and he enjoyed them. 

Now enter his sister, who makes perlers herself every once in a while. She saw my designs and thought that they looked nice and she wanted to make them herself, and asked me how I made them. I explained that all I do is look up the character on google images to see a clear image of what to make and that she could easily do that. She claimed that it would be much easier to look at the one that I had already made. I responded that I take a few artistic liberties with the exact shades of colors I use since multiple colors could work, and that because of that I would prefer she use the internet rather than copying my design.

After saying that she completely withdrew her desire to make the perler because I didn't want her to take the ""easier"" way of creating the design, and she thought that looking up the character herself was too complicated. My friend agrees that she was being unreasonable at that point, but his sister and his mom both thought that it was rude of me to not just allow her to copy what I made. Honestly, she could have copied it anyway and I would have never known, but I just wanted to make my opinion clear.

All of us are ages 19 to 23 and my friend and his sister still live with their parents, hence their mom having an opinion on the matter.

The grammar in the captions leaves a little to be desired, but overall it was a really great experience to reflect on all the memories from my last year of high school. 

I posted a pic of the yearbook on my snap story with a short thank-you to the yearbook staff, telling them that I couldn’t have asked for a better way to commemorate this kickass year. And in the corner, in tiny text, I *jokingly* wrote, “might wanna proofread sometimes tho” with the laughing emoji. 

A sophomore from the yearbook committee then promptly went off on me, telling me that I have no idea how hard they work and such. I’m talking paragraphs of text here. One of the seniors from the committee totally agreed with me and was not offended by the remark at all, but I still wonder if I’m in the wrong. AITA?

bxrdcc	2019-06-07 06:46:19	Jumpy-cricket	AITA if I want nothing to do with my neighbor who invited us to dinner and wants to give us his keys?	"We live in a small appartment complex with another couple, the man seems very dodgy to me and I don't want anything to do with him but my boyfriend is becoming closer friends with him. He had just invited us to dinner and had offered my partner the keys to his appartment saying ""I really like you and your girlfriend,  I think I can really trust you two and would like to give my keys incase of an emergency blah blah"". I think this is a complex situation because to me it seems like he would want us to give him our keys too, or something. I just know that nothing good will come from such an exchange. 

Some background: this man is my partners drug dealer (just pot) but he also sells strong drugs, he is in his 40s while we are in our 20s and have only had a handful of talks with him. He really gives me the impression of my past life, I had dated an abusive manipulative drug dealer when I was younger, and he gives me a strong impression of the people who my ex hangs out with. 
I have seen him yelling at his pregnant wife on the street outside my apartment before, it was bad enough that I was about to call the police but didn't (I'm living in France and still learning the language, if I saw it get physical I would have though). Also a few times he was speaking really badly to her in the corridor calling her sick in the head and such, this was in her last trimester. 
He doesn't seem to have a proper job, just does odd work under the table. 
The couple of in counters I have had with him he has promised us a lot of things like discounts on furniture cause he knows some guys or free work done on the car but hasn't followed through which I expected (and didn't want anyway). 

I think of myself as a nice person but I have been manipulated enough and experienced enough in my past to know better now from a person like this, whereas my partner thinks I'm 'judging before I know everything', he says we fight sometimes too and the guy seems nice. 

We had a fight in the morning about this and I said I didn't want to have anything to do with our neighbour. Does my partner have a point or AITA?

bxr9na	2019-06-07 06:31:58		AITA For Bringing Up a Controversial Topic at a Family Dinner	"Okay reddit here's an interesting Dilemma for you all. First a little background:

So yesterday I saw an interesting opinion on r/unpopularopinion. It bascially said that he thought people who were going to be born with serious disabilities such as that they couldn't walk, talk, and their quality of life would be  extremely poor, should be aborted so that their carers can have a better quality of life. I thought this was an interesting topic of conversation, and was unsure about my opinion on it, so thought I would ask some of my family about it.

I had forgotten to during the day, but later on we were going out for dinner to celebrate a family birthday. My sister and her boyfriend were there, and her boyfriend has a nephew who has cerebral palsy, however his nephew is not unable to walk, and is able to do a lot of things that other children can do, of course there are some things he can't. 

So after we had eaten dinner, we were sitting around talking about this and that. I decided there would be a good opportunity to pose the discussion from earlier, I thought my sisters boyfriend would have a good insight on it, and my dad is a pretty big Catholic so he would bring some of that side into it. So I asked the question...

Wow, if looks could kill. Silence fell around the table as my mum stared at me with a look so intense I thought my very soul was being removed. My sister immediately jumped in accusing me of 'wanting disabled kids to die' and I was called insensitive. After this nothing else got said. 

Once my sisters boyfriend left, my mum and sister went after me for a few minutes, saying I had said a horrible thing, and that it was completely insensitive. I tried to explain I was asking a question, and wanted a discussion but they were having none of it. They said that I had upset the boyfriend, to which I replied 'If he is upset about me trying to have a discussion then he is being a pussy' (not my best choice of words I admit, and I like the guy I was just angry). Everyone got pretty pissed and then we eventually ended it on a silent agreement. 

So what do you think redditors? Was I being insensitive? I genunienly asked a question about the topic which I had seen on reddit relating to those who were severely disabled and had no quality of life, not even like my sisters bfs nephew. Also I didn't pick a side I was asking objectively. 

TLDR:
Asked a Controversial question which had some relation to someone at a dinner table and got wildy misunderstood, got called insensitive and then proceeded to insult my sisters bf out of anger."		1	0

I’m coming back to the apartment in September but since I don’t really know these people and they won’t be coming back, I want to move all of my things to my room.

bxr5qb	2019-06-07 05:57:06	carlaolio	AITA if I waste a chicken salad my sister bought the ingredients for?	"*warning: this is very, very, very petty* 

Yesterday our mum said she was making pumpkin soup now that it's getting really cold. Hearty. Warm. Yum. 

My sister gets this grand idea of making a sweet chilli chicken noodle salad and shows me the recipe. I politely said it looks good. Next thing I know, she's at the shops buying the ingredients. Mum told her pumpkin soup was for dinner but my sister claims they will compliment each other (no...)

So it's around 330pm and she says ""I am going out to see a friend. Do you want me to brown the chicken now?"" So for one, no. It's hours away from dinner time and chicken mince doesn't need browning, it gets cooked when it's needed. At dinner time. And then I realise she had NO intention of cooking it and left it up to me. So I cooked it up for her and by this point I am not very hungry and I had eaten during the day anyway. She started pressuring me to eat it, knowing I have an ED. She's telling me how much her kid likes it and how good it tastes. I ended up having a small bowl full and I'm not the biggest fan of it. I then realise she is also eating mums pumpkin soup... A lot more soup than salad. Yep, sure fine. She then tells me she's going back on her diet tomorrow (today) and that she would hate to waste the salad and it needs to be eaten. So I told her I will eat it. 

I planned on having leftover soup tonight and low and behold, there's fucking none left because she ate most of it instead of her salad. Only the salad is left. I *was* going to have both but now I am just going to bin the salad. I didn't get dinner stuff out for tonight as leftovers were going to be my go-to. 

I'll also add that she uses a lot of passive aggressiveness and guilt tripping to get her way. She's is in her 40's and I rent a room of her so I have no way of speaking up against her when she does shit like this.

Does this make me an asshole? She is *really* into not wasting food but I feel like she pressured me to cook it and that she realised she didn't really like it and then made me feel guilty if it gets thrown out. I don't want the fucking salad and I never really wanted the fucking salad."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxr5id	2019-06-07 05:56:24		AITA for not going to the sporting event on my dad's birthday when we were on vacation?	"Dad got last minute tickets for a bowl game that just so happened to be on his birthday and it was his college alma matter. Just so happened to be playing the game in the city we were staying at.
   He got 4 tickets.  I was surprised that he got them.  I did not know he was doing that.  He never asked me prior, but he asked my brother and my uncle. 
   I never said to him that he didn't ask me,  because I figured why start trouble. Plus I thought it would be cool to go.  I am a fan of college football. 
   Thing is I had plans for a big NYE party the night before and had this planned since October. He got tickets on Dec. 19th.  I told him I would pay the $100 for tickets the day he told me he got them
    All I wanted to really do was party on NYE and chill at the hotel pool next day. But I figured game would be cool. Then had second thought the night before.  I told him I am thinking I will just meet those guys around half time because I don't feel like being locked in for 1pm game kickoff
    He got pretty pissed when I told him that. I'm thinking to my self...he didn't even ask me for tickets.  Honest mistake...probably, but maybe not. 
  So now I feel like he ain't being cool and meeting me in the middle.
   I ended up not going. I hung by the pool.
I got silent treatment from him for rest of the trip."		1	0
bxr4qf	2019-06-07 05:53:52		AITA for sending food back to the kitchen	My boyfriend and I are backpacking Europe from the US and decided to splurge on a one-time fancy meal. We each got steak medium rare. Maybe things are just different here but they came out very very rare. Mine was at least edible but his was cold inside. Not room temp, cold. We got in an argument because I wanted him to send it back to be cooked more and he said only a gigantic asshole would ever send food back. I said it wasn’t some minor inconvenience, it was inedible and would make him sick. These steaks were €30 *each* (which is a fucking crime considering how small and low quality they were), so there was no way I was paying that for him to not even eat it and then going out and buying another meal. Ultimately he refused to send it back so I took his plate and found an employee and politely asked them to cook it a but longer which they did without fuss. My boyfriend was very embarrassed and kept apologizing when they brought it back out.	No A-holes here	1	0

I told her shorts wouldn't cover any more than my boxers and would make absolutely no difference in the amount of ""skin Im inappropriately showing off"", they would just be an extra unnecessary layer and make down there hotter, and asking me to wear pants is stupid considering I don't say it's inappropriate for her to wear skirts or dresses.

bxr2v7	2019-06-07 05:47:45	Giantpancakewawr	AITA For Playing a Role in my Best Friends Relationship Ending?	"I(Male, this will be important later) have close with my best friend(We will name her Anna) for roughly two years now, and we have been through a lot of hard times together. During this time though, neither her or myself had interest in dating each other due to not being each others types, and we knew we had a great friendship as is.

About a year into our friendship, Anna starts dating this guy named James(Not actual name, just filler). During this time, initially meeting James, he seemed like a very nice and swell dude who I got along with well. We had played some video games together and everything seemed for the most part pretty well. 

Then, one day Anna and myself had gotten in an argument in regards to her grades. At the time, she had not been doing assignments for her classes (She was in high school at the time and wanted to go for a law degree in college) but rather spent time with James. Her grades slipping caused me to be slightly concerned. I confronted Anna in regards to her grades and this argument broke out between us. During this time, Anna had been calling her boyfriend James for support. Eventually we blocked each other on everything except SnapChat in anger. I was relaxing and taking a breather to gather my thoughts and come back into the conversation later.

I find her then messaging me on snapchat:

Anna:""OP, why in the world would you start talking shit behind my back and saying this stuff to my friends? You seriously are a fucking asshole for doing this! James said that you sent him messages about how horrible of a person I was and how he should be careful about dating me.""

OP: ""I never said any of that lies, I haven't messaged him since I checked up on his incident weeks back. I can send you proof if you want to.""

So I screenshot the messages between James and I and send it to Anna. The only messages I had sent him were to check up on him because Anna was worried about his safety one day due to him struggling with depression at some points. Anna eventually responds back saying that, ""James said that you deleted those messages behind his back."" We decided to call in order to understand everything.

During that time, I thought and understood that Anna and I were very close. He could have thought that something could happen between Anna and myself, but have made clear before would not happen under any circumstance. 

In that call, it was Anna, James and myself. Anna at this point was neutral and she confronted as to why James had lied about the things he did. He denied everything and when asked to give proof of the messages I sent that was talking behind Anna's back, he couldn't provide anything but to just trust him.

With issues Anna has had in the past, she had not been a big fan of lying and broke up with James at this point for trying to escalate our previous argument in trying to have Anna no longer be best friends with me.

bxr2o7	2019-06-07 05:47:05	GG_mage	AITA for not finishing my meal	"So went to dinner the other night with some friends. I wasn't really hungry so I ordered a salad to be polite. But it was a horrible salad. I realize I'm sounding petty but it was bad old lettuce with gross watery tomatoes and... Well anyways the point is I ate less then half and pushed the plate away from myself calmly. 

Before the waitress could take my plate an acquaintance at the table said to me ""Sorry do you mind if I finish your salad?"". I said ""no of course not, go for it"".

He then proceeded to say ""Ya know just, peace corps and I know how precious food can be."" I took this comment to mean he had been in the peace corps and seen some really poor situations. I'm a pretty talkative person and usually would have started a conversation about his life and volunteer work and such, but I was so taken aback (and frankly embarrassed) to have discussed it further with him and just said ""oh.. yeah""

After the evening I thought more on the topic. And yeah, that was kind of shitty of me to waste food. I shouldn't have ordered anything really and not let the social pressure get to me. And maybe that was his point, to make me realize that. But then I also started thinking about all the food that's wasted in restaurants and how he might view those items. Would he go around eating everyone's tiny leftovers because he actually believed in not wasting a bit of it? Does it really make a difference if he ate the food? 

Idk maybe I've slightly answered my own question. But was I the asshole for not finishing a few pieces of lettuce and tomato?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxr1r1	2019-06-07 05:44:02	blackpantherz	AITA for expecting strangers to share with my kid?	"After grocery shopping with my two year old today, we stopped at one of those little ride on coin operated cars for kids to play on at the shopping centre. Another woman with her two children arrived at the same time and she put the coins into the slot while her children climbed aboard. As there were four seats I casually asked her ""Can we share?"" She replied ""sorry, no."" I was stunned and asked her ""really!?"" Which my daughter repeated in the same time of voice, which made me laugh. I pulled her out of the car and back to a seat and she began repeating ""we share? We share?"" Louder and louder until I could not ignore it so I told her that these people didn't want to share with us. The lady started shvooting me filthy looks and when the ride finished she addressed us with ""was that so hard?"" 
My husband thinks I'm the asshole, because her children may have had anxiety or been sick or unvaccinated or any other number of reasons why they didn't want to share. And she was originally polite. 
I think that my response while unnecessary was not unreasonable, I did take my daughter off the ride, and she shouldn't be so offended by the ramblings of my two year old. 
So, am I the asshole?

Edit: Thank you all for your feedback. I see that my response was rude and I've used this opportunity to discuss boundaries with my daughter. I would like to clarify that all three children had climbed in to the car before any money had been inserted into the slot. My daughter was in the passenger seat, her oldest was in the driver's seat and her youngest in the back. He jumped in the front when I pulled my daughter out."	Asshole	0	0

It started to upset me because I just felt that I can't reconcile what I see in myself vs. the pictures of girls he follows/likes. I spoke to him a few times about it (&told him I'd want to break up over this) and he said he will stop unfollowing new chicks. Um we met each other thru instea- he slid into my dms. I know it sounds dramatic that I'd break up with him over this but it's just because I can't get the idea of him oogling over chicks on insta, even chicks from uni- it makes me feel so terrible, i'd rather end this (2 month relo) & put myself out of my misery & focus on fixing my insecurities.

I also unfollowed him on instagram because I didn't want to pry on him/ stalk his activity. But he's been asking me to follow him on instagram and SO I did. AND DUH I found out that, he hasn't stopped following randoms chicks??

I know a lot of this is stems from my own security and I have to deal with it myself, but I'm just really upset that he doesn't seem to care about me despite me telling him how shit I feel about myself :( AITA? I feel like i am but I cant seem to get over this :(

&#x200B;

EDIT\*\*: I've never asked him to stop following chick, neither have I asked him to deactivate his account. I've never suggested any of that because I didn't want to impose anything on him, so instead, I just suggested that we break up because I need to deal with my insecurities- to which HE DISAGREED & OFFERED TO UNFOLLOW those cuties. That's why I unfollowed him on instagram so I wouldn't see who he follows etc but HE was the one who kept asking me to follow him.. And i did///"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxr0j1	2019-06-07 05:39:45	unseen_penguin	AITA for being upset that my bridesmaid scheduled her wedding during my honeymoon?	"I got engaged last year (May 2018) to a wonderful, goofy man. A couple months later, we were picking who would be in the bridal party. One of the girls I picked to be a bridesmaid is a really good mutual friend of mine and my fiancé. She’s been awesome helping with the invitations and even took some beautiful engagement photos as her wedding present to us. 

&#x200B;

She’s been a wedding photographer on the side for several years now but has been having some job trouble, so money is a little tight. I ended up buying her bridesmaid dress for her because I didn’t want being in my wedding to add to her financial stress. 

&#x200B;

My wedding is at the end of next month (July 2019), and a few days later, my fiancé and I are going on a 9 day honeymoon with a cruise that we scheduled in January. 

&#x200B;

Our friend also got engaged almost a month ago (May 2019) and due to her financial issues has decided that she is also going to get married this summer. She told me she was thinking about early July, which would be 2-3 weeks before my wedding. 

&#x200B;

That brings us to today. I got a text from my friend asking when my honeymoon is. I told her when and she said that it’s unfortunate because she’s decided to get married 2 weeks AFTER I do on the day before we get home. She said that she had wanted to ask me to be a bridesmaid but that my honeymoon is more important. 

&#x200B;

This really annoyed me. If it were any other type of vacation then I would have cut it a couple days short to be there at her wedding, but that’s not possible with a cruise. 

&#x200B;

I wish that she hadn’t even told me that she wanted me to be a bridesmaid. She chose a weekend that she knew would probably conflict so both my fiancé and I can’t even go to her wedding. I don’t even care about being a bridesmaid. I just wanted to be there. I know that I shouldn’t be a consideration when picking a wedding date, but it feels inconsiderate to pick a date so close to my wedding then be disappointed that I can’t go? 

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I tell her how upset I am about her choosing a date close to my wedding?

&#x200B;

Edit: I realized I worded that wrong. I'm not actually upset that she chose a day near my wedding. I'm upset with how cheerily she told me while trying to make it better by saying that I would have been a bridesmaid. I'm not a fan of people trying to make bad news happy by being cheery about it."

bxqvnc	2019-06-07 05:23:05	DaTinduh	AITA for bringing a date home to have sex?	"I have a date for this weekend and from our flirty banter I can tell that if dinner goes well she will be willing to come back to mine.

I have a roommate who lives in my basement bedroom. He just started a job at a local manufacturing plant and gets up early to be at work at 5-6am depending on how much OT he wants and usually gets back around 3:30-4:30 in the afternoon. Usually he is up for a couple hours and in bed by the time I get home around 7.

As a courtesy I let him know a couple days in advance that I have a date and will likely come back to have sex. His response was, verbatim, ""Please don't"". He went on to say that the girls I bring over are loud and he can't sleep, and he's on mandatory OT and three weekends on, one off right now.

I dated a girl for about a month earlier this year who has been the only girl I've ever brought over. Every other girl I've slept with since we became roommates I never brought over, and even this girl came over for sex three times in our relationship. Every other time I went to hers. She was indeed loud, which is why I went to hers usually.

I told my roommate that it was unreasonable to expect me to not bring a date over or to have sex in my own house, and that I had left more often than not. I thought I was already doing my part by warning him in advance. If it bothers him that much, or if he feels like he would lose sleep, I think he can either wear headphones to bed or sleep at a friend's if it is truly that unbearable. I don't think it is fair to expect me to plan my dates around his sleep schedule, especially when he works three weeks straight at a time.

For the record, neither myself nor my date are going to be up late. We both work the following day.

Am I the Asshole here?

bxqva8	2019-06-07 05:21:48	Jamesyoder14	AITA for getting my cheating ex girlfriend kicked out of her parents home?	"To start things off I'm 20 and she's 19, and I'd known this girl for well over a year because we'd worked for the same department in our company and we'd become quite close friends that talked about everything with each other. It wasn't until back in January of this year that we actually pursued a romantic relationship after she and her boyfriend at the time had been broken up for a little over a month after having dated for close to 2 years.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to a couple days ago, I found out she'd been cheating on me for the past week and a half after she'd reconnected with a guy she was friends with back when they were in school. I'm no idiot, I'd already had my suspicions that she may have been seeing this guy specifically because unbeknownst to her some friends of mine had been keeping a close eye on her after seeing them at the movies together. I basically knew everything about this guy before she even mentioned his name to me which was an immediate red flag. After I confronted her with evidence that she was seeing another guy behind my back she immediately became defensive and outright hostile towards me, demanding that I tell her who I'd heard everything from and threatening to end our relationship if I didn't. Long story short I didn't tell her and we broke up that very same day and I moved on with my life.

&#x200B;

A couple days later after we dropped all contact she messaged me out of the blue about a subject we both shared similar interests in, trying to find some way back into my life for god knows what reason. This renewed my interest in finding out if she'd actually been cheating on me or not so I got into contact with suspect number one and sure enough he let me know that they'd been dating for a week and a half prior to our breakup. Even though I was already suspicious of her, I can't even describe with words the pain and anger I felt seeing images of her in his arms and the expression of pure bliss on her face. The thing is however, he didn't even know she was in a relationship at the time they'd gotten together because she'd never even mentioned me once. I took that opportunity to show him proof of our relationship and the fact that we'd just recently broken up and he dropped her like a bag of bricks.

&#x200B;

After having thoroughly ruined their relationship she wouldn't stop calling me and messaging me telling me how I ruined everything and how she was finally happy(fucking ouch). After feeling thouroughly betrayed something in me snapped and I contacted her parents giving them proof of everything that had happened up until that point, letting them know about all the illegal shit she'd done during our relationship and I even exposed the fact that she'd been sharing details with me about their crumbling marriage. After hearing all of this undeniable proof, I sucessfully drew her parents to my side turning them against her and getting her car taken along with her getting kicked her out; I don't know where she is now, but I honestly don't care.

Edit: Not a shit post by the way, and since a few of you think that way I removed the eyes abd ears everywhere part and explained what I meant instead fir clarification. Sorry for the incoming text wall, I'm at work so I can't format it too much.

Also I forgot to mention the fact that she'd apparently pulled similar shit before in her last 2 relationships and it was the sole reason she had a falling out with her best friend of 5 years who seemed to like me. I renewed contact with that friend of hers who showed me messages sent between the two of them and she'd apparently been seeing a different guy pretty early on in our relationship. 

She broke things off with him because he tried getting with her friend behind her back, but was ratted out by said friend, which is pretty ironic. She apparently tried convincing her that I was good for her and that her games needed to stop which led to the end of their friendship sure enough. This was one of the driving forces behind me taking things so far since she seemed to enjoy hurting men, and was almost the sole reason her parents kicked her out because they'd heard similar rumors before, but this was the first time they had proof.

Me and my girlfriend (GF) were talking about it and I said I would want to see it because of how bad it's going to be. I didn't actually mean it, I did just say ""I want to see it"" and I do understand how that can come off as...ya know I want to see it. Tickets are expensive and my GF asked ""what!?! You would pay $35 to get a ticket??"" Alarmed. And I know the person who owns the company and they are always looking for an usher and like me and would let me get in for free if I usher. So I explained that. This really upset her. She made it seem like that was my plan from the beginning and she never asked me I just said ""I want to go and this is how I would do it"" and I kept explaining that wasn't the case. My ex girlfriend is also in the show and that upset her quite a bit as well. I shut down the idea of me not going to see her quickly and she got quiet but the argument continued. 
It cam up that I'm a low person for seeing a show just to see people be shitty in it. And I went on to explain that people watch bad movies all the time. And this is no different than that. I also would never outwardly shit talk these people, I just want to enjoy the cringey masterpiece for myself. I would tell her because I tell her everything. And she kinda hates a few people in it  and would kinda like to hear they did a poor job. I'm indifferent towards  everyone in the cast maybe besides my ex and one other dude, they are stinkers. She kinda started to put the nail in the coffin by saying the only reason I'm going is to shit on these people and watch them fail. This was sort of a back peddle. But I do want to support the director and the guy who runs the program. It wouldn't hurt ya know? They aren't bad people and they always need help. I was pretty close to them at times.

bxqsir	2019-06-07 05:11:34	Laughs-In-Spanish	AITA for selling my old phones my mom bought me?	"Okay, so over the past four years, starting when I was in high school, I've had five different phones. Each time my mom wanted to upgrade my phone, I wouldn't want to but she would always convince me by saying she already bought it and it's on the way or something to that effect. I didn't know what to do with the old phones when I upgraded them, so I just left them in my drawer to be forgotten. This repeated itself until I had four different phones collecting dust.

My mom and I often talk about possibly selling them in that phone recycling machine we saw in Walmart throughout the past year or two. I assumed that she just wanted to get rid of them.

Today, I finally gathered up all four phones and told somebody, I think it was my brother, that I was going to recycle them and hopefully get some money. I wasn't keeping it a secret, so when my mom asked if I was taking them to Walmart, I said yeah and then my mom asked for me to double check if I deleted everything on them and to take out any SIM or SD cards it may have. I did and then my older brother and I went to Walmart.

Two phones were worth $5 each and the other two were supposedly worth nothing. I cashed out the $10 and my bro convinced me not to recycle the other two in favor of selling them on EBay. On the way back, I forgot who brought it up but we both decided to go to Starbucks with the $10.

When we came back, my mom was upset that I sold the phones without asking her and supposedly she only wanted to check the price, not sell them. Couldn't argue back really as I realized I fucked up and just wanted the moment to pass. I tried to tell my mom that I thought she didn't care about the phones and wanted them gone at the time. She compared me to a druggie who steals from others just for quick money, but I thought she was overexaggerating. Then I remembered that she grew up with a not-so-good family and now I'm just laying on my bed wondering if I have a problem.

Okayyyy, so I work in a grocery store as a head cashier, there’s normally supposed to be 4 of us, but there’s only 3. One is fairly new and is deciding to step down in a few days because it’s too much for her, and the other one is just not so great at her job she doesn’t do nearly half of the tasks assigned, calls out and goes home early frequently, and all management is aware of this and is not happy about it. 
So that leaves me running the front doing the work of 4 people , I’m not going to say I’m fantastic at my job but I do my best , and I go above and beyond for every task.  Lately the scheduling has been off as well because corporate has a new graph they want us to follow and it of course sucks, so the nightly coverage is up until 7- or 8pm then there’s a closing cashier and me. 
it’s busy up until close (10pm) so every chance I get I’m trying to run to the back close out a register which takes about 10 minutes per till. There’s 8 tills, and of course I have a whole checklist of other things I have to complete as well. So recently one of my four managers we’ll call him R. Tells a different manager who’s closing (J), that I need to be out front and asked why I’m hiding out in the office instead of out front cashiering, and says I probably just want to get out early. J gets along with me very well and realizes how hard I work he tells R that it’s been really busy lately and I’m just trying to get my work done . So of course I kind of get pissed off because it’s not like I’m letting the lines get long, if I need to help the closing cashier knows to call me and I come out as quick as I can. Also during that time that I’m trying to close out tills R is just sitting in the office with the girl from the vitamin department who should be out on the floor because we have a lot of theft over there. She’s also a back up cashier so she could be helping out front instead of in the office just talking with him. Which happens on a normal basis because there have been multiple complaints about her being in there too much with him. Besides the point R and I usually get a long pretty well but sometimes he is too hard on me I feel. I noticed he is  that way with other people in different departments too, but it’s almost like it’s the people who actually do their work instead of the ones who should be talked to. So I was debating on talking to the actual store manager and just telling him how I feel.  I’m doing the work of four people I’m the only one who gets my job done 100% and some help would be nice instead of being scolded for not doing enough while the R and the vitamin girl aren’t doing their job. I don’t want to get anyone in trouble though or look like I’m just complaining for nothing. So AITA for feeling this way!?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxqqs4	2019-06-07 05:05:47		AITA for being cold and distant after my fiancé puked at our wedding rehearsal?	"I’m sitting here after my fiancé got mad, said I’m trying and went to bed. We’re getting married in 2 days.

Tonight was our wedding rehearsal. Everything went alright I suppose, up until the priest started doing the consents and the questions that we are to answer “yes or I do”. At this point, my fiancé started flipping out saying I need water. Where’s my water and leaving the rehearsal where I, the priest and our wedding party we’re standing. Alongside some parents and family in the pews of the church.

We stood there for a good 4 minutes until people started going to see where he was. Turns out he was in the bathroom throwing up. Some of went outside for a smoke to wait it out and when he seemed ok. We continued.

But the rest of the night seemed awkward as hell. Now, my fiancé is a mental health worker. He presents to various groups of people and comes across as confident and comfortable (which he says he is). 

Expectedly, or unexpectedly, I don’t know... I took it as he is NOT ready to get married. Especially the time that things started happening (the marriage part). 

We talked after and I said I’m not sure after that. Maybe I’m superstitious but it just didn’t seem like the greatest sign. He explained it as there was people around and that he was nervous about being ‘the center or attention’ but I can’t help but feel that’s bullshit since he’s actually fairly confident and charismatic. However, he has had a past of throwing up - having a sensitive stomach (I.e he eats something gross or has flem in his throat - he’ll get sick) but neither of these things happened. Anyhow, I told him I’d try to get over it.

Since the rehearsal I’ve tried to get back to normal but I can’t help but give him the cold shoulder at times. He’s been accommodating but is now getting mad. It’s just since it happened, I’ve had this gut feeling that he’s not doing this for the right reasons - but I can’t help but tell myself it’s just my fears and reading into situations. But after the priest called to see how he was feeling and if he was ok with proceeding with the marriage, it got me all fucked up again and I started being slightly cold because I feel like it’s just not right.

bxqqng	2019-06-07 05:05:19		WIBTA if I were to dump my boyfriend who is a recovering alcoholic?	"Me and my boyfriend have only been together for a little over a month and I just found that he's been lying to me about what he does every other Tuesday. He's currently on probation for a DUI he got last Fall and he's been attending court-ordered DUI programs meant for rehabilitation, alcohol testing, and paying fines and fees. He's been keeping this a secret from me in our time together and I just found out about all of it. He also told me that he's going to start community service as well.

 He told me that he's been sober since the DUI, he's served his jail time, and he's attending all of his classes to get better. He keeps claiming to be a better person and trying to change, though he has told me that his license has been suspended and that I'm going to have to drive him around every now and then, and now I really can't help but feel badly about this. My last boyfriend before him not only had a drinking problem, but he also had me driving him around everywhere since he didn't have a car of his own. Those two issues just made the relationship really messy and heated and I'm honestly getting flashbacks to that relationship now.

I'd be lying if I said breaking up wasn't an option on the table for me. I want to believe that he's changing for the better and he's putting in the effort to clean up his act, but I honestly don't know. Breaking up with him at this point in his life feels like a scummy thing for me to do, but I really don't want a repeat of my last relationship and how ugly it got. What do you think?"		1	0
bxqpyn	2019-06-07 05:03:11	Scout2019	AITA for not wanting to put an anti-bark collar on my dog?	"First and foremost my golden retriever puppy is the love of my life and is spoiled rotten. I’ve only had her for eight months and my partner and I are serious about her obedience training but despite this, she is vocal and we’ve told by trainers it’s a trait of her breed.

Unfortunately, we live in the middle of a small country town. We’re renting and half the property is fenced off with a large metal fence, we’ve blocked our dog’s access to the front corner but the remaining quarter faces a park. It’s this side that causes the problems. Since she was a small puppy a neighbour on this side has been giving our girl treats over the fence but now doggo is bigger doesn’t like that doggo barks at her when my partner and I are at work. This neighbour is a retiree and a friend to the landowners (who owned two dogs before us)

I’ve checked with at least three other people who live nearby and they’ve told me that my pup doesn’t bark aggressively but does bark loudly at people who walk close by along our fence line. They’ve also said it doesn’t bother them. However, this morning the neighbour confronted me, I had a feeling she would as she’d gone cold for a while. She said my dog barked way too much and asked me what I’m going to do about it.

I feel terrible but I’m thinking I’m not going to do anything. My dog is inside between 6pm and 9am and doesn’t bark during this time. Whenever I’m home or have come home in the middle of the day i find her sleeping. I already play with her a lot and walk her everyday averaging about 50km a week. 

Also, I honestly think it’s a good thing she barks at people who walk along that fence line as there’s a path on the other side of the road and that fence isn’t very secure. 

The only option I can think of is buying a one of those collars that sprays your dog when she barks. However, I don’t see why that would be necessary in this situation, particularly because when I walk down our street to go to work several other dogs do the exact same thing.

So would I be an absolute dick if I ignored my neighbour’s feeling and let my dog bark at people who walk by our house when I’m at work?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxqp93	2019-06-07 05:00:57		AITA for not supporting my brother when he was upset	"My brother is an accomplished and decorated engineer. He graduated college a few years back and got hired to work in the “National Defense” industry doing work vital to the military operations of our country. He quickly rose through the ranks to become a very senior figure in his area. Originally, he always said his plan was to get some experience and leave the industry ASAP. Since getting on the fast track to success in the industry, that plan (understandably) faded.

I am a more recent college graduate who now works fairly senior on the staff of a well-known antiwar politician in my country. My antiwar and anti-interventionist beliefs run very very deep, and this internal drive is what has allowed me to impress my peers and bosses and quickly rise to the position I now have. I work closely with many organizations interested primarily in ending the militaristic stances of my country and reforming our foreign policy. 

This seems like the setup for some weird comedy, but it’s the situation we are in. I’ve never hassled my brother about my beliefs on his job or really discussed it except for asking if his plans were still to soon exit the industry. I think we’ve both recognized it’s a powderkeg have avoided the topic of the nature of our work. 

A few weeks ago there was a very large protest at my brother’s place of work, against specifically the work he does in National Defense. Going from work, my brother was splashed with fake blood and the crowd hurled insults at him. He called my parent’s house (where i was visiting and the only one home) near to tears, and explained what just happened. I said, exactly, “That sounds really rough i am sorry. Do you like working somewhere and doing something that draws that reaction from people though, man? Do you think they could have a point?”

My brother hung up, and texted my parents what I said and that I am an asshole who doesn’t understand the real world. He told them he would not visit home while i was there except for holidays. My parents are also uncomfortable with his job but supportive of the opportunities it has awarded him, and so just asked me to apologize to make the issue go away.

I refused to apologize, and feel i was in the right for bringing up the point of the protesters (to dissuade people from doing the job my brother is doing). I understand i didn’t offer him emotional support in the moment while he was understandably upset, but honestly i did not want to undermine the (real) lesson he was being taught in the effect his actions have on the world and their consequences. I realize it could be “not that deep” and i should have been there for him, but i can’t ignore my deeply held conviction against what he is doing. I can see the myself being both TA and not TA.

TLDR: Brother was assaulted outside of his workplace for the work he was doing, i chided him when he called upset."		1	0

I went into the bedroom while she went upstairs and went to the bathroom and got ready for bed. I laid down on the floor of the bedroom and started petting our dog. I pet the dog for 5 minutes. She came downstairs and sat on my face and said something (neither of us remember what she said but I remember it being something aggressive but it’s entirely possible she said something playful). I immediately punched her in the vagina. She said I was being rude for punching her in the vagina. I asked her if it was ok if I put my dick in her face.

bxqohr	2019-06-07 04:58:36		AITA for not changing my mind about never wanting to get married or have kids after being with my girlfriend for the last five years?	Since the beginning my [M25] goal was always to graduate college, live cheap, and use the few thousand dollars a month I’ll have to spare into a few business ventures. Along the way I met a really cool chick, my girlfriend [F28] five years ago. I let her know from the beginning my goal was to never get married and never have kids, she was hesitant at first but ended up being cool with it. Mind you the entire time I wasn’t pressuring her at all, I actually encouraged her to leave me if she had ling term goals that were different. Well as you can tell where this is heading over the last year she started to change her mind. I let her know numerous times that it’s a huge desire in life to give up on for me, and if it’s important she should leave now before it becomes hard for her to have kids or chances for deformities become high. (Sorry if that’s a false fact, I just always heard into your thirties that the chances get really high.) She decided to stay, but in the last week or so her mom had a talk with me letting me know I was holding her back in life. I have no desire to change at all, and my girlfriend ended up letting me know she broke down while talking to her mom about it. I just personally want a few properties on the beach, and want enough money generated from business that I can travel the world when I feel like it. I can’t stand the thought of getting a regular suburban house and devoting the next twenty years to raising a human being. That’s something cool, and I’m glad I’m here because my parents chose to do that... buuuut that’s not me. Well I tell her maybe we should breakup if she really can’t deal with it, and she calls me an asshole who’s too stuck up to change my mind after five years of true love. I still love her, but I’m not giving up on my life goals especially since I just graduated college and I have enough money to being pursuing them. I can’t lie I feel really bad about this now.

Made the mistake of telling my mum, who lives in a different city. We do have family living in my city, so she tells them and now all parties except me want to go to this family dentist. 

Problem is that the dentist and they live on the other side of town. The procedure might take 3-4 sittings, so I am looking at 6-8 hours of travel time. This makes me super mad and I get into an argument with my mum over the phone. Especially because the dentist I selected is a 7 min walk away.

bxqfo6	2019-06-07 04:29:30	Nomoneylottaproplep	WIBTA if I accepted money from a boy “loved me” for a year.	"It’s a lot of money.

We’re both 19 and the guy in question was “in love with me” for a year. Not sure about his feelings now, but idk if it’s 100% platonic.

I use quotes because he was fucking with a lot of girls. He would try and tell me I was different and he feels about me differently. But I wasn’t about it.

I did sit him down once and tell him I’m not interested. He told my friends he was heartbroken. 

His family has a lot of money, but he sells drugs on top of that. Which is another reason why I didn’t want to be with him. I know a lot of guys in my neighbourhood who felt forced to sell dugs to support their families, he was doing this shit for fun. 

But he is a sweetheart. He goes powerwalking with his grandma and her friends to make them smile. He’s a genuinely good person. We have the same sense of humour too. But I don’t date womanizing drug dealers. 

There are 3 kids in our area  we took in, and along with the two siblings I already have...shits wild. But it’s worth it and we’re all family. We all love each other, that’s enough. Unfortunately, love doesn’t pay bills and we’ve been really struggling recently. Allowing the three kids to go into the system is NOT an option. They are so loved in our house. 

My mom is getting a promotion at work and things are going to be A LOT better when she does. So this super struggle is only temporary. But we’re really struggling now and could be facing eviction.

Yesterday, I took the kids out to the park in a much, much nicer area (ours isnt rlly safe). The boy was there power walking with his grandma lol. His grandma asked me if the kids were all mine and I said no. He said he was going to drop her off and come back to chill with me. When he came back, we were chilling while the kids played. He asked me about them and I explained the situation.

I just got so overwhelmed when I was talking, that I just bursted into tears. Idk why, it just happened. It wasn’t on purpose.

He insisted on giving me money to help us out. I told him I couldn’t accept and he didn’t take no for an answer. He said it’s “no strings attached, I got love for you”. It was a back and forth until we dropped it “for now

But he got my etransfer from my friend and sent the money regardless. The message is “I have love for you”. Which is not the same as “i love you”, you “have love” for friends and family. It’s sitting in my account waiting to be accepted. It’s a lot of money. A lot more than I’ve ever seen a paycheck.


Am I going to be the scamming hood bitch who took money from a guy who liked her. And she STILL didn’t date him. Wouldn’t this be taking advantage of any feelings he might have towards me? I’m conflicted morally.  But if I do this, my mom wouldn’t have to stress out so much. Or maybe she’d be disappointed in me. 

Then there’s the implications that really scare me. But with out situation, AITA to my family if I DONT accept."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxqfnw	2019-06-07 04:29:28		AITA for parking in the same spot. My neighbor isn't so happy about it.	"TLDR

Recently my parents landlord told my family that the neighbor across from us doesn't want us parking our cars in front of her house. It's just a street curbside parking. Open to anyone. Our side of the street is a fire lane..However, I keep parking there just to see what she would do next. 

Once, she parked right in front of me. So she ended up blocking her own driveway, so i don't see a win there.

Other times she would just park at that spot herself even though her driveway parking is more ideal to park in. She used to always park in her driveway. 

At some point she yelled at my aunt who was just visiting.

It doesn't bother me at all when she gets there first. I just imagine how her anxiety levels rise when she sees my car.

So finally the other day she put out her trash cans out, as did the rest of the street, and she blocked my car from the front & behind. HA! I know it bothers her so bad. 

I had a strawberry ice pop in my hand moving the trash can on her lawn. I was almost finished with the ice pop so i placed it to melt on the handle so when she grabs it she will have sticky hands. 

I was just feeling a little petty.

So today I left a cheap vibrator with a note that says:

HI, I NOTICED YOU SEEMED UPTIGHT ABOUT A PUBLIC PARKING SPACE... MAYBE THIS WILL HELP."		1	0

bxqeja	2019-06-07 04:25:54		AITA for lying to my friends why it didn’t work out with a man I was dating	"I was dating a man whom I met trough my friends - they used to work together but were never close with him. I liked him A LOT and he was playing hot and cold all of the time - he’d do big “relationship” steps then he’d leave me on seen for days or just disappear for 2 weeks. My friends knew about all of it but proceeded to say how he’s definitely in love of me maybe way more than I have feelings and thought he just doesn’t want to come off as needy and creepy too early in the relationship. Months pass by this way and I finally got answers to all my questions about his behavior.  We sat down and he was finally honest with me - he met someone just before me and it didn’t work out, but he’s still deeply in love with them and can’t get over them. He said he still liked me very much and would want to keep hanging with me. Seems to me like his “cold” behavior was his real one and his “hot” one was him trying to jump into a relationship to forget his love for the other woman. I was pissed at him for not being honest sooner and not considering my feelings and how they’d develop as more time passed so I ended everything immediately and refused staying friends. 

Now... I have few years of bad dating history and I’m tired of looking for reasons of “what’s wrong with me” when the case is rejection on my end. I also don’t want all the “I feel sorry for you” behavior and topics from my friends. That’s why when they asked me what happened and why are we not dating anymore, I just confirmed their suggestions of the guy being a little creepy for me by falling too deep too early and that’s why I had to end it. I didn’t make up stories or add imaginary details, I just confirmed what they suggested, although it’s not true. I feel bad because they all think he’s some kind of freak right now. They don’t work with him anymore and I can’t say this disrupts their relationships with him in any way, but still feel like if he decides to get in touch with them for any reason, they’ll refuse because of this story. Therefore I feel like an big asshole for not telling the truth just to save myself period of pity + self-pity. AITA for lying to my friends about the reason we’re not dating anymore?"

bxqcpn	2019-06-07 04:20:06	PaytonGayton27	AITA for wanting to cut all ties with my grandfather	"Basically I moved out of my grandfather's house and moved in with my mother in a different state. He drove my stuff up here. But when he was supposed to leave he told us he had no gas to get home even though me and my mother gave him almost $300 for the trip in advance. He had me contact both of my great grandmother's to beg for money for him to go home. Later that day I walked out of the house, slipped and busted my head against the porch,(it had stormed for a week before I got there and the ground is made of clay so it's super slippery.) and I went to the back of the truck to grab a clean pair of clothes. He was sleeping on it, and I asked him to hand me them and then he blew up at me. Screaming at me to get in the car, and ""if we crash it's all your fault"". My mother came out and asked what was going on and he said I was demanding my clothes and woke him up for no reason.

Side note, I have PTSD from witnessing domestic abuse for 7 years.

He then started to scream at my mother, threaten to ""lay her out"" on the driveway. He left his hand print bruised into her forearm. I told him I wanted my stuff off the truck, he then proceeded to throw my things off the truck. It had just started to rain, so many items were covered in mud and rain water. I also have birds as pets, he started throwing spary paint cans at them. He screamed at my sister to get in the car and left. The drive up here was 13 hours. It took him 29 hours to get home. He decided to stop at rest stops and lock my 16 year old sister in the truck. She had no food, no water, a group of men were in the car next to her and every time she went to step out of the truck they stared and started to get out of their car.

A side note, he had popping pills for years, getting him fired and forced us to move houses 3 times until we were in a hotel for 2 and half years. He treated my grandmother like shit everyday until she died in November.

When they finally get home he informs my mother that she can't speak to my sister anymore until she's 18. (He doesn't have custody of her). I've blocked his number but family members keep telling me I shouldn't cut all ties because he raised me.

bxqbzu	2019-06-07 04:17:56	ObviousEducation	AITA for being upset b/c my parents spent my college savings on my brother's medical bills?	"I'm 18, heading off to my dream school this fall. Since I was a baby, my parents have been saving for my college education and now I can go to my dream university without a cent in debt. The fact that I knew we had the funds to pay for school meant that I applied to my top choices (all private colleges) which are all 50k/year and up.

Last month, my younger brother was diagnosed with a rare heart disorder that needs immediate surgery or his life could be in danger. My parents are beside themselves and want to give him the best in the country. Since it's pretty high-tech surgery, they want to take him to like the absolute best hospital in the world for this procedure but it's ridiculously expensive (there are tons other options at other hospitals but they only want the best). My mom sat me down the other day and told me that they'll have to take the money they've saved for my tuition and use it on my brother's medical bills.

AITA for being really mad/upset over this? I get the severity of my brother's health issues, but I feel like they could maybe settle for a cheaper procedure at a less famous hospital? My parents only want the best doctors for him because they're worried someone else might mess up the operation and kill him, but I can't help but feel like they're maybe overreacting a little bit. I can't imagine doctors in any state being so incompetent as to mess up a major heart operation like that.

Keep in mind that he starts to look very nervous when random people come up and touch him so I stopped letting random people do it, most people understand. I see a younger kid maybe 6 or 7 politely ask me if she can pat my dog. I politely deny by saying no sorry. I see some tears come out of her eyes and I didn’t know what to do so I just walked away.

I feel bad now and before this gets people saying it’s a validation post I now feel like an asshole because I didn’t explain why and I didn’t question why a you g child was out by herself. Part of me is saying YTA and part of me says NTA. I need some help with this."	No A-holes here	0	0
bxqbfc	2019-06-07 04:16:03		AITA for wanting the money my parents saved for a college education despite not going to college?	"First off, I'm European so the education system is a tad bit different. I'll try as best as I can, but I'm sure this will sound a bit off to Americans. 

Background:

My parents saved up money specifically for the purpose of me and my sister paying our education. They've always told us about that money and that it will be available to us. 

I'm finishing off my job education right now and will be starting as a secretary in a big law firm in July. Since I busted my ass the certificate I'm getting has a 4.0 GPA and the job I've landed is well paid for the field. I've recently moved into my own apartment and will have to get an office wardrobe for my new job, so money is tight right now. I have to eat beans with rice everyday lol

My sister is studying for a graphics design degree at a private university and my parents pay the 15k fees. She lives basically rent free alone in the apartment my parents own.

I've asked my mother to give me a fraction of the money out of the funds they have saved up over the years to pay some bills, since I'm not going to college. She was pissed that I would dare to ask for their money and that it's none of my business what my sister is getting and that my sister never had to ask for it. She told me that I will never get that money since I'm not going to college.

I feel this is unfair since my sister has a head start in her life and that she gets to build her life off that money while I don't get anything.

TLDR: I need money out of a fund my parents saved up for my education to pay my bills and my parents refuse."		1	0
bxqb03	2019-06-07 04:14:41	Kmctr	AITA for telling my work friend to stop talking about my raise?	"I have a work friend who started with me in the same position so we started with the same salary at the same time, a couple years ago. Last year when we got our performance raises, she accidentally saw my paper that had my raise on it on my desk and she brought it up to me later that she didn’t get as high of a raise. 

For 8 months she continued bringing it up randomly during conversation and made comments like “I don’t know what you are doing any better than me” or “maybe it was a mistake and (our supervisor) didn’t realize it?”  She was basically in denial but she continued to talk about it which made me upset. After this happened, she was always civil with me but it seemed like something changed in her, she always seemed to make little passive aggressive digs at me in passing and became very competitive and always tried to 1-up me. 

I did talk to my supervisor about it privately, and she told me that it was no mistake and that while we both are good, she thought I had come a little bit farther in job performances than my coworker did. She told me if she brings it up again to tell her to talk to our supervisor. It did come up again, I did tell my coworker to talk to our supervisor and she never would do it. 

About 2 months ago, we got our yearly raise again and she tried asking me what my raise was. She told me she got certain % raise and asked if I got that much. I told her I didn’t know. She said “well I probably got more than you since last year was a mistake”. And I told her to stop talking about my salary and that I don’t care what she makes and she shouldn’t care what I make. I also told her I doubt last year was a mistake. 

Ever since then she has been acting cold and strange with me and won’t talk to me nearly as much.  Was I being an asshole by finally calling her out on the raise subject?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxq9lo	2019-06-07 04:10:20		WIBTA for calling my sister out for my nephew's shitty actions?	"It was his 8th grade ""promotion"" day. She made a subtle big deal about it. So family members needed to show up: I rearranged work days to get it off, 3 other members of the family taking the day off of work, one visiting and getting a hotel room for two nights so she could attend. My sister was upset our father didn't travel from WA to attend in CA. 
So those who attend show up, give gifts, have lunch... whatever. But at lunch the nephew spends his entire time on his cell phone playing games. I ask him questions about upcoming high school and get one word shitty answers. He is too busy catching Pokemon to give a fuck.  My sister half ass tells him to stop playing but doesn't take the phone away and he keeps doing it.
I personally found it incredibly disrespectful as this isn't nearly the first time for this kind of behavior and want to bring up this subject to her.  I'm afraid I might get heated.

WIBTA or should I just drop it and move on?"		1	0

bxq62w	2019-06-07 04:00:04	hobodudeguy	AITA for not wanting to go to my uncle's wedding?	"TL;DR at bottom.

This story starts about a month ago. An announcement is made: shiny new Video Game is coming out! Available June 7th! Boy oh boy, I'm supposed to work that night, but I manage to get that night off, and the weekend as well since I typically don't work that day. I'll have to wake up early, since I am on 3rd shift, and stay up until my typical time to sleep, around 11am/noon. 

A few days to a week later, I get added to a Facebook message group. My uncle is having his wedding on the 8th! Happy day for him! Since I'm on 3rd shift, I almost never attend family events for the past 4 years. Everyone understands, and I always attend when it means I won't be exhausted the next evening or otherwise. I mute notifications and go on with my life.

This morning, I get a call from my mother, reminding me that my brother will be giving me a ride. After a short discussion, it becomes clear that she was assuming I would be attending. I had absolutely no intent to go, for a few reasons.

First of all, I haven't really been present for most of the last several events, except moving furniture for my grandmother's house, and including not being there for the past 2 weddings. Next, I have absolutely nothing to wear. It would be me, bags under my eyes, in a Polo and khakis. Beyond that, as stated, I've been looking forward to this release for over a month (it was no surprise, we've known about it for that long honestly), and it's a serious pain to get coverage where I work, so a 3 day weekend is a big deal. If I go, I would have woken up at 4pm Friday, stayed up all night, passed out at 11am at the earliest, woken up at 2pm, and stayed ""until pictures are done"", which would throw off the rest of the day for me as well. 

Having written this all out, I understand that this comes across as making it about me, but I hope I made myself clear about it all.

TL;DR: Uncle's wedding scheduled in the middle of my 3 day weekend, as a 3rd shifter I'm normally fast asleep and have nothing to wear, unexpectedly asked to attend even though I'm typically not expected to show."	Asshole	0	0
