c011ce	2019-06-13 03:56:54		AITA for playing Hungry Shark in my uncle's house when he was bitten by an actual shark while surfing a year ago.	"I know this seems stupid, but many people got really upset over this. Just to clear things up, Hungry Shark is a mobile game where you are a shark, and the goal is to eat as much as possible and survive (actually a cool game, check it out).

So it all began around two hours ago, when I plopped down on the couch excited because I was close to unlocking a new shark. I didn't realize that people would be upset by me playing a game that essentially mocks my my uncle's injury at the flippers of the shark, because I was thinking about the new shark I was able to unlock. 

When my aunt saw my shark character eat a person, she got really upset and took my phone away, and my family supported her. I was called insensitive by my mother, and was given a lecture about how I should be more mindful of my surroundings and think about what I am going to do before I do it. I tried to explain to them that my intention was not to mock my uncle's injury, but they were not having it. 

I do understand why it could be seen as insensitive, and I kinda do feel bad.

c010l1	2019-06-13 03:54:39		AITA for stopping a woman in traffic and screaming at her?	"So I was walking home from an appointment today and I was waiting by a crossing for the light to go green. The light goes green and I start crossing. 

Out of the corner of my eye I suddenly see this car turning the corner (even though I know they have a tee light) and the woman inside the car is clearly looking down at he phone while turning. I stop in shock, and she motions at me apologetically and tries to keep driving. 

 I walk in front of her car, putting my hand out motioning her to stay stopped. I come around to her door and motion for her to wind her window down. Once she does this, I shout at her “get the fuck off your phone” and walk off. 

I don’t regret what I did but I did want to know if what I did makes me an asshole in your eyes. 

Some points for me being an asshole:

• I did hold up traffic for a bit

• I really did scream at her and tried to shock her

Some points against me being an asshole:

• she needed to be shocked so that she can learn that she needs to not be on her fucking phone while she’s driving 

• she could have hit me

c00zdm	2019-06-13 03:50:52		AITA for ignoring my brother	"Context: English isn’t my native language. I’m 19[M] 4 inches taller than him and 20 pounds on him, he is 23, plays video games all day, doesn’t do anything around the house, and doesn’t have a job. Basically living for free. 

A couple of weeks ago we got into a fight. It started because I went into his room to grab some low cal chocolate because I am dieting. He didn’t like that I went into his room which is okay and I said it was for a second. I grabbed my chocolate and left. I then realized that I forgot to grab my phone and this time knocked and told him that I forgot to grab my phone. He got annoyed and sprayed bug spray in my face. I got really mad and threw the chocolate wrapper in his face. Yes I know I should’ve reacted differently but it was in the heat of the moment. We squared up and he kicked me in the crotch and then barricaded himself in his room. I was hot af at this point and muscled my way into his room, but I wasn’t going to hurt him, just pin him down. I haven’t spoke to him since. My parents obviously want us to make up but I refuse because whenever I’m around him he acts so immature and it becomes contagious. For example, I wanted to help get his life together and asked him to go workout with me. After my workout he started making fun of the faces I was making during my workout and said I was making gay noises while lifting. He then makes fun of my lifestyle and tells I will never lose my weight. I told my parents once he becomes a more mature person, he can come talk to me. AITA for ignoring him?

c00z0l	2019-06-13 03:49:43		WIBTA for reporting my neighbor to strata because she keeps parking in the visitor spot overnight?	"Hear me out here. I’m a really laid back neighbor. I genuinely do not give a shit what my neighbours do, or about any of the ridiculous strata rules in my complex. (Example, white curtains only, only white or black planters, no smoking on your balcony etc etc) the rules say that residents are not supposed to park in visitor spots. 

But for the past two weeks this woman who lives in my complex has been using the visitor spot between our houses just to park an extra car. (She has a street facing unit like mine, and there is parking out there, but sometimes full.) she also has a garage; but I think they have two vehicles. 

I wasn’t bothered the first few times she did it, because hey - sometimes it’s late and you don’t want to park a block away from your house. But often times the visitor spots in my complex are full because of residents parking there, and my guests have to park blocks away and walk to get to my house. (Example my MIL who has just had a knee replacement.) 

I don’t want to be an asshole neighbor who Narks on my neighbor, but also - wtf man, have manners.

c00y9a	2019-06-13 03:47:29	DelftBluest	AITA for not wanting to sell my $4,500 bike (not motorcycle) that I don’t use enough?	"I am a mom with a kickass electric bike that can fit my two kids and two smallish dogs and get us up our 20% grade, and with good enough brakes to safely get back down. The size is universal enough for both my husband and I to ride it. My oldest kid (9) is getting a bit big, but my youngest (4) can’t even ride a bike yet so it is still perfect for her.  I only use it in the summer, and maybe only a couple of commutes to work/daycare a month (plus a few short neighborhood rides to meet friends at the pool at the top of the hill with towels and floaties). But when I do use it, the kids and I have a blast. It is the best “thing” I ever bought, and I researched the heck out of it before buying. Nicest thing I own. Husband of ten years said I don’t use it enough to justify keeping such an overpriced toy that is only depreciating in value. He said he never asks for anything and it isn’t fair that I have this super expensive thing that I don’t even use. I have this bike, a dog that was almost a divorce to get (but he now loves and even insisted on a second dog), and am getting a kitchen remodel this summer, so I do feel greedy next to him. In my defense, I don’t do diamonds or Gucci or other expensive “girl” stuff, and we are happy to have a smaller home. I’m not normally this materialistic.

The last few years he’s tried to sell it, even posting it on Craigslist and forwarding me emails from parents desperate to have my awesome bike and be the talk of the daycare. One time he made up a story about a dad with disabled kids to convince me.  He dangled a trip to Hawaii one year if I would sell it. We went to Hawaii but I talked him into letting me keep it a little longer.  We always fight about it and he guilts me and bribes me and won’t drop it. It is 8’ long and takes up a chunk of garage space, but we can still park two cars in there.  This year we are finally remodeling our kitchen (which I’ve patiently researched and designed and waited on for ten years because he doesn’t like to be pushed) and he thinks the bike needs to go this year so we can put the money toward a fancier built-in fridge. He makes way more money than me, but we both work full time. We do not need the money from selling it, but sure, it wouldn’t hurt. It might be of more practical use or bring even more joy to some other parent(s).  He said he is “sacrificing $50,000 for a kitchen, so I should sacrifice something too.” I reluctantly agreed and said we should wait to talk to a friend in the neighborhood who is interested but currently traveling, but he secretly posted it on Craigslist both locally and in cities up to four hours away... He’s forwarding me emails from people who want it already, and now I’m having second thoughts. I’m hurt he posted it without asking (again)... After weeks of rain he just fixed the brakes a few days ago and we won’t even get to use it for one week if we sell it this weekend to someone who is asking.

c00wad	2019-06-13 03:41:19	713984265	AITA for ignoring notes left on my car?	"So about a year ago I started a new job and the office is in the center of a little borough/town. All the parking in the town is metered parking in 'residential' areas. I put it in quotes because there's houses and businesses mixed in, but they're streets basically off the main road of the town.

Anyway, I have a special permit given to employees of businesses that lets us park at the meters for free. Someone has been leaving notes on my car for different shit like every other week. These notes have been for different things, but basically center around 3-4 different things:

* Parking too far away from the meter (street parking, I always park so that my car is about a foot away from the car behind me)

* Parking too close to the meter (I tried to adhere to the other note and parked right up next to the meter and left a solid 5 foot gap between me and the car behind me).

* Parking too far away from the curb.

* Parking too close to the curb.

* Parking too early in the morning with a car that's too loud.

* Sitting in my car with the engine running (got this note today which inspired this post, and I plan on ignoring entirely).

So, for reference, I drive a stage 1 WRX. This is basically what my car sounds like: https://youtu.be/mz2x-oreuxA?t=57. While I'll admit it's louder than an average car, I don't think it's excessively loud.

I talked to coworkers about the parking notes and they say they've all gotten them and I should just ignore them. The noise notes are unique to me though.

I bought a switch this weekend and was sitting in my car yesterday with the air on (car running) playing it during lunch. After about 30 minutes the car alarm of the car in front of me started going off. I just ignored it 'cause that's what you do with car alarms.

Today I had a phone interview, so I went in my car to take it, and again the car alarm in front of me started going off after around 30 minutes. When I left work there was a note on my car about how idling my car is too loud and it's disturbing everyone.

Anyway, since I just bought this switch I'd like to continue playing it during my lunch break and realistically I'm not going to sit in the office and play it. People constantly need me at work so if I'm physically in the office I'll have to stop what I'm doing to do work which is why I try to got my car.

AITI / WIBTA if I still sit in my car and ignore this note. If the person came out and spoke to me I'd stop doing it, but constantly leaving notes and setting off the car alarm honestly just annoys me. Like if you're home just come talk to me, don't wait until I leave FOLLOW ME TO WORK, and then threaten to call my boss. Like wtf?

Note I got today for reference:
https://i.imgur.com/g1weByG.jpg

tldr, been getting stupid notes left on my car for months. Tried adhering to them but got new notes basically asking for the opposite so now I'm just ignoring them. It's literally between 12:15 and 1:30 in the afternoon depending on when I take lunch. I think that's a reasonable time to sit in my car..."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c00vz6	2019-06-13 03:40:24	nnh09	WIBTA for turning down a job I accepted two weeks in advance because another job benefits me more?	Hi all, I am currently debating what to do and am struggling with feeling like an ass. I accepted Job 1 back in April for a summer teaching position that lasts 5 weeks. In May, I was hired to work full time in the fall by Job 2, and they also offered me to work the summer too. I told them I had an outstanding commitment, but the more I think about it, I feel like I should take Job 2 for the summer.  If I work for Job 1, I would be without health benefits for around 4 months, or have to pay out of pocket ($1,200) total to keep them. Job 2 would give me full benefits. Job 1 is also only part time, whereas Job 2 is full time, giving me about $5,000 more for the summer. I am always very loyal to my word, and can't help feel terrible even though I am screwing myself out of a ton of money (and benefits) by keeping it.	Not the A-hole	0	0

c00ua8	2019-06-13 03:35:16	MonkeysMogul	WIBTA for not attending my mum's wedding?	"Backstory: Ten years ago, my dad died because of health issues. A year after that I met my now wife (I'm Female). My mum was really unstable after my dad died. She would yell at me and hit me. When she found out about my new girlfriend, she lost it. She kicked me out of her house and I lived in my car for about sixteen weeks. She called me one night and said she was sorry for everything. I was a young teenager living on my own, so I told her it okay. I really wanted to finish high school but didn't have the money to pay for it. So by living with my mum, she would pay for my high school education. I got a job because I didn't know if she would kick me out again. My girlfriend helped me with everything. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't be here. 

After I finished college, I ask my girlfriend to marry me. She said yes, I was 25 at the time. I told my mum and prepared for the worse. All she said was that she didn't agree with the idea of me getting married to a girl but she would come because of the fact that it was important to me. I was very happy that she was coming. She had RSVP to the wedding invitation.  I wore a jumpsuit that looked like a dress to make her happy. I was going to wear black but chose off grey to make her happy. I had food that she liked, just to see her smile. 

When the day of the wedding came, she didn't show up. It was heartbreaking to see an empty chair. My girlfriend knew I was upset and ask if I wanted the wedding to start later. I said no and put on a brave face. On the night of the Wedding, she (mum) called. She said a terrible person and that she hated me. I broke down and cried, my wife took the phone off me and hang up. She brought me something to eat and cuddled me.

 Three years later, my mum called me and said she was sorry. She said that she was going through a rough patch. She showed me papers that showed that she in the hospital because of mental health issues. I said okay and our relationship has been much better. She would bring food over and offered to take me shopping. She has been more open to my wife and everything so far has been going smoothly. 

If she acts up again, I will cut her out of my life.  Now my mum is getting married. I never saw her so happy. She asked me to come to the wedding. On one hand, I want her to feel the pain she caused me. On the other, our relationship is much better than it was.

c00r5d	2019-06-13 03:26:05	Kosuuu	AITA for joking about how a friend of mine has ditched our friend group for other friends entirely?	"Ok, so I have a group of friends on discord mixed with old highschool friends and internet friends. On said discord we generally talk a lot and play games together and are generally super close friends, we have other groups we talk to but since we're close friends we usually just go back and forth with each friend group. Playing games and talking with each group whenever we feel like it. So in my situation, one of my high school friends (who now goes to my college) met some new friends in college and essentially has stopped talking to me and other friends. Getting other friends isn't a big deal but going months without any communication is kinda weird when we are on the same campus for the next 4 or so years? So friends and I eventually make attempts to hang out with and catch up with this friend, we'll call him Chang. It seems no matter what we want to do Chang is too busy for everything. Chang cancels plans on the day of (hours or minutes before said plans). This has happened well over 5 plans or so, it has become a pattern. And the issue is, if he does not want to go on the plans, he could just refuse? Chang now gets into the discord call every couple of months or so to ask a dull, awkward small talk question just to get an answer then talk to his roommate or housemate while still in discord or explain how sad he is that he's busy all the time and cant hang out with us and misses the time spent with us. The kicker is, I see on his Instagram story that he hangs out with friends literally all the time. So I and other people in his old friend group have now started joking about how he doesn't talk to us anymore. I've changed the discord icon to a picture of Chang and changed the server name to ""Chang fan club"" joking that he never comes back to talk to us. This joke did not amuse Chang and he was apparently hurt I did so. Chang seems to be hurt by every joke made about how he doesn't talk to us anymore, yet even in recent times, he has been busy for plans made with him in mind. The jokes are jokes alone, sure they poke fun at the situation but it's only to hopefully have him come back and talk to us. Admittedly I feel bad if his feelings are actually hurt over these jokes, but I usually don't comment because I am still salty about the issue and don't wanna say something that would spark conflict. Am I the asshole for making fun of and joking about the situation and hurting his feelings?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"I would like to preface this by saying that I suffer from mental illnesses which I do have a service dog for and while I do my best to not let them interfere with my life I recognize I still have my limitations. My parents however do not.

My cousin is having a marriage this summer which requires out of country travel. Which wouldnt be too big of an issue except that the last time I had traveled to visit them it had only been for four days and by the end of it I was beginning to have fainting spells because I was too anxious to eat or sleep. It took three days of recovery once I got home before I was able to work again.

I agreed to attend the wedding, it's a big deal for my cousin, but I said I would only be able to go for a week. That's the amount of time I asked off from my job, and that's as far as I trust myself to be able to handle it.

My mother booked the trip because I can't afford tickets but she booked it for two weeks. I do not trust myself to handle two weeks. Especially considering that after only four days I was starting to black out. I told her I agreed to a one week trip and that I do not want to be there the full two weeks. I've reached a point in the conversation where I just want to say either I'm rescheduling my flight or I'm just not going at all.

I'd hate to miss it. I've already missed a lot of big events due to my mental issues and I feel like my family is starting to hate me because of it.

So it was a running joke that he always gets ghosted. 

So yesterday for his birthday, I gave him a Ouija board as a joke to ""bring the ghosted people back"". I thought it was pretty funny and didn't think much about it. But then when he opened the gift  he was furious. He was saying things like ouija boards aren't a joke and these things shouldn't be joked with. And how me giving him this gift will make make him repel more people since the ghosts will latch on to him and I am cursing him with this gift. He was pretty pissed and visibly upset that I gave him this ouija board. I didn't understand and I told him that I didn't get why he was upset over this gift. He wasn't the healing crystal or essential oil therapy person but this reaction just caught me off guard.

He left yesterday cussing and complaining it's going to be a pain to get rid of this board.

So I was a new student this year at my school. I saw an *adorable* guy who was a little bit taller then me but we got closer and dated from October 28th to around December 16th I think. We were both clingy as this was my first ""Boyfriend"" and his first Girlfriend who cared (A). We were that couple that was inseparable even though we were in different classes. Teachers knew students dated and it was okay with them as along as you didn't kiss or ""anything"" during school. I vented to him after school.

One Friday he seemed distant. I was picked up by my dad and surprised with a doggo (Doge). I with playing with Doge around 8pm and I got a text.
""We are polar opposites. We can't be together
 It isnt working."" His text read. I remember all the tears I cried. Like anyone else I texted the WHOLE friend group (5 People) but this one girl who is a witch.

Anyway, know you know the backstory, the tea. A few weeks or months past (I was lost after the breakup) and he says he has a secret girlfriend. I wanted to go Yandere on this chick. N0B0DY TOUCHES SENPAIIIIII. So a few days after I learn if was the witch, he said some of the stuff I vented about to his friends, the next grade, and my fake best friend. Then he kissed her.

Dont get me wrong she can be sweet, and has helped me through hard times but recently she has been doing down hill since shes been dating this guy much older than the both of us. (I believe at least 23) he is often very verbally abusive to her and they argue every single time i hang out with them. Its got bad till the point where they scream at each other in very public areas and she will cry her eyes out while people stare. Ive told her many time to leave the relationship but she refuses to listen, and im often triggered by the boyfriend because i myself have been a victim to abuse. Besides that, they both dont have paying jobs but i do (i work 2 jobs) and am able to pay for luxuries like going out to eat. I usually dont mind paying for friends because money isnt everything and my friends return the favor but when it comes to these two im always left to pay the bill. When ever they ask to hang out the next question is if i have money on me. I now lie about it, i cant stand them anymore but i dont know how to tell her.

This topic has been on my mind a lot, I dont really feel comfortable discussing it with my family since they are really quite involved with my brothers wedding which will be in October of this year. 
My brother met his fiancee in college, they are really great together and I'm happy she'll be part of the family soon. But the thing is, I hardly know her at all. We see each other at family events and other small get togethers, but we dont talk to each other very much and there seems to be a mutual agreement that we dont have too much in common, so why go out of our way to force a friendship. Idk.
 But anyways, at the beginning of this year, she and my brother came to me to ask if I would be a bridesmaid at their wedding. I felt really pressured in the moment to say yes, so I did. Immediately after I said yes though I regretted it- and in the months since I agreed to it, I've come to realize that I would much, MUCH rather be in the audience than up there with the rest of the wedding party. 
I found out from my brother that all of the other bridesmaids/his fiancee are in a very active group chat, and I'm the only one that isn't in it. The bride and her bridesmaids often go out for pedicures, lunches, and shopping trips, and I have never once gotten an invite from any of them. 
To be completely honest, my future SIL and I have hardly anything in common. Shes very religious and outdoorsy, and I'm the opposite lol. I love and respect her, I'm happy she and my brother are getting married, but at this point I really feel like she only asked me to be one of her bridesmaids simply because I'm the sister of the groom and she didnt want me to feel ""left out"", but now I feel more left out than I would if I was never asked to be a bridesmaid at all.

I literally did all the readings in that class, I got 100s on all the quizzes, and I wrote really good essays. I went over my essays with my TA and another English professor, both of whom said my work was of A-grade quality, BASED ON DR. B'S RUBRIC.

Dr. B, however, did not agree, and he kept giving me Cs on my essays. When I spoke to him about my ideas, he would always say ""keep thinking"" or ""think harder,"" as if he expected Aristotle-level work.

By the way, when we got our papers back, I would ask other students if I could see their work for reference. The essays that got high grades were nothing special. One paper, which got an A, had glaring logical fallacies, broke multiple formatting rules, and did not even quote the readings like the rubric had required. My essay, on the other hand, followed all the rules, was really well-developed, and got a C+.

This was infuriating. I am confident Dr. B treated me unfairly because he did not like me. If anyone else had handed in my work, it would have been graded differently. Maybe that's because I said something at the beginning of the semester that pissed him off. Whatever the case was, I wanted to make Dr. B suffer. I took revenge by going to his RateMyProfessor page, where I wrote eighteen different negative reviews.

I am seeing that his enrollment numbers are significantly lower than they were in prior semesters, before I wrote the reviews. This might even hurt his chances of being tenured.

Am I the asshole for writing that many reviews? I think he deserved it for treating me so unfairly."		1	0

c00dzz	2019-06-13 02:48:43	bobcatboots	AITA for how I treated my mom when she's staying at my house.	"Backstory: I'm 27F, mom is mom age. She has issues with her family, and I don't. She's also having troubles with work, due to just skipping when she doesn't want to, then complaining about money.

My relationship with my mom is complicated. She has always done a lot for me, and has always been willing to get me out there to see and learn about the world. The trade off through life seems to be that she has always been extremely controlling, but I do love her, and I sincerely try to help her where I can.

My mother has stayed with me after I went with her to work on a trip overseas until yesterday. Unfortunately, she pretty much follows me around in my apt, and ranted to me about her family and my life. She talks about her family is just using me and will drop me when I dont do anything for them. She goes through my cabinets and asks me why I eat rice and why I have *bread*. I cant get on my laptop without her asking what i'm doing, who i'm talking to, and that I spend too much time on my computer. She asks me when i'm getting rid of my game consoles and when I will finally grow up. MEANWHILE she goes impulse shopping, she is drinking her way through my champagne, and a liter of vodka, and has pretty much cooked and eaten most of my extra groceries in addition to me bringing her to a friend hosted brunch and taking her out to eat more than a few times on my dime.

On the other hand, while at work she has gone through my closets and drawers and folded everything, and cleaned and cooked me some meals from whats in my freezer. The cleaning and cooking is a lovely gesture, but I cant find my clothes or where my plates are, and I don't want her to go through my things. I felt stressed and after working for about 14 hours straight, and coming back to being criticized I ended up freaking out a bit at her when she suggested I was deeply depressed and didn't have friends when I sat in my room to decompress after work without the interrogations. I told her she needs to pay a days rent if she wants to bitch at me all day, and replace my liquor and chip in for some groceries. I got petty and cut off my router (as she also just sits and watches movies on Netflix) and left on my bike and didn't come back for a few hours.

She left while I was away at work, and I felt like I could breathe again. Until now where she is screaming on the phone at me about how I make her feel unwelcome, and as as her daughter she has done so much for me and she tries to tell me about my family and how awful they are and shortcomings because she cares. I feel like a brat, but I am an adult and I should have some boundaries, and I am not a child who needs to be shamed into her idea of success. I don't ignore her problems, but I am not a therapist and I feel like her end goal is to destroy my relationships with them.

"My partner and I recently got married, and when we did we had a small registry but stressed to our guests that they did not have to abide by or or get us anything at all for that matter. We're fairly well off already and the wedding was mostly a formality for my family.

Well, my aunt bought us an Amazon Alexa unit because they have one and everyone in my family raves about theirs. My husband and I are pretty big on security and don't trust it at all. We didn't think anyone would get us something that high-tech.

She didn't give it to us with a return receipt, so we're debating selling on our local buy and sell page or re-gifting it elsewhere. Giving it back to her isn't really a great option, because she was very excited for us to have it. 

Overall I don't think it's a bad idea. My husband agrees because of privacy concerns when it comes to the device and my aunt may not even ever find out. However when I told my mother this (she was there when we opened gifts) she said it would be extremely rude and we were overreacting.

someone (F16 ish?) decided to give him a love ""note"" right before he graduates. The love ""note"" was more like a 4 page essay, and full of Grammer mistakes. He thought it would be funny if he marked the ""note"". After he marked it, he gave it back to her with a big red fail in front of her friends, in the cafataria, and loudly told her he doesn't date people with bad grammar.

Note: my friend wants you to know that in the note she confessed to stalking him in school for a couple years

Anyways I told him he was an asshole for doing that but he disagreed so please help us resolve this.

Edit: thank you guys for commenting, didnt expect so many comments, trying our best to read them all. I'm adding more specifics since it's getting more attention. 

my friend wants you to know that to be more specific she said that she followed him around and tried her best to be at the same places and on the same busses as him when she could. She also changed her locker to be close to him, etc.

My friend is a tutor and I made the joke about marking it (didn't think he was gonna do it) when he was marking his students. He was originally just going to mark it and give it to her quietly, but on the spot he decided to loudly proclaim he doesn't date people with bad Grammer.

c007cz	2019-06-13 02:30:37		AITA if I quit marriage counseling?	First of all, my husband is abusive. This is finally being addressed after years of me not knowing what was wrong with me. I blamed myself because he blamed me. Now we’re in marriage counseling, and it’s getting worse. The blaming, the snide and sarcastic remarks, the laughing at me when I’m upset or hurt, the starting an argument and stonewalling me so I can’t respond.... it’s as if since the counselor isn’t calling him out on it, he feels justified in his behavior. I don’t know if she’s just waiting for the right time, or if she just isn’t going to call him on it at all. Of course, he still doesn’t hold himself accountable for the abuse. So here I am, crying again after being told all the crazy things I WOULD do if ‘I pulled that shit’, but haven’t. I don’t know, I’m confused and heartbroken and every time we have a session his behavior just gets worse and I can’t take it anymore. It hurts too much, for whatever reason I keep thinking things will change, but they won’t, and I need to get out of counseling so he’s not emboldened, and the various forms of emotional abuse don’t get worse. But am I wrong to give up? Am I the asshole? Would it be wrong to give up when he’s actually making an effort to go?	Not the A-hole	1	0

I was pretty dumbfounded, I've never seen a prize pool split this way before, where the winners receive less for winning than they would have if they came second, so sent back:

>Yay, Thanks for organising this! A bit confused about the prize distribution, though. Conventionally, if there is a tie for first, the 1st and 2nd prize pool is shared between the two winners (i.e. $90 1st, $90 1st, $25 3rd). Was just curious if there was a reason the prize pool was split differently here

"My (21F) parents divorced a little over a decade ago, and my dad and his GF have been together for the last 4 years or so. They have a kid (3M) together now as well. I wasn't happy when they first announced the pregnancy, and I'm still not too chipper about the kid now. Don't get me wrong, I treat the kid nicely when he's around--even though I really dislike children in general--but I don't go out of my way to play with him or anything like that. What really bothers me is the way that my dad keeps shoving the whole ""he's your brother"" thing down my throat. 

I already have an actual younger brother (18), and he lives with our dad while I live with our mom. I get that my dad is a ""family man"" and wants everyone to feel connected or whatever, but it makes me super uncomfortable whenever he pushes for me to accept his new kid as my ""brother""--especially when I hardly feel connected to the rest of his new family, i.e. his GF/my stepmother, their son, and his GF's other son (11, I think). I rarely see them, and when I do, we don't talk much. I should also mention that I'm not a huge fan of his GF and her parenting skills either. The few times that I've been around her without my dad present, she let the kids run rampant and basically terrorize the general public. It's embarrassing. And she doesn't have a great personality either IMO. Extremely clingy and judgemental, and talks smack about my dad when he's not around. 

My main thing is, I don't know if/how to tell my dad that I don't care for his new ""family"". He cares a lot about his personal relationships, and I know it'll hurt him. But I also know that he's very accepting of his children's opinions and will eventually come to terms with it. I'd just hate to make things awkward between us/me and his family. But I can't keep pretending like I don't want to scream every time he brings up ""\[my\] brother"" when I don't consider the kid to be related to me at all. Or maybe I'm just being a giant, bitter, child-hating asshole?

&#x200B;

"The other week, my girlfriend was causally telling me that her ex (broke up 5 years ago) posted a bunch of old pictures as if he was taking a trip down memory lane. He ended up posting a picture of my girlfriend and him when they were together. I didn't really care, nothing I can do to control that.

She told me that she untagged herself from the post and moved on. I asked her why she was still following him and her response: ""I didn't want to be petty"". After being with her for 3 years, she is worried about being petty to him? Give me a break.

I told her to unfollow him at that moment. She did and then she asked if I still followed any of exes. (She hates one of my exes and already knows that she told me to unfollow her the day we started dating). I only follow one now and she told me to unfollow her and I thought that was fair so I did it. It could have stopped right there.

But then she starts asking about past again with my exes (even though I have told her the stories multiple times) and then questions the night when I lost my virginity. (I have only been with that one girl and my girlfriend). I have no idea why she starts asking. She asks about the other girls too. Then she asks to go through my phone to see who I follow. I give her the phone and she sees that I follow Mia Khalifa and flips out. 

""You do not need to be looking at her when you should be looking at me.""

Okay, I'll unfollow her.... even though I watch porn? My GF knows I do. Whatever.

Then she goes to every girl's profile and asks if I know them. If I did not know them in real life, she forced me to unfollow them. I got mad and took the phone away from her and a full blown argument breaks out as to why I won't let her see it.

I told her I'll her see it if she lets me watch what she is doing and refuses to do that. I have nothing to hide, just didn't want her to start unfollowing everyone. Then we fight for the next 3 hours about it."		1	0

Alright, long time AITA lurker but this is my first post so here goes:

I started at a summer internship last month and receive a bi-weekly stipend of $1600 before tax. My sister is aware of this and has reached out to me for financial assistance in repairing our late grandmother’s car. No doubt she wants to get it back up and running so she can drive to friends houses, school, work,  or wherever. She’s asked for $192 initially but I’m expecting higher maintenance costs as the car is over a decade old. I would prefer not to give her any cash since it is my earned money, and she’s coming off as opportunistic to me. I consider myself an extremely frugal person, and I’ve been saving my money for upcoming college expenses, food, and other necessities only. Additionally, she works a minimum wage job at a local store so if she really wants the repairs she could save up for them herself. 

WIBTA if I don’t share my money to help her out? 

TL;DR: My teen sister wants me to give her $200 USD to repair our late grandmothers car so she can start driving to work, have the freedom to go where she wants, and develop her independence/autonomy. She just got her driver’s license last week and is really eager to take advantage of it. I’m saving my earned cash for my own personal expenses like transportation, food and upcoming tuition costs. WIBTA if I don’t give her any of my money?

She’s been to medical school so she’s usually a bit busier than I am. Bc of that I’m usually the one who gets groceries, makes sure to fix what breaks, etc. I’m fine with this since I actually like doing chores as long as I get to do them when I’m not tired or busy with something else so I don’t complain.

But I feel like she’s getting a bit entitled bc of that. As in she expects me to do everything she asks (buy something, call someone, go somewhere) and while I usually do it since I want to help her, sometimes I won’t have the time/energy right away and she always seems to get frustrated when that happens.

So today I was on a call with my long distance best friend after a long day at school and having missed my regular bus which added 30 mins to my walk. I was tired and just happy I got to end the day by relaxing in bed talking to my friend.

That’s when my sister enters the room and looks around a bit, then asks me if I had seen her notebook. I say I haven’t and she says she must have left it in her car. She looks at me and I notice she has one of those white beauty/face masks on. Things get a bit silent as she just sits on the bed with me and none of us say anything, my friend just awkwardly waits over the phone. I think she wanted me to volunteer or something

She finally outright asks me if I can go get it for her and I stall bc I don’t really want to leave my bed but I don’t want to say no. I tell her I’m on a call with my friend (who she knows all about) and that I don’t want to say bye to him right now. I even tell her that if she could wait 20mins (the time he had left to call) I would go despite being tired and having already taken my clothes off

That doesn’t seem to be enough as she says she needs it now and can’t go out with her face mask so I gotta do it. I ask her how long is left till she can wash it off and she says 40 minutes so it’s gonna be a while till she can go. I repeat that I can go in a bit and get uncomfortable and never really say no.

She then says she needs it now to study and that I should be more helpful since “I don’t do much schoolwork anyway”. I tell her I’m a bit tired and im with my friend and repeat again that I will go in a bit if she wants, but she whines a bit before kinda rudely saying “Ok, whatever, I hope you don’t need something from me anytime soon” and walks away slamming the door (not too hard but enough to make a point).

I started feeling extremely guilty for that, even tho my friend told me he thinks I had the right to say no.

bzzxg7	2019-06-13 02:01:57		WIBTA if I tell my boyfriend to tell his friend who wants to fight me not to stick around when I’m there?	"(Sorry for weird format on mobile and rushed writing.) Basically this girl has had this huge grudge on me since high school because she was my ex’s rebound and he was still in love with me (stalking me, following me home from school) and I would talk crap about him because of this. This made her irrationally mad. I told VP what was going on and how she’d threaten me even showed screen shots. She then stopped because she was a senior and going to graduate soon. Her wanting to fight a sophomore wasn’t a good look. 
Fast forward 5 years later and I’m dating my ex’s friend. My current SOs mom was nice enough to let this girl stay in her home after she was impregnated by my ex and now they’re close and SOs mom loves their kid so she from time to time. I understand that it would be inevitable for me running into her so I decide to talk about HS with her and if she understood where I was coming from because she was now dealing with the same issues. This gets her upset and she starts saying how she didn’t give a shit what I had to say. Later that night SO gets a text with her threatening to “fuck me up” and it followed with “this is a warning.” I eventually found out that he hid it from me I told him that I don’t want to be in a relationship where I’m going to be threatened and he either needs to speak up about this or I need to leave. He decided to block her instead of talking to her. Throughout a couple months where she’d decide to pop up randomly and hangout she’d throw a lot of shade. I didn’t let it bug me but I pointed it out to SO. Few days ago I plan a small little hangout not including her and she shows up and stays. It ruined my mood dramatically especially because I have to walk on eggshells with her. WIBTA if I’m more aggressive toward my boyfriend about putting his foot down with her? Any advice as to what either him or I should say? 

TLDR; girl has dumb grudge against me and continues to come over to my boyfriends house to hangout."		1	0

"My husband is getting punished for bad behavior, this part is not negotiable. I am just curious if people think installing nanny cams in all the bathrooms is a bit much.

What happened: My husband has a porn habit and I know he sometimes masturbates to porn in the bathroom either streaming on his laptop or his phone. What really bothered me was he was so indiscreet as to let our younger son walk in on him masturbating to asian shemale porn. I don’t want to get into details, but suffice it say my son saw enough that he started asking questions about transgendered people, and of course every Asian woman is now transgendered in his mind. It was one of the most uncomfortable conversations and we had to tell him his teacher (she’s Asian American) is in fact not transgendered. He’s at the age where he extrapolates everything. I’m SO relieved school’s already ended because I cannot fathom him yakking about this, and especially about his teacher, with his classmates. 

My husband’s punishment: If you have ever been a parent, you’d know how pissed I was. As punishment, I told him he was not to use any room in the house as a private space for porn or masturbation so long as the children are around. To make sure that happens, I installed nanny cams in every room where there’s a lockable door, including the bathrooms. 

He feels this is unjust and going overboard. I’m not so sure. Did I go overboard with nanny cams in the bathrooms here?"	Asshole	0	0
bzzw9o	2019-06-13 01:58:56	hellismybackupplann	AITA for not going to my sister's graduation	"Throwaway account.

I'm a 26m with a younger sister who is in her early 20s.
She lives in a city a few hours from me and has a graduation ceremony that I won't be attending later on this week. We get along pretty good but siblings get under each other's skin every now and again, I try to stay civil because it's always miniscule confrontations that usually blow over in a few days.

Not this time.
We were discussing an issue that was bothering me and I used some pretty abrasive language to express my frustration. I cut the convo short and walked away. I talked to her later on saying that what I said was not directed at her but at the situation in general but she wasn't having it. She started going off about how I can't talk to her like that and that I need to stay away from her while our parents are away for the weekend. (My sister is staying at our parents house while shes down for the visit). I was alittle taken back by the proposal but I tried to laugh it off and not take it seriously. Then she proceeds to tell me how much of a dick I can be and that I get so angry so fast that she ""fears for her life"" in these scenarios. She again warns that I need to ""stay the fuck away"". At this point I'm not sure what to say, so I walk away alittle shocked. It almost seemed like an opportunity opened for her to just unload on me.

I've never been physical with anyone in an argument.
I've never threatened my sister.
Im told that i'm intimidating though.

A day goes by and what she's saying has really been bothering me. Why am I just hearing about this now? We grew up together and this was never a concern before. I try talking to her asking her to give me an example of when ive threatened her. I also tell her that it bothers me that she thinks I would ever do something to put her in danger. No response from her, silent treatment.
Now I'm pissed. 

You want me to stay away? Done.
Her graduation is in a few days and I've informed my parents I won't be driving up and staying at her place. 
This graduation was going to be a trip for a few days, going out for dinner as a family with some of her close classmates also. My parents insisted that she's being dramatic and that I need to go. If that's how she really feels, then I don't want to put a damper on the graduation or the hangouts afterwards so I opted out.

bzzvv9	2019-06-13 01:57:48		AITA for giving my bf an ultimatum about family vacation?	"Over Christmas, we went on weekend vacation with his family. It was fine, but we all stayed in a large Air BnB together and it was too much. I was more than ready to go home by the end (3 days).

Now it’s summertime and my family is planning a weekend trip, next month where the lodging will be very nice and free. All we have to do is drive 3-4 hours and clean up/do laundry before we leave.

My boyfriend doesn’t want to go, because friends of the host will be there, and he doesn’t know them, but thinks he doesn’t like them. 

I told him today that going on this vacation isn’t optional. I explained that if he doesn’t go, it makes me look like a jackass to my family, and makes him look even worse (we are *very* close with the hosts, my sister and BIL) and they will be offended if we’re both not there. I’m not thrilled myself about the friends who are going, and the only reason he has the opinion he does is because of me. But it’s fine. We don’t have to hang out with them and the place is huge. I’m also willing to just go along with it because of my sister.

Then he looked at his calendar and said he can’t go, now because he has an obligation for his volunteer activity that he does every summer. And they’re short-staffed and they need him. 

I told him that he has to pick. I feel like he is prioritizing this other thing over me, and it feels like crap. So I gave him an ultimatum. I said that he needs to figure it out and make the vacation work, or I’m done. 

I am not demanding of his time, ever. I go out of my way to help him out, I am understanding when he has to work late, and when he can’t spend time with me because of his other obligations. This time, though, I am not going to be understanding. I feel like I give and give, and when it’s his turn to compromise, he refuses.

I told him he is taking a day off work, and he is not doing his volunteer stuff that weekend because I get that time, and I get all of it. He wants us to come back super early on the last day so he can help with the volunteer thing and I said no. I’m not getting up at 4 am on vacation, because we have to do all that laundry and cleaning when we get up, and we would have to leave by 6 to beat the traffic, or wait until closer to noon.

bzzv3j	2019-06-13 01:55:45	zenpotato1996	WIBTA for refusing to help my mom manipulate my dad into quitting smoking?	"Back story: I’m about to finish my first year of college at a school millions of miles away from my home, where my parents have been having HUGE issues in their marriage. At the beginning of these issues, they used to treat me like a marriage counselor where they would separately tell me their side of the story over the phone and ask what the other person had told me while villainizing them. After realizing that this behavior was actively interfering with my life at school I kindly asked them both to stop. My dad understood and has stopped and our relationship is back to normal, but this is about my mother.

While my mom has mostly stopped her past behavior, she recently informed me that my dad has started smoking again after nearly 20 years. She wanted to share this with me because she felt really disrespected by his behavior (which I said was ok, because I love her and want her to share with me when she is feeling bad). 

The problem is that she has since asked me to manipulate my father into quitting smoking when I come home. She wants me to “find” his cigs and use my acting skills that I’m learning here to act really disappointed and angry and scared and start yelling and pleading and crying to my dad to his face. Her justification for this is that as his daughter, I should be concerned for his health and should be willing to do anything to make him better. 

While I am concerned that he is smoking again and genuinely do want him to quit, I feel extremely uncomfortable by doing this, but I also don’t want to disappoint my mother. To make her feel better, I told my mother I would try it but honestly the thought of using my dad’s love to manipulate him makes me feel sick.

bzzu5x	2019-06-13 01:53:05		AITA for getting extremely annoyed at my sister for not reading the Driver’s Manual?	"OK, the backstory is a bit long, so I’ll be brief. My (15F) sister and (16M) I are both eligible to take the written test and get our instructional permits. My sister is a little over a year younger than me. The plan was to go in and take the test tomorrow. The problem is, I have been unable to get my permit until now because we live overseas most of the time. We got back in to the US yesterday evening. 

Anyway, we were both supposed to read the Driver’s Manual in time to take the test (We got the PDF about 2 weeks ago). I easily read the manual. It was 96 pages of basic instructions and it only took me an hour. My sister, however, didn’t read it. We are probably not going to take the written test tomorrow because she didn’t read the manual. 

Normally, I’d be OK with this. It’s not something to freak out about. The reason I got so annoyed at her is because I have to go to college in 53 days. I have to somehow learn to drive, get 30 hours of daytime driving, and 10 hours of nighttime driving within a 53 day period. Every day I waste is time taken away from my extremely tight schedule. I got pissed at her because she is holding me back. 

Her reason for not reading the driving manual is because we were on vacation up until Monday. She is right, we were on vacation, but I feel like that isn’t a valid excuse when it is potentially screwing me out of this test. Especially since I read the Driver’s Manual while on vacation with no extra effort at all, and considering that we had a week beforehand to read the manual before we went on vacation. I read it during a semi-long car trip. She had the same opportunity to read it during that same car trip. In an ordinary school, they don’t delay by a day the test because a student didn’t study. The student just fails the test. 

So I got extraordinarily annoyed at her. I basically told her that because she failed to do the work, she was going to fail passing the test. She got super pissed at me and called me an asshole (among other things). I feel like I was justifiably annoyed. I don’t think I stepped outside of my boundaries, or did anything unreasonable. Both of my parents stayed neutral and told me to calm down. (By the way, I never got angry and raised my voice or called her names. I just got annoyed and talked down on her.)

I left my clothes on the toilet and my dad came in and said hi and told me he was home. Turns out he grabbed my clothes and threw them in the laundry without telling me. He also didn't check the pockets which happened to have my ipod in them.

 My ipod had a pretty cracked screen so there was no saving it once it went in the laundry. Once I found out I got kind of mad and told him that he should pay for a new one. When I bought the ipod it was 100% my money and it costed about 200 dollars. The new generation of iPods also costed 200 dollars so I thought that was reasonable but my dad said that he would only pay for what the ipod was worth at the time which he decided after looking on craigslist was about 50 dollars.

 AITA for getting mad at my dad for not paying for the total price of the new ipod or was my dad right for only paying for what it was worth.

Four days ago, due to being bullied for all throughout highschool jack snapped and said """"F__K YOU, YOU MOTHER FU____NG N-word"""" which instantly led to 4 guys treating him as gentle man.

My best friend K and I have known each other since we were kids. He was the best man at my wedding and I was his. Our families are super close. Our wives are good friends. Our kids play together. All that good shit. For the past year or so every time we hang out just he and I, all he does is talk about these other women he's sleeping with. He will literally fuck anything with a pulse. He has multiple online dating profiles and has even shown me pics of these women and messages. I swear it's a different chick every week or so. His wife is the primary breadwinner while he works part time when the kids are at school and takes care of them and the house. His wife is super sweet and also super oblivious to his affairs. I know he's having unprotected sex with these women along with his wife. My wife knows but hasn't said anything to his wife yet. We both want to sit her down and tell her OR basically tell him if he doesn't tell her then we will. Are we gonna be the assholes here for possibly ruining a marriage? Or should we just keep quiet? This is literally tearing me up inside. He's my bro but I don't condone what he's doing and frankly I'm sick of it being the center of every conversation we have. I'm sick of seeing his Facebook posts about how much he loves his wife and how she's his partner for life and blah blah blah. It's all just an illusion. I've told him it's fucked up and he just doesn't seem to care. He's also had a few close calls sleeping with married women and their husbands finding out. Like, one dude sent him a message online telling him to stop messing with his wife. I feel like one way or another, it's going to get out and maybe it would be better for his wife to hear it from people she loves and trusts rather than a stranger. But I just don't know. What should I do? I already feel like TA for keeping it hidden for so long.

UPDATE:

So my wife and I talked to his wife and she did have suspicions that he was cheating but no concrete proof. I told her everything and asked if she wanted to see the SS and texts he had sent me. She said no. Said she needed some time to think about all this and process it. There were a lot of tears from all three of us. She is understandably pissed and wife and me, mostly me, for waiting so long to tell her. We've chatted here and there over text the past two weeks but haven't seen each other in person. K called me two nights after it happened crying and screaming that his life was ruined and we were pieces of shit for what we did. He's still in the house but I'm sure it's only because his wife works so much and doesn't really have other childcare options. I don't really have much to report back. His wife say she's going to get tested soon. She had a few months back when she suspected something was up but everything was clean so her doubts about him cheating were eased until we dropped this on her. I don't know what will happen. It's only been two weeks so I guess time will tell. Anyway, that's about it. I feel like shit but a huge weight has also been lifted off my shoulders. Thanks for all the advice kind strangers.

There’s always been sexual jokes made about me, and I always brushed them off - but now its getting to be a lot . 

I’ve been feeling really bad and the team environment feels toxic, but I usually don’t stand up for myself. I was urged by my bff to call my manager (25/m) in order to rectify the toxic environment and ask him to speak to the boys about the Lewd comments. I did and it felt really good and he said he would talk to them about it.

To be clear, it started out as banter. But then the frequency of the comments increased and it became quite toxic and often times I didn’t want to be at the games. But I kept going because I love Football and playing with boys really increases my skills as the facilities to play girls Football here really suck.

After games, everyone usually changes and takes off their shirts and puts on a new one (cuz sweat). Out of respect, I walk like 5m away from everyone else, turn away from them and change my shirt as fast as humanly possible. 

My team manager texted me yesterday saying that  by changing my shirt in front of the boys I gave them the right to sexualise and make lewd comments about me. “Boys will be boys” and “not my fault they have testosterone” and that I’m not acting “like a lady” .  I’m really upset and hurt that he would say that. 

He’s saying in order for him to talk to the boys about the sexual comments he needs me to compromise and go change in the bathrooms at the pitch - far away, and literally everyone else changes at the pitch - instead of switching shirts. I say I don’t want to compromise because I’m not in the wrong, and although I understand where he’s coming from, compromising would make me look like I’m wrong and that it’s my fault I’m being sexualised

bzzni7	2019-06-13 01:33:57	Vivsmj	AITA for not paying utilities	"Im 22F, I rented out a 4 bedroom 3 bathroom house with a group of people. The lease started august of last year with Jessie, Taylor, and Taylor's brother Chris. Initially it was the 4 of us that were going to be living there. After we signed the lease, Taylor told us the day everyone was moving in, that her boyfriend Chad was also going to be moving in. Jessie and I did not know this was going to be the case, and the house was extremely cramped because of it. (Keep in mind this house is about 1300 sq feet, it was extremely small) 
I have one dog, and Taylor has 2 dogs. We split the pet fee and we each paid half of it. No one stepped up to be the one to take care of the utilities. So, I initially stepped up to get the water service going under my name. While, Jessie put the electricity under her name. Chris, Chad, and Taylor did not offer to take any part in setting up the internet, even when we each already decided to take care of having 1 service under our name. The problem initially was that we needed a modem and router. I decided to take initiative and pay for what we needed, which ranged to around $150, the router I had prior to this wasn't able to handle 5 people on it, as Cox had told me. They recommended I go and buy something that could work better. We searched for internet providers all of which were over $100 a month. I realized I had a promotion with Cox that I could use which was $70 a month for the ultimate package. We all split the utilities by 5 and paid monthly, and I decided to get over the $150 I had to pay for the router and modem. 
December comes, and our living situation was rather very unlivable to my standards, and was too messy. I like the floors to be clean but my roommate's dog continued to shit and pee all over the wood floor, to where at times we'd step in them unknowingly. So I decided to move to my boyfriend's for the remainder of my lease. I however continued to pay my monthly rent knowing it was my responsibility. 
However I decided to stop paying the electricity, water, and cox bill, so they had to start splitting it by 4. The water and electricity is based off of usage, from what I believe, but they (Taylor, Chad, and Chris) believe it is based off a fee that doesnt have anything to do with usage. Jessie agreed with me and said it was based off of usage so she agreed that I didnt have to pay the electricity. They continued to say that it doesn't matter how much water is used or electricity, and that the bill is the same whether I am there or not. Before I moved out I unplugged everything in my room, and moved all my things out of the bathroom hallway (this was my bathroom). I kept the water service and cox under my name so that they wouldnt have to pay the deposit for water, and that they could keep my Cox promotion for their benefit to avoid a more expensive service. I completely stopped paying for all the utilities once I had left 100%. They continued to say that it was still my responsibility to pay 1/5.

One of these close friends, we’ll call him Josh was recently in Costa Rica for a school trip type thing and met a girl who he’s interested in.

This girl lives about 3 hours away from us but only about an hour from this amusement park. He’s now asking me if it would be ok if he invited her on a date when we go for my birthday. 

On one hand I don’t wanna be a dick and tell him no, because I know he would really wanna see this girl again.

But... on the other hand I’m really looking forward to spending time with my best friends for my birthday and riding roller coasters and shit with them. I feel if I say yes she can go then he might just dip on us for her or I won’t be able to spend much time with him.

bzzi02	2019-06-13 01:18:12	gottttablaast	AITA for ending a friendship because my friend got back with their ex?	"Okay, this might be a little all over the place, I apologize. 

My friend, Jay and I haven’t been friends for very long. For the most part we’ve only known each other on and off for about a year. I say on and off because every time Jay would get back with his ex he would vanish, to the point where our friendship didn’t even really form until the fall of last year because I’d maybe hear from him for 2 weeks every like 4 or so months. When we became friends who regularly hung out later on, some lines got blurred and we definitely crossed over into FWB territory. I know that’s important information so I figured I’d get it out of the way now. 

Well, Jays ex was a pretty horrible person (his words), and he would often vent to me about the things he was put through while they were dating. He even said that he believes a lot of his trust and commitment issues now stem from their relationship. There were many nights over the course of our friendship where he’d drink a little too much and cry to me over the pain he caused. 

At the beginning of the year he completely ghosted me for about a month, which turns out he allowed his ex back into his life. When things got bad again, he reached out and needed a shoulder to cry on. I let him back in, and during that time we created some boundaries for each other. One of mine was I’d only be his friend if he didn’t hang around her, because she’s obviously bad for his mental health, and in all honesty I don’t want to have to deal with her and the problems she causes again. 

He was in a really dark place and together we worked hard to lift him out of his depression and find his happiness again. Right when things started getting better, he became distant and sprung on me that he was hanging out with his ex again. I called him and told him I’d be picking up stuff I left at his house, and that’d I’d prefer that after I get everything he’d delete my number so he wasn’t even tempted to reach out when things go south again. 

When he kept repeating how he still wanted to be friends, and that he only slept with her once and he wasn’t wanting to date her. I told him we were never really friends (he always treated me more like a girlfriend. He even told me he thought he might love me? like I said we blurred a lot of lines), and that I wasn’t going to stick around to watch her destroy him while he expects me to pick up the pieces again. Huge fight, a lot of arguing and yelling before I hung up on him. 

I’ve had to tell the story to a few people since then who have asked where Jay has been and about half of them make it known that they think I was TA for trying to “dictate” or control my friends life.  I personally struggle a lot with setting boundaries and what is or isn’t appropriate to expect out of situations. I figured reddit would be able to tell me if I’m an asshole who grossly overstepped so I can use this situation as a learning experience."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzzhrx	2019-06-13 01:17:33		AITA For telling a coworker they look tired?	"TL;DR at the bottom, I’m going to try and explain this in an unbiased way

So I work in an office on the typical Mon-Fri 8-5 grind with a few other people.  A co-worker (F) who I will call C1 and I (M) we’re both leaving together as it was 5 pm like we usually do and on the way out struck up a short goodbye conversation with another coworker (F) of ours who I will designate as C2 (note: we are all between 20 and 30 years old). 

Now C1 started off by asking C2 how long she had been in the office today, to which C2 started off with “uhh a long time” and I added in “all day right?” C2 then says “it’s been a really long day” in a mainly “I’m over it” tone and this is where I’m confused. I said “yeah, you look tired” and both C1 and 2 gasped and looked at me like I had whipped it out (I just like the comparison, point being they were both very taken aback). C2 exclaimed “excuse me!” And I just kinda mumbled in confusion “oh sorry you just looked tired” and C2 just said “BYE” in a pretty definitive way (it was still in a bit of a joking manner because all of us have always gotten along with no issue but you get the message). 

So we all said our goodbyes like we usually do and went on our way.  I just feel like I might have said something wrong even though the phrase is always thrown around whenever someone mentions that they are tired, but both their reactions made me feel like I did something wrong and am an asshole. I do see how it could be taken as a “you look terrible today” kind of thing but that’s never happened to me so I’m just not quite sure. I am ready to accept judgement, so am I the asshole?

TL;DR told a coworker/friend they looked tired, for two very taken aback reactions

bzzh3i	2019-06-13 01:15:43	Leon_Zea	AITA for suggesting my date walk to a bar that's 15 minutes away	"A girl(24) and  I(24) went on a date to a bar; our first date. We both live close, and the bar is a 15 minute walk from her house, roughly 15\~20 minute walk from my house. I asked her if 8pm is OK for her, she said she just needs to see if her mom can give her a lift. I SUGGEST that she could walk because it's pretty close. She gets really annoyed that I suggested this, saying things like ""omg you're testing me hard right now, you think I'm going to go walk to the bar in my heels?"". I said ""my bad, I didn't think of you walking in your heels. I could always give you a lift"".

She accepted the lift & we went on the date, but only after her saying I was being as asshole for wanting to make her walk to the bar, which I apologized for & said it was just a suggestion. It's been some time since our first date, maybe 3-4 months, but she still brings it up when she's mad as an example of times I was an ""asshole"".   


Edit: She said it was an asshole move because somebody with manners would have offered to give a lift in the first place, instead of only offering after suggesting she walk."	Not the A-hole	0	0

A friend of mine wanted to hang out and we set a time for his place. I had alarms set and was planning on waking up, getting ready, and going. Instead I slept through my alarms, never heard them once and woke up two hours late. My friend is mad at me but he is the type who doesn’t want to hear or have to care about my problems. He sees it as we’re all going through stuff but you don’t let your problems control your life.

The thing is, I can’t help it. I’m broken from knowing that I’m officially a stranger to my family. I’ll never see them or talk to them again. Lately I haven’t left home unless I absolutely have to because being around people causes me to break down. Seeing all the cute families out and about. It’s like I’m being stabbed.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to go anymore?

Update: It kinda turned into something funny. I took the advice given and called him because he wasn’t responding to my texts. Usually means he’s mad at me or about something. NOPE. He overslept as well. Lol, which made me glad because I felt terrible about not waking up on time. I’m still at his place and am having a good distraction. Will look into help asap.

bzzea4	2019-06-13 01:08:05	Break4Coughy	AITA for complaining to customer service about an employee?	"When I buy things on Amazon I use Amazon Cash. The way it works is that you can go into a participating retail store and pull up a barcode on the Amazon app, they scan it and you pay cash and it’s applied to your Amazon account. It’s not ideal but I have a lien on my bank account and can’t use my card.

The closest participating retailer is a GameStop and I’ve gone there to add money to my amazon account six times since May 1st, the last time being June 6th. I went in today to add cash and the associate said they’ve never heard of it before. When I explained what it was, he changed his answer and said they don’t do Amazon cash. Then I pulled up the confirmation email that Amazon sent me from the last transaction. It not only included the name of the store the money was added at, but also the date, he then said that he received an email from his supervisor _3 days ago_ saying that they no longer participate in that program.

I felt that it was obvious he just didn’t want to do it for whatever reason. So I called the customer service line and made a stink about it. This is the first time I’ve ever complained to customer service about someone and now that I’ve calmed down I’m wondering if I went overboard.

Update- I called other GameStop’s in my area and asked if they participate- they all said they did."	Not the A-hole	0	0

my son is currently doing a drama course and waw starring in a main roll for a play made by his drama buddies and him.

throughout the stress of everything I was able to send a quick text to my son that i might not be able to make it. I never even checked the reply as the minute I got home I was dealing with a 17 year old girl who was thrashing on the ground and screaming (she has severe PTSD) 

my son came to visit me yesterday to find out why I never made it to his play and I explained everything, he is mad and just thinks that I missed out on his debut roll.

"My girlfriend and I have lived together for about 6 months, and we have a friend that got a summer internship and needed a place to stay in town for the summer, so he asked up if he could live with us. We said sure, that's fine. He has a stipend and makes plenty of money where he could go get a 1br apartment, but we thought we would help him save money. So fast forward a month and a half, and his boyfriend is always over, and our parking is very limited in front of the house, so we asked if they could maneuver their cars behind and around ours instead of parking in front of our neighbors house. He ignored this completely and didn't seem to want to even try to comply. The week afterwards, he is slowly becoming less understanding about living with over people, and he starts refusing to do dishes after they eat, and threw our very nice stainless steel pots around and scratched them up. I saw it this morning, so I sent him a picture of the mess, and the pan and said ""Hey, could you please try to be more careful with our stainless steel pans, we really love those and don't want to mess them up. Also, please try to clean the sink out at the end of the night, whether your rinse the dishes and put them in the dishwasher, or hand wash and put them up."" 

He replied just saying Okay, and has not spoken a word, or made eye contact with us all day. Usually we catch up when we're all off work, and he showed up an hour late to dinner having already met up with his boyfriend, and didn't say anything the entire time he was eating when we were on the couch hanging out. His boyfriend is very nice and was thankful for us cooking dinner (we alternate Wednesdays) and talking to us, but our roommate was obviously very upset. This is a 21 year old man so I feel like how I asked him to respect our house rules wasn't crazy or rude but I just wanted to get a second opinion. I don't think I want to be friends with someone with this fragile of an ego to shoot him right into immaturity, but if I'm actually an asshole for saying something, I'd be happy to apologize.

bzz426	2019-06-13 00:40:02	DitzyCoworker	WIBTA if I told a guy about how his ex cheated on him multiple times which he never had any idea about?	"So about a month ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bqq0t1/aita_for_saying_to_my_coworkers_face_in_front_of/), which, as I mentioned in the comments, since I didn't have room for character limit, that it happened a few years ago.

I guess I'm kind of an asshole, but I also left out a lot of other stuff (which may have made a difference in the verdict), which will be mentioned here since it relates to the question.

So, fast-forward to today. Emily is no longer there and long gone, and pretty much the only relevant person from the story still around is BF #2. I'll call him Bob.

I was never very close with Bob back in the day - especially when they were together. In fact - ironically, out of the three, Bob was the one who put her on a huge pedestal and treated Emily like a queen the most. Took her on expensive dates and stuff. He actually asked her out a year before they started and she declined, but surprisingly, while still hanging out as friends for another year he was somehow able to 'change her mind'. Of course, she did take full advantage of his crush on her during that year, getting him to buy her stuff and give her rides places and other stuff (and even after they broke up she was dragging his feet and teasing him with false hope, but that's for another time).

It also got to the point where, because I would often call her out on her toxic behavior and disagree with her on things (unrelated to Bob or her life), Bob wanted to play the hero and defend her his white knighting went as far as making a social media post putting me and a few others on blast.

Anyway, at one point before they broke up - we had a going-away party for some people who came from abroad to work with us for the summer, which Emily actually organized. Despite being her boyfriend, Bob wasn't there - but during that party, she actually did make out hardcore with a few of those people.

Obviously I didn't rat on her because I considered her a friend at a time and had no respect or empathy for Bob after how he treated me, though I did kinda feel sorry for him.

So as of today four years later, I now work alongside Bob quite often and we are more civil and friendly - we don't hang out or anything, but we have put aside our differences and talk a lot about random stuff, including old co-worker gossip since we'd both been there for a long time. Emily's name has never come up, it's been kind of an elephant in the room - I'm actually kinda dreading the moment she does come up, which will happen soon, because I am considering telling him.

I know they're long broken up, but the thing is, I don't think he ever knew (before you say he probably knows, I have solid reason to believe he doesn't which I can't fit here). It also wouldn't start anything either since she now lives across the country. WIBTA?"	Asshole	0	0

bzz3ie	2019-06-13 00:38:28	sleepless_socks	WIBTA if I gave my roommate constructive suggestions before I move out?	"I am almost done with my first year of college and I’ve had two roommates this year. Early on we all got along really well but she made some... interesting comments behind each others back. Like how toxic our relationships are and how the only reason I got into the college we go to is because my mom works here (not true).
We decided we wanted to live together about midway through the quarter and as soon as we said this she started getting worse and worse. She had 8am classes and woke up at 7 to ate loud food on her bed while we were trying to sleep. She slams doors and is in general loud. During break she visited my other roommate’s home and made comments like “wow your whole family uses only one bathroom” “Your house is so small”. She also made comments to my roommates aunt (who has brain damage) asking my roommate right in front of the aunt “is this the one with brain damage?” &etc.
My roommate started to get frustrated and we had a conversation about everything she said and we were pissed.
Then one night we and a few other people from my suite went out for kbbq. We chose a cheep restaurant Bc we are all broke. The service was horrible. We were the only people there and the waiter did not bring us water or silverware or even the utensils you use to cook the meat with. We asked several times to be brought that stuff.  So we went to the host and they ended up getting us it. As well as when we were cooking the waiter took the tongs out of my friends hand. Like didn’t even ask for them, just took it. So we only wanted to tip 15%.
My roommate however didn’t like that and insisted we tip 25%. No one wanted to tip that much so she said that she would pay the whole tip. That was all fine and no biggie. I payed with my card and requested everyone on Venmo and she got offend that she had to pay more than everyone else. I explained that she said she would pay for it so I requested the tip plus her meal from her. She got pissy and said that since we all ate we should all split the tip. So she didn’t pay the tip. I was stuck with a tip to pay myself.
Then later that night she calls her mom crying about said tip and how I was horrible for only wanting to tip 15%. Her mom and her both started saying horrible things about us. Stuff like how I’m fat and that my roommate was anorexic Bc she’s selfish and how we are menaces and how we were raised wrong. My roommate and I don’t care if she talks bad about us but we do care if she brings out family into this drama.
We decide we don’t want to live with her anymore and let her know this. We say this in the nicest possible way and go about our day. She then decides to start ignoring us. We say bless you when she sneezes and she just scoffs. My roommate and I don’t really care we know she’s immature so we ignore it. She also decides to start spreading rumors about us.

WIBTA if I give this letter to her as I leave?

I'm not a birthday person so I asked to have one small birthday with them, as well as my parents. My dad didnt show up until the last minute and treated me like shit the entire time. Meanwhile my mom was having a huge argument with her sister. 

The next day, my actual birthday, my mom comes back from work and immediately says that we should go to my work, that I will be starting the day after my birthday, and that i should start my training. I told her that it's my birthday and I'm not legally allowed to work yet(I dont have working papers for being 15 years old) she basically rolled her eyes and left me alone. Later when im going out to our family dinner my mom started to ask me about photography, I'm completely useless when it comes to photography. I told her that she should ask her friend, who is coming over to stay at our house and will be sleeping in my room. She then yelled out in the middle of the street""Dont talk to me like that"". After that I had enough and just went back home without them. My dad came home and yelled at me for leaving them and said it was all my fault that we didn't eat dinner.

TLDR: I left my parents in the middle of our way to dinner after then being rude to me for the past two days"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzz2tw	2019-06-13 00:36:23	AshHole_Anon	AITA for having another friend fill in for my Maid of Honor?	"AITA for telling my ""best friend"" she is no longer my maid of honor... 

I have been planning my wedding for close to 2 years. In the beginning we hung out every day, she is one of the reasons I'm with the man I'm with now. 
She was dating my husband's best friend. They ended up breaking up and dating her current boyfriend and the father of her child.

2 months later she ends up cheating on her boyfriend with her ex. (My husband's best friend) 
Her current boyfriend finds out and forgives her because she is pregnant with is child...

Anyways a year and a half later, she hasn't talked to me other than to tell me that if my Husbands best friend is at my wedding than she wont be going...

Little does she know because she stopped talking to me that he is no longer in our lives. 

She not once has tried to help plan my wedding, bachelorette party or bridal shower... knowing that she is my Maid of honor. 

I ended up messaging her for her new address when I was sending out invitations, our conversation goes as so....

Me:"" what's your address for wedding invitations?""

Her: *address* 

Me: ""awesome, thank you. 😊❤""

Her: ""your welcome""

Me: ""how are you doing?""

Her: ""good we got all moved into our new place and finally settling in lol how are you?""

Me: ""Been doing good.  Either working or working on wedding stuff. Can't seem to have a day of doing nothing lol""

Her: ""Nice. so I kinda need to know if im still in it or not. Because i was never told when or where the girls were getting their dresses and honestly it didnt feel too great hearing that they all had theirs. And i wasnt invited."" 

Me: ""We didnt have a big get together or anything. My mom bought dresses for her wedding she was going to have then that obviously got canceled. So she just gave me her dresses. I've had felicia step in as my maid of honor, she has been here and reaching out and helping me the whole time. I would love for you to come as a guest and share that day with me tho.""

Her: ""Im glad. Maybe if there had been more effort for every time i had reached out to you to try and help you or offer help or spend any time with you then maybe it would be a little different. I hope you have a beautiful wedding but i dont think i will go.""

Me: ""I feel very similar and I'm extremely sorry to hear that. Hopefully in the next couple months things will turn around and you will feel like coming. You and chris are both welcome. I dont hold any bad feelings. I still love you and miss you alot."" 

My wedding is in 4 months... she waited till now to even mention the wedding to me. I've also reached out to her multiple times and most the time she can't get together because she is ""busy""... I know her boyfriend isn't my biggest fan and doesn't like her to be around me. He has admitted it to me."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzz27g	2019-06-13 00:34:36		AITA and/or a bad friend?	"I was best friends with this girl, we will call her Theresa. We would hang out a fair amount, and I’d pay for outings with her family sometimes. Then I went through a rough breakup and she was super supportive... Always coming over or asking to hang out to keep my mind busy.

Her brother came for a visit soon after my breakup, so she told me to go on a few dates with him to get back on my feet since he was just here temporarily. However, he and I ended up dating long distance when he left. 

After he was gone, Theresa stopped texting me or asking me to hang out as much. And I’m a low maintenance friend and wasn’t so depressed anymore, so I was fine... I don’t need to hang out all the time with my friends. But any time we did hang out, I felt like things were different so I pulled back too. Turns out she was annoyed with me because I was talking about her brother too much when we hung out and she felt that I wasn’t putting as much effort into our friendship as she did. She didn’t tell me any of this until much later though. If I knew, I would’ve paid closer attention to my words or tried to do what she was wanting for me to do as a friend.

Eventually we got back on track and got close again. Then her brother/my boyfriend moved in with her (he got a temporary permit), but he struggled a lot getting settled in. My focus became him because he got very volatile and sensitive, he would easily get angry and yell or cry. He and I started to fight a lot because of this, and since he lives with her, Theresa noticed. 

Soon after he moved in, Theresa started talking to me through him (she’d tell him to tell me things rather telling me herself). I think that maybe I subconsciously stopped talking to her too.. but my attention was on my boyfriend so I didn’t really notice. 

Then an important day for my boyfriend came around and we got into another fight. Theresa took it upon herself to start texting me, telling me I was a bad girlfriend, etc. And I told her she had no idea about my side of things so it was unfair to accuse me of being a bad girlfriend and that she should hear me out because we were friends. Her response was to tell me I was a shitty friend and then she went off on me for not speaking to her. I tried apologizing and asked her to meet with me so we could talk things out and she refused. 

Its been two months now... I no longer feel like I can go to her house, and my boyfriend won’t even invite me over unless he knows I won’t see her. I didn’t get invited to her child’s birthday. And now mutual friends are excluding me from get togethers. I don’t intend on breaking up with my boyfriend, which means I have a good chance of being her kids aunt one day. But now she despises me. And I don’t get it.

bzz1oe	2019-06-13 00:33:07	PM_ME_YOUR_ZOD_RUNES	AITA For refusing to have anything to do with my daughter's baptism?	"So a little bit of background info, my mother is a Christian and she forced me and my brother to go to church every Sunday pretty much until I was 17. My dad is an atheist but to avoid any tension/arguments he would just side with my mom on everything. Now don't get me wrong, I love my mom and she's done ALLOT for me but it had always bugged me that she forced her religious views onto me and my brother.

So I'm in my late 20's now and have a 4 year old daughter. My girlfriend (also my daughters mother) isn't really religious but her 80+ year old grandmother is. Religion doesn't really play a part in either of our lives but my gf kept asking me to baptise our daughter because her grandmother was always bugging her about it.

I told her that I didn't want to and that's its not my desicion to make, once my daughter is old enough she can decide for herself. She would bring it up every few months after that and eventually I got tired of it and told her that she could do it but that I wanted NOTHING to do with it.

So a few months after that she calls the church and sets it up. Problem is that she doesn't drive (neither does her family) and she asks me to drive her. I straight up told her no and stood my ground. She ends up going with my parents and her family (my brother was the godfather) and gets it done. 

Anyways this isn't an issue between us  and happened a few months ago but whenever I think about it I always wonder if I did the right thing and if I'm an asshole for not going to my daughters baptism?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

However, due to my lack of responsibility, I sometimes bike too quickly, causing my mother to be pretty far behind. At our usual rest stop, she arrives and is very angry. Thus, she returns home, and we follow. When we arrive home, she is still very angry and goes off in a minor tantrum (this is quite common for her, though it can sometimes be way worse). By her usual behaviors, she will probably give us the silent treatment for quite a while. AITA? I know I shouldn't have biked so quickly, but her reaction seems a bit extreme.

bzz0j7	2019-06-13 00:29:59		AITA for not covering someone's shift	All the part timers I work with are going to be graduating in a few weeks, so of course lots of stuff is going on. For some reason whenever they want me to cover for them they never ask me directly, they ask our coworker to ask me for them. She doesn't ask me face to face either, I'm usually downstairs while she upstairs and we kinda just yell/talk to each other. Today this happened because one of them has a graduation barbecue on Saturday, which also happens to be his last day working there, and of course I was asked to cover. I declined because I'm too busy to be covering for others right now. Over the past few weeks my schedule has been, work all day, then workout, or I work all day, then I rehearse for one of the three plays I'm in, or I work all day, then support my friends (Who I consider closer than family) in their performances, or I work all day, and then I go to my second job. I've been pretty burnt out lately, and I've been getting pissy (also I'm trying to quit smoking weed daily so that doesn't help) because of it. I've been skipping meals alot recently, because there's just no time for it. If I had said yes to Saturday then I would've had to work all day, skip supper again, cancel a workout with my buddy when I said I'd be there after a week long absence, and then perform three plays in one night.		1	0

bzyyad	2019-06-13 00:23:41	usernamesarepersonal	AITA for baking a cake for my grieving neighbor?	"My husband just stumbled upon me baking a cake. I’d been meaning to take something to our next door neighbor on Monday, which was her first day of retirement, but I’d been sick in bed and didn’t get around to it. I've also been checking on her here and there, because her husband passed recently and they meant to retire together and now she is alone. The whole situation is just heartbreaking. So anyway,  today I felt well enough, and happened to have just the right amount of ingredients for a pound cake. So I’m busy mixing this cake, and my husband wants to know what it’s for. The neighbor I tell him. And what about us? He’s referring to himself, and his parents whom we’ve been hosting the past 3 weeks. I let him know there isn’t enough and that I’ll make another one another day. He proceeds to go (imo) absolutely insane. That I’m giving his parents a reason to “judge us“. That I must have been raised wrong, because it “doesn’t look good” that I bake a cake for someone else with guests in the house. That I should make enough cake for everyone, or none at all. Uhh ok? He then offers to go to the supermarket and pick up ingredients. This is actually great news because I need a few groceries. I’m still annoyed but I’ll move on. So I tell him I’ll text the list and he then replies that he’ll only shop for cake ingredients but nothing else. Because it’s “hot outside”. This is when I tell him, nicely, to fuck off. AITA?

PS: cake is in oven, inlaws haven’t even noticed there is cake and haven’t said a thing. Husband is playing nice to me. I’m still mad at him.

Edit:
To answer the redditor who asked if I’m really concerned with being the asshole... I know husband is being a brat. I posted this to try to hopefully insert some levity into a frustrating situation and because I was really really mad! I showed him a few of the posts, he humbly accepts he is TA and that maybe he just really wanted some cake. We're laughing about his tantrum now. It probably still isn't funny to the internet at large but we’ll at least move past this with some humour. He's usually lovely I swear, but he is definitely not getting any cake anytime soon! Maybe the inlaws will though, because they are my favourite and very nice. The cake is out of the oven and cooling, and I will be dropping it off shortly! Thanks for all the replies :)

Edit 2:
The cake was dropped off! I think she liked it, she is holding up ok, and I’ll be checking in on her again in a few days. Hubs is very well aware of how much of TA he was being, he’s very sorry guys! His mom did eventually notice the cooling cake, and did ask if hubs was getting some. I told her no, and that was that. Not going to make anything of a little comment though. My in-laws are very sweet, if a bit tribalistic. I generally love just about anyone, so really, if anyone seriously does want cake hit me up in the SoCal area! I used the recipe from The Cake Bible, but will certainly be trying the suggestion of the 7up pound cake one day.  When I have groceries lol. A lot of the comments had me in stitches, thanks for the laughs! Husband has lost cake AND spoon licking privileges, we won’t be getting a divorce, we aren’t newly-weds (8 years married) and we both think a Dumb Spouse (DS) category on this sub would be much cheaper than marriage counseling! On a more serious note, some comments did note that it is entirely possible to feel self-doubt in a situation like this and I agree! I struggle with recognizing emotions and feelings a lot, but in this particular instance I trusted my gut. That’s just all the therapy paying off :) Thanks again for all the kind comments, good night to all."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzywdl	2019-06-13 00:18:18	Elden_g20	AITA not attending my Granddad's funeral if my Mothers BF is there?	"I wanted to come here for some second opinions about a family drama. The Asshole (?) in question is actually my brother (24), let's call him Dave. 

The situation is essentially, our Grandad passed away a few days ago and Dave has told her he refuses to go to to the funeral if Mum's (on/off again) BF is there. Essentially Mum needs to make a choice between the BF and Dave over who will be at this public funeral.

A few details of the family situation:
- BF has been around for the last 11 years and knows Grandad. BF is only 32 now, Mum is 55.
- BF is an asshole; very arrogant, unintelligant, obnoxious and selfish as a person. Mum keeps him around because low self esteem/doesn't think she could do better. He cares for her though at the moment.
- BF left her a couple of years ago when he was earning good money and wanted to be young/single.
- BF comes crawling back 6 months later when he loses his job/breaks his wrist/is depressed. Mum takes him in.
- Dave has lived at home this whole time so is exposed to all of this (I live in another town) firsthand.
- Dave used to really respect BF from a young age (teens) but is now sick of him and wants him gone.
- Dave gets fed up with him this new years this year, and slashes his car tires/pisses on his keys/punches BF in the face with some friends and tells him to get out.
- BF doesn't want to come back on the property now, but he and Mum still meet up in secret, knowing that Dave will start a fight if she let's BF back onto property.

So that's where we are now, with Dave making this ultimatum to Mum that he will not be there if the BF is. I am of the opinion that this is about Mum's Dad passing away, and he's bringing his own drama into this unrelated situation at a time when it is unnecessary. 
What do you think?

Tl;dr: My brother is refusing to go to my Mum's Dad's funeral if her BF is there. Brother hats the BF (with good reason), but is he the asshole?"	Asshole	0	0

bzywau	2019-06-13 00:18:03	BarnBallz	AITA for hitting a mutual friend’s car and not paying him?	"Back in March I was at a little get together at a buddies house and ended up backing into another one of our friends. It was icy out and as he was trying to leave up the steep driveway he got stuck. I couldn’t see him because of the angle and the height difference of the vehicles (I was in reverse, he was going forward out). 

I ended up shattering his bumper, and denting part of his trunk lid. My suv suffered from almost nothing next to a scratch so I wasn’t worried about mine, but concerned and apologetic for what I did to his. I told him not to worry as I would pay for the damage I had done out of pocket, no need for insurance. 

A few days later he sent me a picture of a quote for the repair ($1,500), but he only sent the part that showed the price, not the parts quoted. I asked and asked for the full quote and the front page that had parts listed. He never sent it and we were never able to meet up for me to see it and write him a check. 

A month or so later I saw him at a bonfire, but nothing was said. The next day I noticed my car was keyed on the passenger door. I never said anything about this because it didn’t feel right to accuse him. 

Fast forward to last week he tried calling me all week, but I never answered because I worked almost 90 hours that week. I later explained the circumstance via text but never called him. During the weekend he texted saying I never called and was trying to act like he knew where I was. I ignored him. 

Today he texts asking if it’s not going to be worked out. I explained I wanted the front page of the quote and I’ll pay the body shop myself. He once again sent the same picture of only the price, and I once again asked for the front page. He hasn’t responded yet. 

I understand this whole ordeal is taking way too long but I don’t want to pay for something I didn’t do to his car. AITA??

Wife and I have only been married for a little over a year, but emotionally, I think the relationship was dead before I even said “I do” but that’s my fuck up. Anyways, I’ve brought up counseling multiple times to my wife because we have a TON of issues and she either laughs at the idea or nods it off as it’s not an issue. I really do love my wife, and there was a time I thought we could save it. Now? I’m just not interested anymore, and I’m ready for the next chapter. 

So long story short, I’ve tried and tried and tried to save this marriage myself and offered getting neutral help with a counselor and she has declined. So I’ve given up. I can only do so much. 

So my in-laws have been noticing the relationship falling apart and now for the past week they have been calling and texting saying that they want to help, going as far as to pay for marriage counseling. I don’t want marriage counseling anymore, I don’t want it to be paid for by you, and I certainly don’t need them to bothering me all day over this matter.

My aunt has some dementia and someone has to be with her at all times. My sister lives nearby (10-min drive) and my cousins live a half-hour drive away, but they don't visit much (about once every two months). I'm lucky that my aunt has enough money that I can pay for caregivers. I'm not paid for my time, though I am reconsidering this. It's tiring looking after her, but it's less stressful than it was when she was in a retirement home (secure unit) and was confused and unhappy.   
Last year, I hosted a small party for my aunt's birthday. This year, I told my sister that I didn't want to host and would be happy if the other relatives could take my aunt out somewhere. Today is two days before my aunt's birthday, and I haven't heard that anyone is taking her out, so I told my sister I would take my aunt out to a cafe on the afternoon of her birthday and would invite the other relatives to join us if they can. My sister replied that she has been talking to the other relatives to make dinner plans. I asked why she didn't tell me about it, and she reminded me that I had told her it would be nice if the relatives took her out. I explained that what I had hoped is that the others would take her out on a few different outings (and give me some free time). I didn't mean I wanted everyone to get together and go out without me.   
I asked my sister why she didn't include me in the plans (ie, check my availability at the same time she was checking theirs). She said she wanted to figure out a plan and then invite me. The plan is not yet finalized, and the dinner will be either tomorrow or the next day.

I (F) have been close friends for a long time with a girl from work. She has had a history with eating disorders (specifically bulimia nervosa) in the past and according to her (and her family who I also know) she has made a full recovery.

For a while, nothing seemed out of the ordinary and the thought of her having a relapse never crossed my mind. Recently, however, I’ve noticed her eating patterns have become somewhat irregular — she eats frequently large quantities and visits the bathroom very often (5-6 times during a 7 hr work day), almost always right after eating. I’m concerned that her ED has returned, especially since she has not been looking as healthy as she used to. 

Initially I was considering asking her about it, but I don’t want to bring back uncomfortable memories, trigger her, or offend her if it turns out there’s no issue.

I’ve waited about fifteen minutes and I’m second in line when a woman comes in and starts moving through the line by saying “can I go ahead of you?

Sorry, not sorry, but I don’t think having kids qualifies as a disability that entitles you to preferential treatment. It wasn’t a hot day outside and there’s fifteen restaurants with a drive thru in a one mile radius.

bzyt7i	2019-06-13 00:09:48		WIBTA when i(20m) snapped on my gf(24m) because she disrespects my activities ?	"I'll try to keep this simple. I live at dorms, 2hours from hometown, she lives near the dorms. She just spent majority of her time finishing her masters, I'm in finals of my 1year. Both are uni students(she's finished as I type this). Her activities/plans were put on top of mine, for example I would cancel my plans so that we can hang out when she has free time. This would happen very often, I would travel home and see family less, cancel friends bday parties and so on so that the two of us can hang out. 

I understand that she has less time, finishes uni and stuff so her activities, like last drinks with her classmates and similar stuff is important, the problem is I am often left hanging. We would have plans, she would cancel them and then argue that her are more important. Now I don't ever do this, I never went out or did my plans(even just going home for a weekend and seeing family) when the chance to hang out with her arose because I wanted to spent some time with her and she had a busy schedule. 

This happened again this weekend as I had plans but she said she has time, I cancelled mine because I wanted to celebrate her masters, and today she cancelled our plans and said to me that we MIGHT be together later that night. I cancelled my plans because she said we can hang out, she then proceeds to cancel it and calls me a dick because I plan on going home instead of waiting for a ""might hang out later that day"". 

I was fed up with all of my activities being disregarded lately and snapped on her and said I'm going home to see friends, to which she said that I can ""fuck off home"" and called me an asshole for not respecting her position in life now. She feels she is at a significant crossroad in her life. I respect that but I am no dummy to ditch all my life plans only to see her cancel events on weekly basis and wait for her with all plans.

However, her friend arrived with a bunch of precooked meals, almost all of which including meat.

Luckily, my Mom has told the friend that I’m vegetarian which the friend took well but my Mom refuses to say anything.

bzys73	2019-06-13 00:07:06	throwaway65487907	WIBTA if I asked my boss and coworker not to speak in Mandarin when I’m alone with them?	"Throwaway because I know how the title sounds. I work in a small shop with only 2 or 3 other coworkers at a time. Often, we work long shift. One of the shop owners is a wonderful Chinese woman who I get along great with. The other is a guy from Taiwan who was a recent hire. I don’t dislike him and we do get along, but he can be a bit overconfident for someone who recently got hired. 
Lately, the two of them have been having lengthy conversations in Mandarin when I’m working with them. Now, it’s not that they’re speaking a language that I don’t understand that’s the problem. My issue is that often they’re discussing coworkers and myself in a not so great light. I know this because I once joked with them, and my coworker said “you want to know what we were talking about? We were deciding if X person should be fired” or really rubbed me the wrong way considering he’s a relatively new hire. I’d have an issue with that kind of conversation regardless of in what language, but it especially makes me anxious that he can be speaking to my boss about it with me there and I have no idea. Would I be the asshole if I asked them not to?

Edit: just for clarification, it doesn’t bother me that they’re speaking in a language I don’t understand. I could care less about that. My issue is that there have been multiple time I’ve watched them gesture to me, clearly talking about me (I.E using my name) in the conversation while I’m sitting next to them. I’ve watched them do this with others as well. I just find it rude."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzyrxo	2019-06-13 00:06:18	throwawayminimum1717	AITA for asking for payment for helping to paint my mother's basement?	"Hey reddit. I need someone to tell me if I'm right, or just being an entitled teenager.

So, I (17M) Live at home. I live with my mom, and two of my three brothers. My mom is going to sell the house in five years when my youngest brother goes to college. She decided that she would paint the basement so that it is ready to be sold in five years. She also wants us to help paint it for free. I said I would like payment, but she disagrees heavily.

So my mom's argument is that things like painting yardwork, and general maintenance are all part of the responsibilities of being in this family. I disagree strongly. I didn't choose to be born into this family (or even born in general). Why should I shoulder obligations that I didn't ask for? I couldn't leave even if I wanted. I don't drive. Nowhere in my town would provide housing to a minor. The nearest deli is a 45 minute walk through the woods, and the nearest supermarket is a 30 minute bike ride, when I'm not even allowed to leave my street. So, I am stuck in these conditions that I didn't choose. My mother mocked this argument. She made fun of me, saying I chose to be born by being the fastest sperm.

I asked for minimum wage, and I feel that for painting the basement, which is a big job, I shoud be paid for my efforts.

bzyruc	2019-06-13 00:06:01		AITA for keeping my daughter home from kindergarten for the day because the substitute was a male?	"At my daughter’s school, we still have the rest of this week before the summer break begins (a little later than most other districts). My daughter is a kindergartener and dropping her off this morning, I noticed that her regular teacher was gone, and that a substitute was there. This was one of about maybe 5-10 times over the course of the year we’d had a sub; and something about this sub stood out from all the others: he was a male. He was also the youngest of them all, appearing to be in his mid/late 20’s (I didn’t mind this part at all, just an observation).

He seemed like a perfectly nice guy. I got no bad/weird vibes from him as a person. But he is the only man I’ve ever seen in kindergarten at my daughter’s school, and it’s just a little odd. But while it might sound ignorant, I don’t feel 100% as comfortable leaving my daughter with a male I don’t know as I would leaving her with a female. 

It would be real different if my daughter were in, say, the second grade or up; in these grades, there are a lot more male teachers/subs who I have a good impression of. But a guy teaching kindergarten...not saying it’s a bad thing at all, but unless I know and trust the guy beforehand, I’m a little nervous about leaving my daughter in his class.

I was nice and friendly to him (he saw us enter), but I whispered to my daughter as she got unpacked, asking if she’d like to have a special day off from school. I don’t think they were doing anything super educational today anyways, since there’s a sub and only two days of school left. She excitedly agreed, but I told her to keep it a secret. I approached the sub a little while later and told him my daughter just told me she’s not feeling well, and I think it might be a good idea to keep her home for the day.

He was super cool with it, seemed to believe me, and didn’t seem like he had any sense that I was uncomfortable with him. I took my daughter home but have been thinking about my decision since. Was I an asshole for doing this?"		1	0

bzyqxx	2019-06-13 00:03:26		AITA for not interrupting my shower because I couldn't hear what my bf was saying?	"To preface this, I live with him and his 3 siblings/their kids in a single house, and I moved in last year in October. We're all in our 20s, so naturally when I'm in the bathroom, I lock the door because people have the tendency to barge in without knocking to see if someone is in there first. All of our rooms are next to each other, with the bathroom in the center of the hallway.

My bf and I were planning to go out to lunch today, and it's been 90+ F the past several days, so I wanted to take a cold shower before we left. I was in the bathroom for at least 5-10 minutes before turning on the shower. 

I'm in there, hair wet, getting ready to lather, when I hear knocking on the door. My bf had tried to knock on the door the other day mid-shower, so assuming it was him, I told him to go away, I was in the shower. 

I'm lathering my hair at this point, and I hear another knock at the door, this time louder. I hear my boyfriend saying something through the door, but it's muted, and not only that, the water is running next to my ears. ""What??"" I shout. He repeats himself. Pauses. I barely make out what he says. ""Did you hear what I said?"" He says. ""No, I'm in the shower!"" He leaves.

I finish up and go back to the room, and see him sitting on the bed playing his game with his ear buds in, with this dirty look on his face as he looks at me. ""What did you want? I was in the shower, I couldn't hear."" He proceeds to ignore me, so I ask him again. He shakes his head at me. ""It's too late, it doesn't matter."" ""Ok, but it will take a second for you just explain what you wanted, so just tell me?"" He continues to resist, but finally tells me that his nephew (18m) needed the body wash so that he could shower in the other bathroom. I ask if he expected me to get out of the shower and open the door butt naked just to hand over the body wash, he says all I had to do was crack the door open. I reiterate that I had already started my shower and was shampooing my hair, and I couldn't make out what he was saying. It was ridiculous that he was even getting mad at me for this, as he doesn't like to be interrupted when he's in the bathroom either.

He proceeds to ignore me and resumes playing his game and talking in the party, so I continue to get dressed and check my phone, only to find a passive aggressive message from him that he sent while I was in the shower, even though my phone was in the room on the charger. 

""Yea OK. You're making it harder and harder for me to defend you. Like you're trying to make people dislike you.""

Defend me against what? If people want to be mad and dislike me for the fact that I was in the shower and they couldn't get their body wash ahead of time, that's not my problem. I wasn't trying to get anyone to dislike me, I was TRYING TO TAKE MY SHOWER.

bzyqg8	2019-06-13 00:01:57		AITA For possibly giving back a dog we adopted?	"I know I will get mixed reviews on this one. My husband and I adopted a dog about seven months ago now. The dog came from what the rescue believes may have been a shitty dog breeding situation. The dogs were kept outdoors in pig pens. The female we got has had multiple litters and is probably only 2-4 yrs old. She never learned how to be an indoor pet and was most likely mistreated. I've tried everything I know to do and nothing helps. Her anxiety is so severe I can't even take her on walks. She almost got away from me once when a woodchipper scared her. She sits in one room of our house in her crate for hours despite having full toam of the house. She doesn't like to stay outside at all (understandable.) She doesn't want anything to do with us or our other dog. She hasn't really been out of our house it months. It doesn't seem like any quality of life. She won't let us touch her. Giving her a bath is like killing her. She screams and messes herself. She has pooped herself when things scare her around the house. She is so anxious constantly that she is often scared to even drink out of a water bowl. My husband is gone most of the time and I am the primary caretaker of said dog. I feel overwhelmed. I can't travel with her. I can't even take her to petsmart or somewhere regular. 
To sum it up: Am I the asshole for giving back a dog with needs I can't meet? The rescue has an extensive adoption process, so I know she would go to a great family. She would be fostered in someone's home and not sent to a shelter setting."		1	0

I ended up being marked as getting cut second, which I was fine with. One of my coworkers came in at 5 (I got there at 3) and asked if I would switch outs and close.

(I will say I am the type of person that has a really hard time accepting that people just wont like me sometimes which is why this is still eating me up) 

A couple years ago when I started dating my bf (still going strong) I had a best friend who I pretty much spent all of my time with. She had been dating this guy for a while who was basically a neo-nazi. I didn't like him as he was abusive towards her but I didn't want to say anything because I'd rather be there when she realized and shit went down then have her cut me off if I brought it up. (We had another friend who did and she cut him off right away) 

So anyway I start dating my boyfriend who is Korean (and has a Korean name) and of course I call and tell her all about him and how sweet he is and she asks for his name so I tell her and she just makes a disgusted sound. She then says something along the lines of ""couldn't you have dated someone with a normal name"". I got pissed,  I knew what she was like when she was joking and that wasn't it. It really hurt my feelings and I told her so. I asked her to stop and she didnt. She kept making comments here and there and I just gave up,  I felt as though her relationship had changed her so much and I really didnt want to be friends with someone who could be so racist. 

I ended up ghosting her, I just ignored her messages and stopped talking to her completely and thats how our friendship ended.

"So, let me start off by saying although I love both my parents very much, I have a slightly rocky relationship with my dad. When I was younger, he had a problem with blowing up at my brother and I, especially around the time when he and my mom got divorced, and I’ve heard horror stories from my sister about when he taught her to drive. He also had a habit of not showing up to performances and stuff like that, starting in 5th grade. At this point, it’s become a part of my life. My mom, no matter the occasion, always shows up.

However, my school held an awards ceremony last week. My mom showed up, and I did waved and said and told all my friends that she was my mom and all that. And then I saw my dad. I was kind of shocked that he actually showed up. I was so happy I teared up. I guess I was a bit more exuberant with my waving to him than I was to my mom. 

After that, I looked at my mom and she looked kinda unhappy with me, so I figured waving wouldn’t be a good idea. Flash forward to earlier today, and she tells me that she was hurt by what I did, and that she felt invisible. I apologized,  but it’s still on my mind.

bzyon1	2019-06-12 23:56:50	marbledsongs	AITA for being angry I wasn't diagnosed sooner?	"(Reuploaded with an edited version)
All through school I had an issue with school. I didn't really know why, but it was never easy and I experienced burnout pretty early and stopped caring around eighth grade. I struggled through high school, ninth grade was the hardest.

I had a lot of therapists, every year or so the therapist I had either moved their practice out of our range, we moved out of country, or couldn't serve us. (Military hospital, they stopped having patients who weren't dependents of active duty military.)

I never got a proper diagnosis. I had an ADD diagnosis in seventh grade and we had a 504 plan set up in class, but it never seemed to be enough.

I would always beg to gave a diagnosis, but my parents said that it would be too expensive and that our insurance wouldn't cover it. 

After we moved my parents relented and we got me a diagnosis. Turned out I have severe depression, severe anxiety, a mood disorder, and a learning disorder along with some other issues. I was shocked and upset because not only it was the final semester of my senior year and it was too late to get any help for me in school,but apparenlty i had needed to be in special needs classes my entire life. I barely graduated after that and I moved on after a few months to a full time job. But something always bothered me. A co-worker of mine (We all have the same insurance being all military dependents) said the insurance should have covered the entire diagnosis. 

I confronted my parents recently and they changed excuses twice during our argument. First they said they didn't think it was necessary, but when I pointed out I had an incredibly tough ninth grade, they changed it to say my therapists had advised them not to, which I find hard to believe. Then they said it was too late in ninth grade to get me any of the help I needed so they didn't see the point. They said they didn't like me using my ADD diagnosis as an excuse for things, and that because of it I tended to slack off and try to brush it off on depression or anxiety or something like that. I didn't feel like that was good enough though, and I found it hard to believe that all five of my therapists didn't want me to be diagnosed. The issue was never really resolved. 

This all additonaly stung because a month earlier I had been asking for them to better understand my diagnosis, because it's been a year since it happened and I feel like nothing has changed at all. They still get angry at me for crying about things and they don't seem to respect my boundaries at all. My mom basically said that they weren't my therapist and they were my parents not my friends, that they understood enough. 

AITA for being angry at them, or am I just being entitled? They said I never put enough effort forward and I used my diagnosis as a crutch so I'm worried that might be the case.

I'll try to add additional info in the comments if anyone needs it, I was pretty emotional writing this so it might not be the most coherent."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I earned a really great credit card sign up bonus two months ago that's worth $625 in airfare. Before I got it, my sister and I were talking about taking a trip together to Ireland. I was really excited about it. The thing is when my sister and I have gone on trips the last two years I've almost always paid for the majority of them. This is because during one trip she made way less than me and during the other two she was unemployed. I wanted to go anyway so I said I would cover the majority of the costs, but a lot of things she wanted to do were expensive and I ended up footing the bill. She's doing other vacations so she said Ireland was out. I was disappointed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We tentatively made plans to go to Nashville instead because she would have enough vacation time for that. The thing is, she wants to bring a friend along but she's been taking forever to get back to me because of her friend's schedule as far as dates go. Since I don't have dates, I can't request off. And I actually have over a week of vacation time (my sister has three days left for the year after her trips) that I have to use it or lose it by December. And the time is quickly coming for me to book vacations since we can only have two staff members off a time in the small office I work in (10 people). Also, my sister has already made it clear that she wants to do a lot of partying and night life stuff and that's just not my thing. I thought I would be okay with that but upon further reflection this is my vacation and I want to have fun and do things I'll enjoy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My bf of a few months has voiced the idea of taking a Caribbean cruise since he knows I have points. I've never been to the Caribbean or taken a cruise and was actually thinking very hard about scheduling one for myself a few months ago on a singles cruise before we got together. He's going back to school in September and he won't have a lot of free time once that starts, so an August cruise would be perfect. He's also really in a bind financially since he has to put out the money to pay an old tuition bill to start school again and so any vacation is kind a lot for him right now. If I use my points for flights/hotels to the cruise location and we both pay for half the cruise, that should be really affordable. Maybe only $500/$600 with most food/drinks included. Not to mention a lot of quality time with him before he'll have less of it. My sister blew up at me when I told her I want to use all my vacation and would rather go a vacation with my bf. She said I was selfish and was putting my bf above her. I don't think I am. She's in a better financial position than him and I feel I've been more than generous with her in regards to travel. I didn't promise her anything and no date had officially been set. And she's the one that decided she didn't want to do the vacation that I really wanted to do. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bzyjqm	2019-06-12 23:43:47	MrPandaMurder	AITA for not having a beer with my dad?	"I (18M) just graduated high school last week and I’m going to boot camp for the Marines in a couple weeks. My dad didn’t find out I enlisted until a few days before graduation. He’s had mixed emotions, because he wants what’s best for me and for me to be safe, but he also wants me to make my own choices and do what I want with my life. 

The day after my graduation we had a cookout at my dads and he invited friends and family over. Later in the night he sat me down on the back porch and asked me if this was the choice I really wanted to make. After we talked, he asked me to have a beer with him, as he said if I’m old enough to join the military, I should be old enough to have a beer with my father. I agreed with him on this, but I refused. My Grandmother was there, and she basically helped raised me and was the only female figure I had in my life. She always preached about being straight edge and staying away from alcohol until I was legally allowed to drink. I wanted to have this moment with my dad, but I knew if my grandmother went outside and saw us she would flip out on my dad and I, so I declined his offer. He looked visibly upset, and asked me to still sit on the porch with him. I did, and right after he opened a 805 and set it in front of me with and asked me to drink it. I didn’t touch it, I just sat there. My dad and I continued to talk for a couple minutes, then my grandmother came outside. I immediately got up and went inside to my room. A couple minutes later I hear my dad and grandmother arguing from outside. She isn’t dumb, she obviously saw an open beer in front of where I was sitting and assumed I was drinking it, so she reacted exactly like I knew she would. After a few minutes, she tried to open my locked bedroom while yelling at me, and after I refused to open it, left without saying goodbye and the whole bbq awkward.

After my dad came into my room and said it was an asshole choice to not drink it, because she would have had the same reaction that she did regardless if I did drink it or not. I agree with him, but at the time kept my mouth shut. He said goodnight and left me there to think about the backlash I would have the next time I saw my grandmother.

My boyfriend immediately started a petition to make the school hire a new full time music teacher instead of a part time lessons teacher. He got a decent amount of support on change.org and it’s spread to the parents now too. My mom posted it on her Facebook, which was fine until her friend the vice principal saw it. 

Our old vp told my mom that the petition’s whole argument is based on false information and she would be willing to speak to any student to explain the change in the band system. 

I told my boyfriend this and he immediately yelled at me for taking “the enemies’ side” and was purposefully condescending and rude (he’s literally told me he meant it to be condescending). 

I told him he should talk to the vp and see if it’s true because there is absolutely no harm in doing so, and he refuses. Am I the asshole for asking him to consider that he’s probably wrong instead of just supporting him?

bzyj4o	2019-06-12 23:42:09	vgr_aminuu	WIBTA For Not Allowing My Friend To Call His Friends	"Sorry for format. On mobile.

My friend comes over to my house once a week and usually stays for about three or so days. I have a computer, and good internet. Usually my friend, J, comes over and for the first day we’re usually good, playing games together (I have a PC and I have a PS4 I let him use). Whether cross play, or both of us playing single player games, but still talking to each other.

But that stops quickly. Maybe he gets bored? He starts either: playing my ps4 and FaceTiming his friends, or just playing the PS4 and calling his online friends.

If not that, he uses my PC and just plays like CSGO and listens to music, with my sound cancelling headphones on.

This annoys me a lot because he is at MY HOUSE to hang with ME. Not use my stuff. 

But at the same time, I have a better setup than him, he can use his phone here more, his family isn’t as much of a burden. 

Now, I allowed him to use my stuff all he wants, but would I be bad for taking away some of that complete freedom?? Idk

So, WIBTA if I don’t let him call his friends, or use my PC to just play single player games and not talk to me, while he’s at my house? (Or, specifically, when we’re supposed to be interacting with eachother?)"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzyh19	2019-06-12 23:36:48		AITA for messing with my sister's fake profile?	"Going to try to make this quick. I'm 22 and my sister is 18. I went to my sister's room to grab a top she had borrowed(we do this all the time, borrow clothes go into each other's rooms to get them back) and I notice she has Facebook open and the profile pic is...well..me. I have to do a double take because it really caught me off guard. I know I shouldn't have but I snooped at the profile and it was just pictures of myself- my sister literally has a fake Facebook profile of me.

I'm livid at this point for many reasons. 1. I don't do social media. I'm a private person and I don't like pictures of me to be on profiles like that. 2. Some of the pictures she had were ones that she took without me knowing 3. Other pictures that she had were ones I had sent to friends which means she has gone onto my computer and taken pictures off.

I delete all of the pictures and I check her computer and find a folder filled with pictures that she has taken of me and ones that were on my computer- not even all of me per se, ones of my friends, group photos, food I had taken pictures of. I go through even more and find out that she has even stolen nudes that I had taken for my boyfriend.

I deleted the folder completely and went back to the fake facebook profile. I uploaded a single picture of her with the caption ""The real me"", changed her name(she was using my middle name and a fake last name) and then left her room. I've heard her sobbing from her room all day but I'm too angry and embarrassed to even confront her right now. AITA for messing with the profile and not just confronting her in the beginning?

&#x200B;

Update: I decided to confront my sister since I couldn't stand sitting around with a knot in my stomach. As soon as she saw me she started crying and begging me not to tell our parents and saying she was sorry. I told her that I don't think I could ever forgive her and that it made me sick to even look at her. I asked her why she had the fake profile. Apparently she met a guy 1 or  2 years ago on another site and she was too nervous to give him a picture of herself so she sent one of me. He really liked the picture and from then on it just snowballed. She got deeper into it, made the profile and said that she enjoyed all the attention it got her. I brought up the nudes and she played dumb at first, and then said that she must've accidentally copied them over too. I told her that I didn't believe her but she's sticking with that. I asked her to delete the facebook and got the e-mail and information attached to it so that I can change it and make sure she doesn't try to reactivate it. She tried to make me feel bad and tell me that she was gonna lose a lot of her friends because of this and how that was the reason she did it in the first place. At that point I just felt like she only felt bad she was caught and didn't really care about my feelings. I told her that she was being selfish for only thinking about how this hurt her but never thought about how her lies hurt me. She got upset again and I left shortly after. 

&#x200B;

I saw people mentioning that I should change my password on my computer- I've done that. I've explained the situation to my boyfriend and he offered to let me move in with him which I'm probably going to take him up on. I can't be in the house anymore- I feel so uncomfortable and I feel so paranoid about running into people that she may have talked to or sent pictures to. 

&#x200B;

Thank you for people that have sent kind words/messages/advice. I really appreciate it. Today has been the worst day of my life, hands down. The relationship with my sister will never be the same and I don't think the uneasiness will ever go away."	Not enough info	0	0

bzygbs	2019-06-12 23:34:52		AITA for retaliating after my partner told me he hopes my dog dies?	"This happened a few years ago and I've still not gotten over it.

I had a dog who was my absolute best friend. I moved away (different country) for university and he stayed with my parents in the meantime. It was the most  difficult part of my move and I remember crying weekly while I was away from him.

3 years ago when I was with my boyfriend, I was feeding his cat treats. My boyfriend jokingly said that at the rate that I was feeding him, hit cat would die from obesity. I replied, jokingly that at least he would die happy. It was a joke.

Clearly he didn't take it that way because he replied with ""I hope your dog dies"". Literally minutes later, I receive a text from my mom telling me that my dog had died.

Now the rational part of me knows it wasn't his fault but I had never felt such anger in my life. He didn't think to apologise even after hearing that, and at that point I was posses off. I understand some people may think that my love for my dog is over the top but I loved him more than anything in this world. It's been 3 years and I've visited my family once because he was my primary incentive and visiting them without having him there hurts too much.

Anyways, my dog was the one thing I loved most in this world and I knew his grandmother was his. I didn't mean it, but I wanted to hurt him like he hurt me so I then told him that I hope his grandma becomes ill.

I regret saying those words and I never meant them , but I still stand by the fact that I was in my right to say them to hurt him like he hurt me.

I'm still filled with resentment to this day and miss my dog terribly. I understand I should probably see someone about this as it may sound unusual but having grown up with few friends, he was was always there for me and it sucks knowing I'll never see him again.

AITA for retaliating with my admittedly horrible comment."		1	0

bzyfl5	2019-06-12 23:33:04		WIBTA if I asked this person to leave my Discord server?	"Throwaway because one of my friends involved in the situation knows my main Reddit account.

I made a Discord server for my close friend group, and it serves as a group chat for us. This is a server of 13 people that all know each other in real life, and everyone goes to the same high school except for one member. I created it to be a private, safe space where we could share anything without worrying about who will see it.

One of my friends (I'll call him S) asked me on Sunday if he could invite someone else (whom I will call C) to our server. S refused to disclose a name at first, and to be cautious I said no unless he gave us a name. A couple of days later, S sends me a message telling us C's real name, but pointed out that C was not comfortable being addressed by his name because he was shy.

For some context, some of my friends and I have been getting irritated at S's recent behaviour. He's been insulting people and starting arguments for no reason, but I don't think he consciously realizes what he's doing. I don't know if it's attention seeking behaviour or if he's got some deeper personal issues he isn't sharing with us.

C is an online friend of S's, and S tells me they are going to the same university next year. He asked again if he could invite C. If I said no, S said he would have invited C to the server himself in the fall regardless of my answer. I'm a pushover, so I said C could join if he wanted. I thought even if I did say no, he would just invite him later anyway. I had never interacted with C before, but I did my best to make him feel welcome when he joined. C chatted with us for a little bit, but hasn't been active on the server since he joined.

Today, two of my other friends who are also on the server raised some concerns to me. We were all going to hang out together on Friday and S was coming, so he asked us if C could come. It was meant to be an event with only close friends, so we told him C couldn't join us. This was when it was brought up to me that we had no idea who this guy was. We don't know what school he goes to, what he looks like, or what his last name is. He doesn't even want us to use his first name. We've never met him in real life before, and S hasn't either.

I realized that my friends and I didn't really feel safe having a complete stranger in a server that was originally meant to be a private space for our close friends. I'm probably going to have to ask this guy to leave the server. I'm worried that C is going to think I'm an asshole and that S might defend him, even though it's nothing personal. I don't think C did anything wrong, and I would feel guilty if he wanted to get to know us better and I made him leave. It feels like S wants us to get to know C better and maybe make him a part of our group, but I don't think this would be the right way to do it if that's the case.

1. Just cause you had students who was too of the class graduate doesn't dismiss my stress. (she called my reason for quitting a lesser thing than bad, and said that you aren't the only one)

2. She is very unapproachable, and the main reason is because I didn't get any therapy. My parents are holding me away from getting help. I really wanted to stop seeming like a sympathy whore to my friends after a bad depressive episode. (she wonders why we don't talk to her, yet later she will demean you with harshness. Also I said that I felt this for at least two years)

3. This was a little toxic. I said that this year was the bands last good year. We have no percussion section anymore, and the percussion sophomores are very lazy. Then I commented on how she is very distant again. Finally I talk about the other two directors. I call the male very close, while the other lady (I known for a while, like over 5 years) is a lite version of the normal band director.

bzye7n	2019-06-12 23:29:26		WIBTA If I burned my bridges completely and blocked a “friend” of mine for constantly ignoring me?	"Hi,

I’m trying to keep it short and relevant so I’ll share all necessary details and only that:

We are both 19, I’m a guy she’s a girl. We met at University in April and have somewhat consistently been talking. Off the bat I had feelings for her (can you blame me? we met off tinder). Anyways, she says she knows we met off there but she just wanted to be friends and I gladly obliged cuz I genuinely think she’s cool and we had a lot of the same interests .


So it’s all gravy for a few weeks then all of a sudden last Thursday or maybe the Thursday before she didn’t respond to me. Ok, not odd at all we both do this but we usually pick it up on Snapchat since we’re both active there. Nope


Later after that she tells me she deleted Snapchat and to text her but then she stopped replying to my text too. Then she outright stopped messaging me first and I just let it go on and on to see if she would ever notice and message me back. 6 days later and nope. 


I snapped her yesterday asking her if she was good and it’s been a minute and she said “I’m goooooooooood” and I replied something normal back and she ignored that too.


Anyways, obviously she doesn’t owe me anything I know I can have niceguy tendencies I try to suppress (I was dangerously close to saying something I would regret). She probably dodged a bullet tbh, I have a lot of baggage (shoutout /r/raisedbynarcissists) so she’s prob better off.


I just want to know, if i was a normal person, would I be justified in completely removing her off all social media and blocking her out of my life? I realize I’m being emotional and irrational and letting my heart steer the wheel at times, but at the same time I’m hurt. I’m not the best person but I am a person and I feel hurt and confused. I want her to feel the same way I am feeling. I realize it’s sick and manipulative, but at times I feel I can’t help it.


What do y’all think. Would I be the asshole if I ghosted her completely in response to her ghosting me on social media? Or am I being a petty emotional brat?"	No A-holes here	1	0

The brakes went to the floor and we towed the car to him. He fixed it over the weekend and i got the car back on monday of last week. Everything in the car seemed fine to me, as i don’t know much about cars. We did everything he said to do in the report (check brake fluid, ect). Then, last friday, i was driving me and my friend to his house. i was in a school zone going 40km and had to stop for traffic. i had a good 10-20 metres to stop, but my brakes went to the floor and i crashed right into the back of a car. thankfully, the car in front had virtually no damage, but my car (being a low down celica) had the bonnet folded up and the front of the car was smashed. after sorting out all the insurance with the car in front, i had the car towed to a smash repair, in which they told me the car was a write-off. i have fully comprehensive insurance, so i should receive 4 grand for a new car, but the excess is around 1,500 to 2000 dollars. i told the mechanic what happened and that the brakes went again. he told me that he wrote in the report that the brake master cylinder was worn down, so he was covered under law that he didn’t have to pay anything. in response, i put on facebook the gist of what happened. am i the asshole for blaming the mechanic?

We’re all on our twenties right now, but we kind of see each other every week. So one of them, let’s call her Megan, is my best friend since I can remember, we’re almost like sisters. 

So last weekend Megan got back from a trip with her boyfriend, in which they got engaged, and we decided to host a dinner in my house just for chatting, celebrate and have fun. 

In the middle of the night everyone was pretty drunk, except for me because I’m pregnant, and laughing about our past. At some point, another friend decided to say how things have changed, and how we are so different from our teenagers years, that me, Megan and other girl we’re always partying and dating and now we’re building a family....

So Megan said “yeah, but some things stay the same, just look at me and Sarah (me)”. I didn’t understand and asked her to explain, she continues saying “well, I was always with a boyfriend, but you prefered to be with with different guys”, and i was like “and?....”, and she “ and now I’m going to get married and you just pregnant”.

The thing is, I’m with my boyfriend for almost three years now, we live togheter for almost two, and we pretty much don’t get married because both of us don’t believe is something really important. So I just got mad of the way she said that, and i told her that i didn’t like that, and she was like “ oh c’mom Sarah, don’t pretend it wasn’t an accident, everybody knows that (it really was but we choose to keep... not important right now), I always knew you’d be the first, I’m just happy it was after college” 

At this point i just couldn’t hear what she was saying, i got really angry, I mean, my best friend was saying those rude things to me. I didn’t wanna to get into a fight so i just asked her to leave my house ( I was not polite). She got really angry and we did not talk since that day.

My husband loves collecting neat finds from yard sales and flea markets, and had just bought a huge (and I mean like 4 foot tall) antique bug zapper for our barn. He had taken it out the previous day to show friends, forgot about it, and left it sitting outside on a plastic chair. 

It rained that night, so by the morning the electric bug zapper was sitting in a pool of water in the chair’s seat. When I noticed, I moved it and placed it on a higher stack of chairs under the barn awning, so it would dry off and no one would get zapped trying to turn it back on. Also, dude.. water rusts metals. 

Today, my husband and I are outside with our dogs doing yard work, and the ball our Lab is playing with rolls under the stack of chairs where I moved the zapper. When he tries to retrieve it, like clumsy dogs will do, the neato bug zapper falls over and breaks. 

I naturally scold the dog, but my husband scolds me. 

He says: That I should have moved it somewhere better, not so high up. 
I says: That it was left out by him in the first place, and me moving it at all was trying to be helpful.

Who’s the asshole? 🙃 

Edit; this didn’t actually make us angry with each other. We’re just honestly curious whose frame of mind is “right.”

2nd Edit; I didn’t literally scold my dog, people. I yelled at him to get out of the way when I realized the zapper was falling. The bit about blaming the dog was mostly for a click-worthy title. Trust me, no puppers were harmed in the making of this Reddit post. 😝"	No A-holes here	0	0

I was at this hostel and met some people, we decided to go to this club, so I (and the rest) got pretty drunk. While we were dancing Spanish music turned up. I ""playbacked"" to the song as I was dancing. I had heard the song 10 times before at that point and may not understand a single sentence, but I kinda had a feel for the vowels and such. The playbacking is basically involuntary, I am very bad with rhythm and this helps me dance better. 

Fast forward two Spanish songs and one of the guys I went out with comes up to me and screams ""what are you doing? You don't know this song and language"". I very poorly because of the great amount of drinks try to explain, but he clearly doesn't understand. So I try to keep my mouth shut.

My boyfriend was living with other people who abruptly left at the end of April, leaving him in need of a place to live on short notice. I asked my roommate if he could stay with us until September, a suggestion he was not thrilled about. Our place is fairly small, so its understandable. 

My boyfriend and I looked for other options for where he could stay until my lease is up. We decided to split rent on his old place so he could stay there at least 1 more month and move out. This was financially difficult, but avoided him moving in with me for at least a month.

In that month we found a friend who is willing to let him couch surf for a couple months for cheap, and then we figured we could use the savings to get a place in August,  so my boyfriend doesn't have to be at my current place for any extended period of time.

So even though it's kind of a shitty situation, this all seemed like the best solution for everyone involved.


However, my roommate, who is fully aware of our plan and situation has been acting very passive aggressive and surly for the few nights that my boyfriend has spent here in between other places. It seems like an uncalled for response, but every time I ask, he says everything is fine.

bzy74m	2019-06-12 23:11:20	LandoFeng	AITA for not telling my dad that I do Drugs sometimes?	"Throwaway account because my dad is also on Reddit.

&#x200B;

Me (M19) and my dad have a fantastic relationship together. We go to sport events and concerts together, go out in the evening and just like to chill with each other. It means a lot to me and I really don't want anything to change. 

We are really similair in a lot of aspects, but one thing where we are absolutely not on the same line are drugs. My dad was almost an alcoholic my age and despite him still drinking sometimes and being ok with me drinking, he is absolutely against every other drug than alcohol (even tobacco) because he's scared I will become addicted and ruin my future. 

&#x200B;

Now, I don't do drugs very often. I smoke weed like once or twice a week, do mdma 2-3 times a year and maybe something else like once or twice a year but that's it, I also don't smoke. 

&#x200B;

My parents are divorced, and my mother and basically my entire family tree from my mother side knows that I like to do drugs and everyone is chill about it because they trust me and know that I can control myself. My parents have no bad feelings towards each other so they still talk to each other and let me choose where I want to stay for the night. (They live in the same town).

&#x200B;

The longer this goes on (2-3 years now) I feel more and more like an asshole for constantly lying to my dad and not telling him what's going on, even tho I told my entire family. 

  
I really dont' want anything to change between my dad and me, but I know he would be so heartbroken if he finds out.

Would love to hear some opinions, because I really don't know how I should continue.

&#x200B;

I was rear ended about a month and a half ago and got it fixed about a month ago. I didn’t go through insurance since he asked to pay out of pocket. When I got the car back I wasn’t blown away by the fitment of it but I didn’t make a stink about it. Well, tonight I found a spot right near the trunk where the paint is peeling. I’m very fucking angry, as this car has a lot of sentimental value to me and I have a lot of plans for it, and I shouldn’t have to deal with shit like this, especially not after a month. It was my grandparents car and they gave it to me for helping out with a lot of stuff (deck, patio etc), and I remember the day they got it. They worked hard to get a fully loaded car, coming from base mode 90s Pontiacs.  Would I be the asshole for demanding compensation or a new bumper? I want a new bumper with proper fitment and no peeling.		1	0
bzy4i9	2019-06-12 23:04:36	Chaingang132	AITA For breaking up with my girlfriend while she has a depression	"My first post here because I have mixed feelings about what I just did. Me and my now ex-girlfriend were together for like a couple of months, everything was going steady and I knew about her situation. We talked alot about it and I tried my best to be there for her when she needed me. 

Last week/weekend things were going downhill for her and we got into a bit of an argument like we had before and I always accepted it and understood she can't always help it.

The thing is, she told me she had never felt so bad before and really hit buttom rock. I try my best to understand her but since I have never felt like that it's tough. She also said that she had more pain since we started dating but loved me and wanted to make things work. 

I tought about this for a long time and I asked myself if it wasn't better for her sake if she doesn't have to deal with my problems too because it makes things only worse. Don't get me wrong, I fucking love her and I didn't breakup because I was done with her ""situation"".  I finally came to the conclusion that it wasn't the right time for her to be in a relationship because you can't love somebody else if you don't love yourself first.

Ultimatily I decided it wasn't going to work out like I hoped and today we talked like an hour about this and she said she understood me. I told here she could always come to me if she needs somebody to talk to and then I would be there for her. Now I lay in bed and regret  everything I just did. Now I don't know if I did the right thing because I want the best for her."	No A-holes here	0	0

edit 2: I'm British, by holiday I mean vacation.

We've been friends for about eight years. We don't have a lot of deep personal conversations but she's still one of my closest friends, we have a lot of fun together and never had any arguments.

Four years ago when we were both single we went on a couple pre-uni city break holidays together. They were fun holidays (the only times I've holidayed with friends) but, on the second holiday, we didn't dress for the weather so some of it was a bit rubbish. I joked about it this weekend and she said ""we'll make sure not to do that next time"". 

I immediately said something along the lines of ""lol why would you want to holiday with me, that's what your boyfriend's there for"" and she got quite upset.

She's been with her boyfriend for two years and they've been on a couple city break holidays together. We don't talk a lot about him (see: no deep personal conversations) but he's great guy, very funny and sweet. They're very in love and I'm very happy for her, so there's no bitterness or jealousy involved.

I just don't understand why she would want to go on holiday with a friend when she could go on holiday with her boyfriend: the person wirh whon she's in love and is building a life. 

It would never have occured to me in a million years that she'd want to holiday with me when she has a boyfriend. When I told her this, she got upset. In her words, I've made it sound like she doesn't value her friendship with me and that her whole world does and should revolve around her boyfriend.

I've apologised for upsetting her, and said that I know she values our friendship and that her life doesn't revolve around her boyfriend, but also that I don't need holidays to feel valued (I feel very valued in our friendship!) and that I still don't get why she would want to holiday with me, someone who is a close friend but still only a friend, over her life partner. 

She only replied ""I guess"". We've chatted about other things since then, but I can tell she's still pretty sad about it. 

AITA, reddit? Am I the one devaluing our friendship? I feel like agreeing with her would be like claiming I'm as important in her life as her boyfriend, which feels like an IATA move, but I also am starting to feel like IATA because she's upset."	Asshole	0	0

I come back and they are still occupied. Their hamper is clearly next to the machine so I take their clothes out and carefully place them in the hamper making sure to not drop anything.

As I'm starting to do my own laundry the girl comes downstairs and immediately starts yelling at me about touching her stuff. I start apologizing as I don't want any trouble with my neighbors but she just keeps going on and on. She finishes with saying that if she sees me touching her stuff again she'll call the police, which I think is quite excessive.

Long time lurker here, and also typing on mobile.

Last Sunday, my friends and I had planned to go to the park to play some basketball. There was 6 of us going. Unfortunately, an hour before the event, the plan fell through as one of the members was unable to go leaving us with only 5 people.

After some debate, we decided the best thing to do was just to cancel the trip to the park. At least, that’s what I thought was happening.

After we canceled our trip to the park, my friend made a separate GC without me and asked the remaining three if they wanted to go to his house and swim. The other three accepted so the 4 of them hung out with each other on Sunday leaving me in the dust.

At school on Monday, the guys were all talking about how much fun they had on Sunday. Curiously, I asked what they were referring too. My friends proceeded too awkwardly tell me that they had all hung out with each other without inviting me.

I’m not a very confrontational person, so I kept to myself and didn’t say anything towards them. However, inside I was absolutely fuming. The fact that they just chose not to invite me knowing I was available makes me angry and a bit hurt.

Sister is high risk with bipolar and manic episodes so she’s been using tinder and I’m worried about because her judgement isn’t all there at the moment. She is very sexually actively(she’s bi). So, I decided to create a fake tinder account, fake name but did use a pic of mine from 5 years ago in a pool but completely unrecognizable, even to my sister. I wanted to find my sisters profile! I wanted to see what she was saying on there. I’m worried and I know it’s her life but whatever I decided to do it. Ended up wasting about 2 hours of my life swiping away and giving up. Deleted it all. Now, I felt like I should tell my boyfriend because I don’t know. Felt like I should! I’ve been so loyal for 5 years... He’s now all skeptical about it and I wish I never said anything... So I want to know if I’m the asshole or if I’m in the wrong for doing this!		1	0

"My best friend of almost 20 years was supposed to move back to the area in early 2020. We’ve been living 10 hours away from each other for a few years now (she had to move for work) and we were looking forward to finally living in the same area again.

Last week, she moved home nearly 6 months early and didn’t say a single word to me. The only reason I know is because I saw it on FB. 

Knowing her, she must be mad at me for one reason or another although I can’t figure out why. My best guess would be because I haven’t been calling/texting her a lot recently, but I’m busy af and have when I had the time. 

Anyways, I’m not going to say a word to her. I think that she’s doing this on purpose to rouse an reaction from me or get back at me and it’s so frustrating. And honestly, if this is the way she’s going to act, I don’t even want to be her friend anyways.

bzxv8e	2019-06-12 22:41:57	GrouchyCounty	WIBTA if I uninvited my ex best friend from my wedding?	"Basically I was best friends with someone for practically ever, but the friendship trailed off. I invited them to my wedding in a way that upset them, and realized I don't actually want them there.

The long story is that I felt like the relationship was toxic, and thought it would be best to not try and argue about the issues I was having, so I just stopped reaching out. They told me during our most recent conversation that they always knew I'd be back, so between those two things the friendship never officially ended.

I thought it would be a dick move to not invite them, so I did, and I asked if they could come alone if they decided to come. They made it clear that it was 100% not okay to ask them not to bring guests, especially since it'd been so long since we talked, and we ended up on the phone for probably 15 minutes or more before they hung up on me.

The thing is, during that call, I realized that I really just don't want them in my life, I don't want to reconcile or hang out, or talk on the phone, and... I've been a serious stickler about only inviting people who either me or my husband (or both) actually *want* to be around.

I know it would be really fucking mean to uninvite them, especially with all the history we have together, but I really just don't want them to come. Am I an asshole? Do I need to just suck it up?

edit: I'm an asshole, but I'm just going to have to be woman enough to accept it. So I'm going to do what I need to and ~~hope they don't call~~ tell them I'm sorry but I decided I don't want them to come."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzxuy0	2019-06-12 22:41:14		AITA for having a single work friend of the opposite gender?	"Curious as to everyone's opinion on this situation. For context, I've been with my wife for 15+ years, married for 12+. I have absolutely never been unfaithful in any way, neither has she. She lived in Europe for several months while we were dating, and I in college. I have remained faithful throughout our relationship (this is important, I promise). 

A while back I went on a work trip with several people from my office and I became quick friends with a core group of people, one of whom is a single, recently-divorced woman. I do not find her the least bit attractive physically, but we have a similar sense of humor and she's genuinely a nice person.

We had a group text thing going and when we got back into town she and another person in the group were actually let go from the company (company re-org) so she was texting me individually to help her find a job/ express frustrations, etc. Nothing ever crossed what I consider the line. 

Fast forward a day or two after all that and my wife goes absolutely ballistic on me (this is strange, because we rarely fight, or even argue) about texting this woman. She had gone through my phone and found texts between us. 

A. I take issue with her going through my texts. To me that is a huge violation of privacy, even between couples. Especially since I've never done anything to warrant that. B. our texts were purely back-and-forth regarding new employment, and her venting.

I'll wrap this up by saying I love my wife dearly, I genuinely try to see her side to this. But I just don't see this as a big deal. She does have friends at work, who are single guys and I don't take issue. I trust her, and would never (and have never) go through her phone at texts.

I told my old friend about my wife's blow up - she understands, and I have ceased communication with her. Sucks to not feel trusted and to lose a friend but I'm willing to do that to keep my wife happy."		1	0

Td;lr at the bottom.

Hello reddit, so I'm in a bit of a predicament where I don't know what to do anymore.
Let me start from the start, as context is important.
I am in a healthy and loving relationship. I have been ever since I met him 2 years ago. He is not abusive, nor am I. We work together well but theres one problem that I am struggling to solve.
We are from Australia and in our last legs of school, and in AUS we need what's called an 'ATAR' a score we get at the end of exams to go into university etc. Simple stuff.
Now we are halfway through the year (our year is shortened from Feb-Oct due to exams running until Nov) and he is severely unmotivated. He doesn't want to study at all and told me that ""the last test he didn't study for he got an A so theres nothing to worry about."" 
Now here's where I think I might be the asshole. 
I told him, in anger, that these scores do go towards our final ATAR and that he should work towards that A instead of having it handed to him for nothing. 
Part of my anger is that I studied A LOT more than him at the start of the year, last year I severely fell behind and he used tough love to get me motivated again, and I never came close to an A. Just Cs. And it hurt, and it still does hurt. I stopped studying as much because I feel I cant reach even a B but I'm trying to push forward.
Every time I've tried to talk to him about being unmotivated its ended in him telling me I'm suffocating and need to back off. I understand that because I have a motherly personality so I understand that I can be overbearing but I try my hardest to stop that.
I've noticed hes showing signs of depression and tried talking to him about it but he seems to be in denial, or doesnt care. I dont know what one.
Even if I just tell him to do some study nicely he tells me he doesnt want to and to leave him alone and he doesnt have to. Its getting frustrating trying to help him when he tells me straight up I suffocate him.
So reddit, AITA and I need to back off?

Td;lr: boyfriend is unmotivated, showing signs of depression and doesnt want to do anything to fix his study because ""he gets As without stidying"". I try to tell him those As should be earned not handed to him, and I'm told to back off. AITA?"		1	0

He asked me if I'd ever watched it and I told him that I liked the first couple of seasons when the characters were a lot more grounded in reality, but I overall didn't like the show since it got more over-the-top as it went along. I used the character of George Costanza as an example and here's what I said:

""In the early seasons, George was definitely a loser who was unhappy with his life and he would rightly voice his unhappiness whenever things weren't going right, like all of us would. But in the later seasons, the show overdoes it in terms of how much of a loser George is and he always goes into these giant spaz attacks where he flails his arms around and screams over something as simply as accidentally dropping his pen.""

My friend got mad at that and he says to me ""You always make shit up to prove a point! Stop fucking lying!"" I stated that it was simply my opinion, he claims that Seinfeld is ""objectively one of the best shows on Earth"" and I snapped back with ""The only way that Seinfeld is the best show on Earth is if it's the only show on Earth."" That was enough for him to cuss me out some more, call me a liar again, and storm out of my apartment."		1	0

"My mother is a narcissistic, abusive woman who has sucked any remaining will to live out of me. She disowned me for needing to come home in my senior year of college (she chose my major and school) early due to a mental breakdown. I had to go back for a fifth year, which I would not have been able to get through without the help of the dean. She is a kind, warm-hearted woman who has held my hand through many awful things, such as my lack of sleep and skyrocketing anxiety and depression.

However, my mother recently blew up at me and told me that the dean told her that I need professional mental help. This woman knows that my mother is abusive, she knows everything that she's done to me (you can check my post history for a couple), and she knows that she's the reason I have such difficulty opening up to people about my mental health. My mother told me that she doesn't know who I am and that I'm a complete stranger to her. 

My life is in a total hell now. We had a screaming match that lasted for so long my nose started bleeding. I haven't left my room in days, nor does she care enough about me to come check on me. My grandmother who lives with us enables her and doesn't care about me either. I'm completely alone. Why does everyone in the world pretend to support me and then turn to my mother behind my back? 

I want to send an email asking the dean why she would do this after being so supportive and sweet to me. Does she have any legal right to do this as I am an adult? I want to tell her that my trust in her has been dissolved and that my home life has become difficult due to the personal information she revealed about me.

"While I was out of town, a roommate brought a guest over that burgled me and others. None of us had locking doors, and our lease doesn’t allow modifying the house without owner approval. I wanted locking doors and put in a repair request to replace the existing broken door handles as noted on our move-in property condition checklist.

I requested a repair without consulting other roommates. The manager stated the Owner wanted deadbolts added without fixing the door handles, and I didn’t disagree since there was no mention of me or my roommates having to pay for the requested handles replacement nor deadbolts. The property manager hired a locksmith, and tried to forward us the bill in their name. I stated we were not contractually bound by the lease to pay for repairs. My roommates and I didn’t choose the service, nor the method of repair.

The manager probably paid the locksmith but the Owner wouldn’t reimburse them, and the property manager wants us to reimburse their half of their payment.  I asked roommates to pay for 33% of the bill, since they each received a lock. I’m aware I’m the only one that asked for a repair (for my door), but the Owner elected to upgrade to deadbolts, and the manager chose the service without providing a quote or the option to install locks ourselves. Roommates want me to pay 100% of all 3 doors, even though I occupy only 1 room. I want to pay 33% of the manager’s proposed half of the bill.

However, recently events caused a sharp turn for the worst as far as my moral compass and personal conscious is concerned... I was explaining my excellent entrepreneurship to a second friend when he put forward the opinion that it was the behaviour of an asshole! I was shocked at first however he attempted to explain his seemingly ludicrous allegation. 
He thought restricting a more excited fans access to tickets at a reasonable price by buying them myself, only to resell for a profit later, was exploitation of innocent concert goers and that I should be ashamed of my actions.... 
I, on the other hand, saw it as good old fashioned free market capitalism and therefore took no issue with what I had done, after all the entire entertainment business aims to profit off of the enjoyment and excitement of others, what difference was I making?

So, fellow redditors, AITA? Or was I simply dealing with a pesky socialist interfering with the economic actions of the people...

We have a kid together (1.5 year old). Right before she gave birth to my son she stopped working and I took all life expenses in hand (and it does not bother me to do so).   We want to buy a house in the near future once she starts working again. She and her sister inherited  a large amount of money (her sister got a bit more). The money is enough for half of the down payment and expenses. I will be providing the other half. We agreed that I keep on paying for life expenses and she keeps the money on a saving account and once she starts working she will have her money ready so we can buy the house of our dreams. Today she announced to me that she lent almost half of the money  4 months ago to her sister  (which by the way blew all her heritage money and kept on borrowing from her mom. and bought a car that's out of her budget and that's after my wife lent her the money). My wife did pay  her sister rent part in the past and never got the money back (at one point I had to pay a 400$ bill that had my wife's name and her sister on it). So I got angry and snapped at her and said she did not have the right to do it without even consulting me and lying about lending the money to her mom which her funds were blocked by the bank.

bzxmlm	2019-06-12 22:21:01	PotentialAH	AITA for leaving a bar with men while in a relationship?	"A few months ago my friend and I (both girls) went to a bar / restaurant to catch up. We were sitting alone at a table drinking when a guy comes over and asks if we have boyfriends. We both say yes. (I do, and she didn't at the time but lied because she wasn't interested)

&#x200B;

He continues to chat, and a friend of his comes over and sits with us. We've made it clear that we aren't interested but they just want to hang out and we say ok. They were fun to talk to, and it's nice to chat with new people imo. Then they say they're going to another bar and invite us to go along. 4-5 of their friends were also going. We weren't doing anything else so we walk about 15 minutes down the street (not weird, we're in a walkable city) and go to the next bar. It's kind of raining but not too bad. We hang out with them until the end of the night, and go on our way. We get back to my friend's house at 1-2 am and I head home around 4 am.

&#x200B;

I don't know these guy's last names, IG or phone number. We didn't hug, kiss, hold hands or dance. They were clearly into us but we were clearly not into them and they were bummed but weren't pushy.

&#x200B;

The next day my boyfriend and I are at lunch, and I bring up that we hung out with some guys last night. He got really upset and said I was lying. Said I was cheating on him, and probably went home with the guys and that's why I was there so late. He brought it up regularly for the rest of the relationship, and said he couldn't trust me.

&#x200B;

So am I the asshole? Was it wrong of me to leave a bar with other guys if I was in a relationship? (Me and this boyfriend are currently broken up, but still debating this in my head)

&#x200B;

Edit (for clarification): I had only been 21 for a few months and he didn't like me going out much so this was the first time I was in this situation. Once he told me I told him now that I know I wouldn't do it again. But still brought it up all the time. Also I would 100% be ok if he did that with a group of girls because I knew he wouldn't cheat on me."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I think it’s pretty typical for people my age where I live. Usually we’re just hanging out at my house so it’s not a huge deal or anything but the principle just bothers me. If I say let’s hang out at 5, and you say how about 5:30, that’s totally fine. But if I say let’s hang out at 5, and you agree to that but get here at 5:30, I’m gonna be annoyed. I’m a really busy person and I like things to be planned out and I’d rather be doing something in that 30 minutes than waiting for you to arrive. But then I was ranting to my sister about it and she said I was being a bitch and it doesn’t really matter. I haven’t talked to my friends about it but I kind of want to.		1	0

bzxjwr	2019-06-12 22:14:32	kitkats_at_midnight	AITA for arguing with my parents about what I can wear to school?	"**Context:**

My school is a non-religious all-female private school with a uniform. Recently we have had pants added as an option to the uniform and are available for purchase in the school store (for reference the skirt is 90$ USD and the pants are 79$ USD). Skirts are required on some days and pants are allowed on all days except for ""skirt days"" (if you choose to wear pants you'll still have to own a skirt for these days).

It's been about a year since we've had this option; students wear pants for various reasons (comfort, etc.). Most parents are happy about students being able to choose other things to wear in the uniform. However, my parents think the pants are a terrible option for me to wear to school as it is:

1. Not traditional (our school is old, pants are a new option).
2. Doesn't look ""ladylike"".

I would prefer to wear pants, especially because I'm self-conscious about my legs and also feel quite uncomfortable taking public transit home/to school wearing a skirt. On another note, I think upholding tradition at a school based on what one wears is complete BS. I've politely asked to own a pair of pants multiple times, and been shot down with excuses ranging from ""they won't fit your body type"" to ""it's not traditional and ladylike"".

Last night I got quite upset at them and we had a long and somewhat-angry argument about why I couldn't wear pants. We ended with no new verdict and I'm still not allowed to wear pants at school despite bringing up the fact that I'm not comfortable, etc. My mother thinks I'm being dramatic about the public transit argument. The cost was not a factor in our argument.

I was quite aggressive on my stance and I'm wondering if I am the asshole in this situation for not sucking it up.

&#x200B;

**Edit (June 12th 2019):**  
A few very kind users have suggested I buy the pants myself and wear them only at school or just, in general, buy them myself. I forgot to indicate that purchases I make at the school store would be/are billed to my school account (i.e. my parents **would** see it - and not be very happy). I thank you for your kind solutions, however, these wouldn't work for me. Sorry.

**TL;DR**

* The private school that I go to has pants as an option
* I would like to wear pants for purposes of personal comfort; my parents don't want me to
* Their main reason is it is ""untraditional"" and ""unladylike"". My arguments about feeling comfortable have been called dramatic."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzxjad	2019-06-12 22:13:01	ethno_grapher123	AITA for not wanting to invite my cousin’s GF to our wedding?	"Planning a wedding has sucked, mostly because of the guest list. We’re keeping it small (60 invites max) and want to celebrate with the people we love the most. We are paying for everything. To keep the guest list small, we came up with a couple of rules: 1) immediate family and close friends only 2) no plus ones 3) partners are included if they are spouses/long term partners. Basically if they’re not listed on the invite, they’re not invited. 

So my cousin has a new GF. They started dating in January (or maybe December? Not sure) and according to my mother “he is so in love with her and totally head over heels.” My mother is dramatic af (actress) and over exaggerates everything. The thing with my cousin is that he has a lot of relationships...that are not long term. He gets smitten, brings these women to family gatherings and get-togethers (even if they’re only casually dating) and then we never see them again. So all this to say, I have no idea how serious my cousin and new GF’s relationship is and it’s not for me to judge...except that he wanted to bring her to my wedding. Seems like things are going well, but it’s not like their lives are intertwined (they’re still “single” on social media and live in different towns). So in my mind, she doesn’t meet the above criteria, and no one gets a plus one. We want to be fair to everyone. 

Honestly there’s a whole story around this with my family’s behavior and they were definitely the assholes there (also, long story short, I gave up and she’s coming), but AITA for not wanting to invite her and trying to stand my ground on this? My thought is that I don’t know this person — she will only be one of two people who is a stranger to both my fiancé and myself at our wedding (the other person is a spouse of a close friend in another state). My cousin is the only person getting a plus one — we are making a huge exception for him that we are not making for anyone else. 

My family thinks I’m being unreasonable, that it’s just one person, and that it doesn’t matter that much to me but it matters a lot to my cousin. Their other argument is that he should be able to bring her because they’re coming from out of town — does that make a difference? Why should out of town people get a plus one but no one else does? He’s extremely wealthy and works for himself, it’s not like my wedding is a vacation for him — maybe if it was a strain on him I would understand, but it’s definitely not. I think they’re all acting entitled and childish and that this person doesn’t need to be there — it’s not about them (and I’m paying for it!). I know the situation is “resolved” because I gave in, but I’m wondering if I’m also in the wrong here."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzxhva	2019-06-12 22:09:37	queenk729	AITA for not wanting to spend more time with sister?	"Long term lurker, first time posting.  I am a 24F and my sister is 29. I moved to the same city as her a couple years ago, and we now live in the same apartment complex. She moved in a couple months ago, right across the street from me. We typically hang out about once a week, but sometimes it’s a little less than that.

Over the last year, she’s gotten more and more annoyed with me if we don’t hang out at least once a week. Once in awhile, something will come up with me (I get really busy with work and have to work late at night, I’m not feeling well, etc) and I have to cancel. When this has happened she gets really upset and says I’m not making time for her, but she has also canceled a few times and I always tell her it’s fine and we will plan another day. She makes passive aggressive comments that I don’t make enough time for her often. She also often invites me to things like lunch or dinner the day of and then acts annoyed if I don’t want to go.

A few days ago we had a discussion about this and I told her that I am very introverted, and I need a lot of time to myself for my mental health. I try to maintain a balance between spending time alone, with my bf, with other friends, with her, and on work. She said if I was friend, I wouldn’t be a very good one because I don’t spend enough time maintaining the relationship and spend too much time with my boyfriend. Him and I do see each other about 3-5 times a week but I feel it is different with him. Spending too much time with people can be very draining for me, but he relieves my stress and we will probably move in together soon. 

She then half jokingly said that it “makes her not like my bf because I’d rather spend time with him.” I told her this was manipulative and she eventually agreed.

It’s getting to the point that spending time with her is starting to feel more like a chore to avoid a guilt trip than actual fun. On the other hand I do see how I might be the asshole here. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

J and K went to the corner store and bought some provisions, when they returned A grabbed a bag of chips and and started to munch on them. She then saw a bag of taxis and this is where it all went downhill.



A: I wish I got the takis
M: why, you cant eat them with chamoy? (Its like a chili sauce kinda thing idk, google it)
A: yeah you can you just have to eat them quick.
M: that's kinda fat.


That was the end of the conversation. She then went to J and K's room and began to talk about our interaction. J has always been protective of A and began to yell at me for hurting her feelings. J storms into my mom's rooms and explains to her the issue at hand. 

J: m and a are fighting again. I dont know why M always starts these fights when she knows she cant finish them.
K: can you stop it already, this is why M always feels like crap, you laugh at the mean remarks that A says to m but you can't stand it when M does the same.
J: it's because A is actually funny.

A: ewwwwwwww those cats got you good. They scratched you everywhere.

M: shut up A you know damn well that you have stretch marks as well.

So I’m in the Army, and I left post in a rush with some buddies after spending the day packing a connex. I wasn’t even thinking but I was sweating pretty hard and didn’t shower before throwing on civilian clothes.

When I boarded, the older lady next to me leaned over and told me I was rude for boarding a plane in this state. I immediate felt terrible and started apologizing profusely.

A bit later I was still feeling bad and decided to offer to by her and alcoholic drink as an apology. Big mistake...

She turned out to be Mormon and I guess I had stepped to far. She begins to shout me down full shouting mode at this point and several passengers started to shame me as well. I honestly don’t think it was just the alcohol suggestion, but it just pushed her over. She continued to berate me the whole flight and I of course left in a hurry once we landed.

I know this is an asshole situation on my part for putting this lady through four hours of my stink. But what should I have done after I was on the plane and had already screwed up? How should I have known she was Mormon and would get that mad? Did I deserve the shouting?

This has been messing me up the past day and a half. I hate to make other people uncomfortable and can’t stop beating myself up for it. Will definitely never leave post without a shower again.

Please help me understand my level of YTA. I feel bad for stinking, but honestly can’t tell if I deserved the harassment or not.

I work full time in a restaurant kitchen and my mom hasn’t worked for the last 10 years. I’ve tried many times to convince her and even help her find a job but she doesn’t even want to put in the effort. For as long as I can remember she’s been addicted to various drugs ranging from cocaine to prescription pain killers. Because if this, I spent most of my child hood living with my grandparents who were alcoholics, so I never had a good life growing up. She’s had months of being sober but always ends up coming right back to it. Anyways, since I work full time I have saved up a lot of money and she knows this. She used to text me all the time asking to borrow money from me and at first I did it, but realized it was almost certainly going to drugs and I didn’t want to support her habit. Also, when you give her money once, it doesn’t stop. She keeps asking and the number gets bigger every time, so I put a stop to it and told her to not bother texting me if she’s just gonna ask for money. 

Here’s my issue. The other day after 6 months of not talking to me or showing any interest in my life. She texts me randomly asking for 300 dollars to help pay her rent, saying that I’m her son and I should help her out and that she’s desperate. I told her I can’t do it, as I have my own rent to pay to my roommate and my own expenses, school to save up for next year etc. I told her that as long as she and her boyfriend who she lives with are both unemployed and addicts, I will not give her money. She’s telling me that if I don’t give her the 300 dollars that she’ll be kicked out on the streets. She’s manipulated me many times in the past, but this time I won’t allow it.

In the meantime i let him use Mine because i did not use it to go to work and during the Day he has to move around the city a lot.
To be clear i did not have insurance, it was old and cheap and it was the only thing i could afford because im paying for my studies, but it was my first car and i took care of him a lot  knowing that if someone would steal it, i would be left with nothing.
I never parked it on the street because i dont live in a safe neighborhood and the old cars are the easiest to steal, at least in my country.
So well, he used it and everytime he left it on the street with no supervision and yes, it got stolen.

Yes i know i should have had insurance and don't get me wrong i love my father more than anything in the World and i really care more about him that the money i lost but i can't help being mad at him and have  not even apologized.

"My friends and I have a tradition where we go away to a different location over the same weekend every summer. This year we’re going to my family’s cottage. Without being too specific, this cottage is in an area where there a ton of fun activities available. Originally, the reason I had suggested this location was so that we could do this one activity in particular that I have wanted to do since it was built a few years ago but have never done as it is only possible in the summer (we use the cottage during the winter and rent it during the summer). This year I organized the weekend far enough in advance to be sure that it wouldn’t be rented for the weekend that we are going up. 

In the process of planning the specifics of the trip, one friend in particular mentioned that she didn’t want to do this activity because it is too expensive ($100) she suggested another activity to do that is $50 and all my friends agreed to do that one instead. One of my friends, let’s call her Anne, would also like to do the activity that I want to do but doesn’t want to go against the friend group. I don’t see the issue with the two of us doing the activity without the rest of the group, but she suggested we go up a different time to do this activity so that they wouldn’t feel left out. I would be more resistant to doing this since it’s a 2 hour drive from where we live and we wouldn’t be able to stay over because the cottage is rented for the rest of the summer. I get that it’s her decision ultimately, but I don’t really want to budge on this.

"16M here, so basically I dated this girl for like 2 months and we had an OK connection nothing special but I stil liked her. While we were ""togther"" my best friend starting to build a connection with this girl and before i knew it they were ""best friends"" we then broke up because I just didn't feel it anymore and i felt like i was just using her for her body. Fast forward like 3-4 weeks there is class trip we all went toghter to and i start hearing rumors about her starting to ""fall for him"" I then go to talk to her and we talk things out about how I felt and how she felt. I then ask her about the rumors and she goes ahead and says ""i would never sleep with my ex's best friend"". The day after i hear that they are sitting alone somewhere and I dont think to much about it. I go to check it out and I ask him how he feels and what he is going to do, he then says that he dosen't know and feels that it's weird and blah blah blah. Fast forward to the morning, (we sleep in the same room) I wake up to them making out in the bed next to me, i keep quiet and pretend to be asleep for like 10 minutes and they keep making out and start rubbing each other and shit. After she goes I pretend to wake up and ask him multiple times about her and what he felt and if they did anything. He lies over and over again, and then i tell him that I know everything. He then procceds to get annoyed and then just goes his way.

But last night we were hanging out and I tried this new flavor salt on some popcorn.  It was supposed to be dill, but it came across as lemon to me. Thinking it was just weird/interesting, I asked my brother to try it.

At first he refused because he doesn't like dill, but I assured him that wasn't what it tasted like to me. So he tries it and just goes off. Like, 0 to 100 in no time flat. He's yelling and literally SPITTING in my living room! He tells me off, saying crazy shit about how I'm just like everyone else trying to make him do things he doesn't like.

I got angry right back and told him to grow the f*ck up, that that was just beyond unnecessary.  He gets upset, acting like a kicked puppy, and I start to feel like a jerk. Maybe, knowing he just doesnt like dill, I shouldn't have offered it to him? Maybe I should have tried to de escalate rather than telling him off? Idk.

My wife and I have been married for about a year and a half, and together for almost three. Today she texts me and asks if she were to get a job in another state, if I would follow. Now, i have a stable job that I love and make good money. Her job isnt as stable, as it is in the service industry, but she makes decent money. I told her that I would probably let her go on and take the job, and once i got my things in order, I would join her. Money has always been a big factor in everything I do, and I wouldnt want to move to a completely different state without having something set up before hand. Also, she came to study in the states so she is used to being away from her family. I have always been very close with my family and would be leaving everyone behind in this move. Again, this isnt an important factor, my biggest issue is the not having a stable source of income immediately upon arriving. Long story short, my wife got pissed because to her i wasnt “supporting her dreams.” When in reality, i want to shield her from the extra stress that moving without a job (for myself) would bring. The argument ended with her pretty much telling me that she might have to chase her dreams solo since i dont want to chase them with her. So, AITA?	Not the A-hole	0	0

&#x200B;

Okay so to start this off, this was a few years back, at the time I was 13 and fresh in high school i believe, my friend (G) and I were decent friends not overly close. G's father was diagnosed with cancer and he was not getting any better and G's family knew the father was gonna pass away. One day I was sitting on the couch during spring break and my mums phone got a notification and she asked me to check it so I did, it was a text from G's mum of a nude photo and it had a text message with it that said something about the sex the night before (it was not meant to be sent to my mum it was an accident) and I asked my mum about it and we were both shocked, my mum went around to go talk to G's mum and I tagged along, after they had a conversation G's mum came out the front of her house to me and asked my not to say anything to G or anyone because he was already really upset because of his father being sick. Me not really understanding what was happening to full extent just agreed to not say anything. I have never said anything to anyone just kept it to myself but looking back on it I feel bad for not saying anything. I planned on telling him once after his dad had passed but he was an emotional wreck he was in therapy for depression, dropped out of school and started to use drugs so I thought I would have made it worse so I left it alone and to my understanding to this day he still doesnt know. That was a few years back and I don't speak to that family anymore because I moved countries. When I think back about it I do feel like an asshole so thought I would ask.

bzx3ls	2019-06-12 21:35:28		AITA: Not Reporting Girl Because Of Her Bday Cemetery Photoshoot	"This girl I know just hit a milestone bday and did this very bizarre birthday ""photoshoot"" in a cemetery. As far as I can tell, this photoshoot was literally done just to post on social media. The bday girl is wearing all black, raybans, and holding up these gold balloons while making (what I assume she thinks are) fierce poses in front of headstones. The entire post is hashtagged something like death to my youth. Very weird. Normally I'm a live and let live type (esp when it comes to social media posts), but this was just so...idk what the right word is. Disrespectful, maybe? I mean, I'd be pissed if I saw her posing next to my grandma's headstone with gold balloons. (She wasn't, I'm just trying to explain my initial reaction to the pics.) Anyway, I saw the post while I was in a car with my cousin and showed her the pics and said ""I'm going to unfriend her"" out loud. My cousin said I should ""do something more like report the photos to get them taken down."" I didn't. I mean, it's a really grim and not at all funny photoshoot that I don't understand in the least, but no one else seemed offended (actually, the comments were all very supportive, strangely enough). I guess I didn't report them because I couldn't really decide if this cemetery backdrop was offensive to just me or offensive in general? (Never ever thought I'd actually be confused about whether or not a photoshoot in a cemetery is okay, but here we are.) I went with just unfriending and not reporting. My cousin now thinks I'm TA because those are \*someone's\* family members that the bday girl is duckfacing next to even if they're not mine so I should try to get the pics removed. AITA?"		1	0

bzx2vx	2019-06-12 21:33:48		AITA For calling my classmate an hypocrite because she wants to be my friend now?	"Throwaway because my friends know Reddit. Also sorry for the English.

Also High school drama, I know.

Some backstory before we start.

Last year I transfer to a new school (11th grade I think in America) and I knew absolutely nobody.

Since I had 3 years left of high school I though it could be nice to make some friends but it was really hard since everyone already had a group.

There was this girl (A) who was new too so we immediately bonded.
The fact is that while she started making other friends with other people of my class, I didn’t made any.

After 2-3 months she started to glare at me every time I was with her, one day she told me I should sit somewhere else and “Not stick with her and try to make some friends of my own”. 

Maybe I was too clingy, I don’t really know, but I was alone for the rest of the year because I didn’t want to trouble her and I only knew her, plus I am a pretty shy person myself.

Fast forward to this year, I’ve started to get along better with my class and even though I wasn’t close with anyone I still get along with everybody.

Now last week we went all together (our class) to a Luna park.

In the last few weeks A started to go with me pretty much everywhere, I learned later that it was because she fought with her other friends.

Anyway we are at the park and she always sticked with me and asked me every time if she could sit with me.

She then complained about the fact that nobody was paying attention to her and that I was the only one who talked with her, and that the next year will probably be like this too because her friends left her and I am the only one left.

At this point it started to be really annoying because I wanted to enjoy the day and she was always complaining.

So I told her that last year she left me alone to go with her friends and now the fact that she wants me to be friends with her is pretty hypocritical.

She get offended and leave.

Words got out and now a lot of girls in my class hate me because they think I was too mean to her and that I am the asshole. For some context we are all 17-18 y/o.

bzx1zx	2019-06-12 21:31:32	aita_thro	AITA for making a stupid comment during a serious convo topic	"I've been an asshole in the past. I have a sarcastic personality and it's definitely got me in trouble on more than one occasion. I've made shitty ""jokes"" in the past about some sensitive topics our friends were going through and I learned my lesson the hard way... can't make jokes about everything... even if they're just dumb comments. Needless to say, my wife was really upset and would constantly ask me ""are you fucking retarded?"", ""what the fuck is wrong with you?""...etc. Mind you, this conversation was only between my wife and I and it happened end of 2017.

&#x200B;

Flash forward to recent:

One of our female friends broke up with her bf, saying the guy was emotionally abusive. When my wife texted me and we talked about it, I was shocked, upset, considering if I should talk with the guy or not... obviously expressing my concern about the situation and how this is so shitty and unexpected from the bf. The female friend is a close friend of ours and an even closer friend of my wife. I feel ""protective"" in a fatherly way because I'm the only male in this circle of friends (friends = wifes circle of close female friends). I sincerely care for each of them and value the friendship we have.

&#x200B;

The questionable fuck-up:

Past week, the couple had asked for TV show recommendations. I suggested a list of shows. After they broke up, the female friend told my wife that while they were watching \[insert show title here\], she realized that she was being emotionally abused. That show was not one of my recommendations.

&#x200B;

When my wife was texting me and told me about the show they were watching, I said ""I told them to watch (this other show)! Why did they watch that show!"". I don't know why I said it... it's not particularly funny... but it's not particularly offensive. Especially after I've expressed my concern and grief over the situation, I just threw that in to sort of ""make light"" I guess? Obviously I take this whole situation seriously if I'm telling her I'm contemplating contacting the bf.

&#x200B;

Well, my wife got upset and she started throwing insults at me like: ""What is wrong with you?"", ""Like ur seriously fucking retarded"", ""something is seriously wrong with you"". I asked her to stop talking to me like that, cause obviously that's not how you should talk to your spouse. It's abusive and it hurts to hear her tell me I have psychological/mental issues. But she continued saying those things to me. We've been together for a long time... she knows I have these habits of making comments. Ever since I made that major fuck up (1st paragraph) I've been cautious to hold my tongue.

&#x200B;

AITA for making that comment? Was it a big deal that I said that? I really didn't see it as a big deal, given I'm taking the rest of our conversation very seriously.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - I made an unfunny dad joke that upset my wife while we were talking about a serious topic. Wife began hurling insults at me and asking if I'm retarded."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I don't know if this really counts as abuse, but I'm really frightened when she does this.

My step-sister loves the family cat, but she plays really rough to the cat, to the point where the cat is scared to death of her. For example, if I play a little rough with the cat, the cat plays rough back, biting and scratching me, in a playful way. But if my step-sister does this, the cat lowers its ears and tries to hide, and makes whimpering sounds. 

She hurts the cat in many ways, such as squeezing her until she's crying, yells in her ear and even tosses her up to our 8ft ceiling and letting her drop, without catching her, or letting her fall on a pillow or anything. She calls me stupid when I get upset, and that she has done this with all her previous cats. That's the part that scares me the most.

"When I was 8 years old I found out I have ADD and around the same time my parents were also told I have Auditory Processing Disorder. However, they failed to tell me about my APD until LITERALLY last year and I’m now 26. My whole entire life I would cry about feeling like I’m stupid and I don’t understand things in school like everyone else and “why do I think I hear something but hear something completely different?!” I’ve had to work ten times harder to than most people just to get a passing grade in my classes. It has also made me really insecure and kind of socially awkward as well as having communication issues in relationships. 

My dad could literally give a shit about anything I’m dealing with and my mom never told me that there were accessibilities in elementary, high school and college for Inattentive ADD and APD. I always thought that there weren’t because no one ever said anything, how was I supposed to really know? I always kind of thought people didn’t take ADD seriously and I would get mocked for having it. But looking back it has truly been disabling and everyday is a complete struggle. Everyday tasks are hard to do because my mind is always racing, getting distracted or I go into hyperfocus for 8-10 hours on things other than my work. I also suffer from depression and major anxiety. 

This week I finally had a complete melt down and told my mom that I’ve been angry with her and my dad for never getting me proper treatment to help me. She told me she never wanted to put me on medication and tried everything natural, but it never worked. However I’m grateful I never did go on medication because I do have an addictive personality and I’ve been addicted to meds in the past (from a spinal fusion). I told her I wanted to pay for a counselor that specializes in ADD but she’s completely against it. They help support me while I’m in school and I have a part time job and I have physical limitations that keep me from living on my own. So I get why she doesn’t want to help me pay for it but I am *struggling*. I feel like this would really help me to become a full functioning adult in the future. I’m not putting all the blame on them or my disabilities because I’m also responsible but I need help. I can’t do this on my own anymore and I feel like my symptoms are so bad lately.

We’d need 500€ each for it and we’re on a two week vacation, so putting some of the money we have right now is out of the question as we’d be too broke. 

My mother knows I’ve wanted to get a certificate ever since I first went diving when I was 12 years old, and always asks me when I will get one.

bzx0lk	2019-06-12 21:28:18	Eggybreadsticks	AITA For leaving my friend	"So long story short I’ve not spoken to my former best friend in over a month 

We had a really good friendship, but then a few months ago she started ignoring me. When I finally asked her what was wrong, she sent a very long criticising message about all the things wrong with me and how I need to be humbled. Some of it was true but honestly the whole thing felt really hypocritical and like she just intended to hurt me. I also didn’t take it too well because it all happened at a stressful time, with important exams coming up that everyone was worrying about. 

I apologised, but after that I started to avoid her myself and she made no effort to talk to me or message me, so I just assumed that the friendship would not work out. I hung out with other people and tried to be happy and not dwell on it, but trying to stay conscious of my general interactions with people and anything that I may have been doing before with my friend subconsciously that hurt her. It still bothered me at the back of my head, but I’d been so sad about it before, when she was ignoring me, that I just figured that it wasn’t worth staying sad.

However, I found a post she made in the past few days about how she’d “managed to get away” from a **certain someone** and how **this person** was now happy and she wasn’t and she had wasted her time at school. I’m just annoyed that she’s getting so butthurt over this when she ignored me in the first place, and gave me no indication that she wanted to continue being friends. 

She’s angry that I’m happy, and I would understand if I’d been the one ignoring her in the first place, but I am unfortunately not. I just wish that she could be happy too, and part of me wants to try to reach out again and try to make amends, but we just haven’t talked all this time, and I feel like there’s just too much water between us now to try. I also have a feeling that it would either end with being left on read or more unkind words from her.

   Ok here's where i am the asshole but hear me out. I grab my water bottle and tilt it back, forcing her to drink more than intended. She spills some on herself and chokes a bit. Im well aware im the asshole here but that's not the point of this post.
   So her reaction is is to spill water all over my binder and my project. She didn't know how important the project was, so I believe this is justified.

So I’m really into jewelry, since I have my own collection of necklaces, rings, bracelets, you get the idea. My family knows this so my grandma gave to me her favorite necklace and ring.

In fact, I just rejected it completely. No way I want something that expensive, it would just make me really paranoid about it, having something that expensive in my possession. 

I gave it to my mom and she’s like “your grandma wanted you to have it, it would be a crime for you to reject it” and stuff along those lines.

Over the past year if I had a *penny* for the amount of times he's talked about the shed we could pay off the house. He wants it so bad. He's sketched out designs, loves looking at them at Home Depot and talking about how he could do so much better, etc. I want the shed too, because all the tools and projects we've bought over the past year have made it so we can't park in the garage. Also I like to DIY as well and know how to use all the power tools, so being able to work on my own projects is just as important to me.

Now I am fully confident that he can put nail to wood and build a shed, the problem is that his craftsmanship is awful.

He bragged to me about his ability to crochet, and he made a glove and a hat that were both really nice. He made me a scarf for Christmas one year that is too small to go around my neck and is riddled with holes and missed stitches. The next Christmas he made my name out of wire and bragged to me about how much he didn't spend. I chalked both of these up to bad gift giving skills before we got married.

I asked him to help me paint our tiny foyer. He bitched the whole time and got paint all over the baseboards because he insisted he didn't need masking tape.

We replaced the door to the laundry room and he hung it crooked, so it scrapes the floor in one place when you open it. I do most of the laundry so when I told him about the scraping I got ""it's not that big of a deal."" I rehung it later, properly.

He replaced the rods in my closet and now my shirts drag the floor as he accidentally mis-measured. It's ""too difficult"" to move and it's ""good enough.""

Anyway, I could go on.

The shed talk is getting more and more now since we're getting closer to our budget, but I'm uncomfortable with him building something that could negatively impact our property value. He has talked about making it look like it's meant to be with the house (same siding and roofing) but at the end of the day I think when he has 4 walls and a waterproof work area everything else is going to go out the window.

WIBTA if I sat him down and told him he needed to show some better craftsmanship and care with the smaller projects before he builds the shed? It will crush him to hear, but after the shed he's talking about redoing the back deck and adding a cover that scares me to bits."		1	0
bzwzh7	2019-06-12 21:25:52		AITA for Ghosting a Friend	"There's this girl who's in my last period class. Let's call her X. I knew X since I was 10ish (she's not a childhood friend, more like an acquaintance I would wave at but not really talk to). She lives nearby, so we would walk home together. At first, our conversations were about school, but they started to get more personal. Soon, she was talking about her mother, and their arguments about X's test grades. I gave her some advice, but X never actually put them into action, so she was talking about her mom on a daily basis. It irritated me that she never used my advice, but I kept quiet. 70% of our conversations together grew to be about X's mom.

Then, the snide side comments started. When talking about her mom, X would say stuff like ""I bet you and her would've gone along since you're so emotionless"". She knew that I was an atheist and that I stopped attending mass, but she still talked about going back to Church. It was getting on my nerves.

Finally, the last straw was when X started using me for self validation. She would complain about her teachers and her grades and wait for me to tell her something that would make herself feel better. Emotional support isn't my forte, so I gave her some study tips, but she never used them. 

She brought up her grades on a daily basis now, and between her griping about her mom, there was no space for me. When I tried, X shot me down with ""I wish I was you. Your life is so much better than mine"". When I had afterschool activities, she would be angry since I couldn't walk home with her. She even rolled her eyes at me once. 

So I told X that I didn't want to talk to her anymore. It was out of the blue, since I never mentioned anything to her. X sends me a text saying that I could talk about what was ""going on"" whenever I wanted, and that she would never know if I never told her. Considering that she never let me get a word in, it was pretty funny. I ignored her and she returned the favor. 

I feel bad about it though because she told me her insecurities.

Basically when my gf and me go out for food she usually never finishes her food and I usually eat the left overs. At this point I basically expect it since it happens so much.

One night we went out for a family meal. We order lá food. I took a little bit longer to finish idk why I forgot. Anyways when I finished I noticed that she finished all hers and I say to her

'damn your some girl hey, good job,

I was surprised she finished it all and was kinda like fuck yeah gurl. My gf was OK with that and said something on the lines of you know it or something. One of her family members turns to us and says omg that's not nice. I was like what I just said she finished her food. Then she said I'd punch my bf if he said that to me,. Then we just when back to eating and talking. Nothing really came of it. Her family member is a nice person. But she just said her mind. Which was OK.

My SO [23F] is caucasian and bisexual, and has been very open about that from the moment our relationship started. She holds a lot of very liberal opinions about the world, which I encourage as this aligns with my political opinions as well.

The issue that has arisen over time is that she has previously made some comments that are hyper critical and express a lot of resentment towards all ""straight white men"".

I [26M], am a straight white male. These comments have decreased over the course of our relationship as I usually try and refrain from using labels and identity politics when it comes to issues with our society.

In the last month, I stumbled across my SO's public Tumblr blog, as she uses a similar username elsewhere. The blog contains many posts, images, and memes all along the lines of ""straight men are stupid, straight white men are evil, etc.

This is obviously very hurtful to me, however I am hesitant to raise this due to the blog essentially being ""anonymous"" in same way.

Long story short, we've got two daughters, one is six and one is three. They and their mom are the love of my life. We have a great time going out together and spending time as a family unit.

But every time my wifes mom whips out her phone to snap pics of the kids, I know they are going to get shared online, and will be stored somewhere forever, as far as I'm concerned. For anyone to look at.

I recently read a book about machine learning and Google / Facebook using image recognition to target ads. I can't even imagine what other heinous shit people are dreaming up right now for our future, and how our kids entire lives will be available for everyone to see and use in whatever twisted ways we haven't thought of yet.

I'm not kidding when I say that they literally share a thousand pics a momth at least. 

So, rewind to past weekend when wife and I get in a huge fight after she shared a naked pic of our younger daughter on Instagram.

I was probably more mad about that shit than I've ever been in our relationship is and showed it. Then her and her mom shut me down the rest of the day. I asked nicely at first, but now I'm thinking I need to put a stop to this as fast as possible and it's stressing me out.

Am I the asshole? Anyone else dealing with this bullshit?

My kids pics ARE NOT your behavioral targeting commodity.

Edit: thanks everyone for the feedback. I definitely feel in the right here. We talked last night and i actually used some of the great arguments below in our conversation. And she agrees with a lot of it and will tone down the pic posting. But we'll see.

I was under the impression that they were only staying the weekend and from the phone call today, my dad mentioned 3-4 days at my place and 3-4 at my sister's instead of the one night.

My dad and I have little to no relationship in my eyes. The last time I spent any time with him, I believe I was 13? Maybe 14. I'm now 28, and have seen him three times since I was the above age.
He wasn't around when we were kids. Lived 14 hours away from us and we only spent the summers with him after the age of 11. 
Our phone calls are two minutes each. I never call him and he only calls when he's walking into work. 

I have anxiety and the second he told me he was staying at my place for 3-4 nights I couldn't breathe and was just hit with my dad's visit. I can't wrap my head around the fact that he will be in my house for 72 hours and I will have to be the one in charge of entertaining them.

I (17f) came home from school on my last day of finals and immediately ate lunch. I put my plate in the sink and sat back down to look at my phone. My mom just came home from work and saw my plate in the sink unwashed and said, ""You have to wash your own plates."" 

 Just so you know, I had the full intention of washing my plate and was going to get right go it after checking my grades. I walked to the sink with the intent to clean my plate but my mom already put soap on it and was in the process of cleaning it. So I thought I just had to rinse it but then she said that 'oh, since you're here, you can wash mine too.' I was taken aback because not only did I not ask her to do it, but just because I went to sink she immediately assumed I would wash her's as well. Then she says that she already partially cleaned my plate, so in exchange I should wash hers. I told her no, I just want to wash mine. Then she said that I am already out of school and should be helping around the house more. I refused again but she kept insisting. 

Then I just snapped and repeatedly said, 'no no no no.' I know that was a bratty move of me, but I felt overwhelmed from the bombardment of asking. She then proceeds to say something along the lines of, ""Wow, such a spoiled brat. Well, I don't have to be her personal slave anymore once she goes to college."" Then I started yelling at her saying how she always tries to guilt trip me into things, turn my words around, and used washing my dish as a way to manipulate me into cleaning hers. And how I would have helped if she just asked to wash hers if she washed mine. No, she just put soap on it and expected me to finish the job. My mom then says no, you wouldn't have helped becaude i know you better than you know yourself. After that, I ran to my room where I am writing this. 

This feels like a very miniscule thing to get mad about, but I feel like she is constantly being passive-aggressive and I can't stand it anymore.
Am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

My parents and I were visiting Philadelphia last week because my brother is doing work study there, and we decided to spend the day walking around an area full of historic landmarks and buildings. The sound of the subway train on the ride there bothered me slightly, so I put in my earbuds and turned on some music to give myself a different sound to focus on. Everyone was fine with this. Once we got off the sub, the trouble began. I removed one earbud and turned down the volume, but kept the other one in because I wanted to finish the song. I kept forgetting to stop my music and take the other earbud out at the end of a song, then thinking “Oh, I’ll just finish this one.” My parents noticed that I had one earbud in and it irritated them, so I took it out. In hindsight, this is where the story should have ended, but unfortunately, it isn’t

&#x200B;

The next time there was a lull in activity, I decided to try to finish the song that got interrupted earlier. I only  used one earbud, just in case. This didn’t seem to bother anyone, so when my feet started to hurt, I started using one earbud to give myself something other than my feet to focus on whenever we were just standing around waiting or walking between locations. Apparently, this irritated my parents more than I realized because they snapped at me to put my music away. I told them why I’d been listening, and they got annoyed at me for making excuses. It’s true that I didn’t *need* the music, but that conversation still upset me enough that I really wanted to listen to something to calm myself down. I realized that would be a bad idea, so instead I crossed my arms in front of me, trying to hug myself without being too noticeable about it

&#x200B;

Later, my mom told me I needed to stop. I knew she was probably talking about the arm-crossing, but I decided to play dumb. I'm not sure whether or not the whiny ""What?"" that came out of me was completely unintentional. I wanted them to realize how upset I was and no longer cared about embarrassing myself. My response earned me a lecture that got me crying, and I'm pretty sure that I couldn't have controlled that. Dad told me that I needed to start  acting like an adult and that I was ruining what should have been a fun day

&#x200B;

It's true that I probably shouldn't have tried to listen to my music after the first time. I also probably could have made less of a scene by keeping my mouth shut when scolded, uncrossing my arms, then silent-crying the tears away during the next bathroom break. I'm usually better than this, but I was hungry and tired. However, I think they were blowing this whole thing way out of proportion. I kept one ear free and turned the volume way down in the earbud I was wearing, so it's not like I was shutting them out.

Long story short Dan bled Mark dry and then left town calling it a waste of time and bitched about having to pay his share. He put mark into a very bad place financially and emotionally. Dan is in my opinion an ungrateful entitled brat. He is 25 abled bodied and has no mental health issues to speak of.

A week ago Mark gets a call from the management of the old apartments that he lived in. The bill that was for cleaning and replacing the carpet was never paid and was about to be sent to collections . It was supposed to be paid by Dan, who agreed to it because the damage was his fault. He told Mark to pay it. This hurt Mark very much because this man-child never said thank you for a single thing mark has done for him and now wants him to fork up another $400.

Mark is very passive and I am not. Mark wanted to just not talk to him and instead of just relay any messages through his other brother. I was just so disgusted with how Mark was being taken advantage of  I sent Dan this msg...

""Hi Dan this is Mark's fiance. I'm going to be as nice as possible with this but you really really fucked up with Mark. You should be feeling absolutely terrible about how you used him and how you treated him afterwards. You should of said thank you. You should of applogized. He did more for than anyone really ever should of cause he cares for you as a brother. You really fucked up nd it might be too late cause you have stressed him out beyond belief by being so selfish. I recommend you try and find a way to make it up to him.
How are you going to bleed someone dry and call it waste of time?
How are you going to let him pay your phone bill for a year and then bitch about it? Srsly wtf? 
Grow up Dan.""

Apparently Dan was so offened by being told this he bitched to my fiance about it saying it was so out of line and wasn't my business. To me when someone constantly hurts someone I love it should be my busniess to stand up for them when they wont stand up for themselves.  

Marks response to this threw me under the bus. Mark is convinced that I am autistic despite only being diagnosed with depression and social aniexty.  He told Dan...

""When you date autistic women you will have autistic days"" which is just so humiliating and demeaning to me but he said he was only trying to explain what happened to Dan. He agreed with his brother I was in the wrong and now wants me to say sorry. I am not.

I (25F) am currently in the process of moving in with my boyfriend (25M) and his roommate (25M). I live about 1.5 hours from him and commute the opposite direction for work about 3 hours a day.

This weekend is father's day and I asked to invite my dad down to my boyfriends house/town for a Father's Day weekend. Boyfriend's dad is visiting his daughter in another city for father's day, so we didn't invite him. The Roommate just recently lost his father, and out of respect for him, my boyfriend asked for me to not invite my dad over for the weekend. Roommate hasn't shown very much emotion other than anger to his father's death, but I suspect he is either hiding it or hasn't processed it yet.

The thing is, I commute a lot for work and to see my boyfriend. I also haven't had a weekend where I wasn't traveling in a month, and will be traveling the following 3 weekends. The thought of driving an 1.5 hours to see my boyfriend on Friday, and then driving an additional 3 to see my dad on Father's day and round-trip it back home sounds miserable. I'm thinking about inviting my dad for just Sunday, but keeping all Father's Day activities out of the house. i.e. taking dad to the local breweries, downtown, maybe head to the river. I figured he would probably stop by the house to check it out because my mom came to check it out after we signed the lease (divorced parents), but we would't stick around long so as to not expose my Roommate to him (and associated thoughts & feelings) for too long.

I really want to be respectful of my Roommate, but still have some quality time with my dad and boyfriend this weekend.

Being honest I thought I was in the right, with however I had discussed this topic with my real lige told me I was right, and those who didnt, didnt help me in any way or give me an example, so I just posted this to sort of vent, but you guys showed me otherwise.

First of all I want to say that I will not leave my group, I see how it is a pretty shitty thing to do, I also said that the homoparental topic was more debatable than anti-vaxx wich was a really shitty thing to say in my behalf and I didnt even realise it.

Most of you guys kind of misunderstood what I was going for with my question, mostly because Im a dumbo and Im still learning english, but the problem wasent that ""I dont like this debate because thats not my opinion"", because I have done debated before and I get the message that is trying to send, my issue was that I couldnt find any arguments from this side and I couldnt win in any way when vaccination is alredy stablished as a scientific thing and that I wanted to show my skills in debate and it seemed impossible with this, but thankfully, most of you gave ideas that me and my group could use, for example, attacking the gov, the right to not do it, and other stuff.

Some of you were even able to transform this stressing scenario into a fun one, you guys gave me so many ideas and it makes me happy to see that most of you called me an a-hole but decided to help too, wich Im grateful for, so yeah, Ill make it the best I can and try not too suck, thanks to everyone who helped me and gave their opinion on the topic!

Thanks so much."		1	0

bzwkzd	2019-06-12 20:53:03	QueenNephrops	AITA for not letting my ex stay over on our daughter’s birthday?	"I split from my husband 18 months ago. It was messy as he was suffering from mental health issues and felt like I’d ruined his life. There was no cheating or anything like that I just had to end it because his issues were putting so much strain on me I felt I had to prioritise my daughter by prioritising my own mental health.

If my ex is anything it’s a devoted dad and I do feel a lot of guilt for preventing him from living with his daughter full time. Initially we co-parented half the week each but after a few months he moved 300 miles away to be closer to his own family and start over. I get why he did it, it’s similar to my decision to end the marriage in that he’s putting his own happiness first (he was never happy where we lived which is my home town) in order to heal etc. I do feel resentment sometimes because he left his daughter behind and left me to do everything on my own. He’s not contributing financially at all because he’s not fit to work and I’m driving our daughter half way to meet him every time she goes to stay with him which is pretty much limited to school holidays.

She had her fifth birthday a couple of months ago and he wanted to come all the way up to see her. Absolutely fine by me. Then he asked if he could spend the night here as he couldn’t afford the long drive plus a night’s accommodation. I gave it some thought and ultimately said no. 
My reasons were that it was confusing for her having him here overnight as she asks me all the time why I won’t let him live here any more and that after she went to bed it would be just the two of us. We get on ok but I knew I’d be uncomfortable spending the evening with him in what used to be our marital home. 
I try to be as kind as I can to him but all he talks about is how hard everything is for him (won’t entertain the idea that the past 18 months haven’t exactly been a walk in the park for me as a full time single mom working upwards of 40 hours a week to pay the bills and paying off all of our joint debt on my own as it’s all of my own making) and I knew I’d be his emotional hostage for the night. He has friends around here still so I said he should try to find someone else to stay with. He ended up getting a bed and breakfast and when he did come up he barely spoke to me.

Since then every time he’s pissed at me he brings this up saying I was totally out of line not giving him a bed for the night when he’d come all that way. He’s said it so many times without ever conceding I had a point that I’m starting to wonder if I was being an asshole. Should I have just sucked it up for one night?

bzwjxg	2019-06-12 20:50:40	amiarsehale	AITA for reporting my neighbor for noise without speaking with her first?	"I recently moved into a small studio. The first day I was moving in, as I was walking towards my unit, I could hear music all the way at the end of the hall. I thought, ""Oh no,"" and sure enough, as I approached my unit, the music was coming from the nearby neighbor. When I say ""nearby,"" I mean that her door is right next to mine (if we both exit our units at the same time, we'd have to be careful not to bump into each other).

I know the person is a younger female because I saw two 20-something females exit the unit the day I was moving. I would have introduced myself to be nice, but I didn't because I was hauling stuff and they were obviously pretty tipsy (it was the weekend - I'm not judging). I have not bumped into anyone from that unit since (I assume only one person lives there because these units are small.

I hear quite a lot of music thumping from that unit through my walls. It bothers me late at night. Generally it turns off around 10:15 pm or so, but I have also heard it on in the middle of the night. I am a light sleeper and I have an early sleep/wake schedule. I sleep with earplugs and a white noise machine to try to drown it out. I have also resorted to putting my noise cancelling headphones on over my earplugs, though it's uncomfortable to try sleep like that and I can still hear the bass a bit.

I'm a 40 yr old man and want to avoid the awkwardness of knocking on a 20-somethings door and asking her to turn it down. It's uncomfortable for me and may feel threatening to her.  I also don't want to do the thing where I pound on the wall.

I assume she is a decent person and just doesn't know how much it's bothering me and possibly others. I just want a peaceful environment and to be able to keep to myself without incident.

So I let the management company know that it's an issue for me and they said they'd contact her and explain the noise policy.

From her end, I honestly don't know which she'd prefer: A stranger knock on her door at 10 PM or to get into a little bit of trouble with management. I considered a note, but it still seems weird to stick something under someone's door.

AITA?

tldr: Next door neighbor plays music that is too loud at inappropriate times. I don't want to deal with her directly because it is uncomfortable and weird. I asked management to take care of it."	Asshole	0	0
bzwjv3	2019-06-12 20:50:31	sapperdanman	AITA for not shaving my mustache	"Warning: this is petty. Still, I need your help.

Normally I have a pretty full beard on my face, keeping it trimmed to maybe a half inch length, shaving it completely every few months. A few days ago, as I was buzzing it off, I carved a truckers ‘stache into it before chopping the rest off. I’ve never had just a mustache, and I must admit, it looked pretty raunchy compared to my usual look. I loved it. My GF laughed at first, saying “that thing is hideous” with a few lols following. Well, 24hrs later, I’m still rocking the caterpillar on my mug, and go in for a kiss when I got home. GF’s hand goes up, “you’re not kissing me with that thing. I thought you were just keeping it for a day or so for laughs.” I tell her I’m keeping it for a while. I like the new look, and as my beard grows in, it won’t be nearly as noticeable. Things slowly but surely escalated into a full blown argument, after she legit forbid me from visiting her at work (I like to take her coffee if I’m in the area or pick her up for lunch, usually once a week or so), or to be seen in public with her at all. Also, no going to pound town while my flavor saver is present. Other than the mustache clash of 2019, I’d say we have a pretty healthy relationship, but this has bothered me more than it probably should. Does she love me for me? Or only when I “look the part?” Without the mustache, I’m a tall, decent looking guy, and we always get complements when we’re meeting friends or family as a “great looking couple.” I told her she’s waaaay too wrapped up with what other people think of her, and I would never force her to change something about her because of what somebody else expects my GF should be.

One day, I wanted to do my laundry but our housemates laundry was in there, so I threw some dryer sheets in the dryer and moved housemates laundry over. 

While doing this, my girlfriend saw me grab our dryer sheets and move her laundry, and tried to slowly close the dryer door while I was grabbing the dryer sheets. 

I’m not one for typically being petty, so I opened it and finished putting her laundry in and turned on the machine. This resulted in a prompt 15 minute yell match on my girlfriends end about how the girl upstairs wouldn’t move our laundry or “use her dryer sheets for our clothes”. 

This kind of shit has been happening more recently to the point where I’ve felt that I’m the asshole or that I’m consistently doing shit wrong."		1	0

The Pizza place was a few miles away and I was feeling lazy and didn't want to walk there so I wanted delivery. Well when my Pizza came I checked my wallet for cash for the tip and noticed I didn't have any. I didn't want to tip using card so I didn't tip. 

The guy got mad and told me in a angry voice that he only makes $4 for delivery and me not typing hurts him. That I shouldn't do that anymore. I felt bad but I was also angry that he would say that at my doorstop. I didn't say anything to him because I was shocked.

When I closed the door I vented to my boyfriend. I've worked for tips before so I know how rough it can be but I would never get angry at a customer for not tipping. I'll rave a little to my co workers after they left tho.

bzwg2k	2019-06-12 20:41:52	ShallowSquire	WIBTA for not hiring a former high school bully?	"This post requires a little bit of backstory so bear with me.

Go back in time 8 years ago and I’m a freshman in high school with a terrible bully, same grade. Everyday I have to deal with his ridiculousness. He does your general bully things: I’m walking down the hallway and he’ll knock my books out of my hands, eating lunch and he’ll come up to me and steal my brownies, in the locker room after gym class he comes up to me and pushes me around, the works.

Probably the worst thing he ever did to me was when I was a sophomore. We ended up having an English class together with a “show and tell” the first week. Everybody brings in an object, introduces themselves to the class and talks about their object. Mine was a silver pocket watch my grandfather gave to me before he died two years earlier. After class, this kid comes up to me and asks to see it. I firmly say no and he pins me up against the wall and snatches it out of my hand. He looks at it mockingly, opens it and throws it on the ground cracking the glass covering the actual watch. The absolute jerk.

Fast forward to today. I’m an IT Manager with a small IT team (5 desktop techs, 1 network and 1 server engineer) for a company quickly expanding. I get approval to start hiring two more desktop techs.

I get a number of resumes and about 10 candidates stand out to me. One in particular catches my eye because it’s a name that I’m very familiar with. As I’m reading through this person’s education and work history, it becomes clear this is the same bully I had to deal with for four years of high school.

I cant ignore the fact that he has a good resume and is essentially what I’m looking for in a desktop tech. Not wanting to be biased I include him in the screening process for phone interviews because hey, this was 8 years ago and we’re both adults now.

Eventually we schedule him for an in-person interview. This is a panel interview that includes myself, one desktop tech and our network engineer. As soon as this guy walks into our little meeting room I recognize him despite not seeing him since graduating high school.

I shake his hand and state my name and he looks at me for a second and says,

“ShallowSquire? You graduated from (school) right?”
“Yes” I reply.
“I thought I recognized you! Good to see you again!”

I’m not really sure why but that immediately made me feel angry. During the interview all I could think of was the suffering he put me through in high school.

The interview ends. Admittedly he seems to be knowledgeable and my colleagues want to consider him for employment. I told them let’s finish interviewing the other candidates first before we decide.

We’ve since interviewed everyone else and he’s still be considered for hiring. He’s got the knowledge and skills to perform his job well, but I really don’t want to hire him. I don’t feel like I have a personal vendetta against him, but I surely don’t want to work with this guy.

WIBTA for not hiring this man for the sole reason he was my high school bully 8 years ago?

bzwfxk	2019-06-12 20:41:30	cy0nknight	"AITA for not wanting to continue to be my friend's ""anchor friend"", and for completely breaking things off with them?"	"Hi. I used to be in the kink scene in the city where I live. I met someone, we'll call them Queen, in the scene. Queen seemed like a very nice person at first, and we got to doing scenes together at the local kink club. 


In 2017, I became Queen's sub, after some long talks. We made some good memories together since then. Queen even wanted me to get a tattoo and collar. Queen was looking for a dom of their own, and as of this June went through a bunch of guys.


Every couple months, Queen would have a massive falling-out with the Dom they were with. I'd be one of the people they'd text and it felt like I got the brunt of their emotions because I was their sub. I did my best to listen when they'd blow up.Our scenes got more intense every time these break-ups happened, and I wasn't enjoying being at the club. I'd find a quiet place to hide. 


was with the most recent guy, we'll call him Jack. ""cy0n, I really love Jack! He's great!"" turned into ""I ended things with Jack. I'm so upset but we were yelling at each other,"" etc. Things between us had been cold, not to mention that they were in a relationship with one of the Doms, Gene, they were with. They even mentioned that they didn't really love me in a group chat.  


Anyways, I log in to that kink website, the one whose name starts with ""F"", and I see in my timeline that Queen's written a coded message to Jack. They want him back, and would he please PM them? I know who Jack is. This is the same guy Queen had a huge blow-out with. I know what's going to happen. I say to myself, ""I have to leave. I have to get out."" So I write Queen. 


I write them and say, in a very polite message, that I need time to work on myself, so I'm stepping down as their sub. Queen writes back, saying Okay, that's fine, I get why you would do that. (I should also mention that they've said that they're seeking professional help and getting anti-depressants.) ""Can we still be friends?"" 


I repeated what I said, left the Kik group we were in, and logged off Kik. I wanted to say ""You're falling into the same cycle you did before with all these other guys. I saw the message you wrote to Jack on F. I'm not your whipping boy."" Queen wrote me to ask why I was leaving the Kik group we were in. ""There are people who care about you."" I didn't say anything. I've done everything I can to get away from them. I feel that if I spoke to them again, and said what I wanted to say, I'd get a ""But I'm getting help, and it's not what it looks like, and blah blah blah. Why are you trying to throw everything away?"" I'd get anxiety attacks from hearing my phone buzz with Kik stuff, mostly from them, thinking ""What the fuck do they want now?"" I feel like I can't ever go back to the club because Queen will be there. Or Gene will be there smoking his fucking cigar and trying to be a weird father figure. Am I the asshole?"

bzwfux	2019-06-12 20:41:21	Gecch	AITA for trying to merge my group of friends?	"I am going out with a girl for a couple of weeks now and things have really escalated. I met her because one of my closest friends is dating his best friend, so we could go on double dates. We decided to go out to celebrate my dates friend graduation we went to a local bar to have some beer and I told my close friend and her boyfriend to go with us. My friend and her bf were supposed to arrive at 10 at my dates house to go to the bar but they got there at 11+. Here I realized my friend and my date didnt get along very well and only went out with each other because of her bf/best friend. My friend came with 3 other friends that I didnt know were coming until the very same day and I told her it was alright if they buy their drinks. We got to the bar and there wasnt much space but I got two tables where we could drink. My friend didnt want to sit and stayed in the entrance where they could smoke. I wanted everyone to stay together. I was with my date and her graduation friend drinking and I realized that the other group wouldnt join us so I went outside to smoke and drink a beer with them and they told me they wouldnt enter because my date had told my friends bf that she didnt want them there. I doubted that and tried to make them go inside but they were set on staying outside. Now I was trying to be with both groups. I didnt let my date alone as another friend of hers just got to the bar and was talking to her so I went outside again to see what the others were up to and in that moment they told me they were going to another bar because they werent having fun. My date got angry because I left her alone(This was 10m tops as I bought beers for the outside group and was waiting until we finished and go back inside) This group then left and I stayed with my date and her other friends. An hour went by and it was kind of weird until the graduating girl left with her boyfriend and I stayed in the table with other people as my date went outside to say goodbye. Everyone started to leave and I found myself alone in the table with a check to pay. Luckily I found one of the guys that ordered the drinks and they paid the bill.

After that I called my date to ask her what happened. She told me she wasnt feeling very well and went home. I called my friends and they didnt want me to go were they were. I was in the bar area by myself and had to go to my dates house to pick up my backpack with my laptop. So, the next day, both my date and my close friend wouldnt talk to me. I called my friend and asked her what happened, and she told me to fuck off and be happy until my ‘relationship’with this girl ended and that she understood I only went out with this ‘horrible person’as I didnt want to be alone. I didnt reply to that. Two days later, the girl Im seeing texted me and told me she got angry about the situation but didnt want to make a big deal out of it so we left it behind.

bzwf5u	2019-06-12 20:39:41		AITA for not wanting my boyfriend's brother to sleep in our room during his visit?	"My bf's brother and I historically do not get along. I don't know whether it's our personalities, our values, or our morals, but we just don't. We've gotten into terrible fights on every occasion we've been together for extended periods of time, though I always try to keep things civil when he visits for my boyfriend's sake. My main coping mechanism is to get up and retreat to my bedroom and close the door behind me, disengaging from the conflict and giving us both personal space.

He's due to visit this week and my boyfriend:

a) never asked whether I was okay with him visiting,

b) has decided unilaterally to put him up in our computer room/office, and

c) heard my objections and ignored them.

The issue is that the computer room is adjoined to our bedroom by a doorway with no door. We've drawn a curtain across it, but you can clearly hear everything happening in the both rooms. I do not want his brother sleeping in there because 1) I don't get along with him and would rather not be in close proximity during personal sleeping times, and 2) there is no privacy except for the curtain, and his brother walks around in his underwear. And 3), he would have to walk past me in bed every time he wanted to use the master bathroom!

I have provided a reasonable alternative--that his brother sleeps in our large, spacious living room (2 couches and a futon, he can have his pick!) and uses the hallway/guest bathroom. That bathroom is shared by our 2 other roommates, who are rarely home due to school and work.

My boyfriend refuses to listen to me because he thinks our roommates will be put out, and that his brother would be more comfortable in our office space. He refuses to compromise and I'm really frustrated. AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

"So my girlfriend had to have surgery for her broken leg about a month ago and she was given prescription pain pills, she did not end up taking them all because she did not need them. Her plan was to sell the left over pills to her roommates boss because he is an addict and pays pretty well for them.

 A couple of days ago one of my co-workers injured her leg pretty bad and has to walk with a boot for a few weeks and is in a lot of pain, her doctor did not prescribe her anything for her pain and I can tell at work she is hurting a lot so I offered to give her some of my girlfriends left over pills, I did not tell her I would make her pay for them. Knowing that my girlfriend wanted to sell the pills I was more than ready to shell out some money for them to give them to my co-worker.

 When I asked my girlfriend about it over text she seemed really excited to get rid of them. This morning before she left for work and I asked her about it she asked how much she should charge her for them and I just told her whatever she thinks is fair and so she said $40 would be good. I said no problem and than made the mistake of telling her that I was paying for them.

She got upset because she did not want to take my money and is now calling me an asshole because she could have sold them to her roommates boss for $80 and that she feels cheated because she was going to make more money on them. Not only that but because she also feels bad taking my money. After she was done blowing up I apologized for making her feel cheated and told her I would give her $80 for them because I don't want her to feel like she lost out."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bzwant	2019-06-12 20:29:15	missmarix	AITA for telling my mother I want nothing to do with her if she puts down her dog?	"Good ole context:

My mother and I have an incredibly insane relationship. Boundaries are near non-existent with her and I. That part I'm aware of.

But here's where I want good ole Reddits advice.

My mom got a puppy (impulsively) last year. Her reasoning? She was bored. I wish I could make that shit up. He's wild, obnoxious, wiggly, every attribute of a puppy. He's had 2 major surgeries in his short 11 month old life. 1 was a surgery to fix his eyelids. Something with his lower lashes turned inward?  The second, was about 2 weeks ago from a supposed obstruction. My mom is stressed with taking care of a puppy, that she shouldn't have ever gotten, as if she forgot how much work they are from when my dog is a puppy.

Due to this recent surgery that she paid $2400 for, she wants to have the dog euthanized. I told her that it was extremely stupid, selfish, among other choice words for a decision. I also told her that if she went through with euthanizing the puppy, I wanted nothing to do with her. She said that adopting is out of the question because ""What if he's neglected/abused?"" Or ""No one wants a sick dog.""

I tried explaining to her that he isn't SICK with a disease, that puppies ALL THE TIME suffer from obstructions. It isn't that uncommon for puppies to suffer from them. I also mentioned to her that it's funny she would pay $600 for medication for her 22 year old parrot that got pneumonia but is losing her shit and crying for putting a puppy down over an obstruction and (as far as I know elective) eye surgery.

She says I'm an asshole and a bitch for guilt tripping her by giving her the ultimatum of euthanize = no more contact with me (or my dog). Am I that big of an asshole for advocating for an 11 month old puppy? Is her shitty attitude really getting to me?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzwac6	2019-06-12 20:28:33	mce83	AITA for calling out my friends for hitting on girls with misleading statements?	"This happened in college years ago but I have been interested in other people’s opinion. I lived with three other guys in an apartment. We had a moth fly in through an open window and one of the guys joked about making it our pet. 

We named him Andy the moth. They tried to feed him and keep him alive as long as they could. After a few days one of my roommates found him dead near a windowsill. And that night we went to the bar. 

At the bar, we were taking shots and just hanging out and drinking. Two of my friends started talking to a couple girls and told them how we were all upset because “our roommate” died that day. Our roommate named Andy. 

The girls got really upset and felt bad for my two friends and were seemingly comforting them while we drank. At first I thought it was funny, but it went too far. Describing his eating habits, how messy he was, how he wouldn’t clean up after himself, etc. The girls seemed to genuinely like my friends, but it just seemed messed up to me. 

At one point I got so annoyed, I pulled one of the girls aside and told her the truth. They got mad at my friends and left. I felt like an asshole, but I also thought it went too far.  Am I the asshole for this?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzwa9y	2019-06-12 20:28:26		AITA for cutting off my friend for staying friends with my ex	"Not using a throwaway because fuck it. 

I moved to PA in 2016 to do a master’s program in psych. I met M soon after as he was in the same program, just a year ahead. He’s originally from VA. I make it clear to him from the beginning of our relationship that I intend on pursuing a doctorate degree after completing my master’s. We agree that I’ll try to aim for doc programs in the NE but that if I get into a school further away we will discuss doing long distance but that I hate long distance so it might be a dealbreaker. Things are going super well, and I think I’ve found the one, etc. 

Flash forward to 2018: I’ve since graduated and he has not (hadn’t started his master’s paper). We move in together with another friend of ours from the program (E) and things still seem to be going well.

A few months later he drops the bomb that he is moving back to VA regardless of where I get into a program. No discussion. We did not talk about it AT ALL and I felt very much blindsided because he made such a big life decision without consulting me. To top it off, he adds that he’d be willing to do long-distance with me but would be okay if we didn’t. I’m heartbroken and angry and we end up breaking up because fuck that noise. I’m furious at M because he had evidently known for months about this plan and still went ahead with moving in together without saying anything

To say that the breakup crushed me would be an understatement: I was a mess and turned to E as she was my closest female friend in the area. For multiple reasons (financial and otherwise), I also decided not to move out, so our living situation is extremely tense and awkward. I lucked out and got the master bedroom in the breakup so I start to hole up in my room and only come downstairs to use the kitchen. I also completely cut M off because I was still angry and it hurt too much to see or talk to him. Meanwhile, E is still trying to maintain her friendship with both me and M.

E and I agree that she will do her best to not bring up M around me because she knows that I will have a strong negative emotional reaction. As the months go by though our relationship becomes more and more strained as we went through cycles of being ok, her bringing up M, me getting extremely upset and angry at her, forgiving her and trying to make up and her promising to try harder, and then her bringing him back up. Rinse and repeat. My anger at her was also compounded because she had empathized and agreed with my perspective of the breakup and had done her fair share of shit-talking M post-breakup. And then she went on and continued the friendship with him as if nothing had happened. The breaking point was when I came home late one weekend and asked where everybody was at and she replied that M was on a date. TO BE FAIR, I did ask. But I feel (whether rightly or wrongly) that she should have known better than to say he was on a date. So I end up deciding to cut her off as well.

I personally do not want to rent a property as I have done this before and leaves barely anything left over for savings towards a mortgage. We have worked out it will take us about 1 1/2 years to save for a house if we stay living with our parents, however we both work fulltime, myself Monday to Friday 8-5, whereas she works Tuesday to Saturday 9-6. She has expressed numerous times about wanting to rent as we will get more time to spend with each other but I'm just looking towards the future. Also she has offered me to move into her parents house with her, but due to limited space and being unable to see members of my family regularly due to work I have had to decline, does any of this make me the asshole?

bzw9iv	2019-06-12 20:26:41	thisuzernameistaken	AITA for telling my mum to stop wearing my clothes for her date nights? NSFW	"So I’m 21 years old and live with my mum. We are normally really close and are both quite girly, into makeup, she’s basically my best friend 99% of the time but when we argue, we ARGUE. 

Obviously I like wearing really fun stuff, and I go out a lot with my mates so 99% of my wardrobe reflects that, especially because I work in a tanning salon so the more fashionable my outfit the better. 

There’s a brand called Missguided and they dropped a playboy collection a few months ago and I bought basically all of it but I have so much clothes It takes me ages to slowly get through wearing everything. My mum has been seeing a new fella for a couple months now, and I’m the first to say my mam doesn’t really dress for her age but I noticed she was taking and wearing my playboy stuff. 

My mum has a BANGING figure and she’s a lot taller than me so she usually nicks my cheaper clothes and doesn’t mind if I wear her nicer bits, and usually we don’t have an issue with this. However lately she’s been going away for the night and coming back the next day wearing the same clothes and I really 100% haven’t got an issue with her living her best life but I do think it’s really really kinda gross that her new guy is feeling her up and doing naughty things in my clothes. I know this because he tagged her in a Facebook post with his hand on her arse in my playboy dress with the caption ‘this dress was a lot of fun on my bird😉’ and you know, it doesn’t take an idiot to work it out. I know obviously clothes can be washed but it really is bothering me. 

I asked her as casually as I could if she wouldn’t mind not wearing my stuff when she knows she’s going to stay over at his place and she got really huffy with me and told me that she will plan her spontaneous nights away better so as not to hurt my feelings. She said she lets me wear stuff on date nights but I REALLY didn’t want to answer her back and let her know I hadn’t fucked my date with her bleeding heels on. 

Btw I’m fairly new to Reddit and I wouldn’t normally post on here but my boyfriend loves it and told me my issue is perfect for this subreddit.

He literally slept the whole movie after feeding. He cried for about a min before the movie while I was setting up to feed but otherwise was completely quite.

"So some back story: My friend and I have known each other since 6th grade, but then I switched school and we reconnected junior year. Since then we’ve finished our first year in college (she stayed in-state and I went out-of-state). For her birthday, I flew back home to surprise her (this was October last year). I coordinated with all our mutual friends to plan a whole weekend hangout, and everything went smoothly.

Recently, it was my birthday. She was available from 11:30-midnight that day. I know it’s petty to get mad at a friend for not spending time with you, but what pissed me off the most was that for those 30 minutes she only complained about being tired and sleepy

In her defense, she was stuck at a research lab until around 4pm that day, then had mandatory dinner with her family. She got a speeding ticket that day as well. And to top it off, the previous night, she was arguing with her boyfriend (it not a toxic relationship. they don’t argue often).

She had a really rough day, so I haven’t gotten mad at her yet or anything, but ever since I’ve got back in town she spends all her free time with her boyfriend and when she does hang out with me and our friend group, she only complains that she’s tired and sleepy.

My friends are saying I’m justified to be angry with her, but I just need a third person opinion (also I’m more of a confrontational person that being angry). So WIBTA for snapping at my friend when she’s already having a rough time?"		1	0

My wife is terribly irresponsible! It drives me nuts sometimes. Now she just got home and told me that her iphone fell from her pocket and into a cement mixer (of course completely broken). This was a brand new iphone XR, bought only two months ago.
And this is not the full story. She has had 8 iphones in the years we’ve been together (all iphones 7,8,8+, 10, X and XR). Every single one of them she has managed to break. She has numerous broken screens, shattered them to pieces, drowned one in a lake, run over another with a car.... and I could go on! And not just any phone, she always buys the most expensive iphone there is. And as soon as it breaks she buys another one. 
Let’s go back to the point of this argument. 
I told her that she was not allowed to buy a new iphone and she should just settle with some other cheap phone (because she will break it anyway!). She thought I was being unfair and got really angry, said it was not my business to tell her what she could and couldn’t do.

bzw6fn	2019-06-12 20:19:34	Only_Double	AITA for hooking up with my twin sister’s ex?	"My sister’s name is Ann and her ex’s name is Chris. They dated for 7 months, but broke up during the last day of school, because they are going away for college, and neither of the two wants to have a long distance relationship. She didn’t really seem super sad about it, just a bit sullen for the first two days.

&#x200B;

Now’s a good time to mention that Chris and I are good friends. When they broke up, I told them I wasn’t going to pick a side because they both mean a lot to me, but if they didn’t want to hang out together, I understand.

&#x200B;

On Sunday, he invited me to get high with him in his room. We often did this during their relationship, and I offered Ann to go with me but she declined. I went alone, and we decided to use his vape in his room and watch Stranger Things.

&#x200B;

We ended up cuddling together in his bed. I don’t know how it happened (I’m guessing just hornyness mixed us being high), but we ended up making out with each other, before he went down on me and I gave him a handjob.

&#x200B;

Now, I don’t know if he told her, or if she found out some other way, but Ann’s really, really upset with me. She says she’s disgusted that I’d betray her and have sex with her ex. I told her it wasn’t really sex, but even if I did, I don’t get why my sex life is her business anyways. They are broken up and barely dated for half a year anyways.

&#x200B;

She’s currently not speaking to me which never happens because we’re literally each other’s BEST friend. We’re both very sex-positive and I’m genuinely didn’t know what I did was bad at all.

&#x200B;

I tried apologizing to her anyways, but she just walks away and ignores me. Don’t get me wrong; I hate that I hurt her, but I feel like she’s acting a little childish. Am I the asshole for thinking I didn’t really do anything wrong?"	Asshole	0	0

"About a year ago my wife and I (mid 20s) moved into the her parents (early 60s) We were having trouble saving up a house deposit and they were having trouble paying off there mortgage on a single income. My FIL hasn’t really worked in about 8 years. I reluctantly agreed as neither of us got along with my FIL.
My FIL is the most unpleasant person I know, almost everyone I know hates being around him.

We payed $100 a week for rent and also half of all bills, including body Corp and rates. These are just for home owners. I mention this because I feel we payed our share and I wanted to be seen as equal and not a child living in there home. I felt that we were helping each other by living together. 
We kept all our stuff seperate. Had seperate bathrooms, fridges, parts of the house. 

I came home from work one day and find a bunch of empty cans and bottles in front of my fridge. My FIL is the only one home so I ask him if he knows what they are. He says they’re mine, he doesn’t want us to put our recycling with his anymore. 
We all put our recyclables in a cardboard box and take it to the bin every couple of days. 

I ask him what the deal is, it’s a shared recycling, he says he just wants to keep all our stuff seperate. I say fine that’s a great idea let’s keep all our stuff seperate. Then I ask him to come with me to the garage where my fridge is. I grab him a box and ask him to get all of his stuff out of my freezer. They’d been using it the last month because theirs busted. They said they’d get a new one but hadn’t.

He gets pissed off at this point and tells me I’m being a dick and he’s gonna kick me out. I just laughed at him and told him If I’m out so are you I’m paying his bills. I tell him we can discuss it at a family meeting when our wives are home. I can tell he doesn’t like that cause he knows his wife will tell him off. We argue on and off the rest of the day. I stay in my room but he keeps coming up.

Anyway at night everyone’s home I bring up the recycling and me getting kicked out, as expected the MIL tells him off. He loses it accusing me of tearing the family apart and telling me to go fuck myself. At this point my MIL tells him she wants him to leave as in for good, go back to his home country. Pretty tense at the time, but they’re still together now.

I told this story to my Dad and sister and they said I was being an asshole.
I didn’t make him take out his frozen stuff I was more pointing out his hypocrisy.
He shows no respect and I in turn I give him none.

Probably didn’t need all this txt. FIL didn’t let me use his recycling so I didn’t let him use my fridge."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bzvxxq	2019-06-12 20:00:40	wellexcuuuuuse_me	AITA for correcting people I didn't know well when they were wrong?	"I went on a couples vacation with four other couples weeks ago. We were invited by one couple we knew but didn't know the three other couples. We are all Black, in the South, mid-20s. 

We all shared an Airbnb house and spent a few evenings of the week hanging out in the den, drinking and talking. For the most part, it was a good time and we all got to know each other well enough to have fun conversations and get to know one another well.

One evening the conversation goes into a discussion about race. One of the girls I knew previously was talking about how someone she knew was ""White mixed with Spanish"" and I respectfully explained that wasn't a thing, as you can be White and Spanish, and race and nationality are separate things. Ends up she meant Hispanic when she was saying Spanish, and the discussion evolved into me explaining the difference between race, ethnicity, and nationality - I genuinely just want my people to go out into the world knowing the difference. 

One couple was rolling their eyes at my explanations and said it wasn't that serious and that they're gonna stick to how they already say things. I just smiled and fell back. The conversation keeps going and the guy of the couple rolling their eyes - Chuck - is talking about how ""strong"" Black genes are and how if someone is mixed with Black they typically look mostly or fully Black because our DNA is ""dominant."" People are nodding their heads in agreement. I jumped in to say that wasn't how DNA works. Chuck replies with a sarcastic and dismissive comment like ""Yeah, yeah I bet"" and everyone laughs. I fell back for the rest of the evening. 

The next evening there was a conversation about educational systems by state since a few people there were originally from Mississippi and we all now lived in Texas. Before I chimed in with just general commentary, Chuck joked ""Go ahead, we know how much you like your statistics!"" It felt super malicious to me and I fell back in the conversation and went to bed early. 

Later on I asked my boyfriend if he would tell me if I was ever embarrassing myself or doing too much around other people. He assured me he would. I brought up the situation before and said I felt perhaps I was unintentionally being an asshole and failed to read the room. He said maybe I was being a bit of an asshole know it all, but it was fine and at least I didn't say anything actually wrong. I said there was a lot of ignorance I didn't bother commenting on during this vacation and it was unfair that the one conversation I spoke up, I was a know it all. We left the conversation at that. 

I've recanted this to close friends who weren't there and they all told me I did nothing wrong and that we should look to educate our own people at any given opportunity. I keep replaying it in my head over and over, wondering if I was being an asshole and feeling like if I had a do-over, I wouldn't have corrected anyone.

bzvtr3	2019-06-12 19:51:19	Due_Respond	AITA for refusing an elderly relative's birthday gift?	"So last thursday it was my 18th, all my family gathered, including my stepmom's family. My stepmom's mom, ""Sharon"" hands me an envelope. I open the envelope along with the other gifts, it's a lottery ticket. Fine by me I figured, and then Sharon chimes in telling me that if I win over 100 dollars I have to share it with my (non-biological) cousins and my sister. This would mean sharing the lottery ticket 6-ways, so I'd come out with nothing even if I'd won.

I'm honestly flabbergasted at this, who shares a lottery ticket 6-ways and I refuse to scratch it. I won't accept a gift with some sort of tacked on rule, and she seems pretty salty about it. 

When it's all said and done I tell my dad, who wasn't in the room what happened. He agreed that it was ridiculous and we started joking around when my stepmom came in. She realized we were laughing about her mom and the lottery ticket and gave us both nasty looks, like we did her some big wrong.

bzvnus	2019-06-12 19:38:16	potatobug25	AITA for what I said about my ex-suite mate?	"This past school year while living in the dorms I lived with my roommate of 3 years now who I love and have never had any serious problems with, a suite mate in the same year as us, and another suite mate who was freshman. 

My usual roommate and I continued on as normal. We've never had any major arguments. We both got along very well with the suite mate in the same year as us. The only places we really interacted were in a shared living room space and in the bathroom that connects our rooms. I really liked her. 

The freshman, however, is a totally different story. She was awful to live with. She's a really hardcore vegan, the animal rights kind rather than animal welfare. Having taken entomology, I had to make an insect collection, which required me to kill and pin insects. Like any person, I didn't enjoy having to capture neat insects just to kill them, but in the end I was proud of my collection. If she saw me working on it, she'd call me a murderer. It wasn't a one time thing, though. If she saw you eating alone, she'd join you and lecture you for eating meat. She was also rude about people's interests and really snobby about people's favorite books (she's an English lit major if that explains it), so you really couldn't talk to her about much. Her boyfriend was over a lot. They also apparently had sex with the other suite mate several feet away in her bed.

Basically, she was unpleasant to live with as a suite mate and I couldn't imagine sharing a room with her.

She's looking for a new roommate since her roommate this past year doesn't want to live with her again, and someone considering being her roommate contacted me asking how she was as a suite mate. I told the truth and said I wouldn't recommend it if you want your living space to be relaxing. That person decided not to room with her. The freshman has since contacted me and says she still needs a roommate and I ruined a good chance for her, and that she needs this financially or else she can't afford a place to live. 

I feel bad about that, but was it really an asshole move to tell the truth about living with her? I'd feel so bad if I lied to someone and said it was great, but I also don't want her to not be able to afford a place to live for this upcoming school year."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I was searching for something in google and as I typed “w” name of a website “wattpad” (basically people, mainly teens write fanfictions there)popped up. I remember that, I used to read stuff there when I was 12-13. I clicked on it, just out of interest, I was wondering what changed about it. I went there and she was logged in. She had one story published. I read like one chapter of it. It was...interesting. Fr I wanted to throw up. It was about Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold (columbine shooters) first of all,  I didn’t know people still obsessed over them, and second, where the fuck dod she learn about the things she wrote. I waited for her and when she came home I said I wanted to talk to her. I said that I came upon the stuff she wrote and said that it was unacceptable. Also said that it was disgusting that she was even thinking about those thing. She started crying and ran to her room.

I don't give out the games, just kinda back them up when they bring it up, and when their dad made a facebook post asking about this stuff i told him my 2 cents. I've openly argued against their parents, since they've asked me (most likely hoping I'd agree). 

My mom thinks I'm ""overstepping my bounds"", but I just don't see any reason for them not to be allowed to play. They're perfectly mature for their age, are good kids and all, what's the problem?

bzvnab	2019-06-12 19:36:54	fresh-oxygen	WIBTA If I Didn’t Go To His Parents’ Anymore?	"My fiancé and I have been together for nearly 4 years now, and I’ve always had a wonderful relationship with his parents, especially his mother. I’ve considered her to be a second mother to me, and they consider me a part of the family. Despite some cultural differences, with me being from the north east and them from the Deep South, we’ve just sort of ignored political issues, because what’s the point in arguing about that? I do make/share a lot of political posts on Facebook, and I knew they irked some of my older relatives, but I didn’t think anybody was that upset about them. 

Well, it turns out that his mother does get quite upset about it, and it’s been building in her for a while. She eventually exploded at my fiancé on Sunday after hearing I had attended Pride over the weekend (I’m bisexual). She said a lot of very hurtful things about not only my sexuality, but me as a person. Afterward, she apologised to my fiancé, not to me, and said it was mostly because of other physical and emotional issues she was having, as she was in pain and having issues with her own mother. 

We now haven’t spoken in days, and I’ve decided I really don’t want to hear from her unless she apologises.  He claims his mother still loves me and didn’t mean what she said, but I don’t think things that cruel just come out of nowhere. I don’t want to be around her. I don’t know that I feel comfortable spending time with his family, now knowing what his mother really thinks of me. I’m considering cancelling my trip to stay with them and go to a family reunion. I know this would disappoint my fiancé and his friends and other family members, but just the thought of spending time with her after what she said makes my gut twist. My close friends think I’m being unreasonable and petty, and that I’m holding a grudge. I know it would be disappointing my fiancé to miss this trip. Should I just let it go? Am I being an asshole?

(TL:DR- Fiancé’s mom said mean things about me behind my back, and now I don’t want to see her anymore. Friends think I’m petty.)

We've been going there to clean up the trash accumulated over winter, mostly the plastic stuff washed up by the sea, before the first tourist group arrives.

I have a younger brother (8) and sister (11) who, instead of helping out, decided to collect the ""pretty"" waste and pile it up behind the house. Basically they made a mountain out of bunch of water bottles and loose sandals. When I asked them to clean it up, they'd say we're still playing with it (even though they weren't, they just didn't want to help clean).

So while they were occupied with something else, I took trash bags and picked up their garbage. They didn't even notice the pile was gone until two days later when we came back. They cried and told on me. Our parents said I should've let them play with the plastic since they had put it behind the house where the tourists don't go because of boulders. But it looked ugly af, when you looked to the sea from the balcony all you could see was old shoes.

bzvdby	2019-06-12 19:14:43	gowmax	AITA for not following superstitious beliefs?	"  

So my wife and mother in law are flying from the United States (I work and live here) to India (my home country) next month with our infant new born who will be 4 months old then. I am at work and was checking dates/airfares in different websites. Usually we pick a week and fly out on the day when the fares are the cheapest. 

Similarly, we picked the Jul 10th week and found that Jul 9th was the cheapest. I called my wife with my findings and she got excited on hearing about the low fare and we decided to book those dates. We hang up and then she calls me back in a few minutes saying that they cannot travel on that day because it is ‘ashtami’ -  the eighth day of Hindu lunar calendar. My mother in law has a lot of these superstitious beliefs without knowing the reason why they exist. This is one of them that you cannot travel/do anything significant on this day of the month – every month! She doesn’t know why but it’s just that because its “inauspicious”. Now since it’s my mother in laws belief, it becomes my wife’s belief and she doesn’t want to travel on that day. I am a very practical guy and don’t believe in anything unless I have some proof. I told her I will check the exact fare difference. If it is not too much I don’t mind but if there is a significant difference, they will have to travel on the “inauspicious” day. My wife keeps arguing with me but I still stand by my word. 

The fare difference between the ""inauspicious"" day and a regular day is $130 which is around Rs.9,000. Back in India, a lot of families live on that for a whole month. I am not going to just let that go down the drain because of my mother in law’s/wife’s superstitious beliefs. I would rather donate that money to charity!

AITA?

Edit: I checked fares in the evening once I got home and another day that week got updated with the same low fare. So we booked on that day. My MIL does not travel on the “inauspicious” day and I got my low fare. Win win for both! I spoke alone to my wife and came to an agreement when we have a similar situation later, $130 is more important. She wouldn’t know about these inauspicious days  unless my MIL told her."

Ok so some quick background I had an electric issue with my bike that needs a dealer tool to diagnose. I was on a wait list at one shop for 6 weeks, getting shined on every two weeks till they finally said take it somewhere else. 

Because of this bad experience I know my patience is about shot but I take it to another shop that can squeeze it in the same day with no waiting but the caveat is that they will diagnose it around the scheduled bikes that come in. They call and give me the diagnosis. They said it will take a week or week and s half to complete. Two weeks go by and they say they that they just got the bike sent to a near by machine shop to fix one of the issues. ( I thought that would have been done in the first week.) They said don't worry it will be two or three days and then it will be done. 

Guess what today is? Day 5. I called to see what was happening and they said they had been trying to get a hold of the mahine shop because it wasn't back yet.

I try to be patient I know things don't always work out. I don't know if this is common for motorcycle shops. Or I am just super out of patience because of the other shop.

Ok so at the end of the week me and about 7-9 of my friends will be celebrating the end of our GCSE's and secondary school (along with most of Britain's Y11 population) by going to a party. This is all fine for my parents and, although I'm not a huge party-goer, I have been before. Nothing negative has ever come of it though. My parents will no where I am going and I will be with my mates the entire time, it's not like I'll be alone and we're getting an uber back to my house. So my parents are completely fine with me going out and stuff but the one condition (along with the plethora of knowledge they need to know beforehand) is that I have to turn on find my friends.

For those of you who don't know it's an app on my Iphone that allows others to keep a track on where I (my phone) am at all times. I really don't want to turn this on as I think it's basically just an invasion of my privacy and just allows my parents to have an even bigger control over my lives. My parents (mum specifically) have said that I'm no longer allowed to go unless I turn it on. But I'm pretty much turning it into my figurative hill to die on, as this discussion has come up before and I have been steadfast in my refusal.

I was invited to my best friends birthday party and subsequent dinner taking place yesterday. The party was going to be bowling from 6pm to 8pm and dinner at 8pm at a Japanese restaurant. Out of my best friends group of friends I am the only one with a full time job (27M) the rest are unemployed (including my best friend) or still at uni. 

I had rescheduled a meeting with some co-workers so I could leave on time for the dinner as I was not able to go bowling seeing  I usually leave work by 8pm. So I was ready to leave work at 7.30 to make it by 8 to the restaurant (had to pick up my girlfriend first) and I get a text from him saying if we could move it to 8.30, I said that’s fine. I picked her up and went to the Japanese place, figured we could have a drink beforehand. When I got there the hostess informed me they were fully booked and he had not made a booking. I called him and he said that we should try a different place and to meet him and the others at that place in 15 minutes. 

So, I arrive at the other place and he’s not there. This other place was also fully booked and again no reservation, I was starting to get pissed off but seeing it was his birthday I decided to be more patient. I call him and tell him that place is fully booked as well. He suggests a third place, bear in mind it’s already 9pm and there is still no place to meet. He said that he’ll think of a place, I said, listen man, I have an early flight tomorrow so I can’t stay out that late.

We get to the third place at 9.15 and he’s not there, this place was empty so booking was not an issue. I waited 15 minutes and nothing, called him two times and he did not pick up. The GF and I decided to have a quick snack somewhere else and headed home. 

When I was packing my suitcase around 10.30 Another friend called and asked if I was coming. I said no I was not gonna make it, he then handed his phone to my best friend who claimed his phone died (not true bc calls don’t ring when the battery dies) I said sorry that I could not make it. I did not want to make a fuzz swing it was his birthday so I said we’ll see each other some other time.

bzv5e6	2019-06-12 18:57:00		AITA for not being sensitive to my sisters strange eating habit?	"My sister absolutely refuses to eat out at a restaurant. She skips meals with family and everyone thinks there is something else going on since she just happens to be “sick” every single time we want to have a meal out. She won’t go on family vacations, just refuses to eat if it’s not at home. On the very very rare occasion she will come with us to eat but won’t eat anything.

She claims she doesn’t like eating in front of people if they’re not eating the exact same thing she is, at the same pace she is. Even at home she will eat at the formal dining room table instead of at the kitchen table with my mom and I. Sometimes my mom will force her to sit with us and she will sit with her plate until we are done and then she will eat her cold food on her own. 

My mom wants to take us on a really nice trip to Italy and will only go if my sister goes, and my sister refuses because she “won’t be able to eat.” Am I the asshole for getting frustrated with this because I am missing out on lavish vacations? or is she the asshole for not getting over it and allowing the rest of the family to enjoy vacations and such? I graduate from college next year and will begin my life after that. I want to be able to take these vacations while I have time and she’s just ruining it over something that I feel could easily be overcome!

Side note: an eating disorder is not the problem. At least not in the way of anorexia,bulimia, etc. she is consuming enough calories she just does it in private I guess."	Not the A-hole	1	0

bzv1x3	2019-06-12 18:48:55	AITAThrowaway2743	AITA for putting pressure on my wife to get surgery	"Using a throwaway because this is a sensitive topic.

My wife and I have always wanted biological children. We were both clear about that when we got married. She got pregnant soon after we married, but we lost the pregnancy. We learned that the reason is that she has an issue with her uterus (not getting specific for anonymity reasons). The issue can likely be remedied with surgery. However, any pregnancy post surgery would automatically be classified as ""high risk.""

My wife refuses to get the surgery. She's scared off by the idea of surgery and ""high risk"" pregnancy. I have been putting pressure on her to get the surgery for the last year because I think she owes it to us to at least try, since we got married with the understanding that we wanted biological children. She exploded at me yesterday and accused me of thinking of her as an incubator. I certainly don't, but I do feel cheated that she's not putting in her all to follow the plan that we both explicitly wanted at marriage. Am I the asshole for pressuring her into following our original plans?"	Asshole	0	0

bzv1rp	2019-06-12 18:48:32		AITA for making a scene in the grocery store.	"My (M26) former BEST  friend (M26) texts me about 4 hours ago and asks if I wanted to hang out and smoke some weed. I said,  ""yeah, but I'm not paying for it this time, or we could just do something else."" Friends replies with, ""o well"". 

I get kinda mad and say, ""hey man if your just hitting me up to pay for your shit you really need to get the fuck out of my life."" This is a long going argument between us, and I was just standing my ground. 

Friend apologizes, and was like I'll figure it out. A few hours pass and I never heard back from him so I  message him,  ""hey are we not hanging out now, what's up?""

He doesn't respond. So that brings us current, fours hours later. I stop to get pretzels from a grocery store and I see my friend hanging out with his other friend group that I don't know that well. Just what's he's said about them really. I walk up to him with a WTF face, and he basically ignores me, doesn't look my way, just kinda says, ""I'll text you later"".  So I walked away to check out as the only person I knew there was pretending I wasn't there. 

-We have been friends for 7 years, roommates a few times, I gave him my old car instead of selling it, hung out almost everyday until about 2 months ago.  That's when he met this chick (in that friend group mentioned) who he is actively cheating on, and the rest of them are fake fucks from what I can tell from not knowing them. Since then he basically will only hang out with me if they are busy, and no matter what we are doing he will ditch immediately, not even just for his girl, like any of them-

Anyway all this is stewing in my head so I go back to the group, just fucking mad, and I say to everyone, "" Friend, I get why every one in your life eventually blocks or tries to fight you (which is true), you just screw everyone over, because you have mommie issues and you haven't had a job longer than a month since your dropped out of high school. Dont fucking message me again"", I then turned to the girl he is with, the one he is cheating on, ""when you realize he's screwing you over, just move on hes not worth the trouble"". I only said that because she is like falling for him, and he just brags about how many other bitches hes seeing and how hes got this one wrapped around his finger. 

Anyway they all laugh at me and I leave. 

That kinda made me think ATA."		1	0

bzv17x	2019-06-12 18:47:12	TheLumpyPumpkin97	AITA for calling my Mom a cunt after she told me to never have children?	"Background: for the past 2 years I've been having a lot of medical issues mainly involving my reproductive system. After pleantly of blood tests and a few crappy doctors, I finally got one amazing doctor who referred me for more examinations (blood test including hormonal check, CT scan, Ultrasound and pelvic exam). So far I've had the blood test and the pelvic exam, with the 2 scans scheduled this week. All signs point towards advanced Endo and PCOS. My doctor told me there was a high chance I'll never be able to be pregnant.

Obviously, I'm not dealing with that well. I don't believe it's the absolute end of the world, and there are other options, such as adoption fostering or, since I'm gay, my partner could carry a child if she wishes. But I'm still devastated to have this choice taken away from me. And with all the current medical tests, this is high on my mind.

Anyway, on to the argument with my mom. My sister and nephew were visiting today. I currently have a bad head cold, so, although I played with my nephew (nearly 2 years old) for a bit, I eventually went upstairs to rest. Later my Mom asked why I went upstairs, so I explained to her that my head hurt, the dogs were being loud and the baby was making lots of noise. To which she said ""if you're going to be like that around children and only think of yourself, then do everyone a favour and never have kids"".

Normally I would just brush something like that off. My mom had been at work all day and usually gets a bit snappy and says rude stuff when she's stressed. But with all my recent medical issues it really upset me. I told her that what she said was incredibly hurtful and when she tried to defend herself I said ""you're being a cunt"" and stormed off.

Now I have my dad calling me telling me to apologise and my yonger sister in my room saying my mom is currently downstairs crying. 

Just for extra info incase it wasn't clear, my mom knows about all these medical issues and has been to most of my appointments with me. I'm also not normally an emotional person, I tend to keep everything in until I'm alone so she might not have known how much the recent news about my possible infertility is affecting me.

bzv0gx	2019-06-12 18:45:34		AITA for refusing to talk to my flatmates after being disrespected?	"A little background info:

&#x200B;

I live 2 flatmates, one of which i'm close friends with. i will refer to him from now on as Josh (Fake name), and the second flatmate Bob (Fake name).

I knew Josh 2 years before we became flatmates, i met him in college, we both usually have the same classes every semester so we hung out a lot.

Josh is the type who lied a lot about his past, (Mainly his childhood) clearly making up fake stories to seem cooler or relatable.

I didn't mind it, I just went along with whatever he said and let him be, i didn't think it was my place to call him out on his BS although in hindsight that was my first mistake.

here comes Josh's second not so pleasant quirk, Josh loved to give me shit about anything, almost anything that i had to say he had some sort of nasty comeback that would just leave a sour taste in my mouth.

It was usually very mundane stuff, it seemed like he just enjoyed arguing for the sake of arguing, and when i call him out on stuff that are factually wrong (no Josh, weed does not cure cancer) he would snap.

Hopefully that gives a sufficient enough background on Josh.

 i met bob after moving in the flat.

&#x200B;

Now comes the part that made me finally snap.

&#x200B;

the evening before the incident , me and Josh were watching TV in the living room, and i was tired, we smoked a few joints and i felt sleepy.

I was lying down the couch with my eyes closed but clearly aware of whatever is going on on the background, AKA Not sleeping.

The episode was over, and Josh asks me if i was asleep, i said no i'm not while rubbing my face.

Josh was convinced that i am lying, he started arguing with me, telling me how i don't need to lie about sleeping, and it was a massive argument where i needed to convince him that i wasn't sleeping, but alas, Josh was not convinced.

&#x200B;

next evening comes, we are sitting in the living room , this time with Bob and we decided to play a game.

ill spare the game rules but they were both cheating, so i decided to call them out on it.

Josh immediately saw an opportunity and told me that i was whining, and claiming that they were not cheating, calling me a liar, etc.

&#x200B;

Now, i am obviously pissed off (not over the game, just being called a liar and disrespected like that) and so i tell them that i am tired and going to sleep.

&#x200B;

Josh decides to hit me below the belt and bring up the sleeping situation that i mentioned before, so i finally snapped, and basically called him out on all of his BS that he was running his mouth at for the past few years.

Once i finally went to bed, i heard them talking to each other, practically shit talking me (It was one sided mostly, Josh being the main culprit, as Bob doesn't have a spine to think for himself) and i felt betrayed by both my flatmates.

&#x200B;

Now for the past 2 days i've been avoiding my roommates.

"So some background, I’m on an exchange right now in Germany, and I’m probably the top of my German class, so a lot of my group relies on me for translations, I lead often, and I’m fitting in very well in the country.

We’re in a larger city, and after spreading out in the city for a while, we meet up in one of the central squares. 

I’m talking with my friends sitting on some stairs, and this girl, fake name 
Jean, is in the square trying to catch pigeons.
We’re all middle aged teenagers, so you’d think we’d have common sense, but no. Jean is in the middle of a public square stalking and jumping and running after pigeons. She’s drawing huge looks from all the locals.

I know the stereotypes of Americans, and I’m conscious of our behavior in another country. 
So she’s acting like an idiot, and it’s beginning to piss me off and embarrass me, and probably other members of group.
So in my exact words

“Stop harassing the pigeons, were in another country, be on your best behavior!”

then quieter, “god damn”

She’s pissed at me, and the teachers leading the exchange said I shouldn’t have yelled. As if I’m the one who caused a scene.

I asked her, how chill is it really, and she said it was all fine, so I came by.  It did seem chill and we started getting all kinds of fucked up.  I was at a separate table in this backyard with the least gang affiliated people.  I guess that didn’t match the vibe of the mingle because after an hour, her gang member brother shouted out to me “Hey, cuz!  You wanna hold the glock?”
Now what I should’ve said was something like no, I’m good, thanks.
It didn’t occur to me how nothing particularly good could come of it.  But I guess I did want to check it out cause I said sure and went over to check it out.  
They pulled it from under their chair and offered it towards me.  I looked at the grip and saw how shiny it was, and I dunno why, but I pulled my sleeves over my fingers to handle it.  I hear a wtf from one of the guys next to the guy who gave it to me and I see him give a cringe of amusement.  Then the woman next to him lols.  The guy who gave it to me is just kinna lookin’ at me, and my hazy ass just grinned and I blurted, “I don’t wanna get it dirty.”  The gun owner said “it was on the ground, we’re not worried.”  Now I realize they think I’m worried about my fingerprints on this dubious weapon, and I wondered if I subconsciously thought about that too.  I still didn’t unsleeve my hands though, and turned the gun over.  I was high enough that the scene was starting to bother me and the people around me weren’t alleviating the situation.
I wondered if they were getting what they wanted, like I failed their cool gun test.  I thought about some dangerous gun joke i could make like pointing it at them or my own head, but opted for saying, “Neato”, with a big dumb grin and handed it back on my sleevy platter.  The guy next to gun guy said “i can get you one if you want” and another dude laughed.  I said “I’m all good” and held up both my sleeves, and nobody laughed.  Then I grabbed a pretzel and walked back to my table.  My friend and I left twenty minutes later.


Tldr: I think I offended some gang members when I tried not to get fingerprints on a gun that they wanted me to check out."		1	0

At that time there was a light drizzle. So, I see the bus is coming in one minute so I step into an empty place on the street. By complete luck, the bus stopped there.   Like any normal person would do I hopped on. Now here’s the problem. After I touched my buss pass, this guy literally climbs out of his bus driver seat and starts shouting at me about how I have no respect for old people and why I jumped in front. I looked around and there were no old people behind me.  Sure, there were some at the back but they were behind like tons of normal people. In fact, I was the only teen. He also told me I was wasting everyone’s time when I would’ve got on in one second and no one would be held up if I was just let on. So, was aita for getting on the bus where it stopped?                  Edit: no one was getting off or on the bus.	Not enough info	0	0

bzutss	2019-06-12 18:30:23		AITA for wanting an answer as to why I had been lied to?	"A few weeks ago my wife and I went over to our married friends house. The husband friend was gone for the weekend, and there was another couple there I knew mutually from the wife friend and work. I was being pleaded with by wife friend to drink with them. I told her I hadn’t drank in awhile and I didn’t really want to. She kept on and my wife told me it was ok, she would be DD and I should just have a little fun as it had been some time.  I drank, and blacked out, and the last thing I remember is seeing my wife make out with the wife friend, and I never thought I’d see my wife do something like that, and I thought it was pretty hot. 

Next morning, I’m told by my wife and that I was freaking out about them making out and trying to get them to do it again, or telling the wife friend she should either take a shot or make out with me. I was told I made no physical advances or didn’t try to aggravate the moment. My wife, unsurprisingly, is totally fine with everything and there is 0 issue between us. The wife friend reassures me that everything is fine, to please not worry about it, that she understood I was totally blackout drunk and I would never do anything like that otherwise, that it’s in the past, and asks to please not let this ruin our friendship.

Fast forward again, this time a few weeks later. I have had terrible anxiety over the whole situation the past few weeks, and it’s only been elevated by me being ignored, and the husband friend removing me from social media. I was made to believe that the wife friend did NOT want this to ruin our friendship and it was apparently “no big deal”.  I try to text them both, asking what’s going on. I go ahead and assume she’s told the husband what happened. I send husband friend a very long, honest message and apology about what happened, ending it with saying I would understand if the friendship was no more. No response from anyone. 

I am not blind to the fact that what I did was an asshole thing to do, regardless of being blackout drunk or sober, but even then it’s not in my character, and again I’ve been told it’s fine and all is well. 3 days pass and I get my answer. I’m told by husband friend that I’m never to speak to him or wife friend ever again. I say I understand and don’t blame him, but I just want to know why I had been ghosted and essentially lied to about all the stuff wife friend said.  Then the wife friend chimes in and because I said this to him and accuses me of trying to create issues in their marriage, because “there’s issues in mine”, which is the furthest from the truth. She says the only reason she said any of the stuff to me about it all being not a big deal, to not let it ruin the friendship, etc was a lie to “not hurt my feelings”. I would rather have the truth. I’m again told by her to never contact them again, and she even threatens to contact my wife (dumb). I remove them from all social media and delete their numbers, and move on."		1	0

"I work in weddings and events as a waiter I go as a head waiter, and I take guys with me my friends moslty and anyone else who wants to work and I give them around 27$ while the company gives me 30$. So there is a guy in my highschool that kept bugging and asking if he could work with me a week ago I accepted and sent him along with me.

I didn't say anything to him I just kept acting normal and I told him that he wasn't allowed to work with me anymore. Fast forward a couple of days he start messaging me asking when he will get paid for that one time he worked I told him that the owner of the catering company and our manager saw him hiding and barely working so they won't pay me for his shift and basically this was a lie for me to take his shift so I can avenge what he did during to me.

Little back story. Back in 2001 me, my mum and dad were 1 ""happy"" family. My Mum one day invited this man to come and stay at our house as he had been kicked out by his wife, my Dad agreed. A week passed and it turns out my Mum was having an affair with this Man (We'll call him Bob) and she ran off with Bob and never came back. Messy divorce and 12 months later 11 year old me is living with Mum and Bob. 

My Dad HATED Bob for obvious reasons. Now my Dad has passed away my Mum said she would like to be at the funeral to support me but is going to bring Bob. I thought about it for a few days and spoke to my Dads family. We all agreed my Dad's funeral isn't the place for Bob. 

I've have today spoken to my mum that I don't think it's best Bob be at the funeral. My Dad didn't like Bob,  my Dad's family don't really want him there and they also didn't know each other. 

It was very obvious my mum was upset about this and said fine then I'm not going either. Am I the asshole for asking my Mum not to bring Bob?

Edit: this is the message my Mum has just sent me.

"Okay, so a relative of mine has a mental handicap of sorts (I've never asked other family members for specifics, so this is about as far as my knowledge of it all goes), and he calls me a lot. Think Laura Linney's character in Love Actually, except my relative isn't in a care home or anything. He lives with my grandma and grandpa, if that matters. Anyway, I get that he might be kinda lonely, so I don't have a problem answering the phone, even if the frequent calls can get annoying at times. So, today I get another one of these calls, and he wants to come to my house so that I can show him a video of something on YouTube. A lot of the calls and visits are like this, so I offered to connect his phone to their houses' Wi-Fi so that he could do this sort of thing himself. I live about 30 minutes away from my grandparents, and he has a smart phone, so I figured this would be way more convenient rather than him getting on a bus every time he wanted to watch a 5 minute video. He wasn't so keen on the idea, and had a million and one excuses as to why he couldn't watch it by himself, despite me explaining each time why he could. Eventually he said, ""I don't want to do it by myself, though. I want you to do it for me."" This is where I got annoyed, since I feel like this is just pure laziness. I offered to come over and even show him how to do it, and he insisted that he didn't want to even try and learn how. He also said I should be making allowances, given his disabilities. I told him that I do make allowances, but this is a simple thing that he could easily do by himself. Granted, my tone was probably pretty aggravated, but I didn't raise my voice and I was doing my best to be as polite about it as possible. He replied, ""well we can't all be perfect like you"", at which point I hung up before I got really angry and yelled or something. 

&#x200B;

This was a few days ago, and since then, I've had a few people from within the family tell me that I was in the wrong and that I need to be more patient with him. In my mind, I don't see how wanting to help him do things by himself rather than babying him constantly is a bad thing. I sort of get where they're coming from, so there's a little doubt, but maybe somebody can offer a different perspective. So, AITA?"		1	0

My older half sister who I share a dad with is now bringing her adopted sister on her mom’s side because her mom and stepdad are going to be on a trip of their own.

The original plan was that my sister, her fiancé, their toddler daughter, and her sister would drive up in one car and I would ride up with my parents.

Well my parents have now decided that since they will be a lot closer to my grandmas that is like 2 hours from the lake and 6 hours from our house, they want to go visit her directly from the lake house. 

We all thought that would be fine and I could just ride back with my sister because she has a 5 seat SUV.

However she is saying I need to drive my own car because there isn’t room in hers. I have pointed out that there are enough seats in her car and I will happily sit in whatever seat is the least comfortable spot, but I really don’t want to drive 9 hours alone.

She is adamant that it would be too cramped and that I am being selfish for wanting to make others uncomfortable on the ride back.

AITA for thinking it’s not a big deal to have two young adults and a child in a car seat in the back of a Jeep Cherokee and making someone else have less room so I don’t have to drive myself?

So I have a friend who is in love with a friend of a close friend of mine. Let's call my friend A, his crush B and him C. So C asks me to ask A if B likes him. I tell him I will and am somewhat optimistic saying that she probably does. A couple of days pass and I speak to A. I ask her about B and she basically tells me that she hasn't revealed anything about if she likes someone or who she likes. I report back to him and it's nothing big and we move on. About 2 weeks later me and another friend are talking and I receive a text from A. She basically says that if C where to ask him out she would reject him. My friend sees that I got a message and since we are close buddies I show him. He then says something like: how funny would it be if we trick him into asking her out. And so the operation begins. I start asking him about B and we talk a little about her. I barley had to do anything as it's the end of our school year and he was already in the mindset. But I cheered him on and have been doing so for a couple of days. In two days he's gonna ask her. I'm genuinely excited"		1	0

"I'm Indian-American and my parents don't approve of me being in a relationship with a classmate of mine. I'm 24. They would rather not discuss the issue and hope that I somehow fall out of it. Which is not going to happen.

In the meanwhile, they keep setting me up on dates with people they know or find online. At first, I just turned them down, but sometimes my parents get irrationally upset at me because it appears rude that I wouldn't even be interested in meeting them. Even more so if there are mutual friends or relatives involved.

I've settled upon this strategy. I go for the date, I'm polite, split the bill, and tell them I had a good time but I see no chemistry. My boyfriend thinks it's weird and I don't blame him, but he is okay with it.

My parents obviously feel this is a way to find a balance. My friends think it's hella weird and I'm a complete asshole. Obviously the truth lies somewhere in between ..."	Asshole	0	0

We talk about all sorts of stuff from sports, to work, to family/relationships. I haven’t been with the guy since the beginning of January 2019. 

About a week and a half ago, he sent me a message about a hook up and I went to make plans, but didn’t follow through with the meet up. He then sends me a nude to which I send a picture of my face and upper chest. I’m male btw. 

My bf and I have been dating for a month. He is the reason why I didn’t go through with the previously said hook up. Last night, he asked to use my phone and I let him. Little did I know he went through old texts and photos and stumbled upon that conversation. 

He asked me about it and I told him that the old fwb is nothing to worry about. But my bf is pissed and wants to break up  because I didn’t tell him about the old fwb and that I responded to his pics and text.  Ive apologized and said I was in the wrong, but he keeps accusing me that I slept with my old fwb when we did not. I have not slept with anyone but my bf during our relationship.

bzuk2n	2019-06-12 18:08:18	Hetaliafan1	AITA for hating my mom because she never told me I had a learning disability?	"For context my mom is single mom with 4 kids who used to be a teacher.

In 4th grade I was diagnosed with the learning disability dysgraphia which caused my handwriting to be completely illegible and caused my grammar and spelling to very very bad. My mom never told me about this and every time I asked if she knew anything about why I wrote the way I did she told me it was my fault. I think she did so I wouldn’t have an excuse to be a lazy, because I didn’t really care about school and avoided writing at all cost. In fifth grade I was given assistant technology to type stuff and refused to use it because I thought I was not disabled and there didn’t use it as much as I should. I was kinda of a brat.

Around ninth grade I was looking around my mom’s room for a flash drive and found a document from 6th grade, that said I had a specific learning disability on it. A quick search on google brought up dysgraphia and I asked my mom if she knew anything about it. She told me about my diagnosis and that she kept it hidden from me to motivate me.

I was furious with her. I know I wasn’t best student, I had a tendency to slack off and procrastinate but I don’t think a learning disability diagnosis would have increased my chances of doing that. I’m starting 12th grade at the end of summer. My handwriting has improved but I still can’t stand the sight of it and I’m still slightly angry with my mom. Which is weird because she didn’t really did anything wrong besides doing what she thought was best.

bzujog	2019-06-12 18:07:22		AITA for being pissed off with my girlfriend and her best friend, and deciding to no longer connect myself with her best friend?	"This happened a while ago, but it’s been bugging me since. I’m writing this to share my thoughts with you all and to of course work out which party is at fault here.

Me and my gf’s best friend originally had a great friendship. She was happy for my gf because she liked me, and thought I was a decent fella, and I liked her because she was a great girl to speak to and a great friend.

A few months ago me and my gf’s best friend got into a bit of beef with one another. I clicked on that her friend was controlling, and tried to stop my gf from going on holiday with me. She also would make comments when were all together, and if I reached over to give my gf a little kiss, she’d make a childish comment to make us both uncomfortable. I never said anything to her nor did I do anything, but my opinion of her changed ever since. I agreed with my girlfriend to be civil with her because after all I need to make her happy. Please note that her friend never caught wind of why I decided to dislike her, as far as she knew I was okay with her and she had no reason to think otherwise.

Her friend decided to visit my gf in university, where I am at also - this is where I met my gf. In the morning of her visiting, my gf was with me and she asked me if I wanted to go for drinks with them both later on in the evening *AFTER* she and her friend had something to eat in a restaurant. Of course I agreed, and wanted to put the beef behind me.

Fast forward to the evening... I began getting ready at 7pm, and decided to decline two other offers from my friends to go out with them as I originally agreed to going out with my gf. I get dressed and as I’m about to book an Uber my gf messaged me, stating that her friend didn’t want me to come. She said she didn’t want to “3rd wheel” and that she wanted it to be with just her and my gf. I told my gf calmly that I wasn’t going out with you all to publicly make everyone aware that we’re together, I was going to have fun with the both of them - no different to another male friend coming along meaning she wouldn’t be third wheeling. My gf again said no, and began taking her friends side amongst all of this. 

An argument followed and I made it abruptly clear that I don’t want anything to do with her friend anymore. I stated that it’s obvious she’s trying to control you, and that she has no issue with going out with her other, not so close friends and their boyfriends, but because it’s you - her best friend - she’s trying to control what YOU want to do, which was to invite myself out. 

Her friend stayed for another 3 nights after this and I never saw my gf or her friend for the duration of this. She asked on the final night if I wanted to go for a drink but I respectfully declined and stated I didn’t want to involve myself with someone toxic like that.

When she left me and my gf argued because I was telling her that she lets her get away with it, and doesn’t defend my corner to her best friend. Instead it felt like she was defending her amongst this argument.

Had dinner with my dad and step mom last week, now they aren't coming to the rehearsal or the rehearsal dinner, and deny they were ever invited. I was pretty explicit to them about the schedule, my fiancee also invited them.

I’d had suspicions and I found a USB stick which had photos of my mum and another man on. These photos have stuck with me and they hurt me to think about even now. I was too young to understand the gravity of the situation at the time so I never said anything. 

It’s been 10 years since then and my parents are currently going through a divorce because my mum has decided to go off with the guy she’s been seeing for 10 years behind my dad’s back. I always assumed that my mum had stopped cheating on my dad. I never had proof that it had stopped, and I sometimes had suspicions but I just trusted that she wouldn’t be so stupid. 

My dad’s obviously been an absolute wreck because they’d been married for nearly 30 years and were retiring together this month. I haven’t spoken to my mum for nearly 4 months now because I feel so hurt by the fact she’s chosen this man over my dad.

bzuem4	2019-06-12 17:56:10	Away_Yoghurt	AITA for sexually messaging people while still mutually interested in a girl	"So to cut a long story short I was asked out by a girl who is absolutely a lovely human being however I declined as I personally don't feel up for a relationship at the moment because I'm currently going through exams and also dealing with shitty mental health and starting new anti-depressants and because I simply was not sure if I was interested too.   


However regardless of that we have both slept with each other (on friendly terms for \*both\* of us) and in addition to that we have clearly developed feelings for each other and we often do just casually kiss when alone along with just more overtly sexual activity. I think about it it's abundantly clear that we both have developed feelings each other but we've both said to people that we are currently /not/ in a relationship.   


I personally am a fairly open person when it comes to sexuality and I have often spoken to people online and shared photos of myself / visa versa. I did this recently because someone messaged me again however at the time I didn't think much of it I now feel some strong-ass feelings of guilt. We have never agreed to not go after other people (in fact she even displayed interest in camming with people which honestly I think is neat, that said that was a short while ago and lately it feels like the level of interest has gone up even more so).   


I think the fact that I feel so guilty and disgusted after the fact makes me realise I may have more feelings for her than I thought. That said I know we're not in a relationship but I don't want to have crossed some un-drawn line. I literally just don't want to ""cheat"" on people and obviously if we do get into a relationship I will stop messaging people (or rather I would continue to have stopped)."	No A-holes here	0	0

bzuc0b	2019-06-12 17:50:06	throwaway3513513546	AITA for enabling my mentally ill friend ?	"I (30M) have a friend Bob (also 30M) who I have known since early high school. Over the years, he has developed a mental illness which was eventually diagnosed as schizophrenia. Bob's erratic behaviour resulted in him losing most of his friends, to the point where I am one of the few remaining.

Although Bob has gone through some rough periods in his life, he is now living at home with his mother and receiving treatment for his illness. However, he often expresses to me that he is bored out of his mind because his mother does not allow him to drink alcohol or smoke marijuana.

While I personally agree that Bob should not be drinking or smoking weed, I understand why he wants to do it anyway. My relationship with Bob always included drugs and alcohol, so it seems natural enough that he comes to me when he wants to indulge in these things.

The problem is that Bob can't seem to do these things responsibly. The last few times he came over, he wanted to drink alcohol. We went to the bar and Bob drank 5 pints in the time it took me to drink 2. I told him that I thought he was drinking too much but he went for it anyway.

Recently he asked me to go with him to buy marijuana legally at a dispensary. I went with him and he bought some. He asked me to keep it at my apartment for him, because his mother would throw it out if he kept it at home. I agreed. He smoked and got extremely agitated, felt sick and got picked up by his mother. I later found out he threw up in her car.

This type of thing has happened a few times. Eventually his mother called me upset, and said that while she appreciates me being a friend to her son, she wants me to stop letting him smoke weed and drink. She also reminded me that he is on medication that does not mix well with alcohol. Whats more, she asked me not tell him that she phoned me about this. I hesitantly agreed.

I wasn't sure what to do at this point. While I agree that he shouldnt be doing these things, I also feel that it isnt my place to forbid him. I realize that I am enabling his behaviour, but I think that if he does not do it with me, he will do it somewhere else in a less safe environment. Finally, I was not comfortable with concealing the conversation I had with his mother. Partially because I don't like the idea of lying to a friend, and also because it removed context for a difficult conversation I needed to have with him.

The following day I called him and explained the situation. I told him that his mom phoned me, and asked me not to tell him. I told him that I wanted to continue hanging out, but it was a problem if his mom wasn't on board. I suggested we find some middle ground, such as drinking less or not mixing substances. He was suprised, but seemed to agree. I haven't heard from him since. While its not unusual for him to go quiet for long periods of time, I find myself wondering if I did the right thing.

Am I an asshole for enabling my friend or for betraying his mother's trust ?"	Asshole	0	0

For the most part we don't have any issues between the two of us, except for what happened today. To provide some of the justification why I don't think I'm an asshole: my older brother bought a car from my uncle for $2000 and my parents paid my brother back over time so it became the car for us kids. Then my brother moved to california temporarily and left the car to just us two. During a overnight shift my sister totalled the old car so we needed a new one. My parents bought a better 2008 Civic and it was planned that my sister would pay it off because the accident was 100% her fault. She decided she didn't want to pay it off so now I pay $600 dollars a month for a car that I shouldnt even be responsible for while trying to go to school full time, but she still continues to use it as if she and I have equal rights to the car.
Today she texted me and said that she needed to be picked up from her friends house (btw her friend is her old manager where she works while the manager has teenage children. always thought that was weird). Her friend lives very far away and I did not want to drive there because Im constantly tight on money and I didnt want to pay for gas going up there.

Long story but will make it as brief as possible. Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I am about to move in with my S/O and a few  our close friends as roomies for us all to save some $$. Currently we are in the process of finding a home to move in to. This is all fine except I am seriously considering telling her that I do not want to live with her and need to know if I am being a selfish asshole in this situation. 

Backstory: 
A few months ago, at her request, I had the dreaded conversation with her about our past partners/experiences and in that conversation we each learned some less than stellar facts and mistakes about the other. I thought this was a bad idea because there are things I’d rather not know or think about, but she insisted.

On my end those things are in her past, I fell in love with her for who she is now and her current values. I’d like to believe that people can change for the better (call me naive). I managed to set her past blunders and partners aside and out of my mind to concentrate on focusing for our time together/future.

On her end, things are much different. She is fixated on those things to the point of comparing herself to those partners and she is acting upset about things that have long since happened years ago. This has been a weekly occurrence since where I am berated and insulted with some pretty negative opinions about who I am as a person. 

She suffers from depression and self esteem issues rooted in her past so I don’t want to be too hasty to jump ship, I want to put my best effort to be kind and understanding. I’ve recommended medical help such as a therapist but haven’t been successful. 

This being said, the weekly (oftentimes daily) onslaught of insults and breakdowns from her have me wanting to tell her that I do not want to live under the same roof as her. My reasoning is this:

We can either focus on the positives of our relationship, lives and proceed to continue growing together - and living together

Or we can focus on the negatives, partners and mistakes of our past. Let the relationship become toxic until one of us walks away. - not living together

Is it an asshole move to give her that choice for her to pick what she wants? She is really keen on living with me but I’m starting to be less so due to the months of her doing this?

One of the salesmen says he’ll have a look into it for us. It ended up being an overdue bill which was a fault on their end because they double billed us by mistake.

The salesman says he will unrestrict our account for us, but he wants to talk to us about new phones and phone plans. I tell him I’m not interested but he just keeps trying to sell us stuff. He goes on for about 20 minutes, I must have said NO to him around 50 times. Every time I say NO I get more frustrated and angry, I’m just there to get my phone fixed from their stuff up. 

It gets to a point where I’m yelling ‘JUST FIX MY PHONE’ but it’s like he can’t hear me. That’s when another employee turns up and just starts yelling at me for yelling at him.

I apologise and say all I want is my phone fixed. My wife’s crying at this point. Pleading for them to fix our phones aswell. After all that this guy continues to try to sell us stuff and refuses to unrestrict our phones. I’m almost crying at this point aswell. I just get up and leave, the salesmen doesn’t say anything. 

When I get to the front of the store I just say as loud as I can ‘YOURE A SCUMBAG’ 
We ended going to another store and they said they can’t even unrestrict services from a store so I think he was lying the whole time aswell. We had to call customer service.

bzu5kk	2019-06-12 17:35:43		WIBTA If she is possibly anorexic?	I have been talking to this girl for a month or so now, and she has been showing some glaringly scary signs at me. For example, she will say that she wants to not eat and that she likes the feeling of being exhausted. She says it's like a challenge to her. She has said this constantly and I'm scared she might be anorexic. She doesn't have the body of an anorexic person, but she keeps on saying how she doesn't like to eat and how she wants to throw up. I've been trying to help her by telling her to eat and shit like that, but she won't listen to me. I've even told her that I'm not an expert, but maybe she should go see one just to be sure. Am I the Asshole for pressuring her into eating and making her feel bad for not eating though.	Not the A-hole	1	0
bzu5kc	2019-06-12 17:35:42	AwkBallOfSelfDoubt	AITA for setting a coworker up to fail?	"Strong title but hear me about.

Basically, I work for a small company that does a lot of in-house lunches as a perk of employment. And this is not an easy group to cater for, I'll tell you right now. Gluten allergies, vegan, etc abound. 

But I've got it down to a science. And I do 95% of the office catering. A coworker is supposed to do the other 5%, but she genuinely sucks at it. Like hilariously bad, so the past couple of times I've stepped in to order, but then she insisted I do the set up and cleaning (which is part of arranging the lunch but not part of our deal). 

So this week, I didn't help her with any of it. And I made it very clear I wouldn't beyond giving her the email of one of my contacts who gave her plenty of advice. She heeded none of it. 

And obviously, everyone in the office complained that the lunch wasn't to their standards, which might have made then the assholes except, guys, it was really bad . Sauteed vegetables, a noodle dish, and rice for half of the head count. That's it. Because my coworker had mouth surgery, and that's all she can eat.

So after her verbal dressing down (indirectly or directly) from everyone in the office, she's been pretty cold to me, finally saying that I was an asshole for not helping her more because I knew what I was doing, and she didn't. And like, I guess I could have to her that there's more out there like tofu for the vegetarians. But in my mind, she's proven she won't just accept an inch, so why should I bother offering that.

But maybe I was wrong. Because I remember there being a steep learning curve when I started. So I guess, Reddit, am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I aim to be everyone's friend and do whatever I can to not upset anyone. This comes from having mild to moderate anxiety when I feel like my actions could cause a rift with someone. However, over the last few weeks, my coworker has really been rubbing me the wrong way.

I've been at my job for well over two years and I've worked with this coworker for just as long. I get along well with everyone, barring one person who left in January and no longer works at our location. That being said, this coworker and I developed a close friendship, despite her being 20 years my senior (like that makes a difference). She doesn't have much of a filter, and likes to talk about everything going on in her life. I wasn't bothered by this, as her and I shared a sense of compassion and a sense of humour.

Lately though, things have been really taking a turn for her. She got divorced earlier this year, her daughter just went through a painful time after having an abortion, and her ex husband treats her like absolute garbage. She has also been having some health issues that I'm not going to go into. She is now in a new relationship which is lovely, but I feel like she is trying to squeeze as much out of same as possible. She has been leaving work halfway through her shifts and not coming back, has been calling in sick at least once a week only to post pictures online while out with her new man, and just this weekend, refused to call in when she did not show up all weekend. How she wasn't fired, I don't know. I guess it's because our manager just left on maternity 12 month maternity leave and her replacement is still learning the ropes.

To be honest, I've lost all sympathy for her. My compassion is wearing thin. I'm sick of hearing her complain about being broke every day and then either not finishing or not showing up for her shifts. She's on her phone constantly at work, and she's becoming more and more of a hypocrite every day. Just recently, she's started pulling me aside to trash talk some other coworkers claiming they trash talk her all the time. The only trash talking I'm hearing is coming from her, so I'll believe it when I see it.

I'm not concerned for her anymore, but I'm worried about her two girls and pets at home. Her health is not my concern anymore. She's not taking care of herself, so that's on her. I want to call her out for her antics and behaviour on and off (when she's supposed to be on) shift. It's annoying everyone there, but I don't want to lose her friendship.

Would I be the asshole if I called her out?

&#x200B;

Edit: Since you guys seem confused as to what I mean by call out, I mean giving her some tough love. I would never say anything out of malice, but she doesn't seem to understand that what she's doing is wrong. Even with talking to from managers.

Edit 2: I don't want to come across negative or resentful about her. I did my best to have her back when things started going downhill months ago, but I can't be her cheerleader when she doesn't seem to want to do anything to help herself."	Not enough info	0	0

I stand at the very side of the gym with my towel and bottle on a window ledge to be out of the way and clearly not using any machines. It's a few feet from the machine I'm wanting to use. I'm facing the general direction but I'm not even looking, I'm looking down at my phone in my own world. I don't even mind if another person uses it after the current user. I'm in-between having a break and waiting. Head down, haven't looked up for the whole time when the guy comes over and casually asks: 

> Are you waiting for the machine? 

It's a very common question in the gym. I presume he's being polite so I reply ""Yes"" instead of telling him that i'm just chilling and not really waiting. He then says politely 

> Do mind waiting over there or something? I can't concentrate 

I understand where he's coming from. I'm not the type to hover, I simply use something else whilst I wait normally. I reply ""Oh don't worry, I'm just chilling, i'm not actually waiting for you. You don't have to worry about me"" 

That's where the potential asshole part of the story ends. I HATE feeling like I've done something bad. It genuinely brings me down the whole day. After that he explained himself a bit more and said something like 

> I just hate when someone's breathing down your neck you know? 

I replied ""Oh I completely understand you, I hate that too."" blah blah. I also made sure to not immediately use the machine when he was finished. We were both smiling on the last exchange and I hope that he understood my pov. He was foreign so I'm hoping there was no miscommunication. I just hate feeling like I've upset someone when I didn't intend to. 

Side note: I thought ""this a public place anyway. You can't tell me to do something"" but I understood where he was coming from so that was only a reserved thought if the situation escalated slightly. Thanks."		1	0

My girlfriend and I have been dating for around a year at this point. Recently we decided to move in together and I’m super excited about it. However, recently I’ve learned a lot that makes me think my girlfriend is almost embarrassed of me, and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or justified.

We recently hung out with her best friends from where she’s from and they started asking about her move coming up. I was excited to hear what she had to tell them. In the few minutes that she was talking it was very apparent that they had no idea that the apartment she was moving into would be for us. She hadn’t told her best friends that we were moving in together, but rather moving in solo. A little strange but she then told me she didn’t want it getting out to her coworkers. Weird but okay. 

Another instance was that we went to the park and her coworker was there. This is a person that she spends every day with and considers a close friend. She knows his whole family and has met them on multiple occasions. I even met them before. We saw him at the park and he said he didn’t even know my name. Weird considering we had met before, but also strange that he didn’t even know my name considering that my GF works next to him every day and they talk about their families.

Another instance was that a coworker asked her out on a date. Harmless because she obviously said no, but she told me she didn’t even mention me. She just basically said she didn’t want to go out with him and why did he think he even had a shot with her. I’m not one to like when anyone brings out the “I have a GF/BF” card too quickly, but in cases where someone blatantly asks you out, wouldn’t a “I have a SO, no thanks!” Be appropriate?

It just seems to me like she’s embarrassed to bring me up, and I’m not really sure why. I don’t know if I’m competent overreacting, so WIBTA if I confront her about this?"		1	0

&#x200B;

I have a mug collection I've been growing for several years. I get them from weird stores, storage units I buy in auction, garage sales, I even go paint mugs at the pottery place sometimes. Basically, I like mugs. We actually had to move all my mugs to their own cabinet because the collection is growing at a good rate (my friends and family also buy me mugs.) I know it's a silly thing to collect, but whatever, we're all silly in our own ways. 

&#x200B;

Back in January my cousin came to live with my fiance and I while she got back on her feet and saved up to go back home. (We live across the country from all our family, and her troubles and clean up of such took her our way. So when she expressed distress about having a hard time saving up, we invited her in, no money wanted from her. Just want her to flourish.) In the time she's been here she's ruined 3 mugs, one of which was my favorite travel mug, and a limited edition. That one really bummed me out. This morning while unloading the dishwasher, I pulled out a thermal mug that my friends mother gave me before I moved away. It had been ruined. I was talking to my friend about it and said I might just go get some cheap ones from Goodwill and put the ones I like away. I love my cousin, but my mugs have also gone missing her room, and she'll let milk mold in them. My friend told me that was kind of an asshole move because I told my cousin what's mine is hers when she moved in, and now I'm reneging over something as dumb as mugs. 

&#x200B;

I feel like she's right on a certain level, and I don't want to be an asshole. Part of why I love my mug collection is because we use them when I have friends over, and it's a good way to know which is your drink. I also don't mind the handwashing of them afterwards. But in the same breath, I've asked her to please be more mindful. I don't want my collection to slowly dwindle because of someone else being careless. Which also makes me feel like an asshole but not one at the same time for trying to set boundaries.

bzts94	2019-06-12 17:05:59	jenndro	AITA for not wanting to go my cousin's wedding?	"Hi everyone, I hope I explain my story right, I'm the worst at explaining things, but here goes..

Hi, my family is pretty small, all I really have is my family (2 sisters/both parents) and my 3 cousins and their parents. We're all like two years apart from each other, or around the same age. We aren't close as we used to be with our cousins when we were younger, except our oldest cousin (Say her name is Annie). I only see them maybe 6 times a year, we do celebrate holidays/birthdays together. So Annie (now 26), is getting married in September, in Las Vegas. (We all live in California) I seriously don't really know anything about her, she stayed with us for 1 month in summer, back when I was in 7th grade. (I'm 23 now.) That's the most time I've ever spent with her my whole life. She's always been more into hanging out with her friends, so we've actually never hung out. We've hung out more her two younger brothers. Whenever there were birthday parties, she always invited her friends and hung out with them, never with us. I think Annie and I have been the ""closest"" since my older two sisters are very tomboy'ish and weren't into girly things like Annie was. So the few times we talked, it was usually about boys, makeup, and fashion, whatever girly things. So Annie moved out at 18, and was gone from my aunt's house for years. She also never really reached out to us or talked to us, we would only see her like a few times a year for holidays. She recently got a house and invited us for Christmas at her house last year. And like always, she had friends (they were long-time family friends, so we at least knew them) over and giving them the most attention. She was treating us very kindly though, making sure we were eating and drinking. But most of her jokes and conversations were directed to the friends. She also invited me in February(just me, not my sisters) along with her mom to go with her to bachelorette party in June, it happened last week. I did not go, because around March she texted me saying something about if I wasn't okay with going since her mom still hasn't gotten the days off, or something, I just had this weird feeling she didn't want me to go, I didn't fight it. So I venmo'd her some money and said ""Shots on me, have fun!"" and she totally ignored it. It may have been cause her other friends were venmo'ing her, so maybe she missed it. Also whenever I comment (like a comment on a selfie that she looks great) on anything on her social media, she always ignores it. Maybe I'm just annoying though. So I don't know if I should waste money on a plane tickets/hotel for her wedding in September. But she's also the only family I kind of have and I don't want to be a jerk.. so AITA for even thinking about not going, everyone in my family is going.

It's worth mentioning that my mom has a history of being really verbally abusive, and I've been going to therapy for a while because if it. It's for the most part gotten getter between us but I still feel a bit of tension from it. For a long time I've developed a learned helplessness from her words, and it doesn't help that whenever I talk about going somewhere now she jumps to offer rides. Like even though I'm fine and I've been fine taking public it feels like she still doesn't accept or trust that I can be responsible enough to do things on my own.

For example if my family has plans mom usually starts getting freaked out about giving me a ride and making sure it's all timed properly. 

*""To get there at 5 I have to be done with my hair appointment at 4 then I can run back to the house- oh, but that'll take a while. I know! I can have your sister drive me to the appointment in my car, then she can pick you up after work and pick me up too!""*

Ect. ect. ect. It gets really overly complicated.

Thing is I can just take public transit and everyone can deal with themselves, but as soon as I suggest it she treats it like it's simply not an option. 

Mom: ""The trolley doesn't got that far.""
Me: ""I know, but the bus does.""
Mom: ""but that won't work! you can dirty your outfit.""
Me: ""I've never once ruined an outfit on the bus. It's not as dirty as you think.""
Mom: ""You never know though!""

We'll go back and forth and she shoots down anything I say. When I do put my foot down and tell her I'm doing it my way she acts really hurt.

While the thighs actually looked like hers the hand was definetly different to hers but I didn't pay attention to that when I sent the message, I only noticed later.

&#x200B;

So, she got pissed off because I appreciated someone else's body and even more because I saw her body many times and (according to her) I'm supposed to recognize her body and in particular her legs among others. 

I didn't agree with her idea and to prove my point I sent her some pictures of men legs similar to mine (particulars between the knee and the ankle) so she had to figure out which one was mine, she failed the test and said the test was rigged because I didn't show enough details.

bztlal	2019-06-12 16:50:20	a00107987	WIBTA if I tell my best friend not to get a dog?	"  

For context, I should start by giving a little background information. T has been my best friend for the last 20 years, at this point, we're more like sisters than we are friends. T has had a pretty hard life as she struggled with anorexia, bulimia, depression and PTSD following her mom's death.

&#x200B;

In 2017, my boyfriend and I shared a townhouse with T & D, their cat and their 2 bunnies. 6 months after we moved in together, T & D split. After their split, T told me that she had to give away her two bunnies and then a few months later her cat passed away unexpectedly. It was a really hard time for her. Eventually her and D managed to patch things up and within the following months of reconciling, T and D adopted a new cat, moved, and shortly there after she became pregnant. 

&#x200B;

Now lets fast forward to this Saturday evening that just passed while we were at T’s house. It had been no secret that T was struggling with postpartum depression, we had talked about it since the birth of my nephew, but she brought it up while I was over. We sat and talked about it for awhile when she said something about how the time her and D split, was the worst her depression had ever been. I made a comment along the lines of ""Well, it doesn't help that you had to get rid of the bunnies and your cat passed away too"" in which she replied ""Yeah - about that"". T then went on to explain that her depression had gotten so bad at one point that she completely neglected the rabbits, causing them to die from starvation and/or dehydration. She said she felt so bad and was so embarrassed that she lied to me about rehoming them. She said that she also knew her cat was dying but that she couldn't bring herself to admit it and was hoping that she would just die without anyone noticing. I was shocked to say the least but told her that I understood where she was coming from. Later that evening, however, T went on to say that she wishes she never got their newest cat because she's overwhelmed with taking care of the baby. No more than a few minutes later she overhears D and my boyfriend talking about dogs. T chimes in and says that she wants a dog. I tell her that it's a lot more work than she realizes and that having a baby, a cat and a dog would too much for her, and she simply tells me that she's not worried about that because she can manage – contradicting herself from earlier.  

&#x200B;

So that brings me to ask, WIBTA if I tell her not to get a dog? She's been talking about it since we went over and is very serious about it. She says it'll be a form of therapy for her, however, judging from her track record with previous pets and her unwillingness to seek professional help for her mental health, I don't it'll help her one bit. My boyfriend agrees with me but thinks that if I say anything I'll hurt her feelings as she's a very sensitive person. I want to give her a reality check but I'm scared that if I do, I'll end up being a giant asshole."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Its been about a week, and the guy hasn't hit me up for money, never provided information on how to get him money when he sent the ticket to me. I even reached out to him to see if I could snag another ticket for a friend, but he just forwarded my email to his account rep.  


So this may look bad on my cousin because I haven't paid yet. (Also my cousin is kind of a doucher, so I am not as worried about his work relationships... long backstory) BUT it shouldn't be my job to remind people that I need to pay them back.

bztg3n	2019-06-12 16:39:02	dressinbrass	WIBTA if I post family photos from an event that shows my sister as she actually looks?	"Background: My sister and I aren't close and my family and I are slightly estranged (although more from my side than theirs). She's active on social media, especially Twitter, but I've noticed recently she only posts photos of herself that are more than 5 years old. That includes photos of me with her (ie, on my birthday). She also aggressively untags photos on Facebook she may appear in.

We saw her over the weekend for a birthday for one of my kids and she looks to have gained a significant amount of weight in the last two years. I love taking photos at family gatherings and my mom is requesting I post all the ones that aren't of my kid.

My wife and I are debating if I should post the few photos with her in them, knowing how Facebook's auto-tagging works, etc. Given her careful curation of photos and appearances on FB, Twitter and IG, I can tell she's struggling with self-image, so I feel bad (as much as I don't get along with her).

EDIT: I don't want to post them, my mom and dad are requesting I post all the photos."	No A-holes here	0	0
bztfxv	2019-06-12 16:38:39	hermanswife	AITA for trying to accommodate my mentally ill sister at the expense of my family? Or did I do the best I could in a very challenging situation?	"Using a throwaway account because it's probably safer after all that went down. 

My sister is extremely mentally ill, but at least according to a family therapist that we've gone to as adults, she is not so mentally ill as to not know what she's doing and in my opinion she is a massive spoiled brat and attention seeker. She claims to be unable to function on her own and through our mom's guilt we have basically ""passed her around"" from house to house for the last 7 years. For reference my sister is 42, I am 28 and there are 3 adult kids between us. Sister is oldest, I am the youngest. I also have a 6 year old and a 3 year and am happily married. 

It was my ""turn"" to take my sister in after she was forcibly ejected from her apartment for essentially being a hoarder and causing extreme health issues for her neighbors. So I sat down with the therapist, my mom and my sister and explained that she could live with us until she got things worked out with public assistance but there would be ground rules about her cleanliness, her food consumption and her tone and volume of voice. 

Well it lasted exactly one day. I went to Trader Joes the first day she was here,  half for our family and half for her. She managed to eat about $150 worth of groceries in the first day. She also basically left a trail of garbage between the kitchen pantry and her room (I mean this literally, for example she would peel the wrapper off a peanut butter cup while walking and leave it on the floor). My husband absolutely came unglued at her and screamed in her room that either she ""picked her fucking shit up or she had to go."" At that time I didn't appreciate the way my husband was talking to her in ""her"" space and he and I got in a huge fight over it. 

Things didn't get any better and I actually think my sister was using my defense of her to ""show my husband"" how she could get away with whatever she wanted because she went into my daughters room and got out all her toys and ""played"" with them and refused to clean up the mess. This weekend I finally had enough and we took her (basically kicking and screaming) to a hotel where we paid for a week (in cash) for her to get out of our house. 

My husband is so furious at me because not only do we have a disaster of a mess (probably to include pee and poop) in our guest bedroom but we are out about $600 to get her out of our house.

In my defense, I knew my sister would be bad when I invited her to stay with us but I didn't know it would be ""that bad"" that fast. Was I the asshole for allowing her to stay and do I need to make it up to my husband or does he need to understand that while my sister is a ""challenge"" she is family and I did what I thought was the right thing?

any help with judgement would be greatly appreciated?"	Asshole	0	0
bztbyt	2019-06-12 16:30:09	username9373	AITA For getting mad at a friend who mocked me for having kept a stuffed animal he gave me years ago?	"I own a stuffed animal of a character I really like that was given to me by my best friend Charlie(fake name) a few years ago that I really cherish. I'm kinda embarrassed by it cause I'm usually more of a tomboy, but it's really special to me cause it was given to me by my closest friend and it holds a lot of sentimental value. Nowadays I find a lot comfort in cuddling with it at night. Because of work, college, and conflicting schedules I don't have as much time to spend with friends as before, and at night I feel really lonely sometimes and that stupid doll honestly really just makes me feel better.

The other night though I accidentally left it lying on my bed while hanging out with Charlie. When he noticed it, and remembered he'd given it to me he was really surprised to find out that I had kept it all this time. It was really embarrassing, but I told him how I slept with it most nights cause its sentimental and makes me feel less lonely since we haven't spent much time together recently. He's my best friend, and for a while I've secretly wanted to ask him out, so I didn't want to lie to him about how special it was to me.

Of course he had to think it was hilarious. He laughed his ass off, and poked fun at me a ton for it. We're used to making really crude or dark jokes with each other, so this was pretty lighthearted, but it really stung to be made fun of for this. I tried to brush it off, but he just kept going and then he casually said something like ""its wasn't a big deal or anything, I was getting rid of it anyway"", and I felt like I wanted to cry, but instead I just acted really angry and forced him to leave. Before I closed the door on him I even threw the stuffed animal at him out of anger.

After having some time to cool down though, I've realized that I probably overreacted. I really cherished this gift he gave me, and the way he talked about it like it was worthless made me so sad and upset. However the way I acted just felt really childish and oversensitive. I feel like maybe I'm at fault for projecting meaning onto this toy that clearly wasn't there. I'm scared I may have screwed over our relationship for having acted so angrily.

bztb5v	2019-06-12 16:28:23		AITA for being upset that my parents don’t want to see me?	"Military wife here.  I know, we’re the worst. 

We’ve been away from home for almost 5.5 years now. 3 of those years we lived overseas. I was happy to travel to my family so they could meet my first born and spend time with everyone. I did it twice. 18 hours in a plane alone with a newborn and again when he was 1.5. 

We’ve been stateside for the last 2 years and change and my parents haven’t been to visit.  I’ve always considered us very close and so I’ve always done whatever I can to see them. Any extra money we have goes to plane tickets home and I’ve flown home at least once a year since we moved away. The last flight was by myself with now two small children, a toddler and a newborn. It was hell and I’ve let them know that it’s just too much for me alone and I won’t be able to visit again until we can afford to come as a family of four. 

They’ve taken two international trips the last two years. They had an amazing time and I’ve been so happy for them, truly. I’m so glad they have had those experiences. Fast forward to about 3 days ago. My parents have been home from their latest trip for about 3 weeks.  I find out on Facebook of all places that they have booked yet another international trip for 2020. No one told me and no one said they’d be visiting us at all.  I was pretty hurt by this.  I fully expected just ONE visit to us in our 3 years here and it’s pretty clear to me at this point that we’re just not on the list of priorities.  I brought this up to my parents in a calm way. I explained that I was upset and feeling pretty crappy about it all and that they should know that I will not be taking another trip for at least another year. My dad said this was fine by them and told me I was selfish and my mom just ignored me for the last 3 days, which is not new for her.  Their complete lack of consideration to how I might feel about this is baffling and it’s like they think I’m crazy for being upset.  My mother told me finally that “I chose to marry someone in the military” and so it’s essentially my own fault.  All I want is just one week of them visiting together to see me and my kids and my husband and see the life we’ve built here. 

My husbands parents have visited us multiple times since we’ve lived here, for the record.  My sister visited me recently which was amazing.  

Am I the asshole for being offended that my parents would quite literally rather be anywhere in the world except visiting us?"		1	0

bztamy	2019-06-12 16:27:15	fgthrowaway7	AITA for not caring that my friends use homophobic slurs	"TLDR: I'm gay; friends jokingly call me a f\*g but I give as good as I get; BF saw a text referring to me as a f\*g and freaked out, telling me I enable homophobia

I (22M) have been in a relationship (my first proper relationship) with 'BF' (20M) for about 5 months now. Things have been going great, and he's pretty much my perfect guy aside from maybe being not as laid-back as I'd ideally prefer. But still, he's funny, compassionate, attractive, smart, all that jazz.

Virtually all my best friends are straight, with the ones I refer to in this post being male, 22-23 years old. 4 of us have been friends for \~10 years, & they're really the best sort of friends to have but we jokingly rip into each other a lot. For example, one is from the country and cops jokes about being inbred, poor, unsophisticated, etc. As for me, I cop a lot of gay jokes and get referred to as a f\*g. We have a fb groupchat we use for memes & plans, etc.

A few days ago I was with BF watching TV when my phone received messages from the groupchat, and as you'd expect BF glanced down at my phone homescreen to see a notification saying '@OP hey f\*g you free for next weekend'.

Well, he FLIPPED OUT. Started asking why tf I'm friends with the guy who said it, called him a homophobe, and said that no straight person should ever say it.

I told him I don't care because I give as good as I get, & I know they're not homophobic, especially considering how supportive they each were when I was coming out.

BF then turns on me and says I'm enabling their homophobic slurs. He then goes on a tangent about how I try too hard to be laid-back and difficult to offend because I'm trying to avoid being a stereotypical gay man (wtf?) and suggests I have internalised homophobia because I'm okay with being called a f\*g. BF then mentions that he was bullied in high school by being called a f\*g (I didn't know that happened to him) and so doesn't have the privilege I have in that I don't associate the word with bad experiences.

After that argument it was quite awkward. He asked me to tell them not to say it anymore regardless of whether or not anyone can hear/see it, and I muttered maybe. He called me an asshole (there it is) and left after about 5-10 minutes of silence. We've talked since but it's been stiff.

I've mentioned to my friends that BF saw it and to be more careful, and they seemed to understand. Aside from that homescreen leak we only use these slurs around each other knowing that no one takes it personally. I'm not going to tell them to stop saying it altogether - it would feel unnatural/forced if they stopped saying it.

IMO there's 0 tangible harm behind slurs that are used endearingly in private spaces, & I don't see why I should make my friends stop calling me something I interpret somewhat endearingly. I will, however, make sure no one else can hear/see it in future.

bzt9mi	2019-06-12 16:24:55	Toszt	WIBTA if I don't take care of my parents when they get old, even if they really need it?	"I wanted to know if I would be an asshole for not helping my parents when they get old. I don't me just being their caretaker or anything. I mean refusing to help AT ALL, eg: no paying for a home, no living with me, no helping with transportation/housing/money. 

My parents were extremely physically/mentally/emotionally abusive to me as a child. It was on a ""they would go to jail"" level. They also neglected to provide me with many of the basic needs in my childhood and not because they didn't have the means. My mother had a a significant sum of money from an inheritance. It wasn't a lot but there were times it would have helped. She wouldn't touch it though saying it should be saved as a college fund.

When I left to get an education, they disowned me and I struggled ALOT on my own. I'm not going into detail because that's not the point but they did nothing and abandoned me when I needed them.

Despite how grim my situation looked at time, with much hardship and support from wonderful people in my life I finished my schooling and started a very successful career. I will be far more well off than my parents ever were.

Right now nothing has seem to indicate my parents have any qualms about what they did to our relationship. They even went on an expensive vacation during my graduation ceremony using the ""college fund"". I know for sure that won't last and I can definitely see my mother changing her tune once my dad gets too old to work. That small savings won't last long and neither of them have anything set up for retirement. 

It's was very much expected culturally that I as their daughter should provide for them since they provided for me as a child. They always reminded me as a child that I owed them for raising me and that family comes above all else.

The way I see it, they are legally required to provide for me until 18 years of age and they failed to do that, to a standard that would have gotten them jailed. However, I'm not obligated to provide for them, they are adults.

Am I being selfish? I feel like many people have the sentiment that you should forgive and forget when it comes to your family. But I feel they never treated me like family to begin with and I have to live with the damage they did to me as a child so I shouldn't owe them anything."	Not the A-hole	0	0

About 2 months in he got diagnosed with an illness that makes him tired all the time. It will get better, but it might take months. I know it’s hard for him and he feels like a burden to his employer. He just sits at home and watches sports, because he cannot concentrate on anything else. He visited my place once but became so exhausted we agreed we should just stick to his place for now.

I always feel like this is touchy area for most people and didn't want to comment until I saw all of the pseudoscience-fake news worthy- fatlogicy comments she was getting. Not sure if relevant, but this friend isn't just overweight, she is rather obese to the point where it's starting to affect her health. 

People were commenting a range of bad advice pieces ranging from taking diet pills, trying juicing, try""intuitive eating"", or simply saying things like it's your genetics that determine if you are fat or thin, or if you lose weight now you'll gain back even more in a few years. There was even one person who commented on my friend's status about how she loves being a bigger girl, loves her big boobs and butt and advised this friend to not be a gross stick figure, and that you can still be healthy and obese. Reading through her comments on that post I didn't see one person mention anything like try cutting out sodas, junk food, sweets, start logging your meals, try getting 10k steps a day everyday, eat more fruits & veggies and eat less breads, pastas & red meats or anything that would actually work.

Since I've been overweight before, I managed to lose ~65 lbs about 5 years from basically using CICO. FWIW I talked to my doctor about what I was doing at the time and they said the amount of food I was eating was perfectly fine, I basically started to eat way more veggies than usual since they are so low in calories and are filling. I was thinking about sending her some helpful resources that I used - like body fat and bmi calculators (yeah reddit i know you hate bmi, but generally speaking it's a good base line to determine what a goal weight range for your height/age/sex is and once you get close to that goal moving to a body fat calculator is a better measurement. As long as you aren't under 4 ft or over 7ft or a body builder it's an okay starting point.), my fitness pal, and other health resources on how to steadily lose weight and slowly introduce exercise to your routine. 

So, should I try to comment on her current status with some helpful resources that helped me? Or would that make me TA? 

To not be TA should I just not say anything at all and hope she gets better info from her doctor next time she goes to see him?

I'm also not super close to this friend anymore, she moved to a different state about 2.5 years ago. We use to spend a lot of time together before she moved, but at this point we only occasionally comment on each other's posts every now and then."	No A-holes here	0	0

bzt84j	2019-06-12 16:21:27		AITA FOR CUTTING OUT MY BESTFRIEND???	"Hey everybody, Im really stressed out about a certain event and I really need some help. 

A few months ago I attempted to take my own life (don't worry I am a lot better) and went through extensive rehab and treatment. However during this time I was unstable emotionally and lost a lot of friends. Most importantly I lost my friends from school, and they spread many rumors about me and tried to turn groups of people away from me. From this I developed abandonment issues, and I am still treating them. So from this I learned to really cherish the friends I have and to be loyal. Of course time passed and I got a lot better so everyone is on okish terms at the moments. 

&#x200B;

These were my friends from school, but this story takes a turn at my home friends. I have a really good group of friends from people from my home. There was this one girl lets call her S who was my best friend. However she stopped texting me so often and we naturally drifted apart. She has her own mental problems, but they never got to the caliber in which mine did. However one of our close mutuals friends in our group contracted cancer and we all became closer through the event. 

&#x200B;

I tried to talk to her more, even though I was really hurt that she completely kind of stopped talking to me at the beginning of the year. We talked for a little bit but one day I asked her to hang out and she didn't respond. I got really paranoid because she was active on other group chats and snapchat so I thought she was avoiding me . I texted her more and no responce. Then i texted her another day with no responce. Eventually I got annoyed and called her out and she barely responded. 

&#x200B;

Anyhow one day I was with all my friends (minus S) and we were hanging out with my friend with cancer. Remember that I have really bad abandonment issues. My friend with cancer said that S wanted everyone to stop being and my friend and cut me out. In turn I got really angry and rallied everyone against her. Now we cut her out of group chats and everything else. She got scared and texted all of us, and we barely responded until we called her out. In turn she said that I was just a bad person and hated talking to me. This is also a person who knew my deepest darkest secrets. Eventually she tried to apologies,  but she didn't really apologies to me and just tried too justify her actions. So we cut her out for good. 

&#x200B;

Anyway I feel like I was treated the same way when I had a mental illness and feel really bad for cutting her out. So am I the asshole?"		1	0
bzt7iu	2019-06-12 16:20:06	Maybe_Dont	WIBTA for telling someone I don’t want them to be one of my bridesmaids anymore	"So my bridesmaid, we’ll call her birdie, was one of my best friends in high school, and while we’ve moved apart a little in college (we both attend different schools) I really want her to be a part of my wedding. She had my back in high school, and while she wasn’t always the best person she always had my back. 

So, just about all of my bridesmaids and I are all in college, so money is expectedly tight. Originally, I was going to just pick a color and let them have their pick of any dress they wanted. After all, I’m not exactly a picky person. I changed my mind, however, when I went shopping with my maid of honor and saw how random dresses could look really tacky. 

I tried really hard to find a few options that look good both together and on a variety of body types. I ended up settling for two dresses that were $200 each, but I thought looked really good together. Mind you, we were at David’s Bridal, so the dresses weren’t going to be super expensive, and they have a year to buy their dresses as well. I’m sure there would be a sale on them eventually. 

Anyways, my bridesmaid, who I’m going to call birdie, messaged me shortly after I had told all of them about which dresses to get specifically, and told me that she felt that 200 was a lot to spend on a dress. She continued to say that she would prefer it if I just let her shop through the clearance section to find a dress that worked for her. I offered to help her pay for it, since I’ve got a job for the summer, and I could make enough in less than a week, but she won’t take my offer, and insists that I should let her find a cheaper dress.

It’s gotten to the point where I’m really irritated with her, since I’m set on these dresses, and I’m not known for changing my mind a lot. If I’m paying for her dress then there shouldn’t be a problem, anyways. I’m really reconsidering my offer to pay, if she’s going to be so difficult about it, let alone having her in my wedding party.

bzt5tf	2019-06-12 16:15:56	DownsDog	AITA for hogging mining rocks in Runescape?	"So I've (24M) been playing OSRS Mobile lately and have been trying to get my mining level to 50. I'm grinding out iron ore in the Fally mines because all the mining guides say powerleveling iron is the fastest way to level. The spot I use to mine has two iron nodes side by side,  which is nice because I don't have to wait for the ore to refresh to start mining again as I can just use both.

One thing I like doing that I admit is an asshole thing to do is jump worlds until I find other people using the same spot, and start ""stealing"" their iron because my mining level is higher and I can mine the ores faster than they can, flexing my mining level. I'll swing at the same rock as they start swinging and beat them 90% of the time. Most times they just switch worlds or walk away to an inferior iron spot but sometimes they say something either mean or nice, and depending on what they say I'll react differently. If they're nice and ask to share I always let them, but if they're mean and tell me to fuck off, I don't. I think it's really funny, and it's these kind of interactions that I believe are the foundation of Runescape, and these arguments take me back to my childhood of playing Runescape and talking to people.

But today I wasn't doing that. I logged on and was the only person at the iron spot. After a couple minutes, another person walks up and doesn't say anything, and tries mining the iron. Of course he can't because I'm a higher level, so he stops for a second then says, ""dick"". I replied ""I was here first guy"", and then he says ""another internet fuktard"". So I wasn't planning on sharing unless he asked but now it's for sure not gonna happen. I turned to my girlfriend who was sitting beside me as this was happening and mid-laugh said ""whenever he starts mining I swing at the same rock and take it"" and she told me I was being mean. After another minute he gets the troll random event and I say ""was that ur mom lol"" and he runs away. As he's leaving I say ""yeah walk away"" so he turns around and stands by me for about a minute then says ""reported"".

My girlfriend thinks I was totally being an asshole and wanted me to apologize to this person. I tried explaining that I was there first, didn't steal this guy's rocks, and this guy was being rude first but she still thinks I'm an asshole. Later I asked my friends what they thought and they think I was being an asshole too.

My mum and dad were both sick offer doing this so they just didn’t invite her, I was sick of it too it seems quite disrespectful to not say your cancelling or being a dick about cancelling.

After realising she was not invited she went on a massive rant on Instagram and Facebook about being betrayed by family etc. and how in our culture family should stick together (which I don’t even get we’re American lmao how is that part of our culture) which annoyed a lot of our family but nobody said anything.

This was until said aunt wished my brother ex girlfriend a happy birthday on Facebook which seems a bit odd but it’s even worse that my brother and said ex had a horrible break up (which the aunt is well aware of) and she’s basically been stalking him for months and making his life hell but that’s another story. So then people were texting my brother saying why was your aunt wishing said ex happy birthday and it ended up really annoying him.

I was annoyed at this and I said to my dad he should talk to her so he tried to talk it out like adults but she wasn’t having it and just cursed at him down the phone and hung up.

This is less of a situation where I’ve really done anything because I wasn’t the one calling anyone, I more want to know who is in the wrong and who’s in the right. I can see that not inviting her might have been an oversight but I also feel her reaction was unjustified.

So my (20m) girlfriend (19f) and I have been together for almost a year. We used to be long distance (about 3 hours) but she recently moved in with myself and my friend. A little backstory, I love to swing dance. Sounds unrelated, but it plays a big role in the story. My girlfriend, who I’ll refer to as Claire (not real name), and I get along great except for this one incident. Over the past couple days I have been talking to an old friend who I’ve known since I was little as we were in children’s theater together. She loves to swing dance, so I figured I’d ask if she’d ever be down to go. I have asked Claire many times, and she always says no, so I figured I’d try and find a partner elsewhere. So, this morning before I went to work I was looking at my messages. Claire notices I’m hiding my phone (she doesn’t like me texting even my friends who are girls) and sees who I’ve been talking to. She proceeds to message this girl and ask her if I’ve been cheating. I send her screenshots of our messages, and so does my friend. She also sent Claire a screenshot of our text conversation. The conversations were completely platonic, and even though I did tell my friend she looked pretty on her Instagram story, that’s just something I say to be nice. Now, Claire has accused me of cheating emotionally and I have no idea what to do. AITA?

Edit 1: okay I understand I may have fucked up by not asking her first. However in my defense, she wouldn’t have been happy with me asking, considering she gets angry when I get a Snapchat from another girl."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

In my city, there is a large industrial area with a lot of distribution warehouses, welding jobs, freight transportation, etc. I went right before rush hour, and by the time I was heading home rush hour was in full effect.

The industrial area is on an island, and all traffic must go through a single road to cross a large bridge. The road has seven lanes of traffic (from all the different areas of the island convening to cross the bridge) that merge down to four lanes of traffic. As a result it becomes a big cluster of traffic when the merge starts.

I needed to get on a highway on the right side of the road to head home, and I was on the far left side of the road. I had to shift over to reach my on-ramp, and since it was rush hour and packed with cars I wanted to proactively move over before the exit. When I started to change lanes, I saw a nice open space right next to my car. I put my blinkers on, waited for three blinks of my turn signals, and then started to move over. When I started to move over, a cargo van on the other side of the opening wanted to move left and took my spot. I honked my horn, but he didn't care and forced me back (since I drive a small VW Golf, my car gets pushed around a lot). To avoid an accident, I had to go back to my original lane. Drawing below.

[DRAMATIC RE-ENACTMENT OF LANE CHANGE](https://i.imgur.com/TVq1LRY.png)

I had only gotten out of my lane for a second, since the van forced me back into my spot. Apparently a motorcycle was weaving through traffic and tried to take my old lane spot (when I was trying to change lanes) and when I moved back I almost ran into him with my car. He started slapping my side windows with a gloved fist and gave me the finger. 

At first I felt really guilty, but the more I think about it the more I think he was an asshole for weaving during rush hour traffic. Am I the asshole?

bzt3z9	2019-06-12 16:11:31		WIBTA If I Asked A Potential Roommate To Pay More In Rent?	"I'm not entirely positive if this belongs on this sub because there isn't exactly a conflict here, so if anyone knows of a better place where I can ask this, please let me know! I just really need some outside opinions on this matter! 

My SO and I are looking into renting an apartment soon and we're looking for one single roommate. He and I would share a room. In my area, most apartments don't have a master bedroom, so this scenario would be in the event that we would have equal sized rooms and shared access to the rest of the house. 

Would I be an asshole if I asked a potential roommate to split the rent 50/50 between my SO and I, considering he and I would be sharing a room and they would have their room all to themselves? He and I would have the same amount of space as the other single person. We would be paying for our own groceries and splitting utilities 3 ways, since three people obviously use more utilities than just two. We would just be paying 1/2 of the rent between the two of us since we'd be sharing a room and the other person would get their own, rather than each of us paying for 1/3 of the rent. 

We've never rented before so we don't really know the proper way to go about certain things, and I definitely don't want to be unfair to any roommate we end up with.

My story begins at Sunday when I asked my boyfriend to wait to confirm our plans to spend Valentine's Day together because things at home were not going great. At Monday I told I had figured it out and he could come, he said he was not in the mood anymore because he was expecting already a negative answer from me. Yesterday he said he was upset because we were not going to spend this day together. Meanwhile I was feeling awful menstrual cramps that didn't even allow me to get out of bed so I said that it was indeed better if we celebrate this weekend 'cause by then I would be feeling a lot better. I said I prioritize more spending quality time together than feeling miserable at a restaurant only because it's a particular time of the year. He understood, but kept saying he was sad and complaining like I was giving an excuse to not see him, so I asked him to come even though I was in pain I said I could make it work, but the answer was that my invitation was at the last moment.
Now he's acting like it's a terrible day and joking about how his life sucks, it almost seems like he values more having a girlfriend so he won't spend this day alone than my well being.

bzt2oq	2019-06-12 16:08:32		AITA for not wanting my Future Mother in-law involved in my seating chart?	"Hey all, first AITA post!

So I am getting married this coming August and I must say, the wedding stress is getting to me. Some how the vision for my day has been twisted due to me making too many compromises for other people. But I digress.

I was speaking with my Future Mother in-law the other day at dinner in regards to her family coming from out of town. She advised me that her sister (whom I have met once in the 11 years my fiance and I have been together) is making up a fake excuse that she may not be able to attend the wedding because she 'may not be able to get time off work'. I was told by my Future Mother in-law this is regular behavior for her, it was likely a false excuse and she would ""decide last minute"" if she was coming to the wedding.

I asked what ""last minute"" meant, and was advised she would decide on the Wednesday or Thursday before my wedding if she would attend. I asked about my deadline and having to give final numbers to the caterers, and was told ""Oh don't worry about that, they always have extra for a few people who just show up"".

I deal with a ton of anxiety and the best coping method for me is to plan for things in advance and get everything done as far in advance as possible. So I started to mention my seating chart, and how I did not want to be playing with it in the 2 days leading up to my wedding and if her sister couldn't respect my RSVP deadline she would get seated wherever was available when she did RSVP. To this, my Future Mother in-law stated ""Well, we will just place 2 other people at the family table and then swap them out with my sister and her husband if they decide to come"". 

I tried to tell her I was not comfortable with doing this, and I do not want the stress of dealing with this the week of my wedding. To which she responded she would do the seating chart herself if I felt that way. While I totally understand it is important for her to have her sister at the family table, I don't think its fair for me to be asked to do back-flips to accommodate her bad behavior. I am even willing to give her an extra 2 weeks after my RSVP date to decide, just as long as I have the numbers by the time I have to give them to my caterer!

&#x200B;

AITA for wanting her to just back off and tell her sister to respect my RSVP deadline?

&#x200B;

TL;DR; My Future Mother in-law is demanding I swap her sister in or out of the family table because she wont decide until 2 days before my wedding if she is coming.

bzt2b9	2019-06-12 16:07:38	weddingfuntimes	AITA for wanting my fiance to choose a less expensive wedding band?	"I proposed to my fiance over a year ago and got her a diamond engagement ring, which she likes. I stretched myself financially and spent as much as I could (I do not have any debt and have pretty good finances otherwise).

&#x200B;

Now our wedding is a few months away and we are choosing wedding bands. I am going to spend a few hundred on mine (which I guess is typical for a man) and she has her heart set on a wedding band that costs about \~$4k and has diamonds around the whole thing. Now, we could afford this by dipping into our savings (which we are already dipping into for our wedding), but I have made it pretty clear that I'm not thrilled about that, and I think we should spend less. She has student debt and we want to buy a home in the near future, so having that extra money will be pretty important in achieving our future goals.

&#x200B;

I've told her I don't think spending $4k on a band is very smart for us right now and she is pretty pissed about that. After thinking about it for a little while, she has said I can choose something less expensive, but she has made it clear that it is not what she really wants and that eventually she would want to replace it with something more expensive.

bzt2an	2019-06-12 16:07:35	IcyDay4	AITA for sending a strongly-worded text to one of my co-workers	"I've (23m) worked at my cousin's (45m) trading firm for 3 years now. We manage a lot of client's portfolios. When my Cousin and his associates are gone, I end up as the de facto care-taker, usually my role is more akin to that of an assitant/researcher. It is a small firm and we only have 4 employees (incluiding myself).

&#x200B;

Carla (32F) is a new employee and has been working with us for a couple of weeks now. I go to the office 3 times a week since I attend university the other days (this is an arrangement we've had since I started working there 3 years ago).

Today, I client contacted me during class. I'd told that specific client that I cannot help him those days, but since no one else was taking care of him I stepped up to the plate and took his orders. After that, he asked some information about his holdings that I specifically needed the software in the office's computers to get. I call Carla and ask her if she could please provide me with the information she said something like: ""I'm at the office but I'm just getting into the elevator I can get it in like 15 minutes"", I replied ""but I'm speaking with a client and need that information now"" To which she replied ""Ok send me the data and I'll get it"".  So I text her the information and she replies to me with the information 36 minutes later.

&#x200B;

I'll admit I was really mad. The client waited for the information 36 minutes. In this line of work a 2 minute delay is unacceptable. I texted her (most of our correspondence in the office takes place in whatsapp texts). (Also, this is translated as this is a non-english speaking country)

""Carla, here at \[name of the firm\] we are a team. Our business is mostly offering our clients a great service. If I ask you for something related to our job it's because I can't get it done on my end and need your help. If we dally giving our clients the information they require, our credibility as a firm diminishes. That the client waited on that information for 36 minutes is unacceptable. Please keep that in mind in the future.""

Now, nobody has said anything, but I feel like she didn't take it too kindly. Did I power trip on this? or stepped out of line there? I mean, I feel like what I did was the correct course of action, but I can't help but feel like kind of an asshole.

EDIT: forgot to mention, I was specifically tasked by the bosses train her. Don't know if that changes anything."	Asshole	0	0

I have this friend group of me, Mia, Leah and ruby. Mia, Leah and ruby have known each other quite a long time and i met them when i started secondary. Leah and i have both agreed we don’t actually like ruby that much and have spoke about it with Mia who I don’t think was that bothered.

I don’t like ruby much because if we passed in the corridor she doesn’t say hi if i do or is nice, if the others are away for whatever reason she just disappears and isn’t really friendly towards me. She generally doesn’t like me anyway, i have no idea why. Leah doesn’t like her for her own reasons, I haven’t actually asked her

Me, mia and leah have been out in town together before and we’ve arranged to go out again this Saturday but mia invited ruby. Leah and i were quite disappointed but if she comes we aren’t going to spoil it, if we are having a really bad time we might go off together and join the other two again later.

(The three of them live close together and meet up regularly and i live much further away so I don’t see them outside school much)

bzszrq	2019-06-12 16:01:54	ORBornandRaised	WIBTA for not wanting my mom to talk to me about her marital issues?	"I’ll try and keep it short. First time poster here, and a mobile post so sorry if formatting is wonky.

I (M 20) live at home with my parents and two sisters (22 and 11) during school breaks, otherwise I live in Chicago. My mom and dad have been having obvious issues with their marriage for the last year or two. They’ve been together for more than 30 years now and they have no intention of divorce as far as I know. My dad works a lot in another city and then comes home on weekends, but he’ll be back for about six months by the end of June. Mom is a SAHM, raising little sister and taking care of the house.

My parents are wonderful people. My dad and I aren’t that close but he is there when it counted for me and tries to connect. My mom and I are really close, don’t always get along or communicate well, but we have a good relationship.  But my parents are very toxic with each other and it shows. My mom and I talk often, and sometimes she will verbalize her issues with my dad. E.g. this last weekend, he hasn’t been calling my little sister on the phone every night like he normally does. Mom said he didn’t try outside of calling once, but sister didn’t pick up because she was occupied playing with me. “Pretty pathetic,” she said. I love my mom and my dad, so it hurt to hear her say that about him (though my wonderful gf pointed out she probably meant the effort was a little pathetic, not the person).

They go to counseling occasionally, mostly at my mom’s insistence. I don’t bring these things up outside of the occasional “are you upset because of dad.” I want to listen to her and talk with her but it drives me nuts and hurts because she’s giving me a negative opinion about my dad when I don’t have that experience. I feel like it’s unfair but then again she’s talking to me for a reason. WIBTA if I told her she can’t talk to me about her marital issues with my dad to me?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzsyfe	2019-06-12 15:59:08	kkat02	WIBTA if I showed up to his house unannounced?	"Okay so long story short, dated this guy for a bit, and we was super sweet and nice and would always tell me how much he liked me and how perfect I was and was always making future plans (like vacations) for us. I never really saw anything coming until a week ago I started getting suspicious and seeing red flags and thought he might still be dating his ex. I planned to wait through the weekend to talk to him about it.

So Saturday I (19F) got off work early and went to the gym. While at the gym he (25M) shows up to the gym with another girl. The moment he sees me he just leaves the gym, leaving the girl. I was waiting for him to come back to say hi, and to be honest I was still giving him the benefit of the doubt, when he hits me up on Snapchat asking me how I am, pretending like the whole gym thing never happened. I asked him who the girl was and he said it was his ex because they’re still friends.

At this point I’m fed up so I go up to the girl and show his messages to her and ask who she is (I’m being polite) and she tells me she’s his girlfriend. I apologized and told her I’d give her her space and to let me know if she needed anything. Five minutes later she comes up to me and tells me she found out about me a few weeks ago.

I text him and tell him I want to talk face to face, and ask to meet him a few hours later at Starbucks to discuss everything, and he agrees apologizing and telling me he’s looking forward to seeing me that night. I show up and wait 25 minutes and he never shows up, and realize he’s blocked my phone number, Snapchat, Instagram, everything so I have no way to contact him.

So now I’m confused and I haven’t heard from him in days. I mean I don’t wanna continue a relationship with him, but I really just want closure and to know the truth, was I really just a disposable side chick? 

WIBTA to show up to his place unannounced to demand some answers?

EDIT: so I probably won’t go to his house, not on principle that I should respect him and his decision, because to be honest while yeah maybe his intentions of not contacting me are clear, my intentions of wanting something serious and hating be a side chick (I told him about my past with this) were clear too so if he can’t respect me why respect him , but more so because I can’t waste more time. He’s a shitty person. If I see him at the gym though (which we frequently do) I will say something but other than that it’s time to let it go."	Asshole	0	0

Im not addicted to porn or anything like that, but if we don't do ""stuff"" for a while then sure maybe I'll browse and jerk off. After she told me this I said ok I won't. But I was so intrigued because I had never heard of this before so I googled if other people feel the same way. Sure enough alot of people do! So anyway we were on the phone and I casually brought up what I did. ""Hey so that thing we were talking about? I was curious to see if other people felt the same way so I googled it. Turns out its a bigger thing than I thought!"" Things were quiet. She says ""Sooo you need other people's validation of what I say? My word isn't good enough?"" I try to defuse the situation and say it doesn't matter what other people think if you're uncomfortable with me doing something I won't do it. I was just curious. She said ""It seems kind of fucked up but what ever its fine, love you."" Then hung up. This was last night, I texted her today and she hasn't responded and I'm scared because I have self-esteem issues and I just want to know if I actually fucked up or not. Shes making me feel bad over something I didn't know was bad.

Update: Wow I get back from break and I get all these responses! Thank you all for your input, I think I need to have a talk to her about how she made me feel wasn't okay. Im a pretty laid back person, and my last relationship was toxic to me. I've never gotten onto her about anything, but I'm scared to tell her stuff that will upset her because of my previous relationship.

bzsxm3	2019-06-12 15:57:10	TikisFury	AITA for not wanting to sleep in my wedding ring?	"Ok before this starts I want to state that this wasn’t a fight, it was a difference of opinion that was resolved fairly quickly. We’re happily married and I really don’t want to see any “divorce” answers at all.  I’m just here to present the situation to see if I’m actually in the minority of opinions. 

So last night my wife and I are getting ready to sleep and I take off my wedding ring and set it on my dresser. I don’t like wearing my ring to sleep because I’m afraid it’ll come off (even though it fits really well and likely it won’t actually come off), and it’s more comfortable sleeping without any Jewlery on (it’s not necessarily uncomfortable to sleep in it but it’s just more comfortable without it on). 

As I take it off my wife notices and asks “what’re you doing?” To which I respond “getting ready for bed, I don’t really like sleeping in my ring” and she goes on a tangent about how the ring is a symbol of our marriage and by not wearing it I’m saying that I don’t care about that. I tell her that it’s not that I don’t care it’s that it’s just a thing and things don’t matter. Wearing a ring doesn’t make me any more married to her and not wearing doesn’t make me less married to her. It’s just a physical item and I don’t see the big deal about wearing it 24 hours a day. I put it on when I leave the house obviously but I don’t really see the need for me to wear it every waking second of my life. I take it off when I’m cooking or doing yard work or showering or doing any work with my hands and that’s ok, but apparently I have to sleep in it? 

Idk, maybe I’m wrong but I personally don’t see the issue here. That being said I relented because I don’t particularly care enough to turn it into a fight, I just wanted to see what the internet thought. So AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I’m coming to the end of my apprenticeship, I’ve been offered a job by a former supervisor for when I qualify (wel’ll call him Tim)

I’ve been wanting to leave as soon as I qualify anyway (won’t get into details but basically not enjoying the work/hours/how employees are treated) but to be offered a job beforehand was very nice to hear, with great money once I qualify and more interesting work, the sort of work I want to get into. 

Yesterday Tim called me and said that he needed me ASAP as he has a lot of work on. I have a portfolio (Online NVQ) that I’ve nearly completed then a final practical exam. Tim was saying how I could complete the portfolio then do the practical exam once I’m working with him.

My manager called me the over day and explained how we should have a meeting soon to talk about money going up slightly as I’m basically earning pennies for the hours/work I’m doing (I know I’m an apprentice but I sometimes earn less than minimum wage as it’s price work).)3 also said he’d hope I’d speak to him before if I was thinking about leaving. (I think he can tell I’m unhappy) 

I don’t see the point in telling him I’m looking to leave as I know nothing will change, how do I know? I’ve spoken to many former employees. Am I the asshole for wanting to leave to better myself and not do stupid long hours so I have enough time to pursue my hobbies/seeing family?

Bob is an extremely eccentric older gentleman who is an avid farmer/gardener. He has tuned every inch of his property into a garden. Over the last couple years he has spread out into the yards of the surrounding rental properties( not his). He has an area for tomatoes in my next door neighbors yard. This is a vacant rental property that the owner has asked me to keep an eye on and has expressed his dislike for the garden in his yard but don’t care enough to stop it.  Anyway...


So yesterday I noticed a rabbit in one of his traps. We are pretty sure it’s the mother to the den in our yard.  I ignored it and went on with my business. I was heading to bed around midnight and decided to check to see if bob dealt with the rabbit yet. Nope, 12+ hours later the rabbit was still there.   I popped the latch and let him free... poor dude was freaking out 


So far there is no drama or anything but I started to feel bad that the rabbit might end up in the garden and obviously that’s the whole point of the  trap .... but then I start thinking how it’s not bobs yard and he’s not supposed to be there.   So did I save a rabbit or did a meddle with stuff that isn’t my business ... aita?

I met one of these friends in England, so he’s flying over to come see me. He’s never been outside of England, so we’re all really excited about the ordeal. 

The problem is, my friend has another American friend that he’s actually never met who lives in San Diego (which is one of the places we’ll be staying for a few days). He’s asked in advance if it would be okay if he tags along with my group for a day or two, which I had no problem with, since he lives in the city and can go back home when we’re done for the day. 

Except now, a week before he flies here, my friend is now attempting to convince me to let his American friend (who none of us have ever met) to sleep on the floor in the AirBNB each of my friends paid for. Apparently, this guy is currently living in his car because the person he was living with kicked him out. My friend’s justification is that he “came over to see him too” and that it should not be a problem to have him stay over since he is a “great guy” and that they talk on the phone almost every day. 

My friend claims to know this guy well because they speak on the phone, but naturally I have a problem with that justification because people can be completely different in person (ex: had a LDR for a few years, flew to meet him, turned out to be emotionally abusive, etc). I personally feel that you can’t know someone completely without a decent amount of face-to-face connection, but my friend doesn’t seem to understand that. 

He keeps bringing up this situation to try to convince me, to which I’ve told him no multiple times, due to the facts that the airBNB is in my name, so I’m not allowed to have more people than stated originally stay over or I’ll risk a fine or cancellation, and the fact that I don’t know this man and I’m not comfortable with him being in the same room as myself (a young female) and my belongings, no matter how “cool” he seems. 

My friend said that “the host won’t know if there’s one more person staying over” and that “it’s selfish to not allow him to stay because he’s in a bad situation (living in his car) and he’s a good guy and a good friend”.

I’m currently working on getting disability for mental issues so working is a bad idea, plus I have had a terrible time making it past training to begin with before I was told to back off on trying to find work. I’ve been in so much pain and have been having PTSD nightmares since I’ve been unable to afford the marijuana.

My partner is amazing, but he’s in recovery and is very black and white about it. He’s pretty drastic and says I’m a drug addict whenever I do have weed. Clearly, we have been great for the last two months since I haven’t had weed in that time. I’m suffering, though. A lot. He won’t help me with obtaining it financially since he’s uncomfortable with it.

I get it to a degree and just gave up trying to convince him of the benefits. I don’t know how to get it on my own and honestly, I’ve been trapped in bed because of the pain. 

Am I the asshole because I wish to continue with THC? I try to make sure when I do have money to get it that I get cartridges so he’s not smelling it all the time. This is our only argument. Again, I have no idea how I’ll get my hands on it without money anyway, but when I do, is it inconsiderate of me? CBD is just as expensive and again, that’s a no from him for help.

I just wish I could figure out a solution."		1	0

bzsre7	2019-06-12 15:42:28		AITA for backing off an agreement to move abroad?	"Presenting myself for judgment here.  I did my best to simplify the situation. 

My b/f and I moved in together about a month ago, together 3 years. We live in the US - I'm from here, he's on a work visa from British Columbia, Canada. I got really lucky and found a dream position within walking distance from our new place that pays very well for the field. We've talked about the future a little - planning to buy a house next year, try living abroad after 5ish years for a year and return, and adopting at some point in there. He's a very risk averse person naturally - we've discussed marriage and he's pretty hesitant about it for concerns that relate to his parents having gone through a messy divorce and concerns about finances.  We keep separate finances as it is, and both make decent money currently (though he does make about 3x of what I do). He very much wants to give living in Dublin or Berlin a shot, which I'm open to trying.  It's a major life goal for him, to the point of, ""I would consider it a life unlived, should I not give it a try."" 

The issue: he got notification recently that his green card was denied on a technicality and work visa will expire in 6-9 months (and cannot be renewed). After the initial shock wore off, turns out he's excited for this and is seeing this as an opportunity to make the Europe move happen now. His work can relocate him and will even pay for the move/lease breaking fee/paperwork...so it's pretty realistic that a move for him could happen without fuss. However, if it happens this way, there's a good chance he couldn't transfer back to the US for a long while because of this loophole issue. If ever.  We do have lawyers who specialize in immigration on the case, but no progress yet.

I'm less thrilled.  I work in the mental health field and it is rather hard to get certification - and therefore work/visas - from out of country and is almost guaranteed to not pay nearly as well.  There's also the mess of legal training, language issues, etc.  I've made him aware of this and could see him kind of deflate when talking about moving...but he is still actively pursuing work opportunities that would let him move more quickly. It is also a concern for me that we aren't married, so I don't have the associated protections or ability to get spousal visas (where they exist for gay guys, anyway...which I presume is most of where we'd go, so probably not a big deal).  I'm open to the idea of Europe down the line, once we are able to stabilize as a couple and letting finances stabilize a bit - particularly for me, as a lot of my post-grad work has been for nonprofits, which wasn't exactly lucrative. I'd also be concerned about moving so far after having lived together so shortly, not getting time to really experience it.  Plus there's the whole leaving family/him not being able to return/etc.  I can see him visibly deflate and look disappointed when we talk about it now, which in turn makes me feel extremely guilty.  

So - am I being too hard-headed/anxious? Is he? Both?"		1	0

Roommate's cat is afraid of new animals. Roommate was out of town, and I had some people over. DogeFriend brought his dog (without asking). DogeFriend has asked to bring doge over before, and it's normally ok.

I locked the cat in roommate's bedroom, where water/food/litter box is. But also where the bathroom is. Cat got out, so we start looking for it. Found it hiding, but it was really scared of the new people, noise, and probably smell of dog. Cat ran from behind bookcase to behind couch, while I'm trying to wrangle it. Dog sees cat, starts barking, and trying to chase the cat, while DogeFriend (ineffectively) trying to tell dog to chill out.

Cat is hiding behind couch, hissing at us. Everybody is yelling ""grab the cat"" ""put it in the room"". I'm trying to make my way over to the cat, but friend , we'll say Mr. Grabby Hands, is closer. Mr. GrabbyHands goes to scruff cat - but has no experience wrangling kitties, and grabs too far away from the neck, so cat turns around and sinks her teeth into his hand.

No blood from the wound, so we apply antiobiotic ointment and bandage the hand, give Mr. Grabby Hands some ibuprofen, all go to bed. Next morning it's swollen, GrabbyHands goes to urgent care and gets antiobiotics. We feel bad for GrabbyHands, offer to pay, but his insurance covered it all.

Mr. GrabbyHands drives home. Turns out, he wakes up the next day feeling really sick. Ends up going to the ER, stays overnight 3 days! Despite the antiobiotics, the wound became infected. He had to be put on an antiobiotic IV. 

GrabbyHands doesn't even tell me - I find out from someone else. Contact GrabbyHands and find out his hospital bill was $2000! I offer to pay half, splitting it with DogeFriend, and GrabbyHands left with the other half. AITA?

Friends saying I make significantly more money then GrabbyHands, the incident happened at my place, and it was my roommate's cat. But I think it's GrabbyHands' decision to grab the cat, whereas I was ready to grab the cat myself.

EDIT: worth mentioning Mr Grabby Hands lost 3 days of work, already paid $500 out-of-pocket for ER copay. His work is very physical, and is hourly (not my fault, or my choice, but food for thought). Also, DogeFriend backed out and isn’t helping pay."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzsla6	2019-06-12 15:28:05	throwaway123123329	AITA for not wanting my divorced parents SO's to visit me during my graduation week?	"I am an European citizen, who is about to graduate from a university in Asia next month. As such, i want both of my parents to visit me next month for a week, during the time i graduate so that they will be present in the ceremony.

&#x200B;

My parents are divorced, and it is the first time for my mom to come visit me and the second time for my father (and his girlfriend). Because it is a huge milestone for me and a special occasion, i wanted both of my parents to come alone without their SO's.

&#x200B;

Here is the problem: Both of my parents want to take their SO's while coming to visit me. They won't be present in the ceremony, but obviously I will have to take them around the city for the rest of time. I really don't want to deal with this hassle during a special occasion in my life, and have no issues if they want to come over at any other time. I made this explicit for them.

&#x200B;

I begged my father several times not to take her SO, however, he thinks that I have no right to decide anything for them since they are the ones that pay for my studies and well, everything else. He mentioned that by coming alone to visit me with his ex-wife (my mom), he will hurt his girlfriend and their relationship. As such, his girlfriend booked already two tickets for him and for herself, because she also wanted to tag along.

&#x200B;

My mom was a bit more understanding. She actually talked with her SO and he understood why he shouldn't come. However, after she heard that my father is also taking his girlfriend, my mom also wants to take her boyfriend over and is very hurt at me for not wanting her to do the same as my father.

Both of them are afraid that their SO will be hurt for not coming along, however, i feel the worst in this situation, because i feel that my parents don't care for me as much as they should. I think that, if they are really afraid that their SO will be hurt over visiting their only child for one week, then their relationship is weak without trust, and shouldn't be together in the first place.

&#x200B;

Personally, i don't understand why my parents don't see my position or don't prioritize my happiness over their personal relationships. It will be incredibly troublesome to take care of two separate groups during a whole week. Similarly, I also don't understand why their SO's cannot see how this is wrong and why would they want to tag along to an event which has nothing to do with them, nor they will be able to come to it? I really just wanted to have my IMMEDIATE and most important family with me, which are my parents so that we can have fun together. I made this very clear to them.

bzsk01	2019-06-12 15:25:00	throwww_e-weigh	WIBTA if I didn't buy my 16 year old sister a new Juul?	"I'm 25F, and live across the country from my family. I'm wrapping up a weeklong visit home now, and up until this point it had been really nice.

On Monday, I had a free morning and wanted to be helpful, so I did some laundry. As I was putting a load into the washing machine, my younger sister came in with some clothes she said she wanted cleaned ASAP. I had no problem with that so I took them to add to the current load.

While hanging everything up, I noticed that there was a battered Juul in the bottom of the washer. I pulled it out and brought it to my sister, figuring it was hers. As soon as I told her that it had gone through a wash cycle, she got really annoyed and asked if I'd gone through the pockets before I washed her stuff. I admitted I hadn't.

After that, she was even more annoyed & upset. She said since I ruined the Juul, it was on me to buy her a whole new one and a pack of new pods. Here's where I'm not sure if my position is right or not:

I said no, absolutely not. That not only was it on her to keep track of her possessions, but that it was illegal for her to even own one and that I wouldn't do something technically illegal to replace it for her.

At this point, she was crying and yelling really loudly, so our mom came in to ask what was up. We each related what had happened. Then, mom turned to me and told me that if it was going to cause issues between us, I needed to be the bigger person and replace the Juul. That a sisterly relationship is more important than a silly little toy. I told her what a Juul actually is and the legalities involved, but she cut me off to say that that didn't make a difference and it was the principle of the matter that dictated I should replace it. I said, well, what if I take her shopping and spend the equivalent amount? My sister cut in and said ""I don't want anything you're only spending $50 on"", and I said something snarky about definitely not buying her a Juul in that case cause that's what they cost. 

By then, my mom had about had it, and told me that it's on me to make this right. That I can choose to be a goody two-shoes and damage my relationship with my sister, or suck it up and fix this. I've refused, and as a result this vacation has become incredibly tense. My sister won't speak to me more than a word or two, and my mom is mysteriously super busy when we were supposed to have plans (she already took off work for them, so I know she's just being petty about this). My flight is on Saturday, so I have another couple days of this to endure if I'm gonna stand my ground.

bzsir2	2019-06-12 15:21:48	darkshay91	AITA for being very annoyed with my cousins?	"A little bit of background I have a 4 year old daughter who I recently signed up for swim lessons at our local pool (I would like to mention at this point that we live very close to the pool only about 4 blocks so we usually walk there) now on the second day of swim lessons we found out one of our cousins is also in my daughters class. At first this was a very welcome surprise as it left me and my daughter with someone we knew there instead just being surrounded by strangers. 

This quickly changed as I was very soon asked if I could take her little cousin the next day which since they only live a couple miles (at the most away) didn’t seem like a big deal though it would mean I would have to drive so I took her, fast forward to now there have been 5 classes and I’ve taken her to four of them and have been asked to take her to the remaining two.

While both girls are going to the same place and during swim lessons I obviously don’t have to do any child wrangling, after the lessons are over I’m left with two children(4 and5) who usually don’t want to leave the pool or want to go to eat or want to go play (which both girls cannot do as they have things to do and places to go) that I must get dried, changed, and where they need to be.

I think it is important to mention that these people are obviously family and also family I personally like a lot, and I totally understand that things happen and that we all need help sometimes and they are currently in position where they need help and I am in a position to help them and will almost undoubtedly do so but aita for being very annoyed that they signed their child up for a class with no clear plan on how to get her there and back and are just lucky enough that I am there?"

bzshvt	2019-06-12 15:19:32		"AITA for wanting to cut my ""best friend "" out of my life?"	"so my ""best friend"" went through a tough break up with this guy she'd been dating for 2 years (he was a jerk and id been telling her that for the last 6 months but its whatever...) and decided to immediately jump into bed (quiet literally) with a mutual friend of ours (who she had previously show disgust towards whenever he interacted with her and on numerous occasions cringed and called him creepy whenever he had touched her even if it was a friendly gesture). 

mf= mutual friend 

bff = best friend 

context: its common knowledge in our friend group that mf has had a crush on bff from the first day of college but he is in a relationship with a work colleague of mine. 

So bffs ex boyfriend was a bit of a control freak and they get into a huge fight  and decide to call things quits but not even an hour after breaking up with ""the guy she planned on marrying"" she was hanging off of mf's neck and making out with him. Then the next day (approximately 12 hours after her break up ) she's sitting with mf and making him write a break up TEXT after he told her he'd rather break up in person. We were on our way back from trip and bff was planning to stay at my house, however she messaged me that she didn't need to because she was going to stay with mf, so I made plans to hang out with some other people. About an hour later she messaged me again saying she was scared that everyone in Mf's flat hated her because they were all good friends with MFs ex,I told her I already had plans and that was that. Ever since that trip things have deteriorated between us, we went for talking everyday to no communication at all. I have been replaced by MF. I tried to talk to her about it and how I had had my previous relationship ended over text because of another women and she ended up manipulating me into being friends with her again but its just not the same. So the final straw was recently her and MF have been doing things without me and the rest of our group (eg getting pizza and bowling ) but then getting mad when they weren't invited to a spontaneous bowling trip me, out other friends and my partner went on. We had invited them out to other events but they always turned us down or tried to change the plans to what they wanted. 

&#x200B;

I can't get over the hypocrisy of the situation and whenever I see them either together or apart it triggers my anxiety but I still have to see them for a few more years at collage. I miss my bff and I miss the great times that we had but I just can't stand to be around her anymore. Am I an Asshole? if so please tell me how I can be more compassionate"		1	0

OK so... I just need to rant and get second opinion on some things. Right now a friend of mine hates me. The reason being that I went alone to see a band we both like. She could not go because of financial and cat-sitter reasons. I tried to help her all the way from when I got the tickets for us until the day of the concert. I offered to pay for her trip, I offered to drive her cats 80 miles to her parents so she could feel relaxed. In the end, she decided to not go (This is a band she has seen multiple times without me by the way, and I have done nothing but support her and be happy for her even though I have been jealous). 

The thing is, since she said she could not make it, I've been indecisive if I were to go as well. For a month she messaged me to go, to not go, to go, to not go and so on. Well, I decided to go on a trip to the country anyways but wasn't sure if I was going to see the band. The day before the concert she practically begged me to go and have fun.

While I'm standing at the event, I had met up with other people. They were holding my hand, hugging me cuz' I felt so bad being there. I wanted to see the band, but it didn't feel right (which I had told my friend the day before). I'm crying, and when the band comes on stage I almost fall to the ground. For at least three songs I was crying because I felt horrible. That feeling is still with me now.

After the concert, my friend messages me and says that I have ruined the band for her, and that I should feel proud of myself(?!) for it.

And the important part is that, we both struggle with mental health. I have a serious case of anxiety and depression. She has borderline. I try to tell myself that it is just a period of anger for her, but I'm afraid that what I did broke our friendship.

Me and my cousin decided we'd go to the pool, and after swimming for a while the life guard blew her whistle and got up for her break. We being old enough to not care stayed in the pool. After five minutes someone came up to us and asked us to get out of the pool. After we got out of the pool he asked us how old we were. We both said fifteen. He gave us a 7 minute speach about how swiming in the pool without a life guard is dangerous. he also mentioned he was doing 'traning' (maybe a new life guard or his kids?) Either way we were pretty frustrated because the pool is swim at your own risk. We even go to the pool when there isn't a lifeguard on duty *gasp*.

Either way I don't know if I was the asshole because I don't know if I was being a bad example to his kids, or if he was the asshole because he instead of dealing with his kids possibly whining about why they can't be in the pool he just asked us to get out.

bzse9w	2019-06-12 15:10:56	theannartist	AITA for being angry at my father for denying me to stay at his place while he isn’t home, even though it is the place I grew up in?	"The title pretty much sums it up, but after telling some friends about this, I am unsure if me being angry about this is justified. 

My father and I have a pretty strained relationship to begin with. He makes it a habit to insult me all the time and when I finally say something he justifies it with something like “you are way too sensitive. I wasn’t serious anyway.” 

Well that being said, my best friend got married last weekend in a town over from where I grew up. I asked my dad if I could stay at his place (aka the home I grew up in) and sleep in the guest room (which used to be my room when I lived there). He said that he and his girlfriend where away on a weekend trip and that it would be better if I would stay at my grandmother’s place. When I said “okay, but why?” he answered that this apartment they are living in starts to feel like home for the both of them and that he can’t have his kids staying there all the time. I didn’t say anything in that moment but was totally angry and still am.

Some more info on all of this: 
- my brother still lives in the same apartment and he is not allowed to have his friends over in his room, because my dad and his girlfriend don’t want to be disturbed, my brother only can have his friends over in a converted garden shed (with a TV, bathroom and everything, but still)

Some of my friends said I was right in being angry at my father and even went as far as saying that I should talk to him about it. Others however have said that it is understandable that they want their privacy and don’t want anyone in their place when they aren’t home.

Now I am confused. So I am asking the internet."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzsdc8	2019-06-12 15:08:51		AITA for not helping my brother financially?	"I'm in my 30s with a wife and kids. Since I was in highschool, I told my parents they should take my brother (now 40s, single) to a psychiatrist, but they refused because they worried about the stigma associated with.

Fast forward, he hasn't had a legit and has just been temping the past 10 years. I think a lot of his past performance issues is due to un-diagnosed psychiatric disease.

Anyway, things got bad so eventually upon my stronger insistence is finally seeing a psychiatrist. Side effects from meds make doing his temp jobs difficult. He thinks a better living situation would help. He's living with roommates that keep him awake. He wants to live alone.

Now, my parents want him to move near me. First, I live in the suburbs and there is no single scene. Yes, I'm here, but it's otherwise isolating.

Second, I'm sure my parents want him to move here so that I can take care of him. They are even want to buy him a home - BUT they don't have enough money to get my brother a nice place. They are too conceited to buy a small studio in a subpar location that they actually can afford. My brother has no savings.  Now, I have a very good job, but we also chose to live in a town where the schools are really good... and the real estate is absurdly expensive. So my salary relative to where I live is below average, but I'd be at the top 10% one town over.

So now I'm getting pressure to 1) help pay for my brother's apt/house 2) take care of my brother who has the logic, attitude, and arrogance of a 5 year old. He always thinks he's right and is so judgemental of everything I do. I have enough of kids and don't have the bandwidth or desire to take care of another child 3) My brother adores my kids, and I want him to see my kids, but I frankly don't want him around them all the time as I think he's a bad influence. A few times a month would be great... but not a few times a week

Anyway, I told my brother and my parents I actually don't have much disposable income since everything is being invested so that I can one day buy a nice house.  So I'm being advised  to move into a cheaper neighborhood with worse schools and use the profits from selling my current place to help out my brother. My brother is judging me and calling me foolish and a status junkie for wanting to live where I am.  He references that you don't have to come from a wealthy town to be successful. Also, I'm being told it's my responsibility to help him out.  This is the same person that tried to ruin my marriage (during the engagement and my wedding). Granted, this was before his diagnosis, but that's a reason, not an excuse... As you can tell, I haven't forgotten and I haven't forgiven yet.

bzscpi	2019-06-12 15:07:26	FrozenJackal	AITA Logged Girlfriend out of My Netflix Account	"So I started dating this girl and she has two TV’s in her house one has a friends Netflix account logged in (family room) and the other is a new TV not logged into Netflix (Bedroom). My GF does not have a Netflix account and she could not login to her friends account because she doesn’t know the password. She doesn’t want to ask friend for the password. 

After a few months of dating we where over at her place and she wants to watch a movie on Netflix that just came out. I was also excited to see the movie, but she wanted to watch in the bedroom. I was like let’s watch in the family room. She said let’s just watch in bed it’s so much more comfortable. 

So a little info here. I don’t have a TV in my bedroom I don’t like TV’s in the bedroom for multiple reasons, the biggest being I find it hard to sleep with the TV on. So back to the story. 

So I caved and signed into my Netflix account on her bedroom TV. We watched the movie then went to bed. 

A few weeks later I am trying to watch Netflix at home and I can’t (we don’t live together). Another device is using the account the error says. At the time I didn’t put it together that it was my GF watching I just figured I left my laptop signed in. Then it keeps happening can’t login every day. My GF calls me pretty much every night we aren’t together to chat before bed. This time I mention that my Netflix account says I can’t watch because another device is watching. She says oh yeah I’m watching Netflix in bed right now. 

Fast forward a few weeks and this is still happening every time I want to watch a show or movie. I would have call her and say hey are you watching Netflix she says yes and says she will get off.

So eventually I get tired of calling and asking her to get off so I signed out of all devices. I know she can just watch in the family room but she insists on the bedroom, this also bothered me when I was over at her place. Like I mentioned before I dont care for a TV in the bedroom. 

So the AITA part is just last night I was at her place and she asked me why she couldn’t watch Netflix I said it was because I signed her out. She asked me to sign her back in and I said I wouldn’t. She asked why and I explained I was tried of having to ask her to get off when I wanted to use it. She brushed it off as not a big deal and hands me the remote saying I’ll get off anytime you want please just sign me back in. I said no, she starts telling me I’m a jerk and if I didn’t want her on my Netflix why did I sign in in the first place. I said she needed to get her own account and to stop mooching off of me and her friend. She can afford an account she makes over six figures. She gets really upset and now we aren’t talking.

bzs6td	2019-06-12 14:53:20		AITA for pretending to be my friends boyfriend	"I'm a 27 y/o gay male, my friend is a 30 y/o straight woman.

So i was in a really crappy job, factory work, i hated it greatly. Thankfully i got a great job opportunity in a city near where my friend lives. My friend offered for me to stay with her as there is a 3 week gap between finishing my old job and starting me new one. I was super grateful, my friend even said i didn't need to pay rent while i was there as i didn't have the money to help.

While i was there, i pretty much cleaned the house daily, cooked dinner, helped her out with DIY things she needed doing in her home, anything i could help with to show my thanks for letting me stay there.

On the last week i was there, she got invited to a wedding where she knows 2 of her ex's would be there (these ex's were bastards to her, the type that broke up with her via text). She really wanted to go see her friend get married but was embarrassed to go alone and asked if i could come with her.... But as her boyfriend. I thought this would be a good laugh and have a fun time with an open bar with my friend getting drunk. We were gonna say we were work friends that got together and it was love at first sight. She said she was going to tell her friends who are going to the wedding too who i really am beforehand.

So we got to the wedding, i met a load of her friends and most of the night was really good. She got to parade me around as i made sure to wear my best wedding suit, one of her ex's seemed visibly flustered by it and my friend was very happy. 

The next morning, we were going for a full english breakfast as a hangover cure with her friends. (these are the same friends that she said she would tell the truth too). When we got there, my friend put her arm around me and put my arm around her. I assumed she must have seen one of her ex's and went along with it. As we were sitting down, she was getting very flirty with me infront of them all but i couldn't see any of her exs around. One of her couple friends asked if we (me and my friend) were still on for our double date next week, and my friend butted in and said yes. I was obviously looking confused and my friend got up and asked me to follow. 

I asked her what she was talking about, turns out that she never told any of them that i'm not actually her boyfriend and they all love me and want to hang out with us. I told her that wasn't what we talked about and i'm not going to continue lying. She got visibly upset and ran off. I ended up telling her friends the truth that i was just here for her but we're not together. All the girls there said i was an asshole for leading her on?!?! I tried to explain that i'm actually gay and was just helping a friend but none of them were having it....

bzs6qd	2019-06-12 14:53:10	grr_qwerty	WIBTA for telling someone that their date has herpes?	"Full disclosure: I have decided I won't go because I feel like I would be morally responsible if she got herpes and I said nothing.

&#x200B;

I am an HR Manager and someone I am friendly with is on a business trip to our main location. About 4 months ago, Matt confided in me off the clock that he was recently diagnosed with herpes. I told him he should not worry to much about it and follow what his doctors say, but that it isn't the end of the world. I know he has a lot of casual partners, but I never asked if he discloses his status because its none of my business and we are best work friends, but we aren't friend friends if you know what I mean. He flew in on Monday and Matt, my husband and I had gone to dinner. We said we could have dinner again on Wednesday since he did not have anyone else taking him out (like our boss). He told me on Tuesday that he had met a girl at a bar and invited her to dinner with us on Wednesday.

&#x200B;

Tuesday, he was sitting in my office and Matt said he thinks of me as a friend and he wanted to ask my opinion on something. I said okay, and he proceeded to say, ""Would you judge me if I didn't disclose my status to people?"" I told him not only is that illegal (in CA and TX specifically are the areas we live), but yes because he is not giving them the choice to decline and putting their health at risk without their choice in the matter. Matt said that he did not call to inform anyone, does not use condoms, and does not tell any of them. He also said he has had one of the recent girls text him a picture of their genitals with sores/rash and they said they didn't know what was wrong, and he still didn't say anything to them. His argument is they don't ask his status or to use condoms, which is obviously flawed logic.

&#x200B;

I feel uncomfortable with the fact that I would be going to dinner with this poor girl, knowing that he is going to try and sleep with her and she could have her health negatively affected. I first thought I could go to the bathroom after her, and suggest she ask his status or anything to give her the heads up. But then I feel like I am disclosing someone's medical condition without their permission.

bzs6p7	2019-06-12 14:53:06	wetardedpanda4	WIBTA if I ended my relationship with my father?	"So this is going to be kind of a long story, scroll to the bottom for a tldr, if you don’t want to read it all.

Disclaimer: I’m an only child and up to 16 years old my dad was my best friend I wanted nothing more than to be just like him when I grew up. He was the one that taught me family was everything and money was not important in measuring your self success.

First you need to know that when I was in high school my dad took a job in Russia, since neither me nor mom wanted to move to Russia we moved back home (dads job at the time was in Australia, so we all moved from the US to Australia). Dads contract mandated that he could only be in Russia for 2/3 of the year due to the way citizenship in Russia works. Because of this he was suppose to spend 6 weeks there and 2 weeks with us at home. For the first 4 months everything was dandy. Then the next time he came home  something was off, he was completely different. I came home from school one day to him and mom outside arguing. He had just told my mother that she was fat and ugly, he didn’t love her any more, and that he was in love with another woman in Russia who was 20 years younger than him.

This was the start of my dad becoming a completely different person. It took 2 years for their divorce to go through and by this time I’m now in college, which my dad pays for. However, taking my dads money for college or really anything is the vain of my existence. It always comes with strings attached and I hate it. He actively tries to buy my love and he makes my life much harder than it should be. For instance he’s always late paying for things like my tuition or rent, even though these are scheduled payments that I tell him about well in advance. I feel so snobbish complaining about these things as I’m already so fortunate to be in my current situation. 

However, I’m tired of dealing with his constant complaints about my management of money, life choices, blatant disregard that him leaving mom wasn’t his fault, his over the top narcissistic ways and I want to tell him somethings got to change. I’ve written a 5 page letter over the past few years of all the things that he has done that have greatly affect me and I want to sit down with him someday and tell him. My question for you is will I be the asshole for saying I’m done? 

TLDR- my dad is a narcissistic jerk that still provides for me but will I be the asshole for ending it or talking to him about how he hurts me?

Edit: I forgot to add that my mother is completely on my side as he has been nothing but a dick to her. Moreover even though he makes 10 times more than she does she provides for me for things I need other than college tuition far more than he does.

Edit: I feel as though I haven’t properly portrayed my dad either, he does do a lot with college tuition as I’m pre-med and that’s expensive. I just don’t know if all of that is worth me bowing down to him."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We’re separated by 10 years and a 12 hour drive. She and her boyfriend decided to take a road trip to New England to see Boston and come to Maine, where my husband and I live. They are staying in our guest room and we have been trying to show them a good time. We have taken them to dinner a few times, out for ice cream, to Acadia National Park, bought them things and suggested other fun activities. My problem is that they either don’t tell me their plans at all and show up whenever they feel like it or after they get back to our house they go up to the guest room and watch movies or something on the computer for hours, while I make dinner and sit alone (my husband sometimes works late.)

It has been three days of this pattern and I’m feeling very used. So last night I texted her that generally when someone is staying with family, they want to spend time with them and that I’m not running an Airbnb. They came down from the room asked what was going on... as if there had to be an activity going on for them to come downstairs. I said nothing that I just want to hangout and spend time together since they’re here and staying at my house. So they begrudgingly sat down and after talking for 5 minutes or so, the phones came out and they began looking at something and whispering back and forth. 

They are supposed to stay for the next couple days but I feel like telling them they need to go. I’m not getting anything out of them staying at my home and I’m sick of feeling like I have a rude teenage daughter. WIBTA to tell them to leave if they don’t want to spend time with me? They don’t have a lot of money for a hotel so I think if I told them to go, they’ll have to go home. 

Edit: I work 10 hour days during the week so they are alone, in and out of the house all day. My expectation is them letting me know their plans and if they’re home, spending some time with us in the evening. Especially if I’m preparing food that were all eating. 

Edit: I guess A lot of people think I’m an asshole. I really have taken the comments to heart and I still don’t really see it as I would never ask to go visit someone and then ignore them in their home. I’m not going to make her leave but I will make it so she won’t be coming back.

We get along great & have kids that are the same age.  Most are upper middle class except one who we thought was solidly middle class.  Bc of this we always book low cost vacation homes, mostly in “off” location (just outside the place we are visiting), w/minimal amenities to keep costs down.  Well I just found out the one we thought was “middle class” makes more than all of us (not a ton but more).  I gave him the WTF look when I found out & he just laughed & said “What?! I like to live below my means.”  So I’m in charge of booking our next vacation home & I’m not interested in a luxury 5 star resort but also not interested in staying at an “off” location anymore bc it’s a real pain to deal w/carting all the kids stuff around for the day.  It would be much more convenient to stay someplace we can run back to for an hr or 2 during the day to change clothes, eat or let the kids rest.  But, of course, more convenient locations cost more money.  WIBTA if I just booked the more convenient location now that I know we can all afford it even though the 1 doesn’t WANT to pay that much.

EDIT:  Info - I just send links to the places I’ve narrowed it down to & wait for feedback.  I just wouldn’t include links to places that are less convenient/less money.  Then I pay for it & they reimburse me their portion.  (he picks the cheapest regardless) 

Look we grew up together, I get it & I’m not into spending a ton either but I honestly thought he was BTcheapA by making us cart all the kids stuff around when we all could just spend a bit more for convenience.  So I guess we cater to him again ...

EDIT 2:  I did not chose to be the one to book this vacation. They decided I should do the research etc & I agreed to.  Also, at this point there is NO SET budget.  I’m just getting an idea of how much different areas cost before passing options along."	Asshole	0	0
bzs5r3	2019-06-12 14:50:41	archibaldthefourth	WIBTA if I didn't put much effort into a shower/bachelorette	"This happened a couple weeks ago, so I've been trying to let the hurt feelings go. However, the shower and bachelorette party are coming up so I thought I'd get some additional opinions.

&#x200B;

I am 22f and so are two of my friends. One of them is having a baby, we'll call her Molly. The other is getting married, we'll call her Leah.

&#x200B;

We went out in April, and Molly told me she was pregnant. Leah also asked me to be in her wedding. I said yes happily. I am not the maid of honor for the wedding, Molly is one of two MOHs. Since Molly is pregnant, I offered to help with planning since the other MOH lives out of state. Leah and I volunteered to throw Molly a baby shower, since she has an interesting relationship with her mom, and we both have extra time.

&#x200B;

Leah and I both put a lot into this baby shower. We rented a shelter at a local park and put a lot of effort into the theme and decorations. Here is where I admit I didn't have as much input as Leah. She was very proactive in trying to plan, and she also had a silhouette, so she wanted to make a lot of the decorations. I was very open to that. Leah really wanted to make this shower great. I did also, but my experiences with baby showers had been ones that were held at someone's home with gifts and maybe a game or two and some small decorations. Leah wanted 5 games,and had many ideas for decorations. She also wanted to meet in person several times, and every time we did this I felt like we were doing it more because she didn't want to work on things alone, rather than necessity.

&#x200B;

We each spent over $250 for this shower. She did a lot of the decorations since she had the machine, and I did a lot of shopping and picking up supplies. As the shower got closer, Leah got very stressed and put a lot of pressure on me to get things done on her timeline. I am a relaxed planner, and if I know what I need to do, I get it done when it's needed.

&#x200B;

The shower went great. Everyone had a great time and it really was beautiful. Throughout the shower, many made comments to Leah about how great it was. She just said thank you. Every time someone told me they liked something I would say ""Thanks, Leah and I ..."". She never did the same. I decided to let it go because it was about Molly and she seemed to enjoy herself and I didn't do it for the credit. The hurtful part came after the shower.

&#x200B;

Molly made a post thanking her mom and I for helping Leah plan the shower. Then went on in her post about how much she loved Leah and could always rely on her. Honestly it just really hurt my feelings that not only was I recognized as only ""helping"" when we split costs 50/50, but that she rambled about Leah's effort and friendship and I was an afterthought.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I don't put as much effort into Leah's shower? Molly hasn't asked, but I told her before I would be willing to help as much as she needed. I wouldn't deny helping, I just wouldn't bend over backwards like I did for Molly's shower."	Not the A-hole	0	0

After his death a lot of people were posting about how much they missed him and how close they were but I knew for a fact that many of those people weren’t close or didn’t even associate with my friend at all. Which made me quite upset because it seemed that many of these people were just posting about him for attention. Most of the people who were initially posting BS posts about how close they were stopped posting about it shortly after the services but a couple kept posting like almost everyday. I mean for God sake one of the guys that posted about being so close to him literally tried to sleep with my friends girlfriend while he was in the hospital getting treatment. 

Anyway fast forward to yesterday and the guy that tried to sleep with my friends gf posted a huge BS paragraph on twitter saying how much he missed him and so on. So I asked my best friends sister if it was okay for me to call him out and she said she didn’t care. So I did it I called him and about 4 other people out for lying about being close to him. So far I’ve gotten mixed reactions to the whole thing but a lot of people are DMing me saying I went too far for going public about it but IMO that was the only way to get them to stop. Seeing posts lying about him like that fucking hurt me. It’s like they’re just using him for attention while me and my friends are mourning the death of a great person. So reddit AITA?


TL;DR:  People lied about being close to my best friend friend who died of cancer for attention. So I called them out and now I’m getting backlash from other saying I shouldn’t have gone public with it even though I asked his sister if it was okay.

bzs3s4	2019-06-12 14:46:01	astonezthrowaway	AITA for telling my friend about an incident a year after it happened?	"I'm part of a best friend group of three; me, Ally and Claire. Last year Claire got married, and Ally and I were her dual maids of honor. She didn't have a wedding planner so all the event set up fell to us on the day of the wedding.

Her husband's groomsmen were Claire's brother and his brother, BIL. From the beginning of the day BIL was never where he was supposed to be. Like if we had pictures at 1pm, he'd be playing golf (it was a venue on a course). We had to track him down and bring him back for photos. Claire was stressing out and asked us to find him whenever he wandered off, went to the bar, etc. After the wedding, the bridal party and significant others had rented an Air BnB together. My husband and I, along with Ally and her husband, camped out in the living room. At about 2am, BIL came in and decided he wanted to watch TV loudly, even though he had his own private bedroom with a TV. I informed him that we were sleeping, and he went off on me and Ally. Saying we'd been nags all day, that this was a party, and called me and Ally ""fat bitches"" and the C word, and said he felt bad for our husbands for having to put up with us.

My husband was ready to deck him, so I thought it best that we left. We took Ally and her husband and drove the 40 minutes home. The 4 then woke up early to get back to the Air BnB before the bride and groom woke up. So needless to say, Claire had no idea anything had gone down and I was happy to keep it that way.


The only time we've seen BIL since is at Claire's birthday, and I've always just steered clear but not made it obvious  because it's her BIL and not like they're going to sever ties with him.


Anyhow, come to today and Ally wants to start a once a month game night as a group. We were all on board, when Claire says she's invited BIL to join because he's her husband's best friend. I instantly got uncomfortable, and asked if it could just be the friend group plus significant others. Claire wanted to know why so I finally came clean about all the stuff BIL said. I can suck it up for her birthday, but I don't want to see this guy on a regular basis, especially with drinking involved.


Claire was instantly upset that I hadn't told her, I said up until this point there wasn't really a reason to because I knew she couldn't cut BIL out of her life and I have/would always suck it up for special occasions. Right now she's more mad at me than she is at BIL and is talking about organizing a gaming group for pretty much everyone but me (I should note Ally was super drunk and only remembers bits and pieces so she is less nervous around this guy).


AITA for not telling her? I didn't want to sour her view of her wedding day, or make her feel like she had to ""choose"" so up until now there was no real point in my opinion."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzs2tk	2019-06-12 14:43:40	FlashyRougue	AITA Should I have given the Uber a low rating?	"I live in Canada, so it's really cold and slippery in the winter. So many people end up injured or concussed. In late Feb I hit my head on the top of my bunk bed and ended up with an intense concussion (nothing permanent thank goodness). 

I was a Freshmen and my dorm tends to be loud as hell, so my older friends let me crash at their place, so my head wouldn't explode. This happened on Thursday and by Friday night I was tired of being cooped up. My friend who was recovering from her own concussion decided to go grocery shopping so I begged to go with her and she allowed it. We both wore sunglasses, because light hurt and walked to the supermarket.

 Being poor students we decided to share an Uber back because we had a lot of stuff and it was cold and snowy (I bought some food as I would be crashing there for the rest of the weekend).  The guy arrives and pops the trunk and we put our stuff inside (remember this). We get in the car and he's blaring some rap or pop music in a language I don't know, making my head throb. I ask nicely if he could turn down the music as me and my friend have head injuries and want to rest after to leaving a loud supermarket. He ignores us. My friend sees me getting a painful headache and asks again, the guy huffs and only turns it down one bar. We both are annoyed and in pain but deal with it.

 We arrived and the guy speeds off almost taking my friends leg with him. I suddenly remembered he had our food and screamed so loudly. Like so loudly that he heard he down the street and over his music. 

""YOU HAVE OUR FOOD COME BACK!"" I screamed (in a lot of pain) as the whole street looked at us. He drove back quickly and popped his trunk open, while yelling at us that we shouldn't give him a bad rating. He was very aggressive and saying that I was being dramatic and making it seem like he hurt us with my screaming. We are both 19F and he is in his mid 20's I think. Am I the asshole for giving him a bad rating? Some of my friends say that maybe he was having a bad day and he didn't actually hurt me. They think that I could have cost him business and are mad that I'm ""selfish"". And that since it was a short ride and he came back and gave us back our stuff giving him a low rating is not fair. The friend in the Uber agrees with me."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I was sat in school in a classroom with a friend when the girl walks in with her friends. I know her so I said hello and continued the conversation I was having with my friend and then I over heard her bragging to her friends about how she cheated on all three of her maths exam with the girl who was sat across from her in the exam hall. She explained how her friend would tap on her desk and angle her paper so the girl could see the answers to the questions. This wouldn’t be such a big deal if her passing from cheating could theoretically affect the grade boundaries since about 30% of the country are not allowed to pass their maths GCSE. 

My friend said I shouldn’t report her for it and I would be the arsehole. So, would I be the arsehole if I reported her for the cheating and I’d there anyway I can prove this is true?

Since then, he's been a bit lost and we are all finding our way through the new family dynamics.  He's generous with money and will pay for food and experiences when I (29) visit home (America) from abroad (Europe, been here since 2009).  

He and my sister (33) visited me this week, and stayed with me and my partner in our small one bedroom flat in an expensive European city.  (They both stayed in our living room on a pull out bed and air mattress.)  Again, he was very generous and paid for almost all of our food and tickets for tourist attractions.  My partner and I thanked him each time.  My sister has always been spoiled by my dad and didn't thank him for any of this. 

I got a bit tense because neither of them thanked us for having them stay, or complemented our flat.  They also didn't thank my partner for driving them to the airport, and didn't show any interest in me or my partner's personal lives.  My partner also noticed but shrugged it off and encouraged me to do the same. 

My dad and my sister are onto the next leg of their vacation, and are now in the country where my partner is from.  They will be staying at the house of my (follow me here) boyfriend's uncle's wife's late parents' house for one night before moving on.  They are not paying for this, and I encouraged them to buy a bottle of alcohol as a gift to thank the family. 

I am joining them this evening and texted to ask if they gave the uncle anything. They said they didn't but ""bought him two drinks"" when they all went out to dinner together.  This is around €11 and shows no foresight. 

I'm so embarrassed that they have been so careless and entitled this trip.  It's one thing when it's just me, but I'm embarrassed that my partner and now his family aren't being appreciated.  I am bringing the uncle a gift and will be able to give it to him when my family goes back home. 

WIBTA if I told my dad he was inconsiderate, even if I cleaned up the mess and he has been financially generous to me and my partner? 

I know it's out of sheer obliviousness rather than malice, and that he would have relied on my mom to do all the polite Ms Manners stuff.  Our family isn't good at confrontation.  Thanks for your advice."	No A-holes here	0	0

bzs0c4	2019-06-12 14:37:25		AITA For Ghosting an Employer?	"I went to the school career fair this spring to look for a summer internship. I study engineering. I interviewed with five companies. Big Construction Company 1 gave me an offer that paid extremely well but forced me to relocate to a remote town five hours away. I would have to buy a camper and travel an hour to get groceries and other items. I accepted their offer through email. 

At that point I thought I was not going to get another offer. Two days later, Big Construction Company 2 called me with an internship offer. This one pays less but is 1.5 hours away in a decent location. I have a girlfriend and dog who I travel back to see on the weekends. I would have to go without seeing them for the whole summer if I went with Big Construction Company 1. I am writing this from Big Construction Company 2's computer.

bzrznc	2019-06-12 14:35:46	takeawayanon	AITA for proceeding with mum’s birthday party despite aunt’s recently diagnosed cancer?	"Since last month, my siblings and I have been planning a big party for our mum’s 60th birthday in late June and we’re inviting the whole extended family, whom we are very close to. 

Unfortunately last week, my oldest aunt had to undergo an emergency surgery and it was discovered that she has second stage colon cancer. The entire family freaked out, myself included. My family members including my mum have been visiting the hospital every day and taking turns to sleep overnight at the hospital to be with my oldest aunt who is now recovering from the surgery. 

Ever since then, my third aunt has been pushing for us to cancel the party for my mum (who is the second oldest among her siblings) but we have refused to do so. We are going to proceed with the party and my mum, whom the party is for, is okay with it. 

Now, my third aunt is complaining to everyone in the family and saying that we should have cancelled the party in light of what happened with our oldest aunt. 

When I asked her why we should cancel, her excuse was that my oldest aunt will not be well enough to attend the party. 

My siblings and I are really upset about what happened with our oldest aunt, obviously, but we don’t think that should mean we cannot celebrate anything in the near future. And besides, if our oldest aunt can be discharged from the hospital before the party, we plan to have a separate menu specially for her, as per doctor’s orders or whatever. And if not, well, I still don’t think we should cancel our mum’s 60th birthday because one person couldn’t make it. 

Also worth saying, my third aunt holds a lot of sway in the family simply because she’s the richest by far among her siblings and she’s the successful one who got out of the hometown and moved to the big city. My siblings and I are concerned that she will convince our other aunts and uncles into asking us to cancel the party as well. 

Anyway, so are my siblings and I the assholes for going forward with the party despite what happened with our oldest aunt?? Should we have just cancelled the party?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzryvv	2019-06-12 14:33:55	Shiizhi	AITA for getting mad at my GF for spoilers	"So obligatory first time poster but long time lurker. Let me know if I can format better. Please note this involves spoilers so please refrain from reading unless alright with Avengers Infinity War spoiler and an off-hand comment about John Wick.

So this story begins with myself and my girlfriend. We have been dating for just shy of 3 years and have a great relationship albeit one thing. She loves to spoil things in small comments. She makes small comments during movies or before hand that spoil something in the movie. She can do this because we live in the same city as her family and they go watch the movie beforehand.

An example I can give Avengers Infinity War. She apparently saw this beforehand despite us promising to watch it together. Please note she never mentioned this before us watching it together. During the movie as soon as Gamora comes onto the screen she made a small comment like 'Oh I was so sad when she died. I actually cried.' I was so taken back because I also ghost the topic online and don't even watch trailers for movies anymore to fully avoid spoilers. 

Currently she is doing an internship on the other side of the US. While in one of our 1-3 hour long calls I mentioned that I was going to watch John Wick 3 with the guys and I'm so excited for it. She instantly said ""Oh that? The ending kinda left me wanting more."" Instantly I became upset and told her that if she made another comment about the movie I would hang up. Needless to say she just said ""I didn't say anything about the movie and just said the ending kinda sucked."" Click and that was the end of the call. She said (over Facebook messenger) she hadn't seen the movie and was messing with me. I got mad and told her off based on everything said here and other similar comments in movies.

IMO if you can avoid spoiling details but spoil parts with how you felt. If I told you the ending sucked in a movie you would watch the movie with the idea that the entire movie must be great and be able to hold the movie because the ending is terrible. 

So AITA for getting angry?

Edit: Sorry for not specifying but I did tell her repeatedly about how I dislike the spoilers and how it frustrates me. In addition I am asking about this because she and my friends think I'm the asshole for this and told me to chill out. I'm kinda impressionable so it got me questioning if I was or not."

"He brought this up the other day nonchalantly, and started off the conversation saying his mum one day asked him what he calls my mum when he comes over to visit at my house. For some context, my mum has always been quite chill when it comes to our cultural traditions and doesn’t actually like it when people call her ‘aunty’ or any similar titles, so he simply just says hi or calls her by her first name which she is perfectly happy with. Consequently, I naturally called my boyfriend’s mum the handful times I have met her by her first name and he has now told me that she finds it disrespectful. 

When I was young, I did used to call my family friend’s ‘aunty’ as a sign of respect, but it’s important to note I used that expression in another language so I am not actually calling them ‘aunty’ in English, and I also used that expression coupled with their name, similar to when we call someone ‘Mrs. (last name)’ in English.

bzrv1f	2019-06-12 14:24:33	thr0waway__777	WIBTA for refusing to drive my mom if she goes into my room?	"Hi all! I (19F) came home for the summer and am currently living with my family. Something that I have noticed has been that they tend to go into my room without permission. Like, my door is normally closed, and my parents will check on me. I also know that my mom will open the door while I am asleep, since my closed door will open at around 3:30am, and will be closed when I wake up that day.

Another thing to note is that I am one of two people in my house who can currently drive. My mom was recently injured and my dad works, so I have been driving her all over the place. I have no siblings that can drive currently, and my dad would probably need to take off from work if I did not drive her places.

Today, was the last straw for me. I am fine with being woken up, but only if it is an emergency. My mom decided to wake me up at 8:30am (I had an activity at 4pm today, but I have no reason to be up at 8:30am) because I forgot to put my retainers on last night. After telling her that it's too early and to get out of my room, she yelled at me at how ""just because my SO does not wear them does not mean that I don't need to,"" ""you know that SO and you probably will not last forever,"" ""your room needs to be cleaner because there is 'no path' (to clarify, my laptop which she moved was on the floor because I was using it),"" and to put the retainers in. Normally, I would ignore these comments, but I was tired and cranky so I yelled at her to get out of my room (she has made these sorts of comments when I am more awake). While I understand that she is concerned for me, I do not appreciate being woken up at 8:30am on a day when I do not need to because I am a light sleeper, which she knows. I would not be able to fall back asleep to wake up later unless I naturally woke up. Another factor is that I do wear the retainers 3-4 times a week, and just forgot that night.

&#x200B;

Being annoyed, I am considering implementing a policy of that I will not be driving anyone if I am woken up so needlessly early. This would partially be to prevent the unwarranted visits at random times, but also I kinda feel like she knows that I had a lot of relationship issues in the past and that I do not appreciate her comments of that nature, considering that she likes my SO.

Note related to my driving: I am not comfortable driving on highways, and have gone out of my way to route ways to get my mom where she needs to in a way where I would be comfortable driving. The car is the one that was not in the crash, and not mine.

So Reddit, WIBTA if I told her that I am not willing to drive her if I am woken up at a time that is too early (This would probably be quantified as an hour before a planned activity that has been known about for longer than 3 days)?

&#x200B;

Edit: I do want to clarify that I have said that I do not want people going in and out of my room at random intervals, and that I am annoyed mainly by the lack of respect towards my privacy that seems to be given. I do see that this is probably not the best solution, but the intention was more about the disrespecting of wanting people not coming into my room while I am sleeping and the door is closed instead of that I was woken up at 8:30am. Also, I currently have a coin lock on my door and noticed that every time the door was locked at night, it would be unlocked by the time I woke up."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I bought the ticket for myself, which was very expensive. He said he would pay part of it (he earns more than me, I still depend on my parents).

The band he likes had a concert before, when I wasn't there, and I told him back then to go. He didn't want to because he was scared of going there by himself and getting lost in the venue.

I want to apologize in advance for my English and for formatting. I am on mobile and English is not my first language. Sorry for the long post. 

I (F25) still live with my mom, my stepfather and my little sister. 
I work since I am 17, and all my money used to go to my mom when she divorced my dad. I didn't get to spend anything on me. She was all alone supporting two kids back then, so I always understood. 
I managed to save a little bit and I managed to pay my college degree(almost everything) as well. 

Even with the money I was giving her, she was not able to pay for our food, accomodation, etc, so she put herself into debt and afterwards, she put me too when I was only 18. I was not aware, at 18, of the implications that this would have in my life and she always assured me it would be ok and I wouldn't have problems. I have not touched or used that money ever. 
Due to this, I am not able to move out yet, because I am saving to pay the debt first. I can't even have my own debit card and have to rely on others. I have a good job which I like, but I am still not paid much. 
We agreed that I would not give my Mother money and I would be staying in her house until I pay all of my debt, and she told me she would help me pay. 
I eat and sleep basically for Free in my house and I have been saving quite a bit until now.  
My Mother still struggles,even with my stepfather living there. I ocasionally lend them money and I pay for some of my sister stuff to help but that is it. I also lended her a big amount of money this year.

Last night, we were having dinner and my Mother started making remarks about me not helping her and that other kids help their parents. 
 I told her that other kids don't have the debts that I do. My Mother then proceeded telling me I prefer to spend money on other stuff, like eating in expensive restaurants (which I ocasionally do, with my boyfriend but only now and then). 
I feel i am entitled to spend some of my money on myself since I work very hard and  want to have quality of life too and be able to hang out with my friends.
She then told me she would not be helping paying for my debts because I earn more than her, so I should be able to pay them all for myself. 
 I screamed to her she was very toxic to me, and she was always messing with my head and manipulating me. 

She cried too and I know I hurt her deeply. She is heartbroken and she told me now she actually wants to help me pay, but she can't because she doesn't have money .
She also told me she feels very guilty and wishes she could do more for me. She is very overwhelmed by having to pay almost everything by herself. All she did was for us, and I know that, she always put us first in e very decision she made. She didn't do any of this with ill intention. 

Im feeling terrible for what I have said to her.

It has a pool near the administrative office open during the summer but also warmer months of the school year. Ever since it opened last semester I always tried to walk by it when I was headed to class or to something on campus, because it always has bikini clad girls sunbathing or hanging out by it.

Some might see it as creepy but I don't stare or anything, I just try to pass by it instead of some random buildings because it's a much nicer view than those. Is that an asshole thing?

bzrppi	2019-06-12 14:11:25		AITA for getting upset that my ex boyfriend (who is currently not speaking with me) is staying with my best friend & girlfriend for Pokémon Go Fest?	"I broke up with my boyfriend a couple of months ago and we’ve been trying to be friends and it hasn’t been working. At one point, things were good and he asked me if he could have my best friend’s number because him and his friend were going to Chicago for Pokémon go fest and he really liked him when they met over the holidays. I didn’t want him to be upset or cause an argument so, I said yes. I called my friend right there and then and it turned into those two having a completely separate conversation and excluding me all together. I immediately regretted my decision...

His friend won tickets through the lottery system so, my ex had just found out at the time. I tried explaining to him how uncomfortable this is for me and how it’s weird that my ex boyfriend and his female best friend (and no, it’s absolutely not romantic, believe me...) is staying with my best friend and his girlfriend. He got upset with me because I was the one that said yes to it, but again, I just didn’t want to have an argument. He thinks he’s right and there’s nothing wrong with this because I said yes and he liked my friend when they met. 

So, even though I said yes, am I still wrong for feeling upset and uncomfortable about this? Or did I just dig my own grave?"		1	0

bzrpgs	2019-06-12 14:10:51		AITA for asking the money back from my father which I have been lending him over almost 1 year?	"Hi guys,

I have been lending my father very huge chunks of my monthly salary because he was trying to set up his own business and was also struggling financially since he quit his job 1-2 years ago to have his own business. He promised that he'd be returning all the money that he takes. I am a recent college graduate and been working full time for about 11 months now.

It's been a bit difficult for me too as I don't have much savings for myself due to starting earning very recently and at times he'd ask for so much money that I am barely left with money to last me only one week. ""Fortunately"" he did this on last week of the month so that I'd get my next salary by then. I did not complain much because I wanted to support him.

Today, he calls me up and tells that he wants me to take a loan from the bank because he wants to invest it in business(which is going poorly afaik) and also to pay off his EMIs since he got a legal notice due to defaulting on a few home loan EMIs. The bank apparently won't give him any more loans because of his poor credit scores. I refused to give him anymore financial support and asked him to return the money that he has taken so far asap. I think it pissed him off and he started calling me irresponsible and selfish and reminded me how he payed for all the years of education and college. He has a  good point I suppose.

Ofcourse I am more than willing to pay for their daily needs like groceries and all in case things get really bad but I don't want to share my father's financial burden or his poor business decisions. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

One of the perks is that I got a small dog walking job for the manager, being paid £5 for around an hours walk with two gorgeous, albeit large, dogs. Recently, my manager asked me to dogsit for a week while she’s on holiday. Staying at her house, walking and feeding the dogs and caring for her two cats. She offered to get the food for me and the internet. All of this I was really happy to do, and agreed. All I asked was to be paid £30 for the entire thing and be allowed to bring over my PS4 for something to do. She didn’t even have to pay me all of it upfront, I was happy to take £10 and get paid the rest after the holiday. 

She immediately started talking about how she wanted to ask other people to see if she could get it for free, but I was her first pick because I was reliable. (Clearly I’m not her first pick if she’s looking into other people). I just want a straight answer about whether or not she wants me to dogsit so I know if I need to make arrangements. WIBTA if I asked her to just give me a yes or no? I know she has money problems (hence the cheap price, originally I was going to ask for £10 a day) but I feel like she isn’t taking me seriously and I’m honestly starting to feel insulted.

"My 60+ year old aunt who lives across the country has no children and has started giving her old jewelry to her female family members, myself included. She has expressed that she is doing this so we will ""remember her"" when she's gone. She isn't sick or anything, she just wants us to be thinking of her while we wear it. Starting now. 

The thing is, none of us would ever wear the items she sends us. Not only are they extremely cheap costume jewelry, the pieces often arrive tangled, tarnished, and/or broken. That aside, at least speaking for myself, I'm nearly 40 years younger than her so the things she sends are not even my style. It honestly feels like she's been purging her jewelry collection and sending us what she doesn't want anymore rather than throwing it away. There is never any card explaining the story behind what she sends, just a tangled bag of costume jewelry. 

My aunt has gotten upset previously when we haven't expressed as much gratitude as she expected. I do call to say thank you but it's hard for me to conjure as much gratitude as she expects for something I don't like and that comes across as thoughtless. My aunts (her sisters) and my dad (her brother) intervened at one point to ask her to stop sending us her old jewelry because she's right, no one in the family appreciates it as much as she does, some of us can't even wear it due to skin allergies, and that we'd be more grateful for $25 donations in our name to the charity of her choice. She didn't stop. 

For my milestone birthday she sent me a bracelet that looked new and a necklace that didn't. Neither are my style and I don't think I'd ever wear them but they aren't bad. Right out of the box I could tell that this was different than the old jewelry she sent me previously. The necklace is very simple with a tiny precious stone. My aunt included a note in her card explaining that the bracelet is ""mine"" but the necklace is ""hers"" and I should let her know if I don't like it. 

Even if that wouldn't make me TA, I feel like telling someone that you don't like their gift is extremely poor etiquette so I don't think I'll say anything when I call her tonight. On the other hand, I don't know if this necklace is meaningful to her in some way and if she'd want it back if I don't love it as much as she does.

bzrm6i	2019-06-12 14:03:06		AITA for silently uninviting my BIL?	"This is one of those #firstworldproblems, but bear with me.

My husband and I were going to go to a local event next month. I had casually invited my BIL (husband’s little brother) to go with us, and he agreed.

When I went to buy the tickets, I was about to hit submit on buying 3, but then changed it to 2 for several reasons.

I *know* my BIL isn’t going to have fun. He does this thing all the time. He agrees to go somewhere because he’s bored and wants to get out of the house, but then complains about the weather, how his knees hurt, talks about video games relentlessly (I’m not exaggerating when I say he literally doesn’t talk about anything else for longer than a couple of minutes), and it’s just not a fun experience for him or me, and usually results in us leaving early. My SO doesn’t care either way, usually.

So, at the last second I decided he wasn’t going, and only bought two tickets. I told my SO, and he was oddly frustrated with me. He said it was rude to invite my BIL only to not buy him a ticket (I’d like to point out it was my money). My SO has made a similar decision before, so I really didn’t think it would matter, but now he’s got me feeling like a dick.

To be fair, though, my BIL honestly doesn’t even know the date of the event, has never once talked about the event other than sending a quick “Ok” text when I asked if he wanted to go, and honestly probably wouldn’t realize the event passed if we didn’t say anything. I could see him being a little hurt if my SO said something like, “We decided we didn’t want to go with you.” but if we kept silent he would literally never know. He honestly doesn’t care that much, he just wants to get out of the house (and I don’t particularly feel like it’s my responsibility to do that for him).

It might help to maybe know that my BIL is a 24 year old “failure to launch” man child. I love the guy, but when Life eventually creeps up on him, he’s going to have a bad time. I think ultimately my husband just feels bad for him, but maybe that’s irrelevant. Point is, BIL looks to us to make plans for him, and I don’t want to go to this event catering to his needs.

I share a double room with one other girl, who we'll call N. N and I get along very well for the most part, except for one thing. Before I moved in, I received a doctor's note qualifying me for an A/C unit in my room. The building is not air conditioned and A/C units are only allowed when deemed medically necessary. Although we haven't hit the dead of summer, it's been pretty warm in the building so I tend to keep the A/C going all the time when I'm home. However, N consistently turns the A/C down or off when she gets home from work. The other day, I asked her to stop doing that when I am in the room. I explained that I have the unit for medical reasons, so if it is on that means that I need it. She got a bit defensive and said that it was too cold in the room, and that the noise from the unit was bothering her. I don't want her to be uncomfortable in the room, but I do have a legitimate need for the room to be cool and dry. AITA for telling her to stop messing with my A/C?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks to everyone who has offered advice! I've texted my roommate and we're going to grab coffee during our lunch break and talk it out. Up until this issue things have been great, so I'm hoping we can work it out.

Edit2: We had a really productive conversation and have worked things out where we will both be comfortable. Just to be clear, she does NOT have a medical condition and does not mind the AC being on when she is sleeping, only when she is working on her summer coursework in our room and the fan is on high. We've agreed to keep it on the low fan setting and around 72-73 degrees when she is working, which she is perfectly comfortable with as the noise is pretty negligible at that level and it's cool enough for me to remain happy and healthy. The best of all worlds, as nobody has to pick up and find a new place to stay. Thank you to everyone who weighed in!"	No A-holes here	0	0

bzrjxt	2019-06-12 13:57:56		AITA for not acknowledging my partner when she woke from a nap?	"Last night, GF texts that she’s gone from work and tired. I just got to the gym after dropping my 11yo son off at moms and text back, why don’t you take a nap and I’ll either bring home take out, heat up left overs or we can go out for dinner. I’m doing 30 min cardio and will be right home. Romantic sentiments also sent. She acknowledges and says left overs are fine. 
I finish the gym, go home and walk in the door. She scares me as she pops up off the couch from a nap. I grab a drink. Give her a forehead kiss and go take a post work out drink while she naps. 

I come back in and get left overs out. Heat up, plate, drinks, and put on the table. I go give her a nudge that it’s ready. She mumbles a bit but stays asleep. I take an outside breather, but she doesn’t get up. Figuring she needs the sleep (she’s up very early for work and has a long day), I eat. Cover her food and put it in the fridge. 

I go outside and read some threads on this very board and then wakes up to come outside for a smoke. I believe I said ‘Hey’, but I was pretty engrossed in one of the threads. She goes in. I go in. Instead of eating. I see she’s cleaning up. Tell her, her food is in the fridge and then she angrily chastises me for being on the phone. 

I could tell she was upset by something before the comment. So, before she made the comment,  I asked about her day. Gave hug, etc. didn’t realize that she was so taken aback by me looking at my phone was the problem. 

I am pretty livid about this. Since I feel I did give acknowledgement to her earlier and really wasn’t expecting to have to drop everything because she was now ready to engage. I’ve done a lot of switching gears of the last three hours. I’m taking my ten minutes of break and engaged in something I was enjoying. Should I have to drop everything once my partner decides they are now up and ready to do something? I wasn’t expecting that. 

I do feel she’s disproportionately critical of others phone usage. I see her on hers with all the typical 40 something phone usage. Facebook, Instagram, text and messenger. I don’t get bothered by it. But she’s give me, and those in her family (mom, sister, adult daughter) admonishment for using them. 

I was mad. But I did give a half hearted apology for not engaging and taking a chill out with something other than her. 

I do feel it’s one of the big differences we have. We both engage in different flavors of media in what we watch, enjoy, choose to spend down time with.

bzri0o	2019-06-12 13:53:08	silver_almond	AITA for being hard to my brother and parents	"I am the oldest of 5. I'm 22m, number 2 is 19m,  3 is 16f, 4 is 8m and 5 is 2f.

Both our parents work in office. Me, 2 and 3 were born in this condition, so we don't receive that much of affection when we were little. They left before we wake up and came home when we're already asleep. Fortunately, we understood the situation pretty early for our age, and we didn't really ask a lot as a kid. They also thought us well, to not be entitled to anything, be humble. They were quite hard most of the time, rarely went physical but nothing abusive, and that mould us into a tough personality.

After high school I went abroad for my study. Somewhere along the way, I received the news that we're gonna have a fifth. Long story short she was born, and we're all grateful. I came back for good at late December last year, and dear God am I surprised. After 5, Mom decided to take a 2 year hiatus from work so she can take care of her properly. I was against this, but then my grandma suffered from dementia just 3/4 months prior to my homecoming and she's staying in our house now, so she's taking care of her too hence my argument is nullified.

With 4, however, since my mom is now staying at home, he's been a real pain to deal with. His school is pretty close, so when we used to have a nanny, one of her task is to deliver his lunch as well. About the same time with my arrival, she left. Dad didn't really want to risk mom riding a motorbike every hot noon just to bring his lunch, so 4 was given 2 choice; either bring it himself when he go or join the school catering. He doesn't want to join the catering because the rice is hard and cold, he says. But he also doesn't want to bring it himself. Dad snapped, he cried, he ended up agreeing to bring one in the morning. What surprises me is during the following week after the agreement, mom somehow lied to dad so 4 can have his lunch hot, fresh, and delivered. She said the side dish aren't ready yet, or the rice isn't ready. Now, 3 is in high school, she goes to school about 2 hours earlier than 4, and somehow mom is always forcing her to bring lunch, even someday only rice with egg or something along those lines. 3 told me, I told dad and we both talked to mom. She was sorry blablabla, and it ends. 

That wasn't his only spoiled behaviour, though. He often take what we store in the fridge for ourselves, and is a crybaby. Me and 3 has always been hard to him. 2 is a bit more calm and composed but pretty much the same. Problem is, whenever we talked about this to mom and dad, the response is either ""give him a break, he's still a kid."" Or ""let him have his childhood for a bit longer, having 5 kind of rob him of it."" We just straight up giving up. They also call us out sometimes for 'being too harsh', we didn't do anything abusive though, just a lot of tough love, so our response is always ""you guys are too soft. We're being hard so he can still have a future.""

bzrhtu	2019-06-12 13:52:37	friendofagoodperson	WIBTA for not allowing my best friend's cheating husband to come around me or my family?	Here is the story: My best friend's husband cheated on her. Not to get to into the details of the affair but he had a long term affair with a coworker who was his subordinate, never apologized to my friend, decided to walk out on her and the kid, manipulated her extensively, etc. To be fair to him the marriage had not been great. That's about as fair to him as I can be because I can't bring myself to think that's an excuse. My friend has been devastated and has been forced to become a single mother because he wanted little to do with her and their kid. She keeps hoping that, even though he treated her like shit (told her he hated her) that he will come back. I never thought he would come back but recently he has been showing interest in coming back (probably because his girlfriend left him). He's still not apologized. If they were to get back together WIBTA for telling her that I love and support her but that I won't be around him or let him be around my family? I want to give her support but at the same time his behavior IMO is equivalent to emotional abuse and I don't want to support that.

\-------------------------------------------

Around 1.5 years ago, one of my coworkers (Zach) went on keto and had great results. He dropped a significant amount of weight, and said it helped 'cure' his depression. Which is great!

What isn't great is that since then, he hasn't stopped talking about keto - not just with me, but with pretty much anyone who has working ears. I honestly can't remember the last time I had a conversation with him that didn't involve *something* about keto.

""I got pimples from eating some bread last night""

""You know that slice of pizza has, like, 40 grams of carbs right?""

""I don't even *miss* eating carbs""

""You know you could never eat carbs again and be healthy, if not healthier?""

Long story short, I got tired of hearing it real quick, as did many (if not most) of our other coworkers. I always thought about politely asking Zach to tone the keto talk down, but in the end I never did since our shifts haven't overlapped much in the past 4-5 months and thus, I don't really see him all that often.

HOWEVER, recently I've found my patience running extremely thin. I can grit my teeth and endure the frequent (and snide) keto comments, but lately his quips have been escalating. The last straw occurred the other week when we ended up with the same shift, resulting in us taking our lunches at the same time and me suffering through another keto spiel. And unlucky for me, Zach had new 'wisdom' to bestow upon me. Here are some highlights:

""CICO is bullshit; it's doesn't matter how many calories you eat, only your macros matter""

""People that lose weight counting calories fuck up their metabolism""

""I'll never feed my kids cow milk; milk makes people fat""

""Keto cures mental illness""

Etc.

I'm not certified in anything health or nutrition related, but nothing he said seemed correct to me. I was honestly pretty angry afterwards for having to sit through 40 minutes of, IMO, misinformation presented as fact, and I was still stressed about it a day or so later. I believe Zach's personality plays a part in my disdain for his talks; he tends to come off as arrogant and authoritative and has a small history of doing/saying problematic stuff at work as well that's remained under the leadership team's radar.

Since then, I've been seriously considering asking him to stop talking about health and fitness altogether, or at least keto. Something like 'Hey I know you're really into keto but I don't really share that passion. Could we leave it behind and talk about other things?'. I hesitate because I feel like an AH for requesting Zach to stop talking about something that obviously brings him happiness, and especially because I don't even see him that often anyway. AITA?"

Both doors can be opened by the driver  and the passengers from the inside. The only way to pay fare is at the front door where the driver can see so that's how people usually enter. Yesterday the bus was very crowded, especially at the front, and there were many people waiting in line outside. I was standing nearest to the back door when I see a man clearly gesturing to me to open it and let him enter. I ignored him. Eventually, someone else opened the door for him. He says to me ""Are you fucking blind? Can't you see I'm trying to get on?"" to which I said that I have no idea if he paid the fare or not. My reasoning was that if the driver had seen him pay and wanted to redirect him to the back door because it was less crowded (or for whatever other reason) the driver would have opened the back door.

bzrfgi	2019-06-12 13:46:22	12345esther	WIBTA if we’d cut out our sister(IL) completely?	"Last Sunday, we celebrated my father in law’s birthday. My boyfriend (37), myself and my teenage daughter were invited, as was my Sister in Law (no kids), her husband (H), her boyfriend (BF) and her husband’s girlfriend (GF). They’ve been in this polyamorous relationship for about two years and they all get along fine. All fine with me.
 
SIL (PhD in neuropsychology) left the ‘rational’ world after a burn-out and became quite… spiritual. Into healings, yoga, gluten free, afraid of wifi radiation, miracle powders (‘it’s not a pyramid scheme, it’s a network approach’), that type. SIL believes in aliens, or ET’s, as she calls them. H, BF and GF are all utterly convinced of this as well. She thinks her ET-guide (let’s call him D, aliens have their privacy as well) uses her to heal people. We think they’re crazy as hell, but hey, live and let live. We only see them like twice or three times a year anyway. They do know we don’t believe in any of that shit and do not want to be involved.
 
Last Sunday at my PIL’s house, BF declared to my boyfriend that he’s an uncle. I was quite surprised, knowing SIL’s infertile, but BF explained that they had an invisible child together. About a year ago, SIL got ‘pregnant’, because the ET-doctors had said so. After a few months, she went to a (human) doctor, who told her she wasn’t (and had never been) pregnant. A lot of confusion, but she still believed she was pregnant (surely the ET’s wouldn’t lie). 6 months later, she ‘gave birth’ to an ‘energetic child’. The child then went to live with D on his starship.
 
All this while, we kept a straight face. The BF asked if we would like to ‘meet’ this imaginary alien baby. We weren’t too thrilled, but they kinda pushed it. Funny side note: the baby was with another alien, since D ‘was on holiday’. At this point, I couldn’t hold it back any longer and cried with laughter. No hard feelings from their side by the way. After I calmed down, my SIL started ‘channeling’: eyes fluttering, rapid arm movements, heavy breathing, talking in a strange tone of voice, and just taking A-Lot-of-Time. She let ‘the baby talk’ to us, wanting us to sing a song, making us all hold hands, etc. Later, BF said they were trying to bring the baby back to earth, where lizard people live would live who could transform into humans. If the baby would be there, then it could take a human form and they could all be reunited. We just sat it out.
 
The whole afternoon had just been about them: very little attention for my FIL. When we drove home, boyfriend was furious. He’s really fed up and doesn’t ever want to see his sister again, because they just can’t keep their craziness to themselves. I’m slightly more nuanced: I suggested not meeting them like this again, but occasionally meeting his sister on, for example, her own birthday – when the day really is about her. But he’s just really through with her/them. Would we be the assholes if we’d cut her out completely?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzrf7s	2019-06-12 13:45:45	Sintharius	AITA for not wanting to go with my mother's attempt at playing doctor?	"Hello folks,

I'm a about-to-graduate physical therapy student living in South East Asia.

My mother was a public health professional; in my country this means that she does not have a license to practice medicine. From what I know of her, she is severely lacking in basic anatomy and other knowledge that is required for a clinician.

After I started studying physical therapy in the Netherlands, she suddenly got it into her head that once I finish studying I can just go back and teach people into physical therapists - experience be damned. So after I returned home to start my internship for my last year, she was recruiting medical students of completely unrelated fields to work for her with dirt cheap salary and expecting me to train them into physical therapists. She bought various machines - some with actual health benefits, some completely untested - and thinks that it makes her a doctor. One time she told a friend to get off hypertension and diabetes meds right in front of my face! My father, who is a retired cardiologist, had an argument with her that day because he, like I, saw her advice as foolish. Naturally she ignored it and continued to tell people that diet and her machines can completely replace medications.

Right now she is hell bent on trying to get me to train completely unqualified people into physical therapists. I do not think I am cut out for teaching, and I do not want to work in an environment where I am forced to teach a medical profession in the absence of people with actual skills (she did not want to hire actual physical therapists). Our relationship has been tense since then.

Here, malpractice is punishable by jail and a large fine. I do not want to be there when the fallout of her trying to play doctor happens and she is saddled with a fine - or worse, landed herself in jail for crippling/killing a patient.

Am I the asshole for refusing to play along with her attempt to play doctor?  

Edit to add situation: I am currently living at home and spending my days alternating between working at a private hospital for training my skills and at her office. She was pressuring (more like guilt tripping now that I think about it) me into doing it because she wanted me to do something useful to her - and she has a dream of making a retirement house of sorts. But health care personnel is short in our country, so her solution to that was... to make her own school instead of just pointing prospective students in the direction of an existing university/college that is already teaching physical therapy."

bzrea0	2019-06-12 13:43:18	PillowWalrus	AITA for not giving my friend a water bottle?	"This happened back in high school and I'm 30(M) now, but new to Reddit and particularly this sub so wanted to get your thoughts. I remember this every now and then and have always wondered if I was really TA.

A little backstory: I grew up in a typical middle class neighborhood with 3 siblings (I'm the oldest of four). We had a basketball hoop in our driveway, and we'd play 3v3, knockout, 21, etc often with other kids in the neighborhood. One of those kids was M, who was my age. We played on the HS basketball team together and our families were friends. I'd go over his house a lot and help him with Spanish or Math homework, and we'd play pool or video games (I was more or less a benchwarmer but generally one of the more intelligent people in our class, and he was a jock). His mom usually made cookies or snacks for us and was always very welcoming. I liked M, but in the interest of full disclosure always thought he and his family had a very high opinion of themselves (e.g. shirtless professional photos of their sons framed in the hallways).

Of note, we had a fridge in our garage where my parents stored water bottles that they'd give us for lunch (they packed all 4 of us a brown bag lunch every day, bless them). Money was never really an issue, but my parents were conservative financially and costs add up quick when you've got 4 kids. 

So one hot summer day, a few of us including M were playing basketball in my driveway. At some point after we finished a game, M asked if he could grab a water bottle from the fridge. My mom had asked us to save those for our lunches, but we could fill up pitchers with ice and water just through the garage door in the kitchen. I told M I would just bring out a pitcher and some cups, and we could all drink from that instead. When I came back outside after grabbing the pitcher, I saw him driving away back to his house. 

I IMed him later (on AIM, lol) asking why he had left. He sent me back a string of IMs calling me a bunch of nasty things, and was very upset that I wouldn't give him a water bottle (as opposed to using a pitcher). His position was that his mom was always very accommodating and offered water, soda, etc whenever I was over, and I was being rude and disrespectful by not doing the same. If he was really that upset over a pitcher vs a bottle, I would've just let him have one but he never made any objection before he drove off. He just dipped. Anyway, we didn't talk for a while and it was pretty awkward.

bzre4o	2019-06-12 13:42:56		AITA for demanding a diagnosis?	"I have been to therapy for quiet a long time. I also changed therapists once and since then I stayed with my therapist. I have been to her sessions since roughly 2016 and she was sure about me having social anxiety and (severe) depression.


In the beginning of our sessions she mentioned me having a small chance of having a Borderline personality disorder, but let that slip as soon as I tried hypnosis. Just a few months back I asked her to test me on BPD, because I am sure that I do have it after researching it myself. I show roughy six of nine symptoms, some are major and some aren’t. Both my therapist and psychiatrist didn’t want to test me, since this diagnosis wouldn’t do me any good. It has a really bad stigma.


After some time convincing, my therapist let me do the test, telling me that I surely don’t have it and that I’m too soft and not violent at all. In the mean time a lot of stuff happened, which is why she still hasn’t told me the result. 

One session, where I wasn’t feeling as bad as usual, she told me that she has looked through it roughly and that she sees the tendencies to having bpd. But on the other hand that she doesn’t think it’s a good idea to diagnose me with that.

I feel like forcing her to diagnose me, but also I just really wanna know if i have it or not.. so AITA?"	Asshole	1	0

bzrcvq	2019-06-12 13:39:47	quackyninja	AITA for not telling my friend about a crush on a mutual friend?	"For context: 
My friend group is comprised of six people: Amy, Sunny, Jane, Vincent, Frank and me. 

So for about a few months, I've had a pretty big crush on Amy. In the beginning, I only told Sunny, the person in the group I feel closest to. Historically, she's been the most supportive so going to her seemed natural. 

A few months pass, the crush doesn't go away and I tell Vincent and Frank so that they can give me some advice or support from a male perspective.

I decided not to tell Jane because she's the closest to Amy and because, from experience, she not great with secrets. 

Around the same time, I was feeling a little down because the girls kept canceling on plans that I initiate with the group in the last minute. Jane didn't know why I was upset and decided to ask Frank if he knew what was up. Frank subsequently let slip that it might be because I don't know what to do about my crush on Amy, while under the impression that Jane already knew. (Found this out last night after Frank told me)  

Jane then texted me to ask what was wrong. I then explained how I felt like I wasn't very valued as a friend and that I often felt left out of group activities and small interactions. This conversation was resolved with Jane saying that it wasn't her intention to ""flake"" so much and that she would try better. 


Fast forward to today with the group: we had been hanging out all morning, but everyone seemed to be a bit spaced out, Jane especially so. At lunch, when the other two girls had gone to a nearby convenient store, I asked Jane if she was okay (not really having the whole Amy ordeal in mind). She instantly froze up and became unresponsive and when I pressed a little further, broke down quite hard saying that ""I told everybody else but her about the Amy thing."" Saying that this is the kind of thing I was complaining about with our text conversation. She then subsequently stormed out of the restaurant saying ""I don't know what you want"" and asking ""do you not trust me?"" with tears streaming down her face. 

I do see where she's coming from and I feel bad for driving her to a point where she broke down to tears by holding in this secret, but I also had my reasons:

- Jane is probably the one closest to Amy within our group. So I didn't want to risk it getting out to her accidentally. 
- I had good reasons for telling the people I did, and didn't want to tell more. The more people that know, the bigger chance it spreads accidentally (note Frank's slip up)
- Jane is not great with secrets. Vincent told me that as soon as she had alone time with him and Sunny, being under the assumption they didn't know, she told them my secret very explicitly. It was described to me by Vincent as Jane being very excited to tell them. This sort of justifies my not telling Jane in my mind and makes me feel like her ""Do you not trust me?"" comment is manipulative.

bzrcdn	2019-06-12 13:38:33	whineywifey	AITA For wanting my parent to do more work	"My partner and I are both doing research PhDs, we work and live together. Aside from this one issue we are very happy,so I don't need people's relationship advice, I just want judgement on this problem.

We will be submitting our theses in December, and I typically, people will keep working in the lab until maybe two months before the thesis is due then spend the last two months writing. We both have very different projects, but work in the same field (biology). John gets very stressed out about deadlines, in the past when writing large bodies of work, he'll be fully withdrawn, work excessive hours.

He's really ineffiecient and he knows it. He regularly comes to me for advice about his work, and I'll spend hours helping him with his research, making good plans for how to get stuff done etc. I'm worried that when it comes to the time we are both getting ready to write, things are going to be miserable. Ive expressed this to him and suggested that on weekends or days where he hasn't much to do in the lab that he starts doing little bits of writing work. He said it was a great idea, but won't do it. He'll spend a hours everyday in work on reddit or doing unrelated tasks that should be done at home. He's already considerably on his work  behind than versus an average PhD. He knows this.

I've been begging him to try and start working slightly longer days now, instead or waiting until September and becoming a moody hermit for four months. He just shrugs it off and says he'd rather play his play station or look through reddit. I don't need him to be as efficient as me, but at least try to work consistently. 

I know when he starts writing his thesis he will constantly be asking me to proof read, give him suggestions, and help loads. I have my own thesis to do, I don't want to do a second one at the same time. But he's said he will be relying on my help.

I told him he needs to get his shit together (more tactfully, but the same message) and that if he can't bother to work consistently now, get off his damn phone, but down his video games and just cop the fuck on, I'm not wasting my time helping him. He is so ludicrously slow at doing anything because he gets distracted, or just doesn't bother.

I keep expressing how concerned I am that we'll both be miserable for months if he doesn't work on it now. I wouldn't mind as much if I didn't know he'll be brooding at home for months, and expecting my help every step of the way. He's started complaining that I stress him out about it (comes up once every couple weeks and has done for about a year, but typically is the form of 'what's your plan for the day, you could get that on before our coffee break, or other suggestions to get him working. It's rarely complaining that we're going to be miserable). I just want to help him while I have the time to help now, because I can't in December. Am I the asshole for always encouraging him to go work and sometimes complaining that he ignores my advice and doesn't care how upsetting this will be?"	Asshole	0	0

I said I work in the service industry and don’t trust the cleanliness of the mugs and would rather use the paper cup. 
Rather than just saying okey. He said I was wilfully polluting the earth. 
I said i’m okey with that and pointed out the tiny tray designated for recycling their paper cups. 
He said those have to be sent across Europe to a specialised plant for recycling to which I nodded and said well if they can be recycled why doesn’t a Starbucks employee sort through their trash and recycle all of the paper cups. 
He then demanded I buy a cheap plastic reusable cup for £1. I said they are just part of the problem, those cups will never disintegrate and by making them so low quality the majority of them most definitely end up in the trash after just a couple uses. 
He just rolled his eyes at me.  

I ended up sitting down with my paper cup and not enjoying any of my drink.

bzrao1	2019-06-12 13:34:07		AITA for isolating myself from my mother when my parents got divorced?	"Hello. 15F here. 

When I was 13 (if I remember correctly) my parents got divorced. I was very torn up over it because I had no idea it was going to happen. 

My dad got an apartment still in the school district, and my mom kept the house. My mom and dad both had half custody of me. I’m pretty sure my mom had more of the custody (maybe full?) because she got child support from my father. I was set to spend a week at her house then a week at his.

At first, I hated going to my dad’s. Not because it’s my Dad. But it was empty and uncomfortable to live in. It was awkward deciding when and what to bring into the house.

As the month’s went on, I spent more time at my Dad’s then my Mom’s. They always stressed that I should choose who to live with whenever, so I decided that it was fine.

But I feel bad for my mom. She went through a divorce, then my sister and I both started to move away. My sister was 19 at the time, and she moved in with her boyfriend.

My mom was really struggling, she had started drinking more and her life was a bit of a mess. She had gotten a job (was previously a housewife and took care of us as her sole job) but she kept going in late. I realize now I should of supported her but I was drawn away by how much she was struggling.

It was easier to go to my Dad’s house basically. He had internet, and the food wasn’t freezer-burnt, I didn’t have to cook. It was comfortable and I had gotten used to the lifestyle. 

Later, my mom had gotten better and she’s a different person today. She had gotten off the drugs she was using, stopped using methadone, and things were looking up. 

In August 2018, my mom and dad moved in together.
They said it was for my best interest, because even when I was spending the correct time at each house desired by the court (1/2 at each house) getting my stuff back and forth was hard, and I kept losing stuff. 

That was before my freshman year, and I couldn’t be more grateful. I had less worries of where my stuff was. 

I still don’t know if my families becoming part of the same house was because I didn’t spend enough time with each family or not. Of what I saw, my mom and dad don’t talk that much anyway. They do what they want to do, in the same house. They seem to be on friendly terms, and I’m glad if that’s the real case.

bzragz	2019-06-12 13:33:36	halkiwebb	AITA for not cleaning up boxes right away	"I work in a repair warehouse and busy season has just started. Instead of twiddling my thumbs looking for stuff to do I suddenly find myself with lots of work, which is nice because I hate having nothing to do. I receive things mostly, parts for stock, parts to repair, parts back from NDT. Because of these I accumulate boxes, lots of little boxes. I usually break them down at the end of the day if I have nothing left to do but lately I’m struggling to get as much finished as possible before leaving as soon as my shift ends so I don’t miss my bus and have to wait another half hour for the next one. 

The guy sitting beside me is a seasonal worker who has been here for just over a month now maybe (near the beginning of May) he has experience in the industry whereas I do not however he was hired with his main job being to move stock into a machine (which makes it easier for me to find parts for technicians when they need them) this of course doesn’t make me “above” him in any way, but it also doesn’t make him above me. 

(I have complained about this guy here twice before so if this all sounds familiar, that’s why. I have difficulty telling what is or isn’t considered rude because I’m autistic though I try to always be aware of my actions and I just don’t want to be a bitch in general)

So this guy hates it when I don’t immediately clean up boxes. It doesn’t affect him (or anyone else for that matter) I stack them neatly and put them under my desk until I have time to deal with them. I am usually just trying to get as much done as possible before I leave so I can try to catch up and I just don’t have time to immediately break down every single box and carry it across the warehouse and outside to the bin as soon as I’m done with it. Idk why it bothers this guy so much, he always seems to ask (or tell) me to do it when I’m in the middle of like 2 or 3 other things as well. Maybe he just likes everything to be absolutely spotless?

There was this one alcoholic divorcee that vomited all over the shower walls, never cleaning it. Pissing on the toilet seat, he moved a house over, and got his ass whooped before leaving. I'm not talking about that cockstain today.

Today, I live with only one other dude. He has said in the past that he views us living together like a brotherhood, though let's be clear, it's only brotherly like doing little tricks like taking a shit, and leaving the door slightly closed immediately after leaving it, fan off. In the early days, seeing the door like that, I thought someone was in there, so it would be hours before I realized no one was in there. When I confronted him about it, he said it's to trap the hot air in the bathroom. It's Summer now. This dude is older than me.

Today, I walked into the bathroom with the door mostly closed (still Summer), just to get a nice smell of shit. It set me off. I am SO SICK OF THIS CHILDISH SHIT, but I literally at first didn't want to make a big deal, so I pushed over a bunch of his shit over. I felt like that wasn't enough, so I poured bleach all over the toilet seat and floor around the toilet.

Sorry guy, I was just cleaning your toilet for you, yo. Nothing to get upset about. Your shits smell healthy by the way, cheers.

So recently its being weighing on me that I don't have ANYTHING to connect with my whom I used to think of as my very close friends for 7 years. It feels like when I try to get along with them it seems like either its not working and when we hang out to have fun I feel like just me being there halves their enjoyment for whatever reason even when I'm not exactly talking a lot there much less make a nuisance of themselves. If anything the only times I get to engage into a group conversation that was seemingly fun is at my expense and they all seem to treat it like its normal or I end up somehow making the mood kinda awkward because they don't exactly share the same interests as I do anymore. It got worse when I finally butted heads with one of them who was in the same group chat as us but has never spoken a fucking word until recently and they seem to be all the best of friends when he never showed up to hang out with us for the past fucking 4 years.

I thought about just leaving but I realise I would stand to gain nothing from it and possibly lose my Nintendo Switch Online Family Pack price which has been doing wonders to help occupy my free time that I wish I could use to play games with them that they will never invite me to. Also being around 20 I feel like I probably will never get a chance to make a really close friend in the future and maybe if I continue staying something good might happen.

I still talk to like 1 or 2 of them from the group but I feel I have completely lost my place in there and it sucks because the past 3 years I have been clinging on them thinking they would help get through these shitty 3 years of my life in Polytechnic but even after that just when I had all the time in the world before going to the Army things start to fall apart between us and I'm starting to feel the vibes I'm getting from them, I thought it was just paranoia but when I asked one of them if they were in a call while watching the E3 Nintendo direct happening live they said yes but when I asked why didn't you call me too he quickly tried avoiding the question. It hurt because his supposedly the closest friend I had among them.....

Honestly its kinda hard to keep this façade going on I thought as guys we could just talk things out whenever things get weird but for some reason they're resorting to all these petty fucking things and it makes it feel like I wasted another 7 years building up something I thought would be a bond that would last a lifetime.

TL;DR felt disconnected with whom I thought are my best friends, they started treating me coldly and now I like leaving the circle but I would have no one to share the Nintendo Online Subscription service with which would help cut costs.

We both strongly and openly support feminism and women’s rights, etc. and it is something that I really value in our relationship. 

Over the course of our relationship I’ve gone from wearing a full face of make up daily to wearing a moderately full face of make up 2 or 3 times a week, usually for a part time job. We’ve had countless conversations about the pressure that is put on women to wear make up and the stigma those who don’t wear it face. I have often expressed that I don’t want to feel like I HAVE to wear it, but rather it’s an option for when I want to have fun with it. 

So yesterday, we were getting ready to go for lunch at the restaurant where I work part time and usually wear make up. I didn’t work that day but said I was going to put on make up because I always wear it there. My fiancé visibly got annoyed and said he wished I wouldn’t. 

This started a large argument, his side being that I should be “stronger” and not fall victim to societies pressure to wear make up, my side being that as a man who has never experienced the pressure of stigma, him judging me for it is unfair. Of course during the argument I got very visibly angry, not yelling but being argumentative and confrontational definitely. 

Near the end of the argument, that never really got resolved, he voiced his concern that my reaction to his opinion was harsh and although he didn’t say it, would make me the asshole in this. 

So, AITA for my reaction/in this argument?

 It wasn’t a good relationship. I found out he was still on Tinder despite us being exclusive, he gaslit me regularly & was emotionally abusive, but blamed it all on his mental health

 5 months in was his birthday & I said I’d treat us to a weekend away. I wanted to book a b&b, but he was unhappy & said a hotel would be better. I told him I couldn't afford this, & he said he’d pay for half. When it came round, he'd forgotten something that weekend & couldn’t go. I moved the booking for a charge. He did this 4 times. Total cost went up from £200 to £240

 We had a rough break up, which included him having a breakdown and was admitted to a private clinic.

 Because of his mental state, I left it 4 months before contacting about the money. I sent a nice gentle message asking if he planned on paying me back sometime. He said he would, but his finances were unstable & didn't know when it would be. He’s not poor, but was in the middle of selling a house so I accepted this

 I texted every 2 months saying hey hope you’re ok, any update?. He’d say no, but soon. After my siblings said it was ridiculous & that I should put my foot down, I sent a more firm message. I asked for an update & he said at the end of the month. I sent a texted explaining that it was getting a bit silly now, and that instalments would be fine, but that we needed to make a plan, as he was being too vague. I said that if there was nothing more definite in the next few months, I’d have to think about small claims court.

 He got upset, told me he’d have an update for me at the end of the month & that was the best he could do. He got very defensive & said that he didn't have to pay me back, he could’ve blocked me, but didn't, & was going to pay me back not because he had to, but because he was choosing to & that I had to wait. I told him I had proof of him agreeing to pay, proof of him causing the booking to be moved & if he refused I would take him to court. I wasn't rude, I said it in the most neutral way I could. He got extremely upset & told me I was being aggressive, threatening & attacking. He eventually told me to check my bank account, & I saw that he'd sent me £20. I asked if this would be monthly & he said yes, but was very rude. I don't have much faith that he will stick to this.

 £140 may not seem like much, but I was made redundant last year, was unemployed for 5 months & have debts to pay off. I also know I'm at fault for ignoring all the red flags, I wish I hadn’t

 I don't want to make his life harder, that's why I've waited so long to do anything. But I just feel he's still taking advantage of me even now"	Not the A-hole	0	0

There is one customer who always wanted (26/f)me to help him (70s/M). I’ve been at this store almost 6 years, and he’s requested me for atleast the last 3. Hes probably been a customer for 20 years.

I don’t think anything weird of this because we all have our “regular customers”. As the years go by we are friendly with each other. He has always bought gifts around holidays for the entire store to share. (Cookies at Christmas, candy at Halloween, etc). A year or 2 ago, he started adding little extra gifts just for me. He always talks to me for longer than most customer, about his life and things going on in the world and I don’t cut him off because it’s my job to be nice to our customers. It’s usually just me listening and reacting to what he says, not me telling personal stuff about myself.

Fast forward to last August, I got engaged. He comes in and sees the ring on my finger, and the usual 20 min conversation was a 2. I didn’t think much of it because there are times he’s been in a rush. 3 months go by and he hasn’t been back in. He finally comes in and asks to speak with me privately. He confesses his love for me and how he’s never met anyone like me in his life, and how he thought we had something and how he thought I was single. Overall very overwhelming conversation because it wasn’t on my radar AT ALL. I didn’t tell anyone at work about this because I didn’t want weird vibes and figured I could handle this myself by still helping him but occasionally avoiding him and letting others help him. His visits have been shorter, and obviously a little weird but he hasn’t stopped being a regular customer.

Yesterday he came in before I got to work and asked for me and my coworkers told him I would be in later. So he came back later, dropped off work to do and gave me a card and left. It made me anxious so I didn’t want to open it at work. I brought it home and told my fiancé about it and that I hadn’t opened it because I was anxious. So we open it together at home and there is a large sum of money in the envelope.

So that brings me to my current situation. I’m not sure what to do about this money, it would obviously help tremendously, weddings are EXPENSIVE. But I don’t know if I can rightly accept this, or if I should seek advice from someone higher up in the company (I’m manager of my department but there is a store manager over me).

TLDR: have regular customer who is friendly with me, over twice my age. Think he’s just nice old man. I get engaged to my boyfriend and the customer confesses their love for me. Customer still comes to store and right before my wedding gave me large sum of money. Thinking about keeping it because it would help, but I feel anxious about accepting something so large."

bzr36z	2019-06-12 13:14:56		AITA for not telling a girl that I saw her drop one of her belongings as I drove past?	"I know I probably am TA for this but would like a little outside perspective.   


There is a girl (probably mid/late 20s) that sells stuff on the beach down the road from my house. Most mornings when I drive to work I see her on the road either walking or waiting for someone I guess. I haven't had many interactions with her but all of them have been negative.   


The first time I met her was on the beach about 6 months ago when I was walking our puppy. Our puppy is the happiest, friendliest dog and LOVES to meet new people. For some reason she took a real dislike to this lady and cowered behind my daughter. This is the only person I've met that she's had this reaction to and we've met hundreds of people walking on the beach. Subsequent meetings of this lady have consisted of her being really pushy and her trying to sell me her crap and not taking no for an answer and puppy cowering away every time. I am not sure if my judgment of her has been clouded by puppy's reaction to her but I do believe that dogs have more heightened senses than we do. I just seem to have the same irrational dislike of her as my dog does.   


This morning as I was driving to work, I saw her ahead of me walking down the road laden with bags (as usual). I saw something fall but couldn't see what it was. As I drove past, I saw she'd dropped what looked like a piece of cloth (looked like that Indian cloth with the small mirrors sewn in). She was just walking and I didn't stop and tell her that she'd dropped something. AITA for not stopping?"		1	0

bzr2j6	2019-06-12 13:13:07	meggles90	AITA for being upset about my ex unexpectedly leaving me stranded with our kids?	"A little backstory, my ex husband and I split custody of our kids. We live about 10min apart so we alternate weeks with the kids.

Ex husbands new fiance (A) is pregnant and in her last month, I have told him that if he needs help with our 3 kids when she goes into labor, I would help as the nearest L&D is at a hospital 30min from here.

Last night he called around 10pm asking if he could drop the kids off because she thought she was in labor so I agreed after he said he would keep in touch with me about making a plan to pick them up today.

My car has a water pump issue and is still leaking and not currently able to be driven at this point. Our oldest walks to school from my house and can take the bus back to dads but our 4yo daughter is not in school and our 5yo is in half day prek. It is a 40min walk to his school and with it being his last week, I really don't want him missing days. 

I had plans to go up and talk to a manager friend about a part time job at a store close by this morning but with the walk to my sons school, it'll be too much in the sun for my daughter. My husband has an appointment at a dealership to hopefully get a new car before he starts his new job next week. This is something I can't go help with now because it's when I would be walking home from dropping my son off at school.

I'm upset because this wasn't supposed to be an all day affair. A was sent home after being told to go back next week to be induced because it's a bit too early (she's 3 weeks from her due date). Ex went to work this morning after getting her home. I never received an update on what was happening and he never bothered to tell me he had work.

If she was in the hospital being induced and such, his mom would be on her way here from her home (1 1/2 hr drive) to pick up the kids and be around to help him out on his time as he should have the kids right now and I wouldn't mind as much.

He hasn't bothered to apologize, doesn't see this as a problem, and now I feel like I'm being childish and getting upset about nothing.

Edit: My offer to help was in place for emergencies as his mom lives far and to account for travel time. The only update i received was this morning saying she is to go back next week to be induced. I have no idea if she was in active labor or what prompted them to go to the hospital."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzr0h7	2019-06-12 13:07:51	biggestpiece	AITA for serving myself the biggest piece of meat?	"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 1/2 years. We live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. We have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. I wouldn't call myself a ""peak bagger"" but I do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when I can. BF doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. 

For reference, I am a 5'3"" 150lb woman. He is a 5'7 170lb guy. 

On Sunday I went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. If you're familiar, it's 13er James Peak in CO. It was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). I had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. Suffice to say, I was pretty hungry by dinner time. I made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. When it came time to eat, because of my big day, I grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. We're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. 

BF got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. He told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. I told him that I'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. 

He told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. I said that I agreed, but again, I'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. He told me I should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. 

We've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). So far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. I think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general.

bzr075	2019-06-12 13:07:08		WIBTA for not letting my girlfriend watch A Star is Born, or spoiling it for her beforehand?	"Spoilers for the movie I guess.

A Star is Born came to theaters around the same time as my girlfriend’s brother took his life.  Now apparently (I haven’t seen the movie yet either), Bradley Cooper’s character takes his life at the end of the movie and it’s a pretty grim and emotional ending.

My gf has had several people tell her that maybe it’s best to not watch the movie yet, and my parents who she’s close with have hinted at it also.

The most recent time someone mentioned to her to hold off on watching it, she asked me why everyone kept telling her to do so. I feel bad because it’s evidently a terrific movie. We love watching movies together and she wants to see it.

She is an emotional, but strong woman in general, but I feel like this type of ending will hit her pretty hard. Completely understandable given her life events the last 8 months.

She really wants to see this movie though. It’s not a question of if, but when. She loves the song “Shallow,” and loves music and movies in general.

So would I be the asshole for letting her watch the movie without spoiling it for her first?  I feel like I could be the asshole for letting her watch something that could be emotionally troubling without giving her a heads up, especially when several of her peers have warned her, as I mentioned.

Or, should I spoil it so she might be emotionally prepared, even if it means, well, spoiling the the ending to a movie. And would I be the asshole for doing this?

I’m stuck. I can’t stop her from watching the movie if she wants, and she has mentioned several times that she wants to."		1	0

"**Short version:**  Wife just left for a 'separation' and immediately started talking to a guy she had an emotional affair with 6 months ago.  Says it's not about him, but it's as clear as day.  I texted him, and she has completely villainized me with things that were untrue.  He asks me if these things were true, I say no and explain the situation.  He says he can fix it and goes on to call her and 'end' things with her. 

 If she was just dating someone afterwards, I could live with it.  I would feel psychotic if I messaged her new boyfriend or whatever.   But for it to be the person that caused this massive rift in my marriage then and now...I'm not going to let that go.

bzqywk	2019-06-12 13:03:58	myfriendcriedAITA	AITA for making my friend cry?	"Hey Reddit, this is a throwaway so downvote it to hell if you so please. 
 
Today and through parts of yesterday I had a fight with my best friend. It started when I was going to an art camp (not overnight) and lost my t-shirt. Now, this would’ve been a big enough deal being the night before we were dying them, but the worse part was how the instructor bought the shirts with her own money. I had a horrible panic attack thinking that everyone was going to hate me and think I was lazy and unorganized. I texted my friend who’s mom drove us to camp (because carpool) and said I couldn’t go. Nothing more,  nothing to pry for, right?

My friend is wondering why I can’t come and after deflecting the question for a while I finally cave and tell her. I told her if I went that day I’d have another panic attack and it would be less pretty in front of everyone. She berates me, tells me I’m being dramatic, and tells me she will still show up at my house without telling her mom (my parents told me to text my friend so they wouldn’t have to text her mom at 10:00 at night and would be upset with me when I said my friend refused to listen).

I wake up the next morning with a plethora of texts from her saying that I was only thinking about myself and I made her cry because she had to go alone. She said she didn’t want me to be like other friends she left for being dramatic which sounded reasonable. Here’s some background: this is the only time I’ve ever had a bad panic attack around her. I told her that I felt like while she may have been trying to help me, she was only fueling my feeling of being out of control of the situation. I said that she knew it wasn’t like me to be “dramatic” like this and I hoped that she would’ve actually tried to be a good friend but instead she ostracized me, made me feel stressed and out of control, and generally upset me. She also threatened me if I were to talk about this to any other girl in our friend group.

I said that we should move past this and that I was sorry. I said that the only reason I was upset was because I felt like she WASN’T sorry for making me feel like that. I told her I was open to listen to how she felt, but instead she said “I don’t want to hear about how you feel” and blocked me. AITA here? Should I throw the whole friend away?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bzqwd9	2019-06-12 12:57:33	mb83	WIBTA if I fired our cleaning service because I don’t like the attitude I got from the owner?	"I realize this is a very first world problem, so maybe I’m just being petty.   

We use a cleaning service on a bi-weekly basis. They do an adequate job cleaning. They’ll do what you ask, but nothing above and beyond. The price is fine, a little on the cheaper end, which is why we keep them. The owner doesn’t do the cleaning - she has employees who do that. The owner handles the bookings. They day before your scheduled service, they send you an email with the time window.   

Yesterday I got the email with the time, but that time ended up not working for us. In the past, I’ve tried to reschedule, but they’re very rigid about the days so I just decided to cancel.   

The owner sent me a note back admonishing me for canceling so late. She said that because I cancelled late, they had other jobs they had to turn down. She also noted that in the past I tried to reschedule so why didn’t I do that now, and that people plan their day around the time they’re arriving (which is fair, but they frequently end up arriving an hour or more early with no notice).   

In all, it felt like I was getting a kind of rude email from someone I pay to do a service for me. This is only the second time I’ve canceled in a year.    

I understand that she is running a business, but if she doesn’t want people to cancel they day before, shouldn’t she send out the schedule farther in advance. I don’t see why it’s incumbent on me to provide more notice than she provides. It’s a schedule and service based business, so I think they need to have flexibility. It honestly kind of ticked me off, so I’m thinking about cancelling all together and finding a different cleaning service.   

I just don’t want to be overreacting. English is not this woman’s first language, so perhaps the tone was a little lost in translation?

"So I F(17) live with just my mom and my sister(18) and things have always been crazy between my mom & sister, for like ever. Always arguing & fighting so the relationship isn’t good. We had to call the cops many times when she was younger, parting all the time with boys with no respect whatsoever to either of us. It got a tiny bit better, but recently, say a few months ago, my sister has absolutely fucking lost it. 

She started to not leave the house, distancing  herself from her friends and prays even more to god then she did before. But not normally, it’s everyday. All day long. I walk into the bedroom, she’s whispering to herself in the mirror, holding a picture of herself with a candle under it. Next she’s screaming at birds, because crows are ‘evil’, and saying ‘cover me in the blood of Christ.. etc’, literally all day long. 

She goes on the balcony and talks to ‘god’ for about an hour and literally does nothing else. It’s not even talking, it’s her looming on her ‘demons’. I also just walked into her baptizing her water bottle, because she truly believes if she’ll make it holy. I wish I was exaggerating. She doesn’t have a job, or go college even tho she’s 18. 

And if either me or my mom say something about it she calls us fucking demons and to get away from her or something. That happened when I told her to wash up the dishes. So we can’t talk to her at all. As I said the relationship is bad. 

But literally me and my mom have gotten so sick of it. Not to mention she’s gotten fucking pregnant without telling the dad and wants to protect her baby from the ‘demons’. I wish I could explain everything but we want her out of this house. Fast. She’s hasn’t even told the dad about the baby so she can’t go there. 

We literally don’t know what to do. I hate her so much, she has been the core of my problems for years and now she’s in the house 24/7, doing nothing, doesn’t want money from the government, and now she’s pregnant and it’s too late to abort it.

So I checked and there was nothing wrong with the phone, except that she'd asked for L1's phone to make a call and somehow reset it, but neither of them now what reset means, or how to set ip up, she didn't even know what an e-mail account was, They both thought l2  had mess up l1's phone really bad, she said she couldn't even make a call or turn the phone on (obviously) .

L2 said if I could fix it She would give 20 bucks, I didn't say anything just kept setting up the configurations. L1 felt relieved when I said done, but there's only one problem. Her gallery was the only place she kept the photos of her pregnancy and the photos of her daughter, so she'd lost all of it, my sister, whose friends with l1 explained that l1's husband didn't allow her to have any social media where she could've saved the photos, so she lost every single one of them. When I explained to her what reset means she started crying, but she thanked me and said at least the phone was working again.

About 30 minutes later l2 came to my house again and gave me the 20 bucks, usually I wouldn't have taken it, but I really need new earbugs so I took it, later my sister told me that l2 took the money out of a bill she was gonna pay today, i felt really bad.

bzqls7	2019-06-12 12:27:35		"AITA For exclaiming ""Jesus woman"" after seeing a video of a female severely overreacting in an inappropriate manner?"	"TL;dr: I think it's okay to exclaim ""Jesus woman, why would you do/say that?"" (depending on the context), as one would exclaim ""Jesus man, why would you do/say that?"". My friend completely disagrees (as so do a few other people I know) and think that is never okay to say ""Jesus woman....."" regardless of the situation. However they are completely okay with the use of ""Jesus man....."", and when asked why one is okay but not the other, they couldn't come up with an answer.



One of my friends showed me a video I'm sure some of you have at least heard of; it's the video where a woman starts yelling and accusing a man of sexual harrassment after he says his name is ""Hugh Mungus"" as a harmless dad joke.

After being shown this video, I said something along the lines of  ""Jesus woman, there was no need for a reaction like that. There were like a million different ways you could've better handled that situation"" 

I used ""Jesus woman"" as an exclamation, such as one would with ""Jesus man, why would you do that"". However, despite explaining this, my friend got semi mad and said ""You can't say that"". He was, however, completely okay with the exclamation ""Jesus man, why would you do that"". When I asked him why one was okay and not the other, he couldn't think of a reason, but he still thought that what I said was wrong. 

So I'm wondering, am I the asshole for saying what I did (with the context that I said in it). I'm completely okay with being the asshole, as long as I'm given a proper reason as why it's completely okay to say ""Jesus man"" but not ""Jesus woman"". The reason also has to have a reasonable explanation, not just saying it's not okay to say ""Jesus woman"".

(I do realize that maybe using ""Jesus woman"" may be seen as inappropriate in regards to the reason I said it, but then again if it were a man in the video that was overreacting, the majority of people I know would've been okay with me saying ""Jesus man...."")"	Everyone Sucks	1	0

Secondly, birthday parties are typically “circle parties”. That means you all sit in a circle in the living room (or garden), and you converse with people next to you. If you want to talk to someone else, you switch chairs when someone gets up, forcing that person to take your spot or look for another empty seat when they come back from the bathroom.

I grew up with this and although I don’t specifically enjoy it, I accept it. But there is one really weird cultural thing I really dislike, and that is congratulating everybody. Let’s say it’s John’s birthday. If you enter the party, you first congratulate John, who probably just opened the door for you so he’s the first one you see. You then go around the circle shaking hands, and you say “congratulations” to everyone. Yes, you congratulate EVERYONE who is at the party.   
 

I think this is a really weird thing to do, and I don’t participate in it. I do congratulate parents or grandparents. After all, they once made a baby and kept it alive, so I feel like I’m congratulating them on a job well done. They took part in the accomplishment of this person going another year around the sun. But I don’t want to congratulate random people I might not even know for no other reason than ""everyone does it"". It makes me feel really awkward for some reason.

Because I don’t want to be rude, I will usually say something like “nice to see you again” or “nice to meet you” when shaking hands.

&#x200B;

Some of my friends thinks I am being rude, because I can just say “congratulations” back. It doesn’t hurt anyone and it’s the culturally correct thing to do.

I disagree, because I acknowledge the person in front of me and I say something that is both nice and appropriate for the moment. I feel I don’t have to comply with this tradition, as long as I am not being an ass about it. I don’t call people out on it, I just give a different, polite reply. Most people don’t even register what I say and just move on to the next person.

&#x200B;

So, AITA for not following convention and congratulating everyone?  
Should I reconsider and just go with the flow, or is my solution a good alternative and is the verdict NAH?

&#x200B;

bzqfv9	2019-06-12 12:11:18	nbellc	AITA for stretching in spandex shorts opposite a church	"About once a week I run speed intervals for training. There aren't any running tracks near my house but about 1km away there is a quiet residential road which is flat, quiet, and almost exactly 400m long (the same length as a track). At the end of the road is a small local parish church. 

&#x200B;

When I'm training intervals I usually jog the 1km to the road to warm up, stop and do some dynamic stretching, and then start my intervals (normally 400 or 800m long). In-between intervals I have short recovery sessions, where I'll sometimes jog slowly, walk, or stretch.

&#x200B;

The other day I was doing some stretching between reps on the bench at the end of the road, which is opposite the church. The weather recently has been fairly warm, but very grey and wet, so I was wearing a lightweight long-sleeve top to keep the worst of the rain off, and spandex running shorts (something like [this](https://www.nike.com/gb/t/fast-running-shorts-2c26G6)) because I figured I would be too hot in leggings. An older woman came up to me and told me that I was being very disrespectful for lingering and stretching in such small shorts outside a church, especially as there were also a lot of primary schools in the area. I apologised and moved onto another street to finish my intervals and stretching, but it wasn't really an ideal place to do speed sets because it's a lot busier and I often end up having to stop for cars during the intervals. 

&#x200B;

So was I being disrespectful? I wasn't raised Christian and I don't want to upset people who are if what I was doing really was offensive. I would never do it on a Sunday morning when people are going into/coming out of a service, but this was around 3pm on a Monday afternoon and it seemed to be closed. Also as a Jew, I would feel perfectly comfortable doing the same outside a synagogue as long as it wasn't on a Saturday morning/holiday. I also wasn't deliberately trying to appear provocative at all, I was just doing some calf stretches ([like this](https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/322/322809/calf-wall-stretch.jpg)) because my calf/achilles were giving me a bit of bother.

&#x200B;

If I'm the asshole I'll try and find another place for the summer, because it's going to be too hot to wear leggings most of the time. But if she was just overreacting please let me know because it really is the best place anywhere nearby to practice speed (everywhere else is hilly or has too much traffic) and I'll keep going."

bzqc8g	2019-06-12 12:01:05		WIBTA if I abandoned my mom when I move out?	"So first of all, my mom isn’t directly abusive. She’s very supportive and has helped me through life in so many ways. She’s my adoption mother.

However it’s nearly impossible to speak to her. She makes herself the victim in every serious conversation we have and it’s gotten to the point where I barely speak to her at all now. Also, my sister had a kid and when she moved out she dumps her kid here everyday and my mom lets him do whatever he wants all day so he’s turning super rude and bratty(this is important). He will stay up the entire night yelling and cursing playing roblox (he’s 8), and if I say anything, my mom gets mad at me.

She’s even gone out of her way to give him junk food at 10:00 pm the night before my finals fall semester. Needless to say I almost failed because I didn’t really get enough sleep.

Here’s the worst part, and it makes my skin crawl saying this. My mom makes me very uncomfortable.
Every time I’m in the same room with her ever since I turned 18, she just stares at me all the time. Sometimes when she sits next to me she’ll put her hand so it’s grazing my leg and every time I say “please stop staring/touching me” she’ll go into how she only looks at me because I’m “cute” and how  I’ll never make it in the real world if I can’t handle people staring or occasionally touching me. Then she’ll go into victim mode making it seem like I’m the bad guy. 

TL;DR my mom is very caring and has helped me in tremendous ways in life, but she also values my nephews happiness over my well being. She also makes me very uncomfortable with indirect sexual harassment."	Not the A-hole	1	0
bzqc0p	2019-06-12 12:00:39	wesleybcrowen	WIBTA for denying my sister’s heritage rights?	"My father passed away in April, and now I am living alone in the apartment we once shared. I am giving the rights to the clinic he owned (I don’t need it, I am in IT) to my mother who still practices there with my dad’s wife/stepmom (they are both on good terms, by the way, despite the divorce). What happens to the two cars he owned is yet to be concluded (I don’t and won’t need to drive).

After the funeral my mom tells me my big sister came to the clinic and started claiming the place as her own lot to sell. She is also planning to sue the stepmom as a fraud that doesn’t have the rights to anything (she was a civil wife and never had a flashy wedding or anything, but we lived in harmony together for more than 10 years) as well as contesting the will my dad made in 1997 which stated that the apartment would go to either my mom or me, saying “it isn’t properly filed in the database” and “has poor print quality.” Both this and heritage proceedings are due to October.

This is so sickening for me to hear, might be fucking me even harder than my dad’s death. I want to talk to my big sister but my mom and our lawyer tell me not to speak to her at all at any cost. They tell me that she wants to take my apartment away from me too. We want to contest her heritage rights seeing as she was never living with my father (he told me a cautionary tale about not cheapening on contraceptives revealing that my big sister is literally a result of a drunk sex at a party with a random broad; mom revealed he was never in good terms with her mother and they both were guilt tripping him into giving their share of his paycheck for decades) and is acting like a complete cunt to my family.

I am planning to defend my mom, stepmom and myself in court and at least give her the least amount of share possible. But god damn do I feel like shit about it, since I visited her and we were seemingly on good terms. She is poor and got recently fired from the police dept. so I wouldn’t mind giving her one of the many things I have up for sale now if I didn’t get bombed like this. I really want to talk to her and set the meaning of our relationship straight, but I am afraid of pouring more gas to the fire. I don’t want to cut my ties with my nephew like this..

She passed and i was really excited for her and she picked me up from work. I got in the car and we started driving home and talking about her day etc and she was doing a few very minor things wrong. I am a backseat driver and i definitely believe in constructive criticism, so as nicely as possible, apologizing before i even said it i told her that i have 3 comments to make. 1.  that she was going 80 in a 100 zone, which is definitely a nit picky thing to say and i probably shouldntve said it. 2. That she had her windscreen wipers on for like 5 kilometers after it stopped raining which i just let her know as it unnecessarily wears the wiper blades and 3. that she was still in 4th gear going 100ks. Now shes been yelling at me making a huge commotion about it and told me to leave her alone and how i ruin all of her good days and i should be ashamed of myself. I definitely understand what i said would be annoying, But i feel that if i dont say these things that she will never learn. I just cannot justify her reaction. We are having a big fight over it and it makes no sense to me.

K: Yes but i want to stay under the shafow as well, and i cant bare the smell
Me: Well, go 5 meters left until i finish my cig and then come back
K: Dont be an asshole and put it down

If we see something that we think isn't right, we say it. Is your new partner a bit nasty? We'll say. If you did something that wasn't good? We'll say. It's constructive and wanting to help.


One of my friends got offended because, when he asked what he needed to do to get his shirts to fit better, I said 'go to the gym and lose some weight'. Apparently this is a sore topic that he doesn't like having pointed out. But the thing is, he asked. What should I have done, when I didn't know he has a sore spot with this?


He's roughly 300 pounds, gets breathless going up and down stairs and works in an office job, so doesn't really move around much. Apparently this is a sore point because his dad told him off about it a lot as a teenager. I should note that we have a group of 12 friends, and they're almost evenly split (7 in my favour, 5 in his).


Also, in terms of tone, I said it in a joking manner. I wasn't mean or cruel. I've known him for 3 years.

bzpzpj	2019-06-12 11:23:37	heteretes	AITA for telling my junior in school that she cant become a doctor	"Ok context is crucial here. 

I am from India and in this country there is a huge competitive exam for medical which had around 1.5 million high school passouts attempting it annually.  There are only 5-10k seats and they all are distributed by various quotas,  reservations etc. 

Now the case in hand,  my junior of my school whom I know from before,  gave this exam and scored around 500/720 which is not at all enough for a seat in a college here.  She consulted me on what to do further as she is also fully aware she can't get it.  She wants to try for next year.  She can get a dental seat or seat in engineering if she gives it next year as she had both maths and biology for her high school. 

Anyways,  I simply told her - You should give up on becoming a doctor.  You will waste your entire year studying and I am not sure if you will be able to score more than 570 or 600 to get a good seat.  Medical is not worth it for its difficulty and you won't have a good life.  I seriously say you go to other options. 

Now obviously she was shocked and didn't say much.  But I thought that it was necessary as medical seriously isn't roses after getting in also.  The amount of studying is insane and she simply didn't seem like one who could do it.  I seriously think she would be happy in other fields as there is less competition and she will be happier.

My grandmother raised me all my life along with my 2 aunties (22F) and (20F). We all live together along with my grandad (48M).

2 years ago everything was fine then she had a massive brain haemorrhage and 3 strokes. She spent months in hospital and we all hoped prayed etc everything would be okay.

She is home from hospital around a year now and tbh I rathered her in hospital. I know that is a horrible cruel thing to say but she is so hard to handle.

She used to be the kindest most amazing woman but her personality is completely different since her accident. She never does anything anyone asks of her all she ever does is sit down and sleep.

She has a carer and she shouts at her all day. When we (my aunties and I) are looking after her she shouts and screams at us. My grandfather works a lot but when he is home he spends all his time looking after her being with her and she is just so rude and horrible.

I know it’s not her fault but I feel so much resentment towards her especially because I have to look after her when I don’t want to (I know that’s selfish). 

She has put on serious weight and all she wants to do is eat sweets and bad food all the time. We will cook a nice dinner and she will ask for a burger and chips. She will never exercise or move or do anything.

Sorry for the rant. I already know I’m an asshole for this! 

TL;DR My grandmother had a brain injury and strokes and I resent her because she will never do anything or move and is nasty."		1	0

1) When he gets mad, he will make me stay in my room, for hours. I can't do anything else than sit on my bed, and look at the floor. He will come in every fifteen minutes yelling at me.

2) He won't let me go to a doctor, to get me checked for anxiety and/or depression. He won't let me see a psychologist either. My mom has no voice in this, because everytime i ask her, he will break into the conversation, asking me ""why, you have no problems?""

3) he forced me to go to a gymnasium, that i didn't want to go to. I talked with the gymnasium, and they got me into the one i wanted. Every time i mentioned this other gymnasium, my dad would yell at me, saying he didn't want to discuss it.

4) he won't let me sleep at others house sometimes, and his argument? Because he is my dad, and he decides.

5) he calls me stupid and an idiot, every time i want to spend money, that i earned btw.

Ok, so here is the deal. I have some friends that my parents don't know of. I'm considering packing my stuff, and jump out the window. I'll leave a letter to explain everything. Then i'll stay at their house.

Title to make it less complicated.

He is from Country 1, when he was 3 years old, his father went to another country to work (and returned to their family years later) and he and his brother and mother were alone. When he was 8 years old, his mom left him and his brother with their aunts and grandparents and went to Country 2 for 1 month with some people from their city in Country 1. When she returned she left shortly after to Country 3 and stayed there 3 months. When she returned home she was pregnant 5 months and out came his half sister. 
His mom has never told him who the father of her sister is, even though he has asked her a couple times. And he suspects it is someone he knows, because it probably happened on her trip to Country 2. 
He knows his sister has met her father's family, but he doesn't know if she has met her father. My boyfriend's father now lives with the family again and is a father figure for his sister.
His mother says she has her reasoning why she didn't want to say anything, but it all happened a couple years ago.
My boyfriend now lives and studies in Country 4 since a couple of years and will return this summer to spend some time with his family. He is now older and still wants to know who his sister's father is, he is not a big fan of these kinds of family secrets, so would he be the asshole if he asks again who his sister's father is??

TL;DR: My boyfriend is now older and more mature and returns to his family after a couple years and is wondering if he has a right to know who his half sister's father is.

EDIT: Thank you all for your answers, you basically confirmed what we were thinking, that he would be the asshole for asking, so he probably won't.

bzpuoo	2019-06-12 11:07:25	captwaffles27	AITA for correcting people's sources and posts during Hong Kong riots?	"So, Hong Kong is in a big riot now sure to the extradition law. There is plenty of content in Reddit about it, or just look it up online I'd you wish to know more.

Anyways as the events are currently unfolding, so far 2 protestors have been hit in the head with non lethal bean bag rounds. 

My friends , colleagues and redditors on the Hong Kong subreddit are all claiming that protestors are being shot in the head. While true, I strongly believe they need to add ""with non lethal rounds"" to the title. Not many layman would read this and assume it's non-lethal. Hundreds of comments in posts there prove  that they believe someone was killed. 

Yes I'm well aware that non-lethal rounds to the head can be lethal. But I believe that there is a major difference in the use of real bullets vs rubber ones.

I have told my friends and colleagues as well as replied in posts on Reddit that it is non lethal rounds , and that these are wildly inaccurate, and likely the police were not actively looking for heads to pop.

My comment on police not aiming for heads is up for debate so I'll cede that if it matters. The real situation is the lack of clarification that police used non-lethal rounds. People say it doesn't matter if it is lethal or non lethal, but I completely disagree, as live rounds would basically make this tiananmen^2. 

Anyways I keep letting people know I'm on the protestors side, but I won't stop correcting people if they spread the false news that people are dying and police are using live rounds. It  is just not true. I believe headlines spreading false news like this will cause protestors to get hot headed and create more violence that leads to more people getting hurt.

Now everyone is calling me a commie, and that I don't know that they're fighting for. Reddit has been kinder but I feel the relationship with my colleagues and friends have been harmed by me correcting the facts as they believe that non-lethal rounds doesn't sound as diresome for the protestors as live rounds and it takes weight away from their cause.

Tldr; am I the asshole for correcting friends, and redditors that non-lethal rounds were used in HK protests and not live ammunition?

Edit: I'm not looking for confirmation. The real dilemma in my head is do I fight for the truth even if it helps the ""bad"" guys? Or do I just let false news fly out there because it will help win against China (said ""bad"" guys). My colleague said that it's best to just say they are using live rounds as it's better to give people more of a reason to fight against the communist push into HK. What's the right choice here?"

bzpotd	2019-06-12 10:49:08	BurritoInABowl	AITA by creating a TV schedule last weekend.	"My (15m) little cousins (9 and 12) were visiting us last weekend, and they are hyper. Like, extremely hyper. They unfortunately are also seemingly addicted to Fortnite. They were here from Thursday of last week until yesterday.


On thursday, when my cousins and their parents came I was watching something, I can't even remember at this point, and literally within 10 minutes of arriving at our house, my cousins started jumping on me to stop watching TV so they could play Fortnite. Since it wasn't anything important I was like ""whatever"" and went away to read. However, last weekend being the Canadian Grand Prix (and me being a pretty involved Formula One fan) there were some times that I really wanted to watch. Because I live in Ohio, this is one of the only GP weekends where I can just watch regularly during the day instead of like changing my sleep schedule a bit (the other ones being Mexico USA and Brazil) So Thursday afternoon, I created a tv schedule of what times specifically I wanted for the TV plus a little bit of time on both ends for some commentary or whatever which is essentially an hour and a half Friday morning and afternoon, some time Saturday morning and Saturday afternoon, and of course the race on Sunday. 

I printed this schedule and my aunt goes absurd and starts complaining that I’m robbing her children of enjoyment. However, I know for a fact that if uncontrolled these crotch goblins will play fortnite for hours and hours on end, and besides, literally everything in f1 is either in the morning or around 2-3pm ish which isn’t exactly prime time for small children playing fortnite. Who plays fortnite at 10am?! Literally it’s just those times and I could care less who is watching what any other time

So anyways this boils down to my mom defending me against her sister, obv she knows I watch every race weekend if I can and that in the end it’s my TV (it’s in my room, I saved up and bought it myself) and that if they really wanted to play fortnite while im watching they could like take my Xbox downstairs or whatever

Aunt and cousins think we’re a bunch of idiots and assholes who support “global pollution” over children’s happiness (which honestly is kinda BS, the hybrid v6 on f1 cars are achieving somewhere between 50-60% thermal efficiency, most combustion cats get around 20 or so.)

AITA? (AWTA; are we the assholes? Is that a thing?)

TLDR: me watch fast car zoom zoom always. Small kid want play fortnite. Me no let play when me watch fast car zoom zoom. Small kid mom think me asshole.

EDIT (for clarification): there are two TVs in our house however the one in my room that I bought myself is a pretty significant upgrade over the one in the living room due to the fact that I’m pretty much the only one who watches anything on TV at all. My Xbox is connected to this TV with a pretty intricate system of zip ties and cable management. The downstairs tv is hooked up to satellite but mine is hooked up to cable because espn.

EDIT 2: my cousins took to the schedule just fine, if a bit complaining in the beginning, but they played for a bit and then got tired so they understood boundaries. The 12 year old actually watched some of the race with me and the small one read a book. This story is mainly just about the aunt who was complaining while the kids literally couldn’t care less."

Not responding to calls/text, avoiding physical contact when we are together, and being constantly on their phone. We live together so this is strange I think. My mind is a mess and it’s all I can think about while I try to act like nothing is wrong. Part of me wants to confront them, but I worry they will deny it and erase their texts/ call logs. So would I be the asshole if I went through their phone?	Asshole	0	0
bzpol5	2019-06-12 10:48:20	Kunokomori	AITA for wanting to be paid for taking care of my sick Grandmother since I can't work due to it?	"Throwaway because reasons.

So, my grandmother had a stroke a few months ago. She's recovering well, but right now she can't really be at home alone. My grandma lives with my aunt in an apartment, and I live with my parents elsewhere in the city since I'm not working right now due to losing my job recently. My aunt's work schedule fluctuates greatly, and she can't be at home all the time to stay with grandma. So I offered to stay over at her apartment to take care of her while my aunt is at work and whatnot. Sometimes this is half of a day, sometimes it's for the entire day, and sometimes I spend the night there, it all depends on my aunt's schedule.

But my aunt will sometimes just kinda go out for fun and hang out leaving me to take care of my grandma, and again this is fine, the entire situation has us all out of sorts, and I'm not really angry about any of this per-say. But I can't go looking for a job because I can't work consistent hours due to my aunt's job and her going out and my grandma recovering, I wouldn't really have the time. I can't hang out with friends. I can't really do much of anything because I need to be there all of the time. So I was starting to think that it'd be nice if I got paid a little bit for having to be there a lot of the time.

To be clear, I don't mean I should be getting paid like a job, I just mean like a ""tip"" here and there as a kind of thanks for covering for my aunt all the time while she works and goes out. At least a little something so I could, for example, replace my computer mouse that broke recently. Not asking for a salary here, just a little something as kind of a thank you.

Regardless if it happens or not, of course I'm going to take care of my grandmother. She's my grandma after all, and I love her to death. This was just a thought I've been having recently."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzpjbt	2019-06-12 10:30:38	throwaway217894	AITA for not wanting to pay to replace my friend’s item?	"Hi y’all. I’m going to try and keep this short. I’ve been friends with “Z” for about 8 years now. Throughout the years, we’ve done each other solid, I’d make sure he eat a few times a week (usually cheap takeout that would last us both 2 days), he’d buy a bunch (multiple Os) of cannabis and smoke me (and others) out. We’ve had our ups and downs, but I’d consider us close to brothers. 

Anyway, I host a common hangout nexus for the group of our friends. It’s got multiple TVs for people to game together on and multiple couches for sitting/sleeping. I’m a pretty open person so I never mind having someone stay the night. However, Z, tends to spend a lot of time over. Like 6/7 days of the week a lot. It’s not entirely his fault, there is/was a lot of codependency for depression that just having someone around helped ease. But I feel recently his welcome has been wearing thin.

As for why... well, he’s not the easiest person to get along with. The type of person that when you criticize them, they say “oh well so and so do it too, you never get angry at them” (I do, he’s just deflecting). edit: I want to point out that he’s not a mooch. He does occasionally clean the space (once per every 3 weeks roughly), and otherwise he’s generally a good person. He does work, and we go back and forth on sharing most things. As for his living situation, we’re both relatively young, and while he does have somewhere else to stay, and it’s safe, it’s a somewhat hostile environment, and the couch I have is larger than what his family gave him to sleep on.

Regardless, the current beef: I was cleaning up dishes, and I went to grab a cup (that he had left on the table for 2 days). Sadly, it was on an older snack table. I’m sure if you have one, you know how shaky they can be. As I was picking the cup up, the table shook so much that his dab pen+cart tipped off the edge, shattering completely. Complete accident, right? Could’ve happened to him. He acknowledged that. However, the cart cost him $45, and seeing how there was a little bit more than half left, he wanted me to give him $25 to replace the amount lost. 

Now, honestly, and I could be wrong, but I’m hurt. I’m doing extremely poor financially right now, but that’s somewhat irrelevant. In the past, he’s broken objects of mine, a $60 computer chair, 50% to blame for losing a $25 vape device. Never once asked him for compensation, just ate the shit. I would be 100% less offended if I had thrown it at him or dropped it myself, but it was, in my opinion, at least 50% both our faults, me for carelessness, and him for placing a glass item so near an edge + leaving the cup there in the first place. What the fuck do I do here? AITA? If I am, how do I stop being angry about this? If not, how can I possibly explain my feelings to him?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzpj7g	2019-06-12 10:30:17		AITA when I ignore my self-centered grandmother who seems to have some kind of Alzheimer’s or memory problem?	"Background: When my mom got married, she didn’t move out of her mom’s house (in my country, we don’t necessarily move out by age 18), instead a house was built in the backyard of her original house and that’s where my family lives. 

My grandmother lives alone in the original house (my grandpa died in 2002), but she comes to our house to eat. 

So about a year ago her memory started declining. At this point, after eating a meal, she’d come back after 30 m to 1 h asking for food, saying she hasn’t eaten. 

In most cases, people say to be patient, right? But my grandma isn’t like one of those lovely old ladies. Whenever she eats our food, she’s always complaining, saying things like “My God! What kind of life is this?”, pretty much insulting us. She also complains about the quality of the food even in restaurants. Saying the food was bad and we shouldn’t eat there (even when my family enjoyed the food). In summary: she’s self-centered.

So when I’m the one she asks for food I usually just ignore her (don’t reply). Because a) We don’t have an unlimited stash of food for her. b) She doesn’t believe me when i tell her she’s eaten already.

TL;DR: My bitch of a grandma eats meals from our house, forgets that she did, and asks for more food. This happens regularly. AITA for ignoring her when she asks?"	Asshole	1	0
bzphsk	2019-06-12 10:25:26	sleepyinsomniacc	AITA for going to a gym my boyfriend specifically asked me NOT to go to?	"I’ve been with this particular gym for almost 3 years and they recently bought out a gym much closer to where I live. The gym before my gym took over was pretty much the go to place for male/female Instagram fitness influences/models. 

Flashing club lights, loud music, open floor, it all just has a really weird club/gym feel to it. Initially it’s a bit of an uncomfortable place to be in, people are working out but given the environment and the demographic of people who go there there’s always bit of a flirting and creepin going on. 

I not only go to this gym because it’s closer to me but because I’ve now developed my routine there. I go in, know exactly what I want to do, do it and then leave. 

I also usually go around 8-9pm. 

A couple of weeks ago I told my boyfriend I’m heading to the gym and I instantly got super weird vibes from him... a part of me knew what it was about but I didn’t want to be the one to bring his issue up. 

After my workout he calls me, a little agitated. His responses to all my questions were elusive so I had no choice but to straight up ask him if he has a problem with me going to that particular gym... I know his been trying his best to not let it bother him and I know it has been bothering him for a while but I just felt like it was something he shouldn’t even worry about.

We talked it out and he explained that he has buddies who go there purely to check out/hit on girls.  

He was very clear about not wanting me to be in an environment like that especially at night and I agreed with him. I wanted him and his feelings to be respected and honoured so I told him I wouldn’t go to that gym at night. 

Forward to today, I haven’t managed to get to the gym twice and I really just wanted to smash a session out. I cannot not be bothered driving to the gym 20 minutes away and even though its past 8pm I really need to blow off some energy so I’m not dealing with shitty insomnia all night. 

Boyfriend asks me what I’m doing, I tell him I’m going to the gym, he asks me which one, I tell him the one closer to me... he throws in a “lol” and ends the convo. 

I feel really fkn torn, I agreed I wouldn’t go to that gym and I knew it would have pissed him off if I did go there but I just feel like I’m kinda enabling a bit of a possessive, controlling side in him by agreeing to these sorts of things. 

But I did agree and I feel so rude going back on that agreement because I know if he did that to me, I would be fuming."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bzpd0f	2019-06-12 10:08:47		AITA for being mad a my sister for leaving a long planned family vacation early?	"So last year my mom turned 60 and my sister asked my brother and I if we should not gift her a little family vacation with us three kids, our partners and our children (my niece from my sister and my son), since earlier that year our father died and my mom could do with a little family time. So we both agreed and planned the vacation more than half a year in advance (time and location-wise). The trip was planned to last four days. 

So one week before the trip I call my sister to make last arrangements and she tells me that she, her husband and my niece will leave one day early (saturday around 2 pm) instead of sunday around noon so that my niece could go to sleepover party. After the phone call I talked to my boyfriend about it, telling him that I felt disappointed that they want to leave early, especially since it was my sisters idea to do the trip in the first place and we planned it long in advance. 

I might add, at this point, that I was never a big ""family person"", my family is quite big and I never really enjoyed spending time with them. I don't hate them, but I don't really love them either. Although I get along ok with my siblings, we still get on each others nerves much more easily then with friends. This is why I was never super excited to do this vacation in the first place but agreed because it is a nice thing for my mom.

So to come back to the point, my boyfriend agreed that it was kind of disappointing that they wanted to leave early, especially for such a (seemingly) minor reason as a sleepover. So we formulated a text (trying to be as polite as possible), saying we found it regrettable that they leave early, that we did not understand why a sleepover is so important that you have to cut long made plans short and asked if it maybe would be a possibility to drive her to a trainstation where she could take a train for 40 minutes (she is 9 y/o) and be met at the trainstation by a friend to be picked up so that my sister and husband could stay for the whole trip. She replied that she could understand that we felt this way and it was within our rights to say so but they would still leave early. 

Fast forward to our trip, some other issues arose and we (my sister and I) had a fight the first day of the trip, where she disclosed that she was very mad at me for my ""passive agressive"" text and started crying that the party was very special to my niece because a recent session with the school counselor revealed that my niece had almost no friends and the sleepover was with her one very good from kindergarden that she did not see very often because they since moved to another part of town. All of this was total news to me. She then revealed that she told my mother, brother and his girlfriend the whole story and they therefore never had a problem with them leaving early. Had I known this beforehand, I might have reacted differently, but my sister and her husband insisted that IATA here. So what do you think?"	Asshole	0	0
bzpcw8	2019-06-12 10:08:21	SsSailorScout	WIBTA if I left my sisters to find a place of their own?	"So, let’s like get into it??
I’m the oldest of six girls with a spawn of my own. I live with 4 of them. Including myself and the spawn there are like, six of us in a two bedroom apartment. 
The second oldest and I had split rent down the middle while one did child care for me and the other one was trying to get her birth certificate and SSC because her school lost it. 
We had a perfect system. 
The fourth child had run off to be with her internet BF (has a habit of doing this) all the way on the other side of the states. Things didn’t work out between them, never does. So she decides that she wants to come back. No prob. I tell her that she can’t come to my place. 
I already have too many people living with me. I can’t afford the extra food or the extra rent because I knew it’d take her a while to find a job (it took her 3 months btw in the middle of holiday season when literally EVERYONE and their past generations were hiring). 
She took it to heart and everyone told me I was being a dick because I didn’t want her to move in. I already knew I was fighting a useless battle. 
So, she moves in, gets drunk and loud like everyday and becomes a huge problem causing arguments she can’t remember and just raising tensions in the house. 
Welp! She eventually lands a job. At the second child’s place of employment. Hey I’m not mad. A jobs a job. Rent is cheaper on my part and she buys her own food so yaaaasss! 
Hol’up we’re getting to the juicy bits. 
My landlord is this frail old woman whom I love. She’s kind and does things based on honesty. That and lil old ladies love me. Not ya know...toot my own horn. 
LL tells me that she’s getting ready to sell the building because she’s getting old. Understandable. 
LL then gets mad at me because I didn’t move a chair off the front lawn and some cigarettes fell off. So she gives us a 30 day notice. I’m panicking. I call her and ask what I can do. She says she needs a few days to calm down so I give that to her because I’m a decent human who understands that people need space. 
So I give her space. 
We talk a few days later and come to an agreement that I’m not gonna smoke on the property. Cool I get to stay in the same place, my spawn can stay in the same school. Everything was well right? 
Hell nah. 
LL brings up the fourth child and I’m an honest human so I tell her. She says I broke her trust. I’m sad but fuck it. Things happen. But I’m furious. I told the fourth child that this is exactly what would happen and not a single soul listened to me and now we have 30 days to find a new place? 
The thing is, would I be the ass if I went and got my own place with my smol human and let the other four figure it out? Two of my sisters don’t have jobs but the other two do so they’d be fine (I think?!) if I left."	No A-holes here	0	0
bzpcm9	2019-06-12 10:07:27	SilverHair75	AITA for snapping at a guy who assumed I was abused?	"Throwaway account.

So I have this classmate, let's call him Ben. Ben has met my boyfriend once, and we have been studying together for about a year. I can tell that Ben has a crush on me, that is why I keep our encounters only about the studies, we are not really friends outside of school.

This week I had some kind of allergy or eye infection that has caused my eye to swell and a bit darker color around my eye. I have been feeling a bit down about it but it's nothing too bad. Ben has noticed my eye and also me being sad.

Today he came next to me and said ""Please get out of this relationship, there are other men out here who would treat you so much better you don't have to stay with him."" He also said something along the lines of he is willing to come in and protect me if I'm scared.

At first I just said ""Ben, it's an allergy i'm not being abused"". But he did not believe me! He continued to say that I don't need to make up excuses for my bf and his behavior is not acceptable... at this point I couldn't hear anything he was saying anymore. I really got annoyed and I snapped at him: ""You don't know him or me, leave me alone!"" and I left.

Boyfriend said I was too harsh and he was just worried and I overreacted.

I was not offended that he was worried but rather that he jumped to conclusion without even asking me and acting like he would save me. Also I love my bf very much and can't stand him being unfairly accused like that.

Now I am embarrassed to see Ben again.

He's rich, mostly from his business, and also from being a member of parliament in our country, so he's really popular among his peers, as well, known to building schools and stuff. Fuck, they call him the 'father of orphans' in the regional language, because of his unbridled philanthropy.

This isn't helping my case at all, lol.

My dad houses upwards to ten random people in our house. It's a two-story house with four bedrooms, and two living rooms, yet it feels so damned cramped. Every time I return from boarding school, I always have to share my room with two other grannies whom I have never, ever seen in my life. When I confront my mother about this, I'm shamed for daring to maintain that I have a right to my OWN living space. She called me 'westernized' because I don't appreciate my family (I do not know these people) enough.

Fuck, one time, they gave me a mattress and had me sleeping ON THE LIVING ROOM WITH NO MOSQUITO NET. I could barely even sleep because of all the whining, and my skin was infested with bites when I woke up. They don't give a single shit at all about that. It's not *his* room that's being invaded. It's mine and my siblings'. 

These also aren't homeless people. They all have houses of their own. They come in completely shamelessly and demand a space. My dad just accepts it and gives me a mattress and tell them to sleep on *my* bed. When my dad*doesn't* feel up for giving them space, he fucking *avoids* them because he's too spineless to confront them about this bullshit. They are rude as hell, too, and sometimes bring their *kids*, who always fuck with my stuff.

Edit: INFO: These are extended family members, in case the title wasn't clear enough. I just have absolutely *no* idea who they are. Also, they come because our house is better than theirs, plus it's more like a community hub than anything. The issue is that I don't *want* the heart of this community hub to be situated in my space."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzp6y2	2019-06-12 09:48:26		Aita for not repaying my grandfather	"My grandparents got married very young - 16 (her) 18 (him). Despite coming from poverty, they somehow built a life together that was very comfortable. My grandfather was able to retire from a white collar job with a substantial pension (~$90k a year) and a lot of savings thanks to my grandmother always being very, very thrifty.

My grandmother got sick and died within a year and a half. During that time I took leave from my job (I was 22) & married my boyfriend in a really crappy shotgun wedding that my mom pulled together in an afternoon because it was my grandmothers wish to see us get married. 

We had an apartment at the time with a roommate but we moved closer to be near my family. My new husband had to drive 2 hrs to work daily.  During her chemo appointments my grandmother helped me pick out a little house closer to my husbands job and said that they would help us pay for it. The market was competitive and they gave us the cash to buy it. ($150k) We bought the house and refinanced it, paying back back a little more than half. He told us to pay the rest back when we had it and refused to set up a payment plan.

She dies.  

Fast forward a year. He reconnects with a woman he had always had a crush on since high school. She rebuffs him until he starts laying on the gifts. He buys her luxury purses, lets her drive my grandmothers luxury car and invites her on our family trip abroad. 

Present day. After a year long courtship he buys her a big diamond ring, planned a fancy wedding at the country club, and took a month long honeymoon in Europe. He has dropped my family and embraced hers.  He spends all his holidays with her, has BBQs and only invites her family, doesn't remember anyone's bday, etc. When he got engaged he didn't tell me or my siblings. We heard through the grapevine. 

I attended the wedding but my family was placed on the far edge of the venue.  He didn't speak to me at the wedding.  Since that time he has asked me twice to get lunch. I declined.

A few days ago he asked me to lunch again and I told him that until he learns how to treat me and the people I care about better I want nothing to do with him.  That sent him into a tirade- sending mean messages to my mother and my husband.

I have received a message from him saying that he has had an expensive year and needs to be fully reimbursed as he is planning to buy his new wife a new car as she wrecked my grandmothers car.

Im aware of his financial situation- pension, savings, big boat, beach house, rental property.  But I also know his new wife spends a lot of money on herself and her kids. While my grandmother cooked all their meals- he now only eats out. My grandmother never treated herself- now he is paying for weekly hair and nails appts.

I go to my apartment gym, and occasionally it’ll already be occupied already, no biggie. However, occasionally, the person that is already in the gym only has the lights on, and not the fan. 

WIBTA if I turn the fan on when I get there?  I haven’t been, because if someone intentionally does not turn on the fan, then they must have some reason to leave it off. But it gets so hot in the gym it kills me to not have it on for whatever godforsaken reason. 

Thanks in advance!

Edit for clarity: most of the time they’re in the middle of some kind of cardio workout (for example, spinning) and I don’t want to interrupt them to ask. Also, I wouldn’t want to turn it on and put them in the uncomfortable position of passively hating me but not saying anything (some people may be afraid of confrontation and just not say anything).

Military family and stuff that I won’t get into but she loves America and I’m totally fine with that. She is also conservative and I consider myself that too. 

Argument: I was telling her about in U.S. History how we learned some really not good stuff America did, or how some noble stuff wasn’t as noble as we thought. This led to her getting mad and assuming I only meant America. I clarified no I agree other countries have done plenty of messed up stuff throughout time I’m just saying I never knew America did some of this stuff. 

I would then go on to say that I wish instead of teaching history at first like war was uncommon and far more peaceful sounding then switching to showing more brutal sides of history when people are older, that they would start out showing history is brutal, even if it is kid friendly. 

My mom continued trying to say America did good stuff and I told her I absolutely don’t disagree, but that history class shouldn’t go from we were amazing to we did this bad stuff. 

I wasn’t trying to start a fight I just was really surprised to hear some stuff about my home country that schools had never taught us before. Both my my mom and I are now very angry and it’s clear this will be a subject to avoid from now on. So people of Reddit, AITA for thinking America did messed up stuff at times and wishing history was taught better?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzp3x6	2019-06-12 09:38:16	Knight3e	AITA for not playing a video game with my mother?	"(Sorry for the format, phone post)

I used to spend a lot of time playing a certain MMORPG that rhymes with Lorld of Larcraft in my youth. (24 now) I loved the game and sunk countless hours into it taking a year off here and there as it got stale. 

My mom on a seemingly whim decided that she wanted to play as well. So I taught her how to play, albeit not the most patient of teachers at first but eventually helping her understand how to enjoy the game. 
 
We played for about two years together and there were some great memories made. She would say “I learned to play so we could spend more time together.” And we did. 

Fast forward to me moving out and just not enjoying the game anymore. I stopped playing and she continued on her own for about another 6 months before telling me I don’t have to pay for her subscription anymore because “she was done with it and the only reason she played was to spend time with me.” 

I don’t know why but internally it has recently dawned on me that the game might have been much more important than I had given it credit. We hardly talk anymore and every time I visit there is tension. I feel like the time spent together on there may have been our last real connection. 

TLDR; stopped playing a video game with my mom after I moved out. (Posted from phone)"	No A-holes here	0	0

"It happened just now, we were eating breakfast and I was sure she didn't remember because I know her and I can see it in her. I was a little bummed out already and she could see it so I told her ""It's kinda cool that you didn't even wish me Happy Birthday or anything"" while playing with my food and her response was ""It's today?""
I got even sadder, because I knew that she didn't really remember the day (not the date but when that date is) so yesterday I kept mentioning it's today, when she talked with a friend and said my birthday is a day later than it really is or when we were playing in bed yesterday evening that it was today. She got angry at me because ""Ok it's my fault, but I just thought it was tomorrow!"", but that didn't change anything for me and she kept getting more and more angry that it's such a big deal for me. It's not about a gift or anything, since we agreed on a gift and I will get it at a later date, but just the pure act of actually wishing me a Happy Bday was what I wanted. I am a private person, so my birthday is just another day for me, I don't celebrate it or anything. I just wish people close to me would remember."	Asshole	0	0

bzoyl6	2019-06-12 09:20:09	WeakestBeast	AITA for not helping my brother start a business.	"My brother - 24 has a full time job but wants to start his own business, he always comes up with these product ideas and tries to get me to start a business with him, but we never get anywhere with them because he doesn’t have the commitment, time or ability to fully start it.

In the past we’ve ended up building product prototypes for his ideas etc but ended up giving up on them.

So basically, without giving the idea away, he had the idea of a unique healthy breakfast for the city and wanted me to help him create a recipe for this product. The work that he mentioned I would be doing would involved store to store sales, getting up as early as 5am to get into the city. I’m trying to pursue my own personal goals over the summer, making lofi music. (Loafy Building on Spotify)

I feel as though I would end up doing 70% of the work for the project and I also don’t think this is ever going to work. The idea itself isn’t good enough, I don’t believe coffee shops / stores would be willing to accept our product without food safety licensing and with existing suppliers set up. We have no business plan, no way of manufacturing on a large scale etc. and on top of that, he’s an argumentative person to work under. For payment, i would most likely receive a cut if things were successful, however I would bet everything on there being no profit at the end of this.

From his point of view however, he thinks I have plenty of time to help him out, as I’m a student (20) on summer break. Since telling him I’m not helping him with this he’s gone on to call me a cunt etc. and is now ignoring me. 

Am I the asshole for not helping him? Even though I could make time for him, I don’t want to for the following reasons."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzowkh	2019-06-12 09:12:43	Confusedparrot123	AITA for finally snapping at my wife about my drinking?	"Throwaway account for obvious reasons as my wife uses Reddit but not this sub.

I know how that title sounds but please bear with me for a minute.

My wife(32f) and I(33m) have been together for 10 years in October and married for 6 of those years. She comes from a... broken home to say the least. Her mother was a drunken alcoholic and her dad was never there, she has one brother and he's a junkie as well. Her life growing up was not easy and I will always respect her for rising above all of that and persevering through it all.

Now onto my problem. My wife has an issue with *any* substance that can get you high or drunk and understandably so. She made this clear after about 2 years of us dating when she told me about her family. Now this I have no issue with, I asked her if me having a few beers socially would be an issue and she said no.

Cut to the last few years and her anger to booze has become *much* more apparent. She claims my drinking 2 beers after working a stressful day makes me an alcoholic. Now if I was drinking every day she may have a point but I have maybe 3 beers a week at most and *maybe* once a month I may go to my buddy's place and play overwatch and have a few more. I don't get drunk by any stretch at my friend's place but just a good buzz and uber home. I have only ever been legitimately drunk 3 times in our relationship, NONE of which she was around for and only ever heard second hand. I like to think I'm respectful about it; I keep my beer in the minifridge in the basement, I don't drink in front of her and at her request I don't talk to her at all when I have those few beers on a friday.

I have in the past quit drinking because she asked me to. Last time I quit for 2 years just because. Quitting is never an issue for me but her badgering me and claiming I'm an alcoholic *all the time* finally caused me to snap at her and tell her that just because her mother was an alcoholic doesn't mean I am. I told her that her extreme hatred for it is causing more issues for me than anything else in my life at this moment. She will literally go from the most sweet person to a completely passive aggresive person in one second when she realizes I bought a 6 pack for the next 2 weeks. The obvious answer is to just quit which would be fine but sometimes I just like to unwind after work you know? I don't get trashed on a regular and I don't let alcohol get in the way of my life so I'm at a loss. If she said ""it's me or the booze"" then I would 100% pick her but my issue is that her problem with alcohol isn't rational and it's not *me* she has an issue with but instead her issues with her mother.

We go out enough and we both hang around with people who drink and she has no issue with them so here I am wondering if I'm an asshole. I feel after a few years of her yelling at me I was justified in getting a bit upset but her friends are calling me an asshole."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzov9u	2019-06-12 09:07:59	mendiebendie	AITA for trying to relate to a friend?	"Forgive me of my formatting sins Father, for I am on mobile.

Background: This girl and I met last year and became quick friends. We called each other our best friends and all was good until she began telling me what I now believe are lies.

Cast: Me and This girl (G)

G and I talked everyday at school. Best friends. We told each other everything. One day, she approached me as I was waiting in line for lunch. Convo went like this:

G: I just got told I might have a bad disease... Can you buy me a muffin?

Me: Of course!

I would’ve bought her a muffin anyways. We always buy food for each other. We sit down and I ask her what’s going on.

G: Well, basically I went to the doctors and they said that I might have [disease thats a more serious version of a common symptom]. I have to wait six weeks until I find out.

Me: Okay well don’t think like that yet. I remember when I was going through something similar.

I told her about a rough time in my life when doctors told me my tension headaches may be a brain tumor. The way the DR phrased it made it seem like there was a big chance. I had to wait 2 months for an appointment with Neurology, where I was told that there was no possible way these headaches were tied to a tumor.

G: Well, I prob have it. I mean, I basically know I do.

(she didn’t)

Later, we got in a fight and she told me that I was trying to make the situation about myself by saying I know what this is like. She said there was no correlation between my story and her supposed disease. She also told me it was insensitive bc she has a bump on the back of her neck that is a “tumor that is benign but could turn malignant”. I didn’t think of it much until a mutual friend ended our friendship because I was insensitive towards G. That’s why I’m asking, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzouwu	2019-06-12 09:06:41	Delachruz	"AITA for refusing to hang out with ""friends of a friend"""	"So I have a childhood friend, I've known her the better part of my life. We don't hang out constantly, but generally provide support in trying times, and talk regularly over Discord. She's one of two people I genuinely consider to to be ""besties"" with.

Only one issue, and that is that I heavily dislike her friends. I'm not outgoing, I very much fall into the classic ""nerd"" stereotype, and I am fully aware that I am hard to get along with. Yet recently she has made great efforts to get me to hang around with some of her friends.

Now, this is obviously colored by my own perspective, but right from the get go, I felt like all of them hated me, and thought that I was a weirdo. Every interaction felt artificial, like they were putting on a nice show to not be rude, and hurt their friend. To be fair, I didn't exactly feel sparks either. I participated in conversation and tried to be nice, but honestly, not one of the 4-6 people she regularly hangs with seems like somebody I would get along with. The finishing blow happened 2 weeks ago, when one of them was asking my opinion on the female rally that will happen later next month around here (Many of them are activists for different things. Something I respect, but don't particularly care for myself). I basically said I had no opinion on it and hadn't really cared before, and she immediately got very confrontational. I dodged all further questions to avoid getting into an argument, but apparently she took this as me being condescending. I have since apologized to the girl in question, but also made it clear to bestie that it will be for the best if I don't see any of them again.

She was a little sad, but accepting. She wrote me a text saying that her other friends reacted badly to this, and are now of the opinion that I'm an intolerant asshole (An opinion she does not share). It has not negatively affected my relationship with my friend, but she has told me she had wished it would not have gone this way.

bzout4	2019-06-12 09:06:19	ConriJ	AITA for walking away from someone who wanted to be single and focus on themselves?	"Me [30M] and P [31F] got out of relationships in Dec18 (she told me she checked out of her last one a year before it ended). We meet in Apr and hit things off. She was upfront that she wasn’t sure if she was ready for anything as she’d had no time to herself since her ex, but she really liked me and wanted to see where it went and wouldn’t see anyone else! That’s fine and I’m happy to see where it goes! We see each other a lot, she writes cute messages like “You may be the most beautiful decision I’ve ever made, would you like to see where it goes?”, she asks me to travel with her to Holland, and to her home country of Spain. A month in she tells me I’m helping her move on from her ex and thanks me.

I’m the kind of the person who falls for people quickly, and it’s something I’m working on, but I know if I want to be with someone quite soon! She asked me to be open and honest with her from the start so I tell her how I feel and where I’d like this to go. She’s still not sure, but tells me she’s trying and that she might need the time I had to myself that she didn’t. I agree, and we keep going! We go on holiday and spend 6 days visiting many different cities; she’s on her phone texting or playing most of it, but whatever, I’m in a beautiful country, so I enjoy the ride. One day she’s comparing our skin; I’m very white British and she’s Spanish. She says “I’ll be darker than you in winter”, I say, “so well still be together in winter”, and I get a “sure, why not?”. 2 days later she drops it that she will leave the country we live in by Dec! This brings up questions about us, as I don’t want to keep getting emotionally invested in someone who’s planning to up and leave, and I ask her where she sees this going. She doesn’t know, but needs time to think about it. I give her space and in less than 2 days she tells me that she wants to be single and have that time I had, that she apparently didn’t, to focus on herself. Even with that, she will be leaving the country. I wish her the best, respect her decision, and say bye.

She gets mad and says “so that’s it, I don’t want a relationship and it’s bye”. I explain that I can’t continue to get invested in someone who doesn’t want to be with me and is leaving. She doesn’t reply; removes me on Facebook; I unfollow her on IG, and remove her as one of my followers. Over the last week we don’t speak, but she views every IG story I post; so she’s manually searching for me. I text her saying she can just talk to me instead of stalking my IG. I get back a laugh saying she was waiting to see how long until I text her, along with some other shit. I say she sounds mad at me, and she says “because I am mad at you, but that’s not your business”. I ask what I did; she won’t explain, and doesn’t want to talk to me. I leave it, block her and delete her number!

I can’t see how she could be mad at me, but I might be missing it!

It got everywhere and he didn't help clean anything up and he encouraged us to let the cat soak in piss all day. He wanted us to just not wash the cat at all. I felt disgusted and my heart aches for that cat. We bathed him but he doesn't want anything to do with us and to top it all off, my dad's birthday is coming up in real soon.

bzor0y	2019-06-12 08:52:14		AITA for asking my dad for labour money?	"Long story short we had to get rid of the fishpond in my garden because of an extension we're having and since my brother has exams, he made me do the bulk of the job. This basically involved me 'taking apart' the pond (i.e breaking the brick base, ripping out layers etc) in waders - the whole thing took about 6+ hrs, and I asked for nothing in return.

Few days later to this morning, I kindly asked my dad about getting some sort of monetary reward for doing such work, even if it was £10. He has a condition so I was somewhat reluctant about asking, but at the same time I saved him sore hands and if he were to pay someone else he would have paid alot more than I would have asked for. He got hot-headed quickly and mentioned how he bought me a car and insurance 6 months back but has completely forgotten that I also paid for a proportion of this etc.  He then mentioned that at 18 I should be paying rent etc. but he doesnt make me however in the UK I think this is a really traditional mindset - I dont know a single 18 year old that does this nowadays, especially with difficulty in job search and pressure from college etc.  Besides this, I just finished my final exams last week (quit my job in April to focus on them) then I started searching for jobs ASAP (have applied already) to pay my own way. My mum and my dad were both shocked I asked for money and said they were disgusted. 

Basically, was I in the right to ask for money? I also do small things here and there (wash cars, maintain the fish pond the whole year etc) but I never get paid for it nor do I expect to for such small chores, but for 6 hours labour I thought it was right to get something out of it. AITA?"		1	0

Today, my mum was being really nice to me by talking softly and hugging me, and I was quite pleasantly surprised as she doesn't do this often. She offered to take me to a fast food joint for lunch (because I had cravings) and we were walking through a nice park on the way. I was having a great day and my mum was being super nice. 

On the way back, as a joke, I said ""I really do like walking with you, even if you can be really mean sometimes."" Her face absolutely fell and I immediately regretted saying anything. I could tell she had made a huge effort to make me happy and saying this put her in a semi-bad mood again. A minute later, I pulled out my phone to check if we were going the right way, and found a shortcut. I told her we should go that way instead, but she got angry and told me our route was more scenic. We started arguing again and I said ""I take it back, I don't like walking with you."" She got very angry and walked to the other side of the street whilst I went down the shorter route. 

When she came home, we were both in a bad mood and she started saying some things that I won't discuss in detail. She told me not to call her Mum and that anything she did for me from now on would be charity, not a parental thing. I sort of raged upstairs to come and write this post. Originally, I was fuming at her, but now I'm thinking about how she looked absolutely heartbroken when I unthinkingly told her she was mean. I just feel awful that she made such an effort to make me happy when I had cravings, and we were having such a good time until we fought.

I'm not sure if we need a backstory of the relationship of my father and I but let's just say I never really had a normal childhood.

So just an hour ago, I (F13) was just on my laptop watching a show when my dad comes in and tells me to turn my brightness up so I don't damage my eyes. He has already told me this multiple times in the past hour to do so and I know it's because he doesn't want my eyesight to get ruined but I can't help but feel annoyed as I've already turned it up. Well I tell him ""The brightness is already up"" I admit I could have used a better tone.

Well, long story short he starts shouting at me how I am undisciplined, etc . (P.sat this moment he just came in with another rant so I'll add it on as if it happened before) He tells me how in the morning he drives me to school and talks to me on the drive but I am unhappy and ungrateful, I have no right to act this way because I haven't done anything. That hurt me because I am always at the top of my class, always getting the highest grades and awards. He continues to tell me as I'm getting older I'm being more undisciplined. In my opinion, I have always listened to the adults and tried my best but I have realised I have never looked at it at an outside perspective. I say nothing and just let him do the talking.

We were (are?) incredibly close and spent a bunch of time together.  I met her parents and take care of her dogs... Anyways I couldn't hide my feelings anymore and eventually told her. She said she didn't know what to say, which crushed me. She isn't ready for a relationship, and won't be for a while. That really sucked, left me in a ""limbo""... but then... a few things things come to light...

One; her (female) best friend (S) told me that H is indeed trying to ""let me down easy"" / string me along. which I confronted H about. I asked H why she felt like she needed to lie. She (crying) confirmed that she was letting me down easy due to the ""strength"" of our friendship, that she was scared to ruin things between us and so instead decided to tell a half truth. We cried about it. I told her I was going to need some space in the meantime, and that I want honesty. Enter depression.

Fast forward two weeks of minimal contact. I'm still broken up about it ( I do love this girl ) but I decide to reconcile in person at a place we both frequent. All is well and good, she is visibly happy, and tells me she misses me... only to hear later from two VERY trusty friends who tell me she is ""seeing"" someone. Less than 12 hrs after we talked 2nd time. Re-enter depression.

I confront her again and she denies it. Reiterates not interested in relationships. H asks me why I think she is lying to me, I tell her, she does not budge and asks me to trust her. Okay, deal.
Later a third person (less trustworthy) came up to me the other day and mentioned something about H & (guy) making out at a party. 
I ask S, who says ""if it is true (?), you can't be mad at her & you can't throw away your friendship, it's so great, even stronger than our ( S & H's) friendship"". 

Here's the deal Reddit... I care about this woman something fierce. We know each other very well, which is why this hurts so much. But from my perspective, she lied to me three times. She knows me well enough to know I wouldn't have flipped.
I no longer think that she gives much of a fuck about me, my feelings or my mental well being. It has taken quite the toll on me, and I certainly don't trust her right now.

I'm considering ending the friendship to move on which 100% of my friends agree with and maybe 50% of mutal friends say I'm an asshole for considering ""throwing things away"". 
It is going to kill me to pick up her pieces again. I know the dude in question is abusive and I / all her friends lost her for a year and a half to a previous abusive partner. They say if I leave am I abandoning her to this dude...

The website justhas basic information on it about not discriminating based on gender identity.

My friend and I are both female. We were having coffee and talking. Someone from the table beside us approached us. During the conversation I found out this person is non-binary but they appeared male.

&#x200B;

For the purposes of clarity in this post, I willbe referring to this person as ""he"". I know! That may be an assholish thing to do and I shouldn't do that in real life. During our conversation I never purposefully misgendered them.

&#x200B;

He interrupted my conversation.

Him: Excuse me, you shouldn't becalling your friend ""she"", you're not allowed to use gendered pronouns.""

&#x200B;

I got confused. I interpreted thevague poster text to mean you shouldn't assume identity but were fine to use pronouns if you knew the person.

Me: ""I've known her for ages. I knowshe is female.""

Him: ""That may be, But I am non-binary and the signs say you aren't allowed to use gendered pronouns. You shouldn't be calling your friend 'she' this is a safe space now and I don't want to feel attacked here""

&#x200B;

I hadn't even used any pronouns to speak tohim, so I wasn't assuming anything.

&#x200B;

I triedto explain again that my friend knew eachother’s pronouns and we would gladly call him any pronoun he preferred. I was trying to be polite and ask if he wanted to be referred to as he or she. I'll admit at that point I had no idea that non-binary people prefer ""they/them"". This was my first encounter with a non-binary person.

He angrily explained that he didn't want me to use pronouns for him or anyone else in the room.

&#x200B;

I wasn't trying to insult him. While speaking to him I never used any pronouns for him at all. I was talking to a friend, which he interrupted. I also think he should not be so sensitive that he can't handle hearing other people using gendered pronouns when it's none of his business.

I thinkhe overestimated what the poster meant. He tookit to mean that you weren't allowed touse pronouns at all, whereas I took it to mean you can't assume pronouns but are fine to use them once you know someone’s pronouns.

&#x200B;

I realized Iwas getting nowhere. I turned my back on him and continued talking to my friend, both of us just using pronouns.

Maybe that was petty, as I knew it offendedhim? I did do that on purpose to annoy him because inmy mind he had no right to be insulted by it.

bzolfs	2019-06-12 08:30:44		AITA to expect my boyfriend to do DIY well, if he insists on doing it himself?	"My boyfriend's dad was a joiner. He seems to have a bit of pride in asking someone to come in to do a task he ""should"" be able to do himself (in his view).

So any time I decide I'd like something to change in the house, I bring it up, and he says he'll do it, even if I say I'll look at prices for a professional. He insists that that's a waste of money.

Anyway, this weekend he put up a shelf in the hallway. I specified I'd like it to be flush with the wall at either end, and to be an 'alcove' style shelf, i.e. no brackets and instead supported by a frame.

He listened, went to the DIY shop, then came back with brackets, saying because they were white, they'd blend in with the wall. They'll only blend in with the wall because the walls are currently magnolia. The entire reason I wanted an all-wood shelf was because it can be painted to match the decor and looks nicer all around.

Anyway he put it up, and in my view it doesn't look great. It's leaning down on one side, the brackets aren't even symmetrical and it doesn't meet the wall properly at either end, with a few millimetres of space in which things like dust / crap can get stuck. Because he'd got so stressed out putting it up, and had done it all himself, I didn't criticise him and thanked him for doing it. I got the feeling that if I'd said anything, he'd have exploded or got in a huff.

Then today, he started painting the shelf and other areas around the hallway without being asked. He doesn't use masking tape, so there were splodges of paint on the wall and drips. He said it's fine because it's water-based paint, but there's all kinds of awkward areas on the wall beneath the shelf where there's bit of paint and I don't really know how he plans to get those off.

He's making me feel like a real asshole for pointing this out and is telling me to go back to what I am doing. Am I the asshole for expecting him to do a professional job if he insists on me not hiring a professional for a job?"		1	0

bzojri	2019-06-12 08:24:02	danbc93	WIBTA if I dont go to my GF's family wedding?	"  

Good day everybody, 

I’m a 26M and my girlfriend is a 24F, we've been seeing each other for the better part of 2 years, and I work at her father’s company. 

About 2 weeks ago we received a wedding invitation from a cousin of hers who lives half way around the globe. Over the course of this year we have already attended 2 weddings from her side of the family, both times I've paid for my flights, accommodation and wedding gifts and I’ve also had to take time off work. 

Unfortunately the issue arises with this wedding because earlier this year I took out a loan to buy both my first apartment and car, and as I am required to make monthly payments as well as save up for my future. This makes the third wedding (holiday) this year, an expense I cannot really afford. 

I've told my GF that I wouldn’t be able to afford to make the trip, and while she understood the situation she suggested that she ask her father (my boss) to pay for the expenses as it is a family wedding. 

Immediately I refused the offer. I understand money is by no means an issue for her family, but I know I would feel very weird, uncomfortable and awkward accepting an all expense 6 day trip around the world from effectively my boss (who is only going up for 1 day -the wedding itself as it is a very busy work period). 

Just for additional context I began working at the company a few months before I met my GF, and when we first started seeing each other I had no idea she was the owners daughter. I have a very good relationship with my boss (her father) and truth be told the relationship between me and my GF has made me work harder, and even getting promoted twice based on my performance and merit.

I've spoken to my GF more about this and she insists that paying for boyfriend trips is a normal thing, and truth be told I'd probably feel different if he wasn’t also my boss but I'm very reluctant to change the dynamic of the relationship with her dad in the slightest. 

My parents raised me to work hard and sacrifice for my future and my GF told me that she would support my decision either way, but I know that me not being there will upset her and I honestly do feel bad about the whole situation.

bzoe0l	2019-06-12 08:02:05		AITA for asking my English teacher to review an assignment grade after school ended when I had an 89.9%	"A little preface:
I've always really liked my English teacher, and she has always been nice to me. Towards the end of this semester, my grade started becoming borderline due to a few grades that were put in. My final grade was put in the day after school ended, but it was very low. I sent her an email about it, and she didn't respond. Since grades were due in five days, I sent another email for the next 3 days, amounting to four emails over five days. When she finally got back to me the day grades were due, she said it was inappropriate to email so much and that she wouldn't consider rounding my grade (an 89.93%). For perspective, two points on a 120 point assignment could have saved my grade. I might also add that I feel, as well as many of my peers that I asked, felt that the grade was considerably low and undeserved. 

Am I at fault here for pissing her off and screwing myself over?

bzod9s	2019-06-12 07:59:33	theironfist29	"AITA for been suspicious about my GF's ""Good guy friend"""	"Ok so this happened quite a while ago (maybe 8 years or so) whilst at uni but been subbed to this thread is making me think about all the possible situations I've experienced in the past lol

&#x200B;

So i was dating this girl during my uni days (UK) & it was 100% serious with the intentions of marriage. Just for a bit of context about the girl which i think is quite important. She was private schooled in an all girls school from the age of 3 up until 18 which is when she went to uni so didn't really have any social interactions with males most of her life (other than family and i suppose extended friend groups) & i was her first boyfriend. So she really never knew what was classed as ""too friendly"" with guys in terms of possibly leading them on.

&#x200B;

So all is well with me and her. I'm well integrated with her friends from her course etc. Theres one guy whos quite close to her (shes known him for about a year at this point) & i could tell he liked her more than a friend but didn't do anything because he knew she was taken. I told her from day 1 he likes her and she shrugged it off with something like ""dont be silly its just ""generic name"". Hes more like a woman"". I tried explaining that as a guy, we understand how other guys work and he was definitely interested in her. I expressed the fact that i didn't like his whole demeanour but i wasn't going to make stupid demands like ""i dont want you speaking to him"", all i said was im not comfortable with you two hanging alone because i dont trust him.

&#x200B;

Fast forward maybe a year and half and me and her are quite rocky - i think she was away for a couple of weeks and the first time seeing her was in uni. I walk into the student social area and i see her sat with him and a few other guys from her course. She sort of slouched onto him with her head resting on his shoulder. Seeing this in my current mental state made me flip my lid and ultimately led to us breaking up - she didn't see anything wrong with how she was acting but i think this is disrespectful to one's partner; i would never do that. (which got incredibly messy as we was still seeing each other around in uni & granted we were still quite young and weren't quite ""mature adults"")

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months and turns out they started dating. A part of me thinks that the old saying came into place ""a shoulder to cry on becomes a D\*\*K to ride on"" or they had something going on towards the end of mine and hers relationship.

&#x200B;

It's all in the past now, from what ive been told they got engaged and then broke it off, but i still think of her every now again because i dont think i'll ever feel for someone else what i felt for her.

If any of you read my post about whether or not I should go to 'Sally's' birthday party, you should know that I did in fact, go to 'Sally's' bday. Everything was ok until we had dinner. Sally started to talk about how she was almost pickpocketed in France (She's loaded, goes almost every year to either Disney Paris or Disney California). I genuinely felt bad until the mentioned a very, VERY racist comment.

&#x200B;

She looked around and said, and I quote, ""You know, they were black so they looked at us, saw we were white and thought we were rich.' I almost lost it. I looked at her and said, ""Why does that matter?"" She looked at me again and said: ""I mean, they were black."" I asked her if she was wearing anything extravagant. She said her dad was wearing a fancy watch. I nodded and said it was probably because of that. I told her what she said was a little racist, but I didn't say anything else because it was her birthday and I didn't want to be blamed for ruining it.

&#x200B;

Anyways, after the party, my friend talked to me and said that Sally was actually very, very racist and told me about some other racist things she had said before. (E.G. saying she's scared of African American men because they're 'dodgy' and 'dangerous')

Not only that, We have a little group for having lunch and all of them have confessed to me that Sally did actually call all of them to hang out at a theme park, but me a few times to talk about me. It hurt, and I'm asking of asking her why she didn't invite me and why she says such racist things. Would that make me an asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzoa6m	2019-06-12 07:47:58	did_i_do_right	AITA for cutting off my close friends from my life?	"The three of us(female) have been friends since college. One was my roommate, and the other lived in the same hostel. After college we moved to the city and again lived together in a shared apartment. After one of them got married, the other two of us shared the apartment anyways. Now all three of us are married and living with our families. We meet rarely. Once we all went on an international trip. A few years back, both of them moved to a different country. Coincidentally, I found an opportunity in the same country and they encouraged me and my SO to move there. Which I ended up doing, not only for them, but the fact that they lived there helped make the decision.In college and when we lived together, we always smoked weed. I'm a much more avid smoker esp because I have anxiety and chronic backpain. Also I really enjoy it. But they both reduced smoking as their priorities changed I suppose. I was honest about my habits and occasionally smoked in their presence. They always said they didn't mind me smoking.But slowly I started feeling excluded from their convos. It looked like they always discussed stuff without me. So I gradually cut them out of my life. Stopped meeting but was nice and civil in WhatsApp and other avenues.

This was about 7-8 months back. Now me and SO have stopped smoking as we are looking to conceive. Recently they insisted I meet them and since one of them has the cutest kid (I love kids) I went to meet them. After the meetup, one of them starts msging me saying, ""Somewhere along the time, we have drifted apart"". I was like no, it was a conscious decision from me cos I felt unconfortable with you gals. She then goes on to explain that, she felt I was always high while conversing with them and that she thought that was impeding the quality of our convos and they felt they could not tell me to stop. I never knew all of this. I, meanwhile, was clueless and was getting more and more anxious about why they were excluding me. Mind you, I was easily keeping my job, recreationally smoking on Friday evenings and travels. It was not like I had left all my responsibilities and was some kind of delinquent. So, I lost it. I snapped that they were not honest with me and that they could fuck off with their judgements.Now my friends are spreading around that I'm an asshole who abuses them and things.

I'm not sure if I explained it properly  
tl;dr - My friends stopped talking to me cos I'm a recreational marijuana user. They did not tell me this upfront and I felt paranoid and bad for many months. Now that I have quit marijuana to try to get pregnant, they want to be friends again and I said fuck off. Am I the asshole?  
Edit - We have a decade's worth of history. For some context, I was their go to person for weed during our 20's. They changed their mind in 30's and did not tell me. I have bailed them out of bad situations in many cases. So I was convinced I had their loyalty. Friend2 went out with my boyfriend after I broke up with him. I felt uncomfortable for couple of years until he dumped her. He was definitely an asshole. Friend1 was okay with the whole thing. Friend2 and me were in a car and met with an accident once on a travel trip. Friend2 was broke and I bailed her out with my credit card. She paid me back only half the money and I did not really mind that."	Asshole	0	0

Since I moved out our relationship is somewhat stable, but my parents are still challenging. My brother moved far away and I'm the only family left in this city. That's why my parents always ask me to care for their pets when they're on vacation. I didn't like it, but I kinda felt like I had to, because I thought they would like me more if I did them some favors. The thing is, their dogs are extremely poor behaved. One gets aggressive quite often and the other one just doesn't listen at all. Going on a walk with those two is exhausting.
And since my past was very difficult I go to therapy, where I talk about this stuff. He thinks that I should drastically reduce the contact to my parents, because of the way they treat me (or at least my mum). I was thinking a lot about this, and in hindsight I think he's right. I'm just so exhausted after having contact with them. But until now they always relied on me and I feel guilty for saying no. I'm writing this while sitting at my parents house. My partner had to go to the hospital today and I couldn't accompany him because I have to babysit their dogs. I hate myself rn for not being able to say no.

&#x200B;

To make it simple, I have 3 friends who I mainly hung out with. J, K, N. We're all 25-26. J has a best friend named A. A hates K with a passion. We always assumed it was because K can be a bit unkind to J at times. Around January J and A took a trip to Texas for a convention and while fighting about why A hates K, A admitted to being in love with J (J and A are both guys). J came back from his trip and told K what happened and then said he was distancing himself a bit from A. That turned out to be a lie later. In April J and K stopped living together because J wanted to focus on school and he says he couldn't do that while living with K as he becomes slothish while with her and he also pays the majority of the bills due to K making a bit above minimum wage. He was planning to quit his job and his parents would be taking care of him. After they moved out in April I let K crash at my place as she didn't want to go back to her parents. After two weeks of living here for free and letting her eat our food my mom and brother didn't want her in the house anymore so I had to tell her time was up. She begrudgingly left to her parent's home. The following Friday J was having a BBQ and invited friends over including N and K and some others. I didn't attend due to hanging out with my gf. This is where it kind of starts to go down hill. K was going to speak to J about working on their relationship as she still loved him. J out of seemingly nowhere breaks up with her. The reason: he's in love with A as well and wants to be with him. I find all this out the following Monday. That's when she tells me that she wants to have sex with me. I tell her no as I have a gf and even if I didn't J is one of my friends and I wouldn't betray my friend like that. She goes to N. N used to date K back in the day but that's a story for another day. N agreed and they have sex every day for a week. K suggests getting back together as they are more mature. N declines as he was only interested in having sex and distanced himself a bit. K goes on to be with a coworker of her's for a bit. N confides in me what has happened and I kept it to myself as it wasn't my business. So J and A explore their relationship and J realizes maybe he isn't gay. J makes a plea to get back with K and K immediately agrees. She wants a fresh start with J so she tells him everything from offering me sex, to N, to her coworker. I don't hear from any of them for about a week and J messages me one day to catch up and get coffee together. I agree and meet up with him. It was a ploy to confront me. He asks me about what K has told him and then asks why I didn't say anything to him. My response was that it was none of my business and that he was dating A. From there he tells N not to talk to him again and forbids K from talking to him. K agrees. N is mad at me for not lying and telling J I knew what was going on.

bzo8vq	2019-06-12 07:42:57		AITA for my uneasy feelings towards my brother and his girlfriend?	"*Mobile, native English speaker.*

Started around spring break. My (21F) brother (18M) broke up with his longtime girlfriend of three years, so he moved back home. Night of his breakup, he went to campus and brought a girl home. I was angry because he hadn't told anyone he and longtime gf broke up; told me they were ""on break"". That was a lie, they actually ended it. My brother's relationship with longtime gf wasn't the greatest at the end but given the circumstances, I had lost some respect for him and disliked the new girlfriend. I say that because they immediately started dating. 

My issue started when this girl only came over at 11pm at the earliest. I'm a full time student/part time worker. I have issues going/staying asleep. I felt it was rude to bring someone over late to a house that he hadn't lived in for almost 2 years. I've kindly told him to respect the lifestyles of our family home since we all have same schedules. He always apologized and said he would do better but it became a cycle of him doing what he wanted and I politely talking to him. Not so much an issue now during summer but it still affects my now full-time work schedule. Just imagine what it's like being woken up nightly because they're obnoxiously loud and having sex.

Other issues factor into my brother being stupid, not new gf's fault. There's a difference between drinking and an 18-year-old alcoholic. My parents focus on his inability to keep a job/work. They let us live rent free if we do work and school. He's had around 4 jobs between moving back and now. He goes whenever he feels like it; tells everyone he went to work when he stayed home playing fortnite all day. School? He was suspended for a semester; never told my parents. 

They've talked to him a few times when I was still in school. One night I got 2 hours of sleep on finals week because of them. It isn't that bad now but all these factors have made me dislike new girlfriend. Most of it isn't her fault but I'm past that due to everything, how she's willfully with someone like my brother, and how uninvolved she is. My brother wants me to get to know/like her. I'm not interested. She hasn't really made an effort either. 90% of the time she comes over super late and books it to my brother's room. My parents thinks she's nice but has never interacted with her. I'm pleasant but I keep my distance. 

It's petty and time consuming to be bothered but the nightly disturbances and the overall factors keep piling up. My mom thinks I should get over it. I do until my brother and his gf do their usual disturbances. I'm literally typing this out at 1am because their sex woke me up. I shouldn't be complacent with this and have tried to civilly end the issues. I haven't confronted him because I'll blow up.

She’s well established in her career and really successful , her job is recruiting for companies. And I am a student who’s starting her undergrad at a CSU, a bit late I know but life stuff happened so I started a bit late.
The college I will be attending is about 2 hours from where i live and I’m moving in about 2 months.
Issues started a few months ago when she told me about a job -in the city I will be moving too- and how she could help me with my resume and she knew the person in charge of the department I would be interviewing. We worked on my resume, i interviewed and i didn’t get the job because i lived far and didn’t have any experience. Which I expected going into it .
Fast forward a couple months later I get a voicemail about a job I never applied to and I ask her about it and she said she’s being sending my resume around without telling me. Which made me a bit un comfortable because she didn’t mention it after either . I told her I’d call back on Monday since It was Friday when I noticed the call. Comes Monday and i had a stressful day and forgot to call back she asks me on Tuesday if I called and I told her I forgot but will do it today since it’s my free day( I called but had to leave a message). She then proceeds to blow up on me and said I quote:
“No one is willing to give you a chance and when you do it’s bc I’m putting in a good word for you referral by mouth and it upsetting when you don’t follow back bc it makes me look bad and reputation and then people won’t wanna trust me with referrals again”

And other messages about how I’m not taking my career seriously. And honestly I’m just trying to start school and figure stuff out. And the Jobs she’s telling me about are receptionist jobs and have nothing to do with my degree. Also it sounds like I’m getting these interviews with no intention by them of actually hiring me but as a favor to her.
This happened all over text 
Because She’s out of town for a work conference which she flew out three days earlier to visit a friend she use to hook up with . I wasn’t worried because I’m not a jealous person but honestly she’s been posting videos of her ex constantly almost seems like to show off to me, which I find super immature.

I could be wrong but all of this came off super condescending and she made it all about herself and how she’s wanting to help me. The way she talked to me felt like she was lecturing me not an adult conversation.I apologized for not calling Monday like I said I would but after
she kept saying things like she didn’t see me doing anything for myself and she’s doing all the work. When I’m working really hard to move my life and set my self up for school in a different city.I just don’t share everything I’m doing with her. 
I don’t know if this makes sense but I’m confused on how to feel."		1	0

bzo0uh	2019-06-12 07:13:40	fcukthisusername	AITA for choosing not to extend trip back home to visit family, friends & boyfriend due to financial limitations.	"I [F19] am a student studying abroad and I booked my return flight tickets back home when they were more affordable. So, this means that I had to return midweek back to Perth, where I am currently studying. 

I have told my boyfriend [M20] prior to and after booking the tickets that I will be returning to Perth a few days before my uni term starts, since mid-week flights are cheaper. He did not comment on anything, but only asked once if I could change it to a later flight. I could not afford the ticket then, since I was saving up for a present for him, which he knew about.

Now that I am about 2 weeks away from my semester break (aka exam week) he has repeatedly asked me to extend my trip for another 3 days, which will cost me about another extra $130USD. I have told him that I am trying to save up for when we can meet again, since he will be studying abroad in Ireland and this money is about 10% of the flight ticket there. Moreover, as I am on student visa, there may not be a guarantee that I can get a part time job anytime soon. I rejected his offer to pay for the extended ticket back home since I felt it was not fair for him to pay for *my* trip back home.

He got upset and said that I was prioritising money over physically spending time with him, and that I was making a huge fuss. 

I told him that he should not have been so rude when he was trying to convince me to extend the trip (he was facing away from me and chatting with his friends and even admitting to aimlessly clicking on the screen), and I asked him to call me back when he was ""less busy"" for a proper conversation before hanging up. 

I am not sure if I said those things in a huff and was the asshole, since he said that he was frustrated and anxious hence aimlessly clicking on the screen. He continued to face away from the video call even though I specifically asked him if we could talk. 

Do I just let him pay for the extension? I don't want to feel like I'm have to justify him paying that extra amount and to pay him back I have to be all extra attentive and what not aka make sure like his ""investment"" isn't gonna go to waste. AITA if I don't?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bznzfo	2019-06-12 07:08:48	Doctor_RiverSong	AITA for getting annoyed with my co worker?	"I (25) work in the funeral industry and my co worker (55) has been “new” for the past 3 months. I have no issue training new people as long as they are honest about what they know. When she was hired my boss specifically said she was very familiar with one out of the two major programs we use. I figured cool all I have to do is train her on one and she is good to go.

When she began working for us and I started training her I realized she either lied on her resume or really embellished it. She was acting like she had no idea what the program was she claimed to have been familiar with. Whenever I would train her I would tell her to write things down that way if she gets stuck she can reference her notes, she said yes and never wrote anything down. She would constantly be on her phone while I was training her and she would have questions like I never trained her at all. 

My boss says it’s the language barrier and she will come around to it, but all she does is slow people down when she constantly asks for help with the same tasks day in and day out. What completely drove me wild was that she almost got our boss in trouble because of her lack of knowledge in mortuary law. We have many laws to remember but the basic ones are how to follow next of kinship to understand who needs to legally be obligated to sign the documents. She dismissed two people who should have been the ones to sign first and almost had them sign documents. I told her before she went back as to what she was doing wrong and she got upset that I “criticized” her knowledge. I told her had I not said anything she could have been fired and thrown into a lawsuit for not knowing her laws. She called me, “Ms. perfect” and walked away before I could tell her off. I vented to my co worker as to why she would even be hired if she doesn’t even know the basic laws to get by let alone can’t retain any information. AITA for being annoyed at this?"

We were both saving for a downpayment. He decides to buy his car and borrows some money from another friend to meet his minimum downpayment instead of saving for a little longer. I saved up reasonably enough for my downpayment so I wouldn’t have to pay a lot of interest. So I went ahead and booked my car which has a two month waiting period. I would have to pay the downpayment only when the car is ready. Last month my friend asks me for money to pay back the friend he borrowed from. I made it clear that the money I have is saved up for my car and I would really need it this month for when my car arrives and he assured me he would return it and not cause any delays for me. I had my doubts but I did lend him the money. I have been following up with him for my money but it seems he does not have it and he is trying to arrange the money from someone else. My cars delivery date is coming very close and I feel bad in reminding him constantly about it. I really waited a long time for this and dont want to wait any longer.

bznx7z	2019-06-12 07:01:15	_freakachu	AITA for giving my brother drugs to stave off heroin withdrawal for his daughter’s graduation?	"This is a long one and I (27F) apologize for being on mobile.

About 10 years ago my (half) brother (35) started drinking very heavily, he’s at the point now where he suffers from seizures if he goes without alcohol for more than 6 hours. He’s been in and out of rehab on our mother’s dime for his alcoholism and substance abuse (previously meth). Our relationship has completely dissolved, I grew up with a father that suffered from the same addictions and because of that my brother and his behavior is very triggering for me. I feel more anger and resentment towards him than I do sympathy or patience. 

Five years ago our mom paid his way to move to a different state where he believed he could get clean and sober because he would be away from his hookups and users he knew. Fast forward to about six months ago he swore up and down he was clean and was down to only a few beers a day to keep the edge off; in our eyes this was a total win. After hearing this news, his daughter, who had shut him out for the better part of those five years, reached out and invited him to her high school graduation. This was the first communication they have had in at least a year. 

After picking him up from the airport yesterday he basically admits he lied. He kicked meth but is now going through heroin withdrawals in my living room and has consumed at least four bottles of vodka in the 24 hours he has been here. He is yelling in pain and only alcohol gets that to go away but now he’s a stumbling, sweating drunk. 

My niece’s graduation is tomorrow. I know it would crush her to see him show up this way after all this time and after his lies about becoming clean. There’s no sending him away at this point so I took routes I didn’t know I had to get him detox drugs and heroin (if those aren’t enough) just so he could be somewhat presentable/present for his daughter. I haven’t given them to him yet or told him I have them. I also told my mom (who is driving us to the graduation) that I don’t think he should go at all because of how traumatizing I think it could be for my niece. She believes I hate my brother and want to hurt him/don’t care about him, when really my concern is wholeheartedly for his daughter. 

Am I the asshole for enabling my brother’s addiction for the sake of my niece’s graduation? Am I the asshole for thinking we should bar him from his daughter’s graduation all together?

bznwc4	2019-06-12 06:58:23		AITA for freaking out about insecticide being sprayed in the office?	"My boss hired an exterminator to spray insecticide inside our office while we were working without any prior notification.  We have a relatively mild ant problem in the kitchenette and bathroom of our office.  Occasionally we would see the random ant at our workstations.  The pest control guy showed up on a Thursday afternoon during work hours.  We did not know that he was scheduled for that day or time.  Our boss spoke with him and then rushed out of the office, asking us to follow up with him when he was done.  My colleagues and I honestly thought the pest control guy was doing an assessment of the situation.  A half hour later, we go to talk to him and find out that he has been spraying insecticide all over the single user bathroom (which is poorly ventilated), and at the kitchenette.  He proceeds to spray under our desks as we attempt to remove our personal items in a panic.  After speaking to him, we understand that our boss was well aware that spraying was occurring at that time.

&#x200B;

It's worth mentioning that we live in a very progressive area where most people are into green living and healthy lifestyles.  None of us would ever spray those chemicals in or around our homes.  It's not worth the potential risks.  We all freaked out and left the office immediately, despite the work day not being over.  I did not go in to work the next day.  My boss maintains that he did nothing wrong and refuses to acknowledge that the situation was mishandled.  I'm still seething.  AITA?"		1	0

bznul6	2019-06-12 06:52:12	Jmcb23	WIBTA if I were to cut a friend in need loose, due to her annoying habits and personality impacting on other areas of my life?	"Since graduating from high school almost 10 years ago, she hasn't really been a consistent part of my life. Some years I'd see her often, and others I wouldn't see her at all. 

About a year ago, she got out of a 2-3 year relationship. During this relationship, not one of our friends saw her once as she had basically abandoned the entire group, much to our distaste. Upon breaking up, she revealed that the guy was abusive and manipulative, and this was pretty much the main reason why my friends and myself let her back into the group, as it seemed as though she needed support at the time. The more she tells us about the relationship however, the harder it is to believe the guy was actually abusive, and that she was just desperate and lonely, and willing to let him walk all over her. 

He was caught cheating within the first 6 months, but she still stuck with him and even jetted off with him a few months later when he was offered a job overseas. 18 months later she came home to visit even though she never wanted to; he booked her a flight and convinced her to visit family. A couple of weeks into the visit, he broke it off with her and told her not to return, as he’d been having an affair and chose her instead (he cheated on her often throughout the entire relationship). That didn’t stop her spending the next 6 months trying to convince him to take her back though… 

So this is where the friendship with her kicks off again… Originally, we would meet up monthly with everyone, but over the past couple of months she has been trying to do stuff every weekend. Sometimes even on weeknights after work. While I do see some friends weekly/biweekly, the thing about her is that she can be a drag to be around due to her bad smoking habits and constant need to be the centre of attention. When she’s acting mature, she can be great to be around. 

However, she also has her moments where she acts like a child. If she wants to do something, she usually screeches “CAN WE DO THIS? CAN WE DO THIS? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE?” until we say yes. If we’re around my other friends she doesn’t know too well, she’s constantly screaming, squealing and being unnecessarily loud. If she doesn’t get the attention she craves from that, it’s not uncommon for her to do something that results in her “getting injured”, where she plays on the injury for the rest of the night, trying to harbor sympathy and attention. Things like burning herself with a sparkler, falling and rolling her ankle, or even sudden extreme stomach pains where we’ve rushed her to the ER to find that there’s nothing wrong… They’ve all been tried before, some more than others. 

At the end of the day, it’s embarrassing. Everyone gets awkward and uncomfortable, and I suspect some of my other friends who don’t know her too well have started avoiding events where she’s present, because her personality has become too intense for them to handle.

"My SIL lives in an apartment very close to us, we're also a close family so I see a lot of her. We have our issues as family does but nothing too big. She's always been big on talking in broken sentences, idk like someone who cannot speak properly. I dont even think its baby talk. For example: ""give food"" ""I is anger"" referring to herself in third person. I dont mind quirkiness and it wouldve been fine if it was a rare thing but she does it ALL THE TIME. 

She's a fucking grown up woman in her early thirties and although I havent said anything, it really gets to me. Recently, a friend of mine came over while SIL was around and I was so embarrassed of her talking like someone who DOESNT GET language. 

Its not like she cannot talk normally. She speaks fluently and actually pretty eloquently when she's in public so its definitely not a disability or condition. She just feels cute doing it. I asked her why she does this and she said she feels she is borderline autistic and these antics help her cope without hurting anyone. 

Its not just this either. There's also a lot of cuddling and contact, she keeps getting closer and closer. Being someonr who isn't used to a lot of intimacy, it makes me very uncomfortable. Every time we go to a family event she clings to me all the time and complains if I leave her to meet other people. It makes me feel suffocated.

I feel she can do whatever she wants to as long as i'm not subject to it. The weird talking thing is contagious and every now and then I find myself talking like her. She has severe anxiety and depression issues so I dont know if I should say something to make her feel like theres something wrong with her.

bzntrb	2019-06-12 06:49:25	makeupqueena	WIBTA if I told my Mom I'm not Dog Sitting for her six days after she gets her puppy?	"My Mom is getting a puppy on Thursday. Tonight, she asked me if I would be willing to come over to ""chill with puppy"" for a bit next Wednesday. Next Wednesday would be the first time the puppy is alone all day as my Mom only works in the Afternoon on Tuesdays and my teenage brother starts his exams on the Thursday so would be home by noon.  My parents purposefully got the puppy right before exams because then someone will be home with her all summer, and they didn't think there would be any issues with her being alone too long but my Mom's work schedule changed suddenly so instead of working only in the afternoon Wednesday she works all day and my brother is still in school all day.  

I work from home and own a laptop, so going to their house (we live on the same street) wouldn't be a problem for me HOWEVER my issue is that I've never seen or met a puppy. I've only ever seen adult dogs. I don't know what to do with this puppy, as of yet, I have never met this puppy. My only interaction with dogs has been when I was a teenager babysitting for families who had adult dogs who were well trained with fenced back yards and the dogs knew how to tell me they needed to go out. Or when visiting friend's who own dogs, but they are my friend's dogs. I'm not responsible for it.  This puppy is not house trained. She doesn't know her name yet, or to sit/lay down. 

The puppy can't go to doggy daycare because she hasn't received her second round of vaccines yet (she too little to have). If I don't go over the poor thing will be home all by herself from when my Mom goes to work until my brothers get home from school. I feel really bad about that and I know she will pry make a mess in her crate being in it that long. My Mom feels terrible to leave her too. I feel like an asshole to say I'm not willing to go over a couple of times through the day to play with her, bring her outside, walk her etc but I really, really don't have any idea what to do with a puppy. She's not my dog, I'm married with a home of my own, I just happen to live near my parents. It wasn't my choice that they got a dog (obviously) and I wasn't expecting I'd have to help care for her given that I don't live at home anymore. I also don't really know the first thing about dogs. I've never picked up poop, and as I said, any dog I've experienced has not been a jumpy, energetic, nippy little puppy."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I work at a small advertising agency where everyone is friends with each other and there’s a lot of joking and teasing through the day, even the bosses join in the banter. There are two women in their 20s at my office, A and B, who have been “subtly” flirting with each other for months. They find excuses to be at each other’s desks, they sit side by side at meetings, playfully touch each other often, when they talk A is extra charming and witty and B is all blushy and giggly; it’s frankly adorable. Me and a few other coworkers often joke that it’s like watching a real life rom-com develop before our eyes and that we should pop some champagne for the whole office when they finally get together.

Yesterday I worked later than usual and when I left the building I saw A and B kiss in the parking lot. They didn’t see me and drove off together. Today we had a small party for one of the bosses’ birthday and I noticed A and B standing in the back holding pinkies, so I called out to them “get over here you lovebirds!” They immediately dropped their hands and laughed it off. I said there’s no point in being coy anymore, that the whole office knows there’s something between them and that we’re all happy for them, they look so cute together. A laughed and asked “what are you talking about?” so I teased them a little “c’mon, I know what you two have been up to in the parking lot”. They denied everything. B got super defensive and left the party, A just stayed quiet and wouldn’t meet anyone’s eye which is unlike her. The mood for the party was ruined after that and we all went quietly back to work. My other coworkers were shooting glares at me for the rest of the day.

"My partner got me tickets to a major event in a large city that has high levels of traffic and traffic accidents. They bought these tickets months ago and we agreed then that we were NOT going to be driving to and from that event or in the city at all, if possible. I am the only one of us that has a driver's license, I have pretty severe anxiety about city driving, and I have poor vision driving at night (when we would be returning). This was all known and explained and agreed upon then.

Now, one day before the event, my partner assumes we are driving, taking a ferry boat to this city and taking the car with us, and then driving home on the freeway afterwards. I immediately got confused and asserted that we would drive to the ferry dock, board without our car, and walk to and from the venue and wait for our return ferry (which is about a 3 hour longer wait than driving).

My partner offers to drive in the high traffic city, but they do not have their license and only have a permit, do not own the car we would take and it is not under their insurance, have never driven in a major city before, and have never driven in hot weather (above 90F) before or seen peoples' tempers in it. I decline their offer and they seemed upset that I didn't trust their abilities but ultimately settle for the longer wait time and to take the return ferry.

They still object to the plan since it's not as time effective, and have told me that they don't want to be tired the next day from staying up late (they could sleep at the ferry dock, for what it's worth.)

"I (25F) and my fiancé (27M) have been together for longer than his brother has been with his girlfriend (amber). However, she has been problematic and toxic ever since she came into the picture. I tried fostering a relationship with her in the past, she repeatedly stabbed me in the back, and now we have no relationship with each other beyond being cordial at family events. 

My family is very traditional and old school and of a different foreign culture than fiancé’s family. In my family, they don’t believe in cohabitation or long term relationships without engagement or marriage as the end goal. I have fought them on this so many times, my own fiancé wasn’t welcome in their home for years until we got engaged, but at the end of the day this is just how they are.

They also have strong opinions on cosmetic surgery and how people dress (both men and women) and carry themselves. 

Amber has had a lot of obvious plastic. From her breast implants to her butt implants, and she also dresses very provocatively all the time. Even in situations where it’s inappropriate. It can sometimes be embarrassing. She also carries herself in a way that I know my family will have issue with (read: loud and trashy). 

I told my fiancé I don’t want her at the wedding. She, to me, isn’t worth the crap my family will give me about her and her presence and demeanor will make a lot of people in my family uncomfortable. I don’t even like her, it’s my wedding, and in my eyes she isn’t technically part of my fiancé’s family so he shouldn’t be so offended about this. 

But fiancé is upset and thinks my request is out of line and thinks he can’t tell his brother not to bring her. I know my family though and this is gonna be a bigger issue for them than fiancé seems to realize.

But my mom (F50).... She gets really nervous anytime I'm going out of the town. She thinks that it's dangerous and if I drive far enough from the town I will definitely get into a car crash and die.
So, she got to know that we are planning that trip and called my wife and started to convince her to cancel the trip cause she had felt that there would be an accident (she really thinks that she has sort of superpowers to predict accidents). And also there is a Christian celebration this week and according to the superstition people are not allowed to swim in the sea. She told my wife that she has to find any reason not to go on this trip. 
My wife got mad at me and my mom, cause she really wanted that trip.
So I decided to call my mom and ask why did she try to manipulate me that ridiculous way instead of calling me and just asking me to stay. But the thing is, that she is hypertonic and anytime she gets nervous, her blood pressure gets high and she feels really bad. So I tried to do it as polite as I could, but she got mad at me, started shouting and so on... I called a few hours later, her husband said she feels sick and she can't talk.
So I have to deal with it all the time - anytime I don't agree with something she says, she gets nervous, her blood pressure gets high and she feels like dying.

bznium	2019-06-12 06:10:56	Eric3568	AITA for thinking it's not always worth it?	"A bit of background. I'm a musician (24m), I'm in college and for a few years now I've been working several jobs. This is both to be able to afford what I do but also because I'm a bit of a sucker when it comes to gear for my hobbies (music, cars and photography are all pretty expensive). I have pretty strict rules about how I spend money thanks to the guys at r/personalfinance.

I was driving home from a show with the other guitarist in my band who's also my best friend, we played with a band from Milan (about 300km from where we live), and that makes it a 600km trip for them. They played last, but unfortunately they only played in front of 20 to 30 people at the venue.
While driving back, I told my friend (23m) that if I had to drive all that distance, ask for a day off at work, spend money and drive just to play in front of 20 bored people I'd be pissed off and wouldn't do it.
He basically replied that it's a hobby, that I always value money more, and that the experience, the trip, meeting the other bands is always worth it and he would do it. Obviously it is a bit of a problem since in a band it's all or nothing, and if one person says no then it's a no-go.

Final piece of context: I paid for all my gear, as I've been for years. Every single piece of hardware he has was gifted from his parents. He can use his low income for his hobbies because his parents pay for his college and also give him an allowance. We always use my car that I have to pay for even if we could use his for free since his family would pay for it. He takes for granted that I will do it and it took me one year to make him understand that it's not free for me and it puts me in a stressful spot.

So, AITA for thinking that even in our passion some things are just not worth it? Am I a greedy sucker who's putting a price tag on meaningful life experiences?

EDIT 1: okay so obligatory edit. My point is not that we shouldn't spend resources on this just because it doesn't make us any money. My point is actually that if you do everything all the time you might not have the resources when it comes to more important things. You could play 20 small shows with 10 people OR you could only play 5 and then record at a better recording studio, gaining experience and having a better sounding record that makes you proud. Also, if I take a day off at work today for a small show my boss might not give me another for a larger and more important show tomorrow. It's not about earning, it's about choosing where to direct limited resources."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bzni9g	2019-06-12 06:08:43	Hashebrowns	AITA For getting pissed at my mom in Home Depot	"We were looking for a father's day gift and decided on a Milwaukee Workbench, $700. The rest of the family would split it and get it for him together. I was paying $200 and had no problem with it, it looked awesome.

So then we had to get it into our car.

The thing weighed 400 pounds, at the time I thought it weighed 1500 which was... A real overestimate. My mom *really* insisted on taking one of the displays, as it was pre-assembled and she figured it would be easier to transport. This is where I objected, as the boxed ones were on pallets and could easily be moved with Pallet jacks, and the display still had a backboard on it which made it too big, so we had to remove it. I kept telling her it would be easier to get it completely new and that I would assemble it for her, but she kept declining.

Eventually I just agreed and we got some guys to help us get the backboard off. It was a bit of a hassle but nothing major. We got it off and wheeled the workbench out to our car. It was far too heavy for two people to lift, so the employees had to call in two more guys to help, and they still couldn't lift it. (Bear in mind we were still out in the parking lot, not the loading area)

My mom was getting livid at this point due to the delays and having to look for more people, and eventually she just gave up, grabbed the refund, and we just left.

I could have kept my cool and just helped, but I was getting really annoyed, because she was putting a lot of pressure on the employees and most of the mess could have been avoided if we just took a brand new workbench. I said something like ""You could have just got the fucking box.""

She was really angry with me afterwards, saying that I was embarrassing her in front of everyone with my complaints. I kept telling her I didn't mean to, that I was frustrated, and I was trying to justify myself. She kept asking me ""Is it really that important for you to be right?"" Later tonight (now) she came into my room a few minutes ago telling me the same stuff, adding ""If I talked to you like that in front of your friends would be embarrassed?"" and ""You're wrong, so just drop it."" She also rubbed it in my face she found out the bench weighed 400 pounds.

Now, I know I'm probably painting my mom as the asshole right now but I was getting really frustrated with her, more than I think I should have. I feel like this whole thing could have been avoided if I just did as she said.

AITA?

Edit: Okay I think this needs to be said. I did not yell at my mom, nor did I 'blow up' in any kind of way. I had somewhat of an aggressive tone after a while, but I did not raise my voice at her."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bznhsj	2019-06-12 06:06:59	AToastDoctor	AITA for reporting a whole team of throwers in Overwatch (They were all grouped up)	"Edit: To clarify, I am 200% sure they were throwing, they would run around and not attack, spam emotes or jump off cliffs. They would spam hello and not do much else. Only on of them ever attacked and he only got one kill and immediately walked to a cliff, emoted and jumped off

&#x200B;

So me and an Overwatch player were in a group when we come across an entire 6 player team. Now we both suck and are bordering between Bronze and Silver. Immediately there is no opposition, the team put up no fight. Now note that all 6 of them were grouped up and doing this deliberately, important to know that they are not hurting their team because they are all doing this. However they are still in my mind hurting other people in other ways.

&#x200B;

I suggest to my team that we should report them, the person I was grouped up with, (Call her B) says ""Why, it's free SR and they are all consenting to it""

&#x200B;

I explained that by throwing they are deliberately putting themselves in a lower rank to have easy fights, B started arguing that it's none of my business that they are throwing to have an easier fight since they were not on my team, her argument was that they could feel discontent with staying in a higher rank and not making any progress so by throwing they are getting fun out of the game. B then tells me that they paid to have fun and they have a right to have fun and if that means throwing to have easier games then so be it.

&#x200B;

I told her I was going to report them all anyways, I did. I told her that by throwing they are going to crush lower ranked players easily when they do fight and are thus robbing those players of their fun. I told her I don't condone cheating and that any kind of smurfing is just being inconsiderate.

&#x200B;

Suffice to say she got mad at me and told me I need to learn to mind my business. I then asked her, how she likes it when she goes up against smurfs and she said she hates smurfs with a passion but claims that we are unlikely to come up against these guys because they are aiming obviously for far lower ranks. Her argument is that it's ok because they aren't doing it to us.

&#x200B;

I try to think of other people in this case, I took into consideration what she said, yes maybe they find the game unfun because they are stuck in Gold and wanna climb, but not matter how I look at it I cannot find anyway to condone these people. It isn't right in my opinion to rob other people of their fun so you can have yours. No one likes losing but in a ranked fight everyone goes in expecting a fair and balanced fight between two consenting teams, by throwing and smurfing they are violating that consent to rob other people of their enjoyable experience just so they can feed their insecurity. This is at least how I see it. This isn't fair to me so I reported them and I lost a friend on Battle net.

&#x200B;

So Reddit is reporting a bunch of people deliberately throwing in Overwatch comp to crush lower ranked players an asshole thing to do? Is condemning cheating right on my part?"	Not enough info	0	0
bznhjh	2019-06-12 06:06:05		AITA For hurting a guy who was disrespecting me and my property?	"So I was boating on my friends pontoon for the majority of a day. Me and all my friends present are college kids. So naturally we drink a bit and enjoy ourselves. 

Come 10pm we are docking and tying down my friends boat and everyone but me is SAUCED. I was having fun being able to wakeboard and wakeskate with a perfect buzz and I knew I’d end up driving people home, so I didn’t drink all that much.

After we dock the boat, I offer to drive people home. Three people end up taking my offer. I think, “great, I can make sure some of my more irresponsible friends will make it home safe”. I despise drunk driving and I don’t all that much like being drunk, so i was happy to do it.

Well, one of the guys i was taking home I had just met that day. We were cool all day and he was a decent water skier, no issues. He is wasted while I’m taking him home and is being a complete ass. He was kicking my car door, yelling out the window, yelling in my car. Just basically doing everything you shouldn’t do when your driver has had even one drink and could get pulled over.

I end up pulling to the side of the road, yelling at him and telling him I’m done asking, he needs to shut the fuck up before I kick him out. He doesn’t stop. The final straw was when we pulled up to where I was dropping him off and he said, “I’m thinking bout knocking you out”.  At that point I told him to get out of my car, and I did the same. I’m 6’4”. This guy is maybe 5’11” on a good day. I get him down easy, and as I pull back for a punch, his friend yells “you won, don’t hit him”.

But I did. I hit him and I hit him hard several times. I ended making contact with his nose many times and I think I broke it.

I feel terrible so I found his number from a friend and texted him and his other friend to apologize and explain I went too far and that he was drunk. He didn’t deserve it, I caused him much more distress than he caused me.

Am I the asshole?

Now i know for a fact this is all bullshit, if he really went 23-0 as a pro boxer surely something would show up when i google his name right. 

Anyway im 19 and have been training muay thai for 8 years (still am), and wrestled in high school, i am very fit and am very proud of my progress in martial arts and fitness considering i too was once a tub of lard. 

I rarely hang out with him outside of work becuase he never shuts up about this shit, and other lies including ""i could have graduated cullinary school with high honors but i got kicked out for fighting"" and ""i know high profile gangbangers who make millions a year, thats why i work in this resturant, for fun, not becuase i need too"". But for some reason we were hanging out, having a few beers watching UFC last weekend and he said ""i could KO both these bums, no challenge"" (he said this during the blagoy ivanov vs tai tuivasa fight).

So i snapped, and said back ""man i fucking doubt you could even kick my ass and im 19, and half your weight, stop lying about this boxing bullshit, nothing even shows up when you google your name, and if you really wanna take up that challenge come down to my muay thai gym and try, i would maul you""

He got all pissy and walked out, and i told all my coworkers about it. The majority of them think im an asshole, although a few agree with me.

For background info hes 29, im 19. And it was just the two of us when i called him out but i will admit i told some of the coworkers i liked."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bznd7o	2019-06-12 05:51:36	WhiteNikeAirs	AITA: I wrote my parents an angry letter after they overreacted to a white lie.	"Background information: My parents and I have always had a rocky relationship, I'll be the first to say I haven't been an angel of a son, and I lie to them frequently. I lie because whenever I go to them with things, it usually result s in a complete tear down of my lack of maturity, responsibility, and overall character. This in addition to extreme paranoia when I go out makes communication hard. 

In this situation: I told them I was going to spend the night at my friends house with the guys, per usual. A friend of ours (F17) with whom, none of us have a sexual/romantic relationship with invited us over to her house for a bonfire, there were a few of her friends there and it was a harmless night of just hanging out. It was decided that we would spend the night at her house, and since I didn't want to be the guy to say no, I just went along with it and told my mom I was headed back to the original house.  The houses are like 2 miles away from each other so I assumed it was inconsequential. 2 nights later I receive a phone call from my weeping mother since she found out through another friends mom that we had slept over at a different friends house. The other mom had also been lied to but wasn't very distraught over it. Apparently my other friends had lied as well and their parents still didn't seem to care all that much. My parents on the other hand, dug into me about how I betrayed another friends mom because I had driven her son to the wrong house, and I betrayed them because I lied (which is understandable). I tried to explain to them that I didn't lie to them because I hate them or don't trust them, but because dealing with them is difficult and I didn't want to have to go home after spending an hour with them on the phone. 

The letter: The letter is 8 pages long, but the gist of it is that I'm upset that my year worth of hard work and relationship building is being thrown out the window for a small lie. I wrote how I don't want to lie to them, it's just that the way they react to everything makes me feel like lying is the only choice. I told them how their paranoia has made me a very anxious person and how it's made romantic relationships really hard for me. I gave them an ultimatum saying that I will go out of state for college just to get away from them with or without their money, and that if they want to have a voice in my life they need to adjust the way they interact with me. I ended the letter with a list of things they do well as parents since at the end of the day I don't hate them, I just need them to work on the way they treat me. 

In Short: My parents and I have had a rocky relationship in the past, I've been trying to improve it over the past year but they still haven't changed the way they interact with me. I lied to them about where I was sleeping over and my mom over reacted and started crying about my ""betrayal"" I wrote them an angry  letter saying why I feel like I need to lie to them all the time."

bznd77	2019-06-12 05:51:32	Michael_Perth_50	AITA for letting my nephew drink beer at my house?	"I'll keep this brief.

bznc12	2019-06-12 05:47:20		AITA (22f) for trying to push my sister (16f) away from her partner (17m) because I don’t think he is a ‘good fit’.	"Background, I live in a small city in Australia. My Mother lives in a tiny town in the Blue Mountains, 14 hours away, and my sister recently moved there. 

Prior to her moving, she and her partner had been living with myself and my partner (22m). So when she left, he was left behind to pack up his things, get his life together and move with us when we move in a month or so. 

But the more I have to live with the kid the more I realise his aggression and, for lack of a better word, ‘ladish’ behaviour will cause friction like you would not believe with my mother who is a ‘don’t bullshit me mate’ kind of sheila. 
I’m trying to prepare him before he moves and gets a rude shock when he discovers my mother doesn’t agree with the way he handles things. Though, it doesn’t seem to matter how much I try to talk to him about it, he won’t listen. He thinks conversation is a pissing contest and believes he can live in my mother’s house, smoke weed and not work for “however long I want because it’s my life and no one is telling me what to do”.

I feel for the kid, he dropped out in yr 10 and bounced between his mum and dad for years. The father being meth and drink addled, he’s got some issues of his own and honestly I think my sister just adds to it. She’s crazy, among many other things, she wakes him up at 6am everyday because she’s going to work and that means he also has to be awake?
But despite that, he has been living here for almost 5 months, and I thought we could have got through to him by now but there are no signs of intelligent life anywhere...

Anyway, my sister and him have fights almost every single day without fail. It’s been testing on my nerves and I won’t lie when I say I’ve egged them on recently and maybe caused a few too. Their relationship isn’t that old and I’m not even sure if my sister is that invested, so I don’t see the harm when he is going to cause harmful friction in my family which is already walking a fine line of destruction. Not to mention that him moving 14 hours away at the age of 17 is also stirring up friction in his family. To me, it’s not worth it for either sides.

bznbwi	2019-06-12 05:46:58	gallifreyanoctodoc	AITA for not letting my mother-in-law move in?	"I’m new so I apologize if I’m doing this wrong but I need some outside perspective. My MIL (65) wants to move into my (33m) and my wife’s (34f) house with our two young children (6&1). I absolutely refuse to let this happen, basically giving my wife an ultimatum of “if she moves in, I’m moving out.”

Some background: my family (me, wife, daughter) rented a house with MIL for about a year, splitting rent mostly so my wife and I could try to save enough away for a down payment on a home of our own. This arrangement lasted roughly a year, and everyone, including MIL, was miserable. We didn’t “respect” her because we weren’t clean enough for her liking, she would constantly pick fights with my wife, manipulate her, and emotionally abuse her. And told my daughter some weird stuff that I felt like I was constantly doing damage control for. She largely ignored me.

More background on MIL: she’s been married and divorced 4 times, has no friends that any of us know of, and has alienated what little family she has left. She’s had approximately 30 jobs in her life, which is as close a guess as my wife could give me because she honestly can’t remember all of them. She’s currently unemployed, has exhausted her benefits, and seems to have no interest in doing jobs she deems “beneath” her. (She quit her last job at a clothing store because she “didn’t like it” and “had to be on my feet all day.”) Also, after my wife and I moved out and into our home, MIL insisted on getting a 2bd apt despite never having guests or even enough stuff to fill it.

One more illustration of what MIL is like: my wife’s aunt and uncle helped raise her and treat her like she’s their daughter. When my daughter was born I made the executive decision that our kids would call them Grandma and Grandpa. MIL HATES this, and recently told my daughter”you know, she isn’t REALLY your grandma...”

On the other side, we DO have room in the house. Not for all of her stuff, but we have an extra bedroom. I’d hoped to turn it into an office one day, but here we are. I’d be willing to let her stay for a short time while she “figures something out,” but we all know if she moves in, she’s never leaving. Laying claim to that basement room is her endgame/retirement plan.

But even after all of that, my wife loves her mother, and would be devastated if her mom ended up homeless. She (only child) doesn’t WANT her mom to move in but feels guilty and responsible and like she should be able to DO something. I’ve told her that her mother’s own actions and decisions over a lifetime have put her in her current position. But I know that’s still hard to hear.

tl;dr - my MIL is on the verge of eviction with absolutely no money, no family, and no resources to turn to besides my wife. MIL believes we are obligated to take her in indefinitely, despite the damage I am certain it will cause to everyone in my family to have her around 24/7.

When her step-mother called to tell her, she was very upset about it and she began telling my aunt and myself and my sister about the things she had always wanted and the things she’s like to have of his. I looked at her and told her that she wasn’t entitled to her father’s things because they had no relationship and she never actually considered him to be her father. She looked at me like I had just told her I fucked a llama and she began crying. 

She has not talked to me since Saturday. So, AITA? I obviously feel terrible that I made her cry but it’s my real opinion and it’s bizarre that she thinks she can go and claim his things."	Asshole	1	0

bzn3ft	2019-06-12 05:17:34	unidentifiedmale1	AITA for refusing to destroy photos of my ex-husband now that she is a woman?	"I got divorced 4 years ago and my former husband has since transitioned and is living as a woman. We are still friends and I have been supportive during her transition. It has been a strange and difficult process in some ways but in other ways it is clear that she is a lot better off now. 

She is trying to make a ""clean slate"" of things and says she wants new people she meets to know her as a woman. It's not so much about lying to people or pretending she was never a man, she just doesn't want them to see it. So part of that is she apparently doesn't feel comfortable with having photos on social media of the way she looked as a man. 

She asked me to go through all my profiles and delete every old photo that has her in it. She even asked me to delete photos off my phone, and even to get rid of some random photos I have in my house. Like they are sitting there in a photo frame and she wants me to throw it out. I said no, I'm not deleting any of it. It's like three years of my life that she is basically asking me to pretend it never happened. She is mad at me. I told her no one is looking at my old social media photos but I guess it is a matter of principle for her. It's become a matter of principle for me too. She's like Stalin getting me to erase her from history. Am I the asshole for leaving them up? No one's looking at them anyway!"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzn34z	2019-06-12 05:16:38	kebapmuncher	WIBTA if I cut ties with my cousin?	"So my cousin and I have always been like sisters growing up (we are both 22). But a year and a half ago our family had a big disagreement and her mom no longer speaks to my mom, grandfather, or my other Aunty. As a result, all my cousins and I have been stuck in the middle but still stand behind our parents and have been supporting them without interfering. 

The thing is.. my cousin and I had already been slowly drifting apart within the last 2-3 years due to adulting. However, we would still always txt each other and see each other once a month.. until the disagreement. I have only seen her a handful of times since then. Whenever I try to make plans she tells me that she is busy with work or uni. But she has been spending A LOT of time with a second cousin (I’m not close with) from the other side of my family who she is not even related to. I was upset but accepted that I will just see her when I see her. 

A week ago my cousin came over with my second cousin to see us. Two days ago, we heard that my cousin and aunt were going to fly overseas that very night (to our motherland for 5 weeks) and didn’t want our family to know. We were all confused and weren’t sure how true this piece of info was. So to test this I texted my cousin asking to hang out next week..  she replied “I don’t know I’ll let you know.” Last night they arrived overseas and she posted a pic of herself and her overseas BF on IG. I believe she is going to get engaged whilst there as she briefly mentioned something like this to me 6 months ago. 

I texted her “I guess we aren’t hanging out next week” to which she replied “yea we aren’t.” My aunty apparently told her not to say anything to us about the trip. But I am still very upset with her, I try and try but never get anything in return. I’m not sure if I am being dramatic and blowing things out of proportion OR if I even have a right to be upset by this. The last txt I sent her was “Anyway, congratulations. Hope everything works out. Have a good life “sister.”” Her last txt was “Don’t be like this.” 

I believe we still care about each other very much but I have become so tired of being the one chasing after her all the time. I can’t forgive how distant she has allowed us to become, and I find those very few times we actually do hang out she’s always comparing and competing over things in our lives, such as weight, relationships, possessions. 

I don’t know. I still love her very much and I know that she would be upset if I cut her off for good.

"So I (19f) broke off my year and a half long relationship with my ex boyfriend (22m) about 2 weeks ago over the phone. We just had lots of differences and things weren’t moving forward so i broke it off on the phone as I didn’t want to make him drive out to my house just to receive bad news and have him drive home in a bad mindset. He was upset for a while but overall we were kind of okay. One day we were texting in order to
plan how we would exchange our belongings from each other’s houses and he asked to get lunch after, I said i would pass on lunch as i didn’t think it was a good idea and he lost it. He was very angry, he called me names, blamed my friend for influencing my decision, told me i was a bad person and selfish and that the breakup was unwarranted because all i wanted was an excuse to see other guys. After this, i didn’t want to even physically see him as i was so angry, so i said my mom (49f) and his mom (52f) would exchange our stuff, as they got along well before we broke up and it would be less emotional for him and I. 

My mom went today to meet his mom, and she told me they had a nice time and i should text her. I said “what am i supposed to say? sorry i broke your sons heart?” Now i said this obviously as a joke, I cope by making dumb jokes and i know it was in poor taste but she was so upset by this. I told her i was sorry but i didn’t know what to say to his mom, especially considering her son called me some very awful things and was angry with me. I wouldn’t even know what to say to her. She went on to call me selfish and said I need to start acting like an adult. So, i don’t feel like i should have to say anything to anyone really. I would be more inclined obviously if she had texted or called me, but she hasn’t so why should I say anything?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bzmyyc	2019-06-12 05:03:15	AradonVilhael	AITA for video-gaming with someone outside of my main friend group?	"So, a while back I was friends with this guy (let’s call him X), and he and I never got terribly close but we did video-game together in a clan and played some games outside of it. X and I grew apart due to different interests in games but recently he had told me he had bought this game that I’m in love with at the moment. 

The group of friends I normally game with all disliked this game, as it’s hardcore and it’s not really a game you can joke around in.

I was ecstatic to have someone else to play with. I had spent months trying to play by myself and I just wasn’t getting too far.

It’s also important to note that they weren’t really too big a fan of X. We all know each other IRL, but the others don’t get along with X too well and think he’s annoying.

The more I played this game with X, the more the other guys I played with got irritated. There was one day they messaged me around 200 times because they wanted me to play with them and not X. I didn’t want to ditch X since we were playing and had been playing for a few hours. X also had asked me to play first and I didn’t want to have him think he was just a backup friend, because he wasn’t.

The game I play with the group is best as a 4-person team, and it’s hard for all 4 of us to get on at the same time. That was what they said was the main reason I should play with them over X. However, if one of them is busy doing something else (such as: talking to their girlfriend, watching anime, or they just don’t feel like it) I don’t think they would get bothered nearly as much. This wasn’t a singular incident, but this was what I’d consider the turning point.

I played with them a few more times, but they still kicked me from their server after I stopped playing with them as much as I had before. I would try to split my free time between things I wanted to do other than gaming, playing with X, and playing with them. But since it’s hard to get all 4 of us together and X doesn’t really get too busy, there wasn’t as much of a balance as I would’ve liked between the 3.

They eventually (about a month of me playing with X again) kicked me from their discord server (an app to communicate on computers). I’m not sure if they think I was cutting them off, assumed I didn’t want to play with them again, or are just getting rid of me because I wouldn’t do what they wanted.

bzmw4y	2019-06-12 04:53:57		AITA for having no patience for my disabled cousin anymore?	"My cousin is one year older than me. She has some intellectual disabilities (but she can still hold a basic job, drive, lives alone now etc...), and she is severely bipolar. 

She was cruel to me as a child but when we became teenagers I developed a soft spot for her as I began dealing with severe depression and could imagine more easily just how lonely she was. She never made any friends so I became her best friend. She was still mean to me and would yell at me often, and even stole from me on one occasion,  but I just dealt with it because I told myself she couldn’t help it and I was all she had. I definitely called her out on her crap, but it never mattered long term. But I only saw her a few times a year, so I sucked it up and gave her a clean slate each time.

Fast forward. She began to date her first “serious” boyfriend. When we were hanging out she joked that he saw pictures of me and wanted her to send a video of us (my cousin and i) kissing. I obviously said no and just pretended it never happened. Again, I excused her behavior in my head, telling myself she’s not sure how to handle these feelings and relationships blah blah blah. 

Fast forward again to a different boyfriend. She would repeatedly tell me that he has seen pictures of me and i’m his “dream girl”. I laughed it off, i’m used to her making comments about my appearance. But then I came to visit again and she told me he wants pictures of me. I’m sure everyone can imagine the raised eyebrows and tone she used when she said the word, “pictures.” 

At this point I was done. I don’t feel in any danger around her of course but I feel extremely uncomfortable and I just have no desire to hang out alone with her again and give her the room to make these remarks. It all kind of boiled over and the clean slate wasn’t possible anymore.

I didn’t want anyone else to know for her sake, but I told my own immediate family. My dad and sister are fully on my side to never spend time alone with her again, but my mom kinda shrugged it off and told me she’s harmless and i’m the only good thing in her life and it’s only a few days a year. 

I just don’t know what to do.  I do feel for her, but the thought of spending time with her alone now really doesn’t sit well with me. It takes so much out of me mentally to just pretend to be okay with this when I know these things go far beyond her disability. I have known her all my life, and she has been enabled and uses it as excuse to behave badly. As I said before, I call her out. It has never made a difference.

Anyway during a rant to me about his troubles I suggest he learn to code or at least give it a shot as that job market is thriving in our area. I offered my services too (I privately tutor mainly dropouts for free after-hours and have lots of recruiter contacts).

The reaction was super negative. Apparently that's hate-speech and a weaponized phrase to target and devalue media workers. *Before you call me a troll*, I looked into it and apparently yes there was a huge period of time, mainly on Twitter, where there was great controversy about ""Learn to Code"" being used to attack and undermine media workers coming off of the big 2018 layoffs that field faced.

The advice was unsolicited I will admit - he was ranting about finances and I took it in a direction he did not invite me to take at all. I later found out it can be incredibly offensive to suggest that, but swear my goal was good.

bzms7j	2019-06-12 04:40:52	FoxtailZerda	AITA for thinking I shouldn’t have to remind my friend?	"Strap in, folks, I got a lot of context to dump.
I’ve been talking with a friend I made on Discord for a while now. Despite the occasional rough patch, we’re generally on good terms with each other, and one of our favorite things to do is roleplay (nothing sexual, I promise). But sometimes he gets busy and it takes him a while to get around to replying. I am okay with this, I understand that he’s got other stuff to do and can’t always be there to reply quickly. He also tells me that even after he’s finished his workload for the time being, sometimes he just forgets to reply, so he asks me to remind him sometimes. Again, I have no problem with this, there’s no shame in forgetting things- to an extent at least. But here’s the kicker: even though I directly told him that it doesn’t bother me that he takes a while to reply (I have other friends I also like to role play with, also nothing sexual, so I’m used to it) apparently it bothers him that he takes so long to reply, and he often gets snippy if I don’t remind him enough. So he does remember on his own sometimes, but instead of using that to actually continue the story we’re playing, he uses it to complain that I didn’t remind him.

So in essence, it feels like he’s blaming his forgetting to reply consistently on me not reminding him enough. It feels like he’s trying to push responsibility onto me so it doesn’t have to be his fault. That just rubs me the wrong way, but I can see where he’s coming from. I’m conflicted, so that’s why I’m here. What do you guys think? AITA?

Edit: This whole situation wouldn’t even bother me if he didn’t specifically say that he had a problem with it and imply that I’m responsible somehow. If it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t even be here talking about it."	No A-holes here	0	0

So some background, I met my friend during my  sophomore and his freshman year in high school in my districts JROTC program and we hit it off and we have been really good friends although. During my last year he wanted to join the Marines and wanted me to join with him, I have always wanted to join the military and see something beyond the US so doing that with my friend seemed like a great idea. But as year progressed he would always ask for rides but not hangout, and when he did he just asked us to stay in our friends room while he had sex in our living room so we had to ask if we could come out. This was annoying but I overlooked it until I questioned enlisting in the Marines and he got angry at me and talking to me for about a weekend then said I was mad at him. It pissed me off but I moved on and told him why I thought the Marines weren’t right for me and why I thought the Navy was a better choice in the long run, he accepted it but made fun of me. The first time I just thought it was a joke but he wouldn’t stop and used greetings like “so how much dick have you sucked” or “ that’s why Marines are better” every time me or my other friend made a mistake. I just stopped talking to him until June 6th when I made a post about honoring all the men who spearheaded the liberation of Europe and he said something along the lines of hur hur navy gay and I just blocked him.

It is a three lane pool, two of which are used for doing laps and one for free swimming for like families and stuff. A boy around 14 was in his 12 year old sisters face splashing her repeatedly. She was telling him to stop; it wasn't too violent they were just playing around. However, as it progressed over the next couple of minutes it became more violent to the point where it looked like he was punching her. They were now leaving the free style lane and rough housing in my lane.  
This is when I told the boy to get out of the pool. His parents weren't around to do anything as they were in the gym working out. You aren't supposed to leave your children unattended in the pool in the first place. The boy got out of the pool saying ""You are lucky that you are older"" and I told him that he was lucky I didn't get management to kick them all out. After I did one more lap I saw him get back into the pool, so I went to management to tell them what was going on.

When management came out there mom had been called by the kids and she was furious, getting in my face telling me that I don't tell her kids what to do that I should have got management in the first place. She was obviously trying to provoke me to get angry, but I just told the manager what happened and walked away.

"Let me start off by saying that I am definitely not a ""hold a grudge for years and then finally forgive you after I yell at you beforehand"" type of person. I forget about confrontations and fights fairly quickly with some time alone, and will apologize quickly after if I need to.

With that being said, most of the time I will apologize even if I am not in the wrong, simply because I hate confrontation (I am a very anxious person and get paranoid easily).

This girl, who we will call N, has taken advantage of that fact. We had an argument because I asked her for gas money. She REFUSED, saying that she doesn't have to pay me because we live in the same neighborhood. I told her to take the bus. N stopped talking to me after this and I decided it would be best if I also had my mind elsewhere (This is a shortened version of the argument but it really wasn't more than that). Exams were coming up and I didn't want any distractions.

Recently, I've started to miss her a lot. Tonight I especially missed her, so I texted her and let her know that I loved and missed her and would like to chat about what happened. She didn't answer me at first, but eventually did and told me that she was still sad and angry at what I ""did"" and that her mom is disappointed at my ""attitude."" 

I am very confused. Maybe it's because I don't see it from her point of view, but I really don't understand how she can still be angry. I don't understand how she can still hold this grudge for a month and a half now and still ignore me when I try to talk to her.

Honestly, I just don't see how she thinks that she is right in the point that I shouldn't have asked her for gas money. I also don't see why that matters in the first place.

In the end, she told me she would talk about it but that she would bring it up because she knew she was right. I told her and I quote, ""If I'm going to dive headfirst into an onslaught of negative mental stimulation then I would rather not put myself into that situation.""

My parents don’t want me to go to another country for college which I understand but on the other hand they also want me to be independent.
I get that my dad is paying for my college and he has the final decision, but I think I should agree also. I understand the economic possibilities of my family so I’m looking for good and affordable colleges in Spain and Germany (I have the European passport) I know the expenses, that I would have to live alone and do everything by myself but I also would like to work (I know Germany is way better for job opportunities)
I’ve search everything about it and the costs of living in those countries and also found that they are great in education.

The fact is that the other day I got into a fight with my parents because my dad didn’t want to listen to me he just said You are not going there! (We’ve only looked in one college, the local one and nothing else) I told them that we should look for more colleges not just the first one and that’s it, that that wasn’t an smart move. So they screamed and me and told me that I was financially tied to them so I couldn’t do much about it and I responded as an impulse: Well, I’ll move out when I turn 18 and I’ll find a job, my mom got sad for what I said so she responded: Well, there are other (emotional) things that tie me to you. I felt bad for what I said out of frustration.
They also said that I’m not responsible enough to live by myself, or mature enough but I think I’m trying to prove them otherwise, but despite that they’ll always find an excuse for not letting me fly (I’ve been a free spirit and very independent my whole life, that’s in my nature)
I don’t want to be unhappy in a place I don’t want to be, I’m a good student and I want this opportunity.

The college my parents want for me is  expensive so even with the rent and leaving expenses of Spain or Germany the price comparative would be kinda the same or even less than If I decide to stay here. Sorry if I made some grammar mistakes (english is not my native language) So AITA here? tell me your opinions"		1	0
bzmlac	2019-06-12 04:18:33	throwawayy8124953	AITA for getting mad at my sisters friend at her birthday party?	It was my sisters 19th birthday recently, and a group of us went to a club to celebrate. Nearing the end of the night, a few of us went to relax at a table near the bar (not necessarily a quiet area, but loud enough where you can hear the conversations of others around) My sisters friend was casually singing along to the music, which happened to include the N word. We are from a very culturally diverse city and there were many POC around. I politely let her know that she shouldn’t be using that word even if it’s just in a song, as it might hurt somebodies feelings if they overhear her. She thought I was joking so she laughed and then started borderline yelling the n-word with the hard r. My jaw hit the floor and I immediately became very serious and told her that it’s completely inappropriate to say that, especially in public. I even went as far as to tell her that she could get beat up if the wrong drunk dude were to overhear her. She seemed to take it pretty well, but I’m finding out now that she’s been complaining about it to mutual friends since it happened; calling me crazy, etc. The majority of my friends agreed with my actions, but a couple think I should have just let it slide.

bzmjbf	2019-06-12 04:12:32		AITA for asking my mom for a room.	This a throwaway. So the problem is my family which is 4 people which includes me. And my brothers girlfriend lives with us as well. The problem is we all live in a 2 bedroom apartment for now. And when I say for now I mean for the last 2 years. My mom said shes gonna get a house but its not working out I guess. Anyways the problem is as you can probably tell its too small. My older brother and his girlfriend share one room. And my mom and my little brother share another room. And for me I sleep in the living room. Everyday. I share no room and I have all my things like clothes and other stuff in the living room. The problem is I have no priviacy. And where the AITA part is when I asked my mom about it or when if we were gonna move soon she tells gets mad and starts yelling at me for no reason. I try to asked for a different bed for the last year because my bigger bed got ruined by my dog. So for now I sleep on a small twin bed. And I really dont know if I meant in a wrong way or if she got mad me about something else. I'm 14 by the way.	Not the A-hole	1	0
bzmj34	2019-06-12 04:11:56		AITA for blocking ex and old best friend	"F19 m20
They = ex
My ex showed up at a place they knew I would be after a few months no contact, and leaving a letter in my vehicle.

I've been reflecting on the incident since, and its left me pretty messed up emotionally. 

Basically, they went through all that trouble to contact me only to tell me that they loved me (conversation prompted by them, not me) but they didnt want a relationship. 

They then said they met someone a lot like me that they want to get with, which is exactly what was said about the person they left me for. They said this new person reminded them a lot of me, which was hard to hear because like...why? 

They also proceeded all this with another statement shortly later in conversation that they intended to get me back and that they felt stupid for not being able to get me back. 

They said I hurt them for cutting them out, but they understood why I did it. 

They cried and hugged me goodbye at the end of it, and it was a bit heartbreaking. I asked them just to block me because I had blocked them and that way it could be even, but they wouldnt do it. They said it would break their heart. 

Now I feel really frustrated on a daily basis and a bit guilty for cutting them out, despite the fact that they didnt cut me out. 

I dont understand why they would have done that if I specifically stated do not talk to me. 

They asked me questions about my personal life and sex life and if I had moved on from them. 

It was a bit tense for me, because I had no real idea of what to do. In the moment, it felt like no time had passed and we could talk much like we always do. 

Theres a weird sentiment in me about everything because I know this person just wanted to use me, but the ebb and flow of our conversation, despite it being confusing still brought me joy. 

In any case, I just feel really messed up right now. I cant tell if me ignoring the apologies is a jerk move or not or if they just have me confused. 

Tldr: ex did a bad and confused me"		1	0
bzmif7	2019-06-12 04:09:54	greatwalloftaylor	AITA for wanting my former best friend to move out before our lease is up?	"It’s been 3 years. The first year went by with no major issues. Shortly after we renewed our lease, he got his first serious relationship in a while. She was constantly drunk, he was constantly drunk with her. She didn’t get along with her roommates so they spent a lot of time at our apartment. A LOT or time. There was probably a two month period where she was there every day. I’d come home from a 12 hour day at work (which I do 6 days a week, 5 months a year) and they’d be watching a movie in the living room. Ok, I had a TV in my room I could go watch and play games. Later, they’d start fucking, loudly. I played the cool roommate for about three weeks or so. But it was EVERY DAY and they’d come back drunk, slamming doors and waking me up. I finally told him I was happy for him but that she was there too much. On top of that, it was affecting my sleep. He didn’t apologize but did ask me what I wanted him to do about it. I suggested she not be over EVERY day. They moved to her place some of the time but she didn’t get along with her roommates and then she got kicked out and had to move back in with her parents. So the fucking returned to our apartment, nightly. I talked to him about it again after another week or so and he explained she’d moved. He kept saying “you’re my best friend,” as if that explained the situation. One night they came back drunk, screaming, and she said that she didn’t give a fuck about me. I’d had enough and decided that I was going to leave whenever she was there. Every time I came home and she was there, I would sleep elsewhere. Couple weeks later, he told me that me doing this was affecting their relationship. I told him I’d heard her the other night, that I was going to continue to leave when she was there because I couldn’t sleep there.

Eventually she stopped being there all the time, and things went back to normal. He clearly blamed me for his ruined relationship and he started spending less time at the apartment and went out to bars a lot. Enough time passed that when it was time to renew the lease we got another apartment together. I’ll admit that I gave it A LOT of thought when agreeing to continue to live with him at that point. I could likely afford to live alone but we found a place only 3 minutes from my office.

Thankfully we’ve been fine with partners due to work schedules, my travel schedule, etc. But he’s still so inconsiderate. Still slams the front door when getting home drunk, when I need to be up at 5:30am. Earlier this week he found out I had to be at work at 6am and he moved him alarm ahead to try and beat me to the bathroom (of which we only have one now). He sets his alarm at 6am on the days I don’t have to be up at 5:30am and snoozes it until 7, it wakes me up and even though I’ve told him this his response was “I didn’t think it woke you up.” 

There’s more but I’m probably rambling at this point so I’ll just ask, AITA for wanting him to move out before our lease is up?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzmhje	2019-06-12 04:06:58	mirarom	WIBTA if I (26F) fully cut contact with my sister (28F)?	"My sister and I have always had a tumultuous relationship at best. She has been a rebel since we were little, sneaking out in her teens, stealing our parents’ car, constantly fighting with our mother, etc. We’ve had a lot of falling outs over the years, but we generally always work it out. 

For a bit more backstory - when I was 18, we lived together for a few months. She is a partier, and she started bringing total strangers that she met at bars back to the house at insane hours (and always on weeknights when I had class the next morning). Several nights, random people would walk into my room (my door didn’t have a lock) and I didn’t feel safe. I called our mother to tell her about this and ask what I should do. My sister found out and she kicked me out because I “snitched to mom.” When I was 19, she gave my information to her lawyer to give to his friend (who ended up stalking me for 3 years) because she “thought it was funny.” Similar events like these have happened over the years, and I’ve been slowly talking to her less and less. 

These days, the only time she ever talks to me is when she needs a favor or money. I mostly don’t answer her phone calls because I know that it’s only because she can’t find someone else to help her, but we text on occasion just to say hi and check in. 

Today, however, I found out that she has been reaching out regularly to my emotionally abusive ex-boyfriend. She was one of the people I went to constantly when he would start mind-fucking me, and she more than almost anyone else knows how much I wish he didn’t exist at all and how much he hurt me. Her explanation was, “I needed help with my car and he’s good with that.” I don’t feel like that is an acceptable response (what if I had gone to her ex-fiancé to ask for computer help), and it feels somehow even more disrespectful than most of the stunts she has pulled before. 

My mother no longer talks to my sister because of a falling out almost a year ago. She doesn’t have very many friends, is always dating complete assholes, and generally doesn’t have that many people to rely on, so I know she calls me because she can rely on me. I’m feeling entirely done when it comes to dealing with her, however, so WIBTA if I just finally cut her out of my life?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzmgse	2019-06-12 04:04:34	Burner-Ahole	AITA for being upset that my wife is taking my kids to Disneyland without me?	"My wife is taking our two kids and her daughter from a previous relationship tomorrow and I'll be stuck at work.

My job and commute basically leaves me seeing my kids about three hours a day, one of the shitty parts of being a sole provider for your family.

My youngest has been working on sleeping in her own bed and we said we'd reward her with a trip to Disneyland. My older one is a great student and super sharp, so he deserves a trip as well. My step daughter has an annual pass so she goes regularly. My wife has been absolutely fixated on going to Disneyland and has been talking about it nonstop for about two months now.

So there is no way I can get out of work as I have a very big deadline approaching, call it an annual review that, and I haven't felt super secure at this job since shortly after starting. I'd leave but the opportunities for this level on income are few, especially within commuting distance.

This will be my youngest's first time going, and my oldest's second time. I've been coming around on the logistics if going but was thinking it would be something we'd do mid to late July. Since Disneyland is no small expense, I now can't imagine I'll be able to afford to go after their trip tomorrow. Being the guy I am, I would probably go into debt and spend the next year paying it off to go in July.

At this point, it's too late for me to change what's gonna happen. I'm trying to figure out whether or not I should be feeling as left out and unappreciated as I do. Being a father and provider starts to feel like all sacrifice, and criticism for sacrificing.

Hopefully this post isn't too all over the road, trying to type it out while also performing my parental duties.

TLDR: Wife is taking my kids to Disneyland, one for the first time, without me and I feel shitty and left out."	Not enough info	0	0
bzmgn0	2019-06-12 04:04:10	slammer35	AITA for teling my friend to not play a game?	"So for context, me and my friends have a group chat.  She (my friend) was talking about some shoes, and was very much obsessed with them and their ""white boy-ness"". I was worried about that, because I can link the whole white boy-ness thing to Fortnite (I can, okay? No questions asked). 

&#x200B;

Anyways, I texted that she should be careful about these things (obviously I was thinking about Fortnite) and that I don't want her to fall into the normie pit. Maybe I over exaggerated this, giving her a whole paragraph and all.

&#x200B;

I guess she actually plays Fortnite, which surprised me since we always joke about Fortnite being bad. She took it really personal, and told me 

> ""what do you do if your friend tells you to stop playing a videogame?"" is what i had to google. 

&#x200B;

I didn't expect her to actually play the game, so I backed off a little. She makes things very dramatized, so she probably wasn't that hurt, but still.

So, I got the ball from him, looked him in the eyes, fake threw it and hid it behind my back. The look on his face was so funny but he didn’t seem to think so. I then pulled the ball out and we continued playing. I think that he’s already forgotten about it.

bzmfhm	2019-06-12 04:00:46		AITA for talking about my friend behind her back	"I'm 19 and I've been friends with this girl my entire life. Two years ago, she started dating my cousin. He didn't treat her well. He cheated on her and lied to her a bunch. I've never liked him even though he's my cousin. But she always went back to him.
My friend has my password to my Instagram and she's been logged into it for a while. I've never felt comfortable with it, especially since she would notify me when someone messages me or reference conversations I had with others in my DM'S, but I never did anything because I find it hard to tell her these things. I just left it alone and told her jokingly to stop reading my conversations.
I made friends with this guy who knows both me and her. He's very cool and he's very trustworthy from what I know. We had a long conversation that somehow came to her and I called my cousin a pos and my guy friend was basically like why would you say that and I mentioned how he's cheated on her and he's just not a good guy. Conversation topic changed quickly.
A few minutes ago, I receive a long paragraph text from my friend going off on me about the messages, saying she ""kept getting notifications from mine and his messages on Instagram since she's logged in so she clicked on it and scrolled up and read them"". 
I'm just really annoyed right now because it's not her business to read my freaking messages. Sure, maybe I didn't have to say the things that I did, but I didn't think much about it because he's a trustworthy friend and I was telling him how I care about who she's with because she's my friend.

"I  (24m) was just on the phone with my S0 (22f) and we were having a pretty normal conversation, she was going to come over after I was off of work, however she had fallen asleep so I called her to see if she was still coming. We ended up chatting about our respective days and such for about 10 minutes, when she burps into the phone. This wasn’t like a little burp, think more along the lines of buddy the elf. She does it right into her mic and honestly I never really minded  (this is a super frequent occurrence) and have just laughed about it when she did it in the past. I don’t know if it was because I was tired from work (construction, it was a fucking long one) but it just grossed me out and  I kind of snapped and said “can you not do that RIGHT into the mic? I don’t want to hear it you ALWAYS do that”. It was silent for a sec after that and I realized i had snapped so I said “hey look I’m sorry, I’m kind of crabby from work and I don’t mean to snap but it just grosses me out hearing it right in my ear whenever we talk on the phone” and she sarcastically said “yeah it’s fine, im going to go you can text me if you want” then hung up. Other than the burp the whole conversation was very pleasant and I did want to keep talking to her hence why I apologized, but it didn’t seem to mean anything so, AITA?

bzmfcj	2019-06-12 04:00:24	emilblowski	AITA for wanting to enjoy alcohol?	"Title doesn't quite sum it up. Having just turned legal age, I've been enjoying the new privilege of drinking. The past few days, I've drank a moderate amount of alcohol each night, roughly 4 beers per night. Enough for me to feel relaxed, but not drunk. The reason for the daily drinking aside from being recently of age is that i have a week off of work. I happen to be a happy drunk, and have never once felt a desire to hurt someone or act irresponsibly while under the influence, as I found out in my college days. 

I live with my mother, who has personally chosen not to drink at all, which I completely respect, which I have expressed before. The past few days she hasn't said anything, but today she snapped and almost banned alcohol from the house, while forbidding me from having more than 2 drinks per night. This is after expressing to her that I haven't driven or come close to driving drunk, haven't given anyone so much as a dirty look while under the influence, and have demonstrated that I can control myself while using alcohol. This is also after she compared me to alcoholics, saying that they use alcohol to relax much like I do, and that my drinking reminds her of how her grandmother had a drinking problem. 

I don't believe myself to be an alcoholic, and to prove it to her, I said I would go the next four days without drinking any. She still didn't take this as a sign that I'm responsible.

I eventually backed down, allowed her to win the argument (like I always do) and agreed to not drinking more than 2 per night, as ridiculous as I think it is.
