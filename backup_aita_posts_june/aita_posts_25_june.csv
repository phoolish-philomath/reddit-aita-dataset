c5krl1	2019-06-26 03:57:19		AITA: Friend keeps asking my copmany to do new designs.	"My friend, who I'll call Rob for easy reference, keeps asking me to create new designs for my various products and merchandise. I know on some level Rob is super excited to see where the company goes and what new designs we put out, but on the other hand, I feel like I am being bombarded by all these expectations.

&#x200B;

It started quite a while ago, more than six months, when Rob told me how much he loved the new design. It was our second ever design, and it really was a huge step up from our first.

&#x200B;

After that, we designed seventeen more products in rapid succession. Each time he asked when the new design would come, and I let him know it would be soon. At the end of the seventeen though we stopped designing for a while and I let him know it would be a while, until we started making sales and being profitable.

&#x200B;

When I put out a new design, I have to choose between taking care of my business, or taking care of my personal needs. I have paid rent late, not eaten for days on end, picked up extra contract work, anything to get some of these ideas off the ground.

&#x200B;

For a while, he just dropped it and did not ask me anything, but then one day he started coming to me with artist willing to work for exposure, and exclaiming he would design them himself, just so long as we put out something new. A lot of the work was unoriginal and not properly themed to fit my company, which is music-themed. I suspect I would take an overall loss on these designs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We've had this same conversation about twice a week every week for what feels like months. Each time he presents me with a new solution that he thinks is holding me back from getting new designs. 

&#x200B;

Every time he reminds me it would be good for business it feels like an absolute stab in the gut. Like he's implying that I don't know what I'm doing.

&#x200B;

Just recently, I asked him to stop. I told him it was very frustrating and that he did not fully understand where my business was at or why I am making the decision to not pursue new art so aggressively. That he would not be able to understand my business unless he was 100% involved in everything from customer experience, to product sourcing, all the way to profit margins.

&#x200B;

I gave him a slightly more in-depth explanation as to why I felt that way, including disclosing my production costs, my average art costs, legal fees, and the math behind how many sales new designs actually bring in. He did not speak at all while I explained this to him.

&#x200B;

After I was done explaining he essentially told me to cool off, it was just a suggestion, and it was a suggestion that would be good for business. 

&#x200B;

About Rob:

1. He does not work for us.
2. He does not buy new designs as they come out. He just likes to look.
3. I am not soliciting his advice. At least not intentionally.
4. He does not share our business with his friends, family, or social media."	No A-holes here	1	0
c5krav	2019-06-26 03:56:32	awolflikeme	AITA for smoking at a bar?	"Drinking with my friends at a local pub, pretty dead. Head outside for a smoke on the small patio which has 2 picnic tables in a fenced area and a large ashtray. We are pretty immediately told by one of the groups that ""we are killing them"" and our smoke is awful and we should go somewhere else. 

We try to relocate a bit within the confined space, but it's apparently not enough. Both tables double down on how we are being terribly rude to them and I tell them I frankly don't care. If I were to go ask the bartender where I should go smoke with my beer, she would tell me to be standing where I'm standing, so they can deal with it YTA. 

It escalated a bit, and both tables were shouting ""fuck you"" and to leave etc. To which I said I hear what you're saying, I simply don't give a shit. I stood my ground, finished my smoke, and went inside after what turned into a very unexpected scene. Was I being a dick or just reacting as a dick to people that were being dicks?"

c5kpb7	2019-06-26 03:51:32		WIBTA for “ghosting” a friend?	"I (22F) have a close friend (21M) who has exhibited some seriously toxic behavior in the past. Tonight, after some serious introspection, I’ve realized how manipulative he’s been, and how much he’s convinced everyone around him (including himself) that he can do no wrong and /or everyone is just out to get him. In the past when I’ve tried to end the friendship because I felt uncomfortable / sensed he was manipulative and disingenuous,  he talked it out with me and convinced me he never meant to behave in a toxic way, so I dropped it and we stayed friends. I’m wondering if this was a stupid move on my part. 

For context, this is what I think is toxic about him: he’s only interested in himself, he never wants to listen— only talk, he has a major victim complex, he thinks he’s incredibly intelligent and his friends just can’t keep up, etc.  he’s constantly complaining that his friends don’t do enough for him, when he genuinely makes no effort to do anything for us, even something as simple as hanging out or just giving advice.

I know ghosting is generally agreed upon to be terrible, but I fear reopening this dialogue with him only for him to convince me he’s a great guy and I’m just evil for not being more understanding (which is how it’s gone in the past). WIBTA for just ghosting and being done with it?"		1	0
c5kpb6	2019-06-26 03:51:32	whyihavenofriend	AITA For Not Going Camping?	"This is long and boring but I'll try to keep it brief. 

My best friend's family has a second property by a lake, every summer she invites our group of friends up for a weekend and it's an overall a fun and relaxing experience. This will be the 3rd year she's hosting. 

This property is about a 5 hour drive away from where we live and we are expected to bring our own food/booze & camping gear since there aren't really enough beds, we sleep indoors but on air mattress/sleeping bags.

Here's where my problem arises, the last two years the group has been about 8 people total. This year the host has a new boyfriend, who along with his group of about 7 other friends are all also invited. Doubling the amount of attendees. This new boyfriend is well liked among the rest of us, but his friends are less so. 

My partner and I are both invited, but my partner is saying they aren't really interested in going because they don't want to hang out with all of the host's boyfriend's friends. They'd rather spend time with our mutual friends, since half the guests are people we don't know. 

 On top of that we went to a Halloween Party hosted by the same friend where her boyfriend's friends were all invited. They all arrived earlier than the time on the invite and by the time we arrived (7:30PM) the majority of them we're already drunk/already doing other things. My partner and I sat down and tried to socialize but no one really seemed to interested in chatting with us.

Eventually we went to the other room and started up SSB. A few of the boyfriend's friends' came over to join us but we ended up getting kicked off our own game and going back to the other room while my partner continued to feel ignored and one other person talked  with me a little bit. We left early. Later the hostess was pretty upset with us because she said we weren't trying very hard to be sociable. Particularly my partner.

It's completely in my friend's rights to invite whoever she wants to her vacation house and I'm not arguing that, but my partner and I were thinking of skipping this year because quite a few of her boyfriend's friends are going to be there this year and it's just a really long drive to spend 3 to 4 days with people who don't really seem like they want to be friends. 

On the other hand, she says that my partner especially is being a big baby and should suck it up. We only met these people on one night and they were already drinking because *we* were late, so it should be on us to give them another chance. 

AITA if I don't want to spend the weekend camping with my best friend's friends? 

TL;DR: Best Friend has friends that aren't my partner's friends. Partner is being called a petty bitch for not wanting to make new friends."	No A-holes here	0	0

c5kn3a	2019-06-26 03:46:07	convenient-t-away	AITA for not wanting to propose more than once?	"So my girlfriend (31F) and I (34M) recently got engaged. We've been dating for about three years and with me moving to the midwest from the west coast for employment, a decision had to be made on whether or not we should take things a step forward. After talking about marriage she said would be open to a longer engagement period before tying the knot to be sure the new life in a different place didn't change things for the worse. Between her saying this and moving we decided to take a vacation abroad to take advantage of the free time I had between jobs.

&#x200B;

After travelling for a week she told me she was surprised I hadn't already asked her on the trip. I think with all of the challenges of travelling in a different country she had really warmed up to how well we worked together when times got tough. I told her I was going to wait until we were moved and were settled in before asking, but she told me she would be ready much sooner than that, as in any time I thought was good was good enough for her. I was ecstatic that she had changed her mind to move things up and started thinking about what I could plan in the next few weeks that would be special.

&#x200B;

Her job needed her to come back to work sooner than I needed to come back so she flew back while I stayed abroad to have my Dad come out for a week to do some father-son travelling. I knew that when I got back, I would only have a couple days with her since I had a specific date to start my job while she would be staying behind for 6 weeks to train her replacement. In the end of things, I only had 2 days to make it happen. I purchased a ring and made a plan to propose in a place that was beautiful and had at lease some personal significance behind it. On the night before I left to travel across the country I got down on one knee and proposed and she said yes!

&#x200B;

Shortly after she started talking about me proposing again. I had never heard of anyone doing this so I asked why she wanted to do it and she replied, ""because it would be sweet."" I told her that proposals were kind of a one time thing and it's not really a special moment if we set it all up and do it again. She said that she didn't remember what I said, which I said hurt a little bit, and would like to do it again so she can remember it better and it would still be special. She also suggested I do the second one in front of her family (who is extremely important to her) although they already know we're engaged. I told her the whole thing makes me feel awkward and I definitely don't want to propose again. I told her to ask anyone in her family if they think it's a good idea. She says it's not a big deal and I should do it to be sweet.

c5kn0p	2019-06-26 03:45:56	lionheart724	AITA for not introducing a potential network connection to my GF’s unemployed brother?	"Let me give you some context about my BIL. He’s a great guy and hard working when he gets a job, but he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has never had to work and being 31 he still doesn’t work. I, at times, felt resentful that my parents were poor and while I was not forced to work, I had to work to buy stuff for myself because my parents couldn’t afford it. 

He’s had three jobs up until now and all three he’s gotten through a family member pushing his application through. One being me, his cousin, and his mom.  Keep in mind his mother got him a job literally pushing buttons paying $32/hr but wanted to quit because he was bored and losing his mind because he had no one to talked to. At the time he only had a HS diploma. Bitched everyday about that job. He made more than me with a bachelor’s degree! Anyway, he quit because we moved as a family so he couldn’t make the commute. 

He finally finishes his degree in Computer Science. Never did any internships. Just wanted to finish because he felt he was behind in life. Great, he’s done. He can’t find a job. It’s been 14 months since he graduated and has not even gotten a single interview. I’ve sent him websites with potential job titles and he won’t take them because they pay $16/hr and they don’t even require a degree. I kept telling him it’s for experience. Stay a year or two, get back into the workforce, get experience. He said no.

I few weeks ago my gf and I went out to dinner with a co worker of mine and her husband. He mentioned he’s in IT and cyber security. Similar degree that my GF’s brother has. My wife mentioned maybe I can talk to him about her brother, maybe he can get him a job with his company. 

And I said fuck no. I’m tired of networking for him. He doesn’t want to do shit. Meanwhile his parents pay his loans and his medical insurance.  All the advice I’ve been giving him. He hasn’t worked in 6 years. He applied to two jobs since relocating. He doesn’t want to work retail, or in a warehouse or office because it’s degrading and beneath him. He would say shit like “I didn’t go to college for this.” But he also didn’t go to college to be broke. 

So my GF’s thinks I’m being an asshole about the whole thing and I should just mention her brother to my co workers wife. Keep in mind I met the man for the first time at dinner. I don’t even know him. So Reddit, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

So I'm in a spat right now with my girlfriend over something which I'm not sure how to approach. Recently my friend (M), my girlfriend, and I were all talking in a group chat. I made a comment to my male friend saying to 'ride me instead', after talking about bikes. I'm not bi-sexual, I only have a physical attraction to women, and my girlfriend has my whole attention, however, him and I have always made dumb jokes like such for years. My girlfriend then asked, ""why can't I ask \[friend\] to ride me?"". I later messaged her asking if she was serious about that question, to which she told me that it's not fair because I did. 

I understand the logic that since I did it, she should be able to as well. However, I told her it makes me uncomfortable if she told her male friends to do sexual things even as a joke, but to females I wouldn't feel uncomfortable as all- as I don't say to other women similar jokes just out of respect for my girlfriend.

She then said that I'm sexist because I'm making a boundary on the premise of the 'difference between our legs'. 

I just wanted to ask her if she could stick to that boundary, as some people could take it the wrong way. Am I the asshole for asking? 

There were some things that had occurred in her transition from her previous relationship to ours that left me a little uncomfortable, and questioning."		1	0

This won't be very long.

&#x200B;

Short backstory for info:

My brother and I have not often got along, and that's fine, many brothers don't. He would always be somewhat bearable to be around.

Now, my brother has gotten into a relationship somewhat recently, with a girl (14F) who seems okay. After about a few weeks, the time we spent not being rude, and d\*ckheads to each other was no more, and now he has only shown negativity and hostility towards not only me, but my family, and everyone else.

&#x200B;

On to more recent and relevant events:

My brother and his girlfriend do absolutely nothing all day (Save for school). He's with her or she's with him at our house almost every day. Every day he insults me, ignores me, and sometimes gets needlessly physical. It wasn't much of a problem when he was single because we would both laugh and point fingers at each other as rivaling brothers do, this was different. I actually tried to be kind, or at least respectful regardless of what he did to me.

 Now, most recently my brother got into an argument with his girlfriend, and she was very toxic about it. My parents had sat my brother down and asked him if he was okay after this argument. My brother told them what she had said, and it was pretty nasty. She had actually managed to get him to do a thing to himself I'm not allowed to talk about here, for sub reasons, and moral reasons.

I'm fed up with how he's acting, and so are my parents, but I don't think they want him to break up with his girlfriend. I'd rather him happy, but with how this is looking, I don't think he will be happy in the end, and I'm doubtful of a better outcome.

c5k97t	2019-06-26 03:12:54	aploplex	AITA for not working as a group during a lab?	"Disclaimer: This literally just happened and I’m still trying to sort out why this went down like it did. Sorry if details are messy. Edits will come if necessary.

I’m known as a relatively smart person and know my stuff pretty well at school. This summer, I’m taking Chemistry for original credit because I need it on my transcript. Chemistry, at the basic level that it is taught at in schools, is extremely self-explanatory and brainless, and I already know what the teacher is teaching. Keep in mind that most of the other students are remedial chemistry students, because it is summer school. I have not missed a single question on any of the seven tests, and have not studied one minute outside of the classroom. That’s how basic it is. The teacher allows us one flash card during tests, and I just draw memes on it.

Anyways, our lab day was today, and we had three labs, all stupid “observation” labs where you just observe things happening. Oh my god, I didn’t know that salt was a white solid. Oh wait, it’s actually SoDiUm ChLoRiDe. My lab partners are not as bright as me. During the first two labs, I played on my phone while my partners wrote down the observations. I then copied their data, answered all the questions, and my three lab partners copied my answers. Note that the questions cover three pages while the data covers a half of a page. 

During the third lab, my partners started to argue with me about not doing the data. Ok, I get it, but I’m giving you the answers to the questions (which btw they don’t know how to do without my guidance and the teacher sucks at explaining). They don’t listen. So this time, I don’t copy their lab data and make it up, because I know that C12H22O11 is sucrose, or table sugar, which I have previously observed that it is made up of white granular solid crystals.

I finish the questions and turn it in. Apparently I wasn’t listening and completed a part of the lab that the teacher told us not to do because we didn’t know the concept yet. I finish 20 minutes before anyone else and play Clash Royale because why not. 

What do my partners do? They beg me for answers. No, bitch, no answers for you. So then they snitch on me to the teacher’s aide, and is he like, not supposed to tell the teacher?

They obviously didn’t want to work with me, and in that situation I’m perfectly fine and capable of doing all the work myself. When the teacher called me, I went over and she told me she was giving me half credit for not working with the group. I was shocked. I’m not one of those “get 103% or I starve” Asian stereotypes, and I never snitch on anybody because I never want to get people in trouble for no reason. I guess my question is, am I at fault here for not participating in an “observation” lab and doing the main part of the lab, the post-lab questions, instead? I don’t know. So it’s up to you.

AITA?

EDIT: This post sounds quite arrogant. I get that. There’s quite a lot I left out due to the 3000-character-limit. I realize now that with how this post sounds, YTA is the obvious answer (although one of my friends has already seen this post and shared it with me [doesnt know it’s me] and said NTA).

c5k92e	2019-06-26 03:12:33	sparklegodhelpme	AITA for Wanting to Abandon My Mom?	"Two months ago my older sister told everyone but me (23F) and my mom (who she lives with currently) that she was pregnant again and moving back in with her ex boyfriend and it got back to us via a drunk friend of hers at my nephew's birthday party. Without her there is no way me and my mom can afford the house we're currently renting and we were unable to find someone willing to move in with us before we had to let the landlord know if we would be renewing our lease and we've been looking at places since.

&#x200B;

My mom is disabled and can't afford anything by herself and I recently graduated from college. I work 3 jobs but I don't think I earn enough to rent a place by myself because everything wants you to earn 3x the amount of the rent, and rent prices here are so high it's impossible to meet that criteria.

&#x200B;

At first every property I showed my mom she found something she didn't like and said she wanted to wait for something better to come up. Then she kept lowering the price of what we could afford, while getting increasingly picky. She will not consider an apartment, she needs a yard, nothing in a ""bad"" neighbourhood, she wont pay a pet rent, no shared laundry etc. We're already limited in what we can rent with our income and the fact that we have pets and she's making it so much harder.

&#x200B;

We're five days from the end of our lease and we still haven't found a house. I can't sleep at night because I'm so stressed out about this, I'm getting stomach aches and if it pops into my head at work it takes everything I have to keep myself from crying. Yesterday we went to see something and while we were waiting for the landlord to arrive she was already finding things she didn't like about it even though she hadn't even seen it yet. Today we went to see two, the first was an apartment and it didn't work because they had a two pet limit and a pet rent and my mom kind of snapped at the leasing agent. The second was a house, it was a little small but nice and we decided we were going to apply when we got home. We needed two separate applications with two separate application fees, which I told her I would pay. I submitted mine and paid for it and then she pulled up the listing and started finding things that didn't work. The one time pet fee was too much, the deposit was more than the rent, they wanted first and last months rent up front (although the landlord told us she could split that up into instalments) and decided she wasn't going to apply. I obviously can't afford it by myself and now I'm out 45$ for my application fee.

c5k4gj	2019-06-26 03:01:57	stromboligirl	AITA because I refused a new couple to join in on my trip with my long-distance friend?	"My college friend and i live about four hours apart so twice a year we meet up at a hotel in the middle to hang out and catch up. This includes our husbands and kids. We let the kids swim in the pool, we have dance parties, we order food to the room, then we let the kids pass out in one of the rooms and stay up and drink in the other. It’s a good time but it really is a cram session of face time since we live so far apart. 

The last time we met up she called me when i was in the car on my way to the hotel and asked if another family she knows but I’ve never met can join. I played it off cool but told her that i did not want to share my time with her and her family since we don’t get to see them often. Problem was she had already invited them assuming I’d be OK with it and she was miffed that i said no. We talked about it and she said she’d tell the other family not to come. 

We meet at the hotel but the vibe is weird. She’s acting cold and distant and has a chip on her shoulder. I finally get a moment alone and apologize for the situation and explain how I didn’t want to share my time - I don’t get a lot of time with her and I don’t want to spend it playing third wheel and getting to know another family. She flips and says I’m being ridiculous and we are all adults and it’s not a big deal to meet new people. She also said they were only invited to swim at the hotel, not stay over (that was not clear to me when she asked). I instantly shut down because I’m so hurt that she was not on my side at all. She was genuinely mad. The family she wanted to invite were friends of her husband. I don’t know their history (i was too uncomfortable to ask at this point) but I strongly believe it doesn’t really matter who they were - this was our time together and the way she asked put me in an unfair position.

c5k40l	2019-06-26 03:00:57	StupidShouldHurt55	"AITA for ""Sitting"" at Boston Logan Airport?"	"So, this happened one year ago, and nothing has made me question myself more than this one incident. I had a 6:30am flight from Boston to Dallas, TX. I get to Boston Logan at 4:30am. I have my boarding pass, all is good. However, the TSA checkpoint doesn't open until 5:00am, so I can't get to my gate.

I'm flying Southwest, and there is a TSA checkpoint been the Delta and Southwest check-in desks. None of the Delta desks are open and not an employee is in sight. On either side of the TSA check-in there are about a dozen chairs, each with a wheelchair printed on them. There's a sign saying, “please leave these seats for disabled travelers.” But there’s hardly a person in sight. Since there's about 20 empty seats, I sit down and wait for TSA to open. 

After 5 minutes a Delta employee approaches me and asks, ""Sir, can I get you a wheelchair?"" I looked at him, befuddled, and say, ""no?"" Then he says, ""this seating is for disabled customers only, you need to sit elsewhere,"" and walks away. I looked around and there was no other seating, and still no one around, so I didn't bother to get up. After about 10 more minutes, TSA was getting close to opening. There were a 3 people in line for the checkpoint to open. There were still no other people sitting in the 19 other disabled seats. A lady with a Delta uniform approached me and said, ""Sir, these seats are for disabled customers only."" I then replied, ""there are 20 seats, and I'm occupying one. And I don't see any disabled customers. The airport is empty. Who am I taking a seat from?"" The Delta lady then says, ""Sir, these seats are for disabled customers only."" I replied,""You just told me that. Who am I taking a seat from? Do you want me to stand next to this seat? What purpose would that serve?"" The Delta lady then says, ""Sir, do I have to call security?"" 

So, I literally just stand up, with my legs against the seat, and she walks away. After about 5 minutes I get in line for TSA, as it's just minutes from opening (approx 4:55am). The lady in front of me mutters something about wishing there were seats in line. I replied, ""well, there's seats right there (motioning to the seats about 5ft away), just don't try to sit in them."" The lady turns around, looks at me for a second, and says with complete seriousness, ""What kind of a-hole would sit in the disabled seating?"" 

Needless to say, I was speechless. I disregarded the Delta employees, but this is supposedly an impartial rando. So that begs the question, Am I the A-hole? Was this lady right? If even half of the seats had been occupied I wouldn't have taken one. But this zero tolerance crap was just hilariously ridiculous."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Context: For the past four years my husband and I have hosted Thanksgiving at our place. Our apartment complex has a nice lounge we can rent out. So we usually handle set-up, the turkey and a side dish or two. Our extended family is pretty big so usually each unit commits to making a few dishes. (Included are my adult siblings, my mother, her husband and my in-laws)

Well this fall my husband and I are moving into our first house! When I told my mother the first thing she said was, ""Great! Now that you have a house and a full kitchen you can cook Thanksgiving for everyone. I have been dreaming about showing up one day and not having to cook anything!""

An argument quickly ensued. I didn't understand why the current arrangement had the change. I still think it makes sense for us to host Thanksgiving and make the Turkey. But I have no desire to cook the ENTIRE Thanksgiving meal by myself. I forgot to mention we have a toddler running around. I am more then willing to divide and conquer the meals but I am not going to cope to a tradition she made up on the fly! 

She is a wonderful mom and has been a provider for our family. I appreciate her and I do my best to show and tell her that. But she is not just passing the torch she is throwing it me.  And occusing me of being selfish.

c5jw0b	2019-06-26 02:42:22		AITA For Being Hurt When My Wife Forgot My Birthday	"There's no way to give context in the title, is there? This problem is over and done with, my wife and I talked it out the next morning. But 2 work friends have said I was a jerk about it, and that thought has lingered. So this is a WasITheAsshole post.

**Background:** I don't like my birthday, and as long as I can remember I never have. Part of it is that I don't like being the center of attention, but the larger issue is that some of the worst days of my life have been on my birthday, and I just got over pretending it was supposed to be a special day. Some of those days, and this becomes relevant, were because people I cared about either forgot my birthday, or promised me a *fantastic birthday to help me get over my birthday issues* only to put in a no real effort. To be clear, I'm not bitter about birthdays, and I happily acknowledge and celebrate others' birthdays.

My wife has pushed back at this, mildly over the years, and we have come to an arrangement. She says she would not be comfortable ignoring my birthday, but that anything we do for it could stay between us. I'd be happy if my mother and my wife each wished me a happy birthday...maybe a card, but it's not necessary. To me that's saying, \*see, I remembered--\*the compromise we've worked out is that I will she will acknowledge my birthday and get me a card and mid-level gift. I'll do the same for her's, which is 4 days before mine, and often we do a group dinner with friends because several of our group have birthdays in a short period.

This year my wife did not wish me a happy birthday, or even acknowledge that she knew what day it was. The next day I told her that it hurt my feelings; that I have an extremely low-bar for what I expect and that it kind of stung--and brought up plenty of baggage from past relationships--that she forgot. She was very upset that she had forgotten, apologized, explained that because of a lot of stuff going on she never realized the date (I do believe her on this). We talked it out and after 10 or 20 minutes hugged it out and moved on.

**The Situation:** A couple of days later work did their monthly all-birthdays celebration, and my name was one of many on the cake. A couple of my work friends were surprised that they didn't know, and it started a conversation. I mentioned what had happened a few days earlier, and they went off on me for the way I treated my wife (in fairness I think one of them was mad and the other sort of goes along with the loudest person in the room). He said I was an asshole to tell my wife I don't like birthdays, and then get upset that she forgot my birthday."		1	0

c5jsiu	2019-06-26 02:34:43	KevinLovesCarrots	WIBTA if I told my mom to have a nice life?	"I’m going to try to keep this as short as possible but this does require a bit of backstory. Also, sorry, I’m on mobile. 

I’m 20 years old and for almost 10 years my mom has been pretty much nonexistent from my life. As long as I can remember she’s never held down a job and always relied on her boyfriends for whatever we needed. My sisters and I were removed from her care about 10 years ago, and instead of getting a job and getting her shit together, my mom relied on yet another man to help her get us back. He was a criminal, she got swept up in that, and she went to prison. In the middle of my freshman year at college, she got released, was living with one of her sisters, got a job, and was doing really well. She came to visit me during family weekend and it really gave me hope that I’d be getting my mom back. But not even a few months later she found a new man and moved out, not even completing her parole. She stopped checking in with her PO and was “on the run” for a while, and was practically homeless. She got picked up again a few months ago and had to spend the rest of her parole time in prison. I only found out about her getting picked up again when I hadn’t heard from her in a few days and her Facebook had been dead as well (she’s pretty active on there). So I looked her up on the inmate search my state has, and she was there, listed as “active”. I called the last prison she was at to confirm, and then told my sisters what I’d found out. She got out again about a week ago and I heard about it from my dad, who heard about it from a friend. I sent her a message on Facebook since she didn’t reach out to me at all, and she told me she had plans to move to another city in the next few days and then out of state, across the country next month if everything works out. When I asked her what for, she said “for a change” and that she’d tell me all about it when she saw me. Of course in the time since then she has made no effort to see me or even message me again, and now she’s out of the city, based on what I can tell from her posts. She keeps tagging me and my sisters in things on Facebook though. 

I am the kind of person who always tries to see the positive. I don’t “hate” anything and almost nothing makes me truly angry. But everything my mom has put me and my sisters through makes me so, so angry and honestly heartbroken. She has never grown up or had to take care of herself. She thinks her actions impact only her and not the people around her. She’s manipulative and whenever I’ve tried to share my feelings in the past, she’s turned it around saying I don’t love her and made herself to be the victim. I want to go completely no-contact because frankly, things were much easier for me when she was in prison and I just didn’t have to think about her. I know it’s going to be a lot harder to cut her out if I am constantly dodging her messages or seeing the things she’s tagging me in. 

So, WIBTA if I told her that I genuinely want her to have a nice rest of her life, but please leave me out of it?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5jpkv	2019-06-26 02:27:57	SecWoe	AITA because I don’t want my brothers girlfriend to stay in my house?	"Hi again. 

So, my brother is in the marines. He lives in a house with a young couple with foster kids. He has had many girlfriends and has been catfished before. He just got a new one who he’s known for a couple of months. She moved into the house with him because she has no where to go. The couple he lives with has just kicked her out of the house for many reasons. They have not been explained to me fully, but I know that the GF caused arguments and the couple didn’t agree with a non married couple sleeping in the same room. So immediately, my brother contacted my mom and asked if the GF could come live in our house starting Thursday. I am very suspicious. We live in Oregon, they in California. She’s starting college in Seattle in the fall and my brother said that being here in Portland would be good for her so she can find an apartment in Seattle. First of all, we only have 2 rooms in this house. Absolutely no room for a guest except for the small couch. My mom is very low on money. I pay her $800 a month to live here before I move into my college dorms in September. We have never met this GF. My mom is a very kind and trusting person as is my brother, but they don’t think things through. I talked to him and asked about how she will pay us rent and pay for her food etc. He said HE is paying for ALL of her stuff, even the rent that she will have in Seattle. She does not work. She is expecting my mom to drive her up to Seattle on weekends (5 hour drive each way) to look at places. She is a stranger to us. I think she is using my brother. I mean come on, the couple that kicked her out even bought her a Greyhound bus ticket to Portland to get her away from them! My brother didn’t even ask my dad if he could take her. My dad lives in the bay area and he has guest rooms and much more money. I don’t understand why she can’t stay at my dads. We have no room for her. 
I do not trust a stranger in my house especially when I’m at work. My moms life is extremely stressful with her 7am-12am job and I think this will only make her stress worse. My brother will not tell us how long she would be here, it could be MONTHS! He’s gonna be a whole state away and we would be left to deal with her by ourselves. 
This girl is taking advantage of my family and I don’t want her here even if her own family is “crazy” and won’t help her. I pay rent, so I think I have a say in this decision at least until I move out. My brother is calling me an asshole and my mom is super conflicted. Am I wrong here? Are my morals messed up again?

I was driving back home from work and was being very careful, driving under the speed limit, with my brights on (unless another car was approaching the opposite way). 

Just a couple houses down from mine was a group of kids sitting in a pothole by the curb, but definitely on the road. What made it worse was that they were wearing black hoodies. I just barely managed to see them in time to swerve and park into my driveway.

After parking I calmly went up to them and told them that it was very, very hard to see them in this bad weather, and I was worried another car wouldn't see them in time. The oldest kid was about twelve and gave me some lip so I just reiterated my piece and walked away.

The next day their mother knocks on our front door and I answer. She says how dare I tell her children what to do. She said she allowed her kids to play out there and doesn't need a teenager to do her job (I'm not even a teenager; I'm 22).

c5joj5	2019-06-26 02:25:32	adrizeeee	WIBTA if I asked my financially struggling friend to help me pay gas costs?	"So me (20F) and my close friend who we’ll call Sally (20F) are driving together for summer classes for about six weeks now, and we started yesterday.   The school is really far from my house, and while it’s closer to her home, it’s still really far.

Every morning I pick Sally up, take us to class, drive us to our other friend’s house, and then take her back home at the end of the day before heading home myself.  This is a LOT of driving.  I mean I’m driving 3 hours combined every day.  It gets tiring for me and totally drains the gas on my old, fuel-inefficient car.  I started off with a full tank yesterday morning, and I’m currently down to a quarter tank.

Now, the reason why I’m taking her in the first place is because she has no car.  Her mother is unemployed, and her dad abandoned her a few years ago.  Her and her mom live off her grandmother’s salary as a nurse, which obviously isn’t much, and she struggles a lot financially.  I don’t feel bad at all having to drive Sally places because she’s my friend and I want to help her where I can (I’m even driving her to a very far doctors appointment on Thursday morning), but the exhaustion of these past few days has really shocked me.

The amount of gas I’ve used has shocked me too!  I’m gonna have to go refill tomorrow morning.  Bottom line, WIBTA if I asked her to split the gas cost with me, knowing how much she is struggling to even afford paying for the classes?  I’m afraid she’ll be upset with me and tell me she can’t afford it.

I’m also afraid of being a selfish friend asking her to pay for the fuel.  But at the same time, since I’m driving us both, it is only fair.  But she’s doing badly in terms of money right now.  So ahhh!

c5jofa	2019-06-26 02:25:16		WIBTA if I asked my neighbor to turn down his music, even though he doesn't seem to play it that frequently?	"The man who lives in the house right behind mine has started playing live music every Wednesday night, from about 7pm to around 10pm. From the sounds of it, it seems that he's in a band and they use this time to practice their music. Even though we both live in detached houses with a yard separating us, the bass from his band can be heard from every room in my house. Using noise-cancelling headphones helps somewhat, but if I wanted to relax in my bedroom, where I spend most of my time, even those don't block out all of the music as it is the room closest to his house. The noise is like having a live band perform in your backyard every week for three hours, except the band doesn't even play full songs, just the same few chords, or the same chorus, or half of a song, over and over again.

This particularly bothers me because I work irregular hours, including full days on the weekends, and Wednesday night is one of two nights where I can relax. I don't want to listen to a band play the same few chords over and over again for one of my free evenings every week. The issue is that I don't think he plays with his band that frequently - he doesn't play the other night I have off (Thursday evening), and I don't hear him any other time I'm home. Nor does he play after 10pm, like some of the people in other crazy neighbor stories I've read. Would it be too demanding of me to ask him to tone it down? 

(In case it's relevant, our city is weird because the bylaws only say that you can't make ""nuisance noise"" but doesn't have anything about when quiet hours are or anything like that.)"		1	0
c5jn41	2019-06-26 02:22:12		AITA for suddenly cancelling on someone in this situation?	"Hi everyone!

&#x200B;

So basically I had plans today to meet up with an acquaintance for coffee at 12PM. Let's call him X. I'm not particularly close with X, but we have had several classes together as college students and we were supposed to catch up. The coffee shop we were going to meet at is a 5 minute drive from our college campus, where I was taking a summer class. (I don't know if this is relevant, but it's an hour to my campus from my house and another hour back, so I had already driven a lot today.) I assumed X was at home with his car because when we were making plans, X asked for the shop's address and at what time were we meeting. He lives about 15 minutes away from campus. We chose this shop because of its specialty drink, which we both wanted to try.

&#x200B;

All is well until about 30 minutes before we were supposed to meet, during my class. X finally told me he needed a ride to the shop and a ride back. The address he gave me -- not his house's, mind you -- was about 25 minutes away, so about 75 minutes was needed for just driving (25 min to pick him up, 25 min to drive back to the shop, 25 min to drop him off). Usually I would be okay with driving a friend that far, but he told me too late. I had already made plans to meet up with my boyfriend after this at 1PM. Driving X would mean less time with my BF since he had work later and I only get to see my boyfriend once a week. 

&#x200B;

I will admit I chose my BF over X, which I usually don't do with friends, but I was also peeved X didn't tell me until about 11:30AM that he needed a ride. Thus, I cancelled on him saying: ""I'm sorry, but I had made plans to meet with my BF later because I didn't know you needed me to drive. We should still meet up, but let me know if you need a ride earlier next time!"" He responded saying I stood him up with a :( face. I haven't replied to his message yet, but I've begun to feel really bad.

&#x200B;

If this makes me an asshole, please tell me. I'll apologize and buy X coffee next time, if there even is one. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Acquaintance failed to mention he needed a ride to and from the coffee shop until 30 minutes before we were supposed to meet. Thus, driving him would take an additional 75 minutes, which I had not planned for. I had already made plans to meet with my boyfriend -- who I only see once a week -- after coffee because I was unaware of this. I then cancelled on X because 1) I was peeved he didn't tell me he needed a ride until right before and 2) because I hadn't seen my boyfriend in a while. Yes, I did choose my BF over X, so I feel like an asshole. Am I one?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

My dad has booked the tickets so I fly out with my granny who has quite bad Alzheimer’s. I’ve flown with her before but usually with another adult and she tends to get quite frustrated, to the point where she literally kicked my aunt for getting her assistance. My granny is fine with me but I’m worried that she could refuse to fly or make things difficult for me, these plane tickets are an awful lot of money and I would feel incredibly guilty if we missed the flight because couldnt get her to cooperate. I know my dad would be angry at me If something went wrong and we missed the flight. Basically I’m worried about being responsible for her.

My dad (who arranged this) has said that it would be good for me to do this, which made me more frustrated. He is flying out with my step mum and their two younger children a week before us and will meet us there.

I haven’t complained as of yet, but I’ve mentioned that I’m a bit worried about it. He seems to just dismiss it and say it will be fine. Internally I’m really quite frustrated and angry that my dad thinks this is a good idea. He’s aware of my mental health and that I’m not the most confident person who is good with leadership and being in control. He knows what my grandmother is like and I’m just worried that she will unintentionally make things difficult when we fly.

TL;DR I fly out alone with my grandmother who has Alzheimer’s and im worried that something will go wrong as her illness may make her difficult to deal with. My dad who arranged this said it would be good for me."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c5jkzo	2019-06-26 02:17:24	Mediocre_Bondage	AITA for refusing to work a position I am not trained for.	"Slight context I work for a well known non profit organization as a lifeguard during the summer, guarding for swim classes at local pools.

The past week we have had 2 swim instructors quit & swim lessons have started to stack, which means longer shifts and bigger classes.

For the two instructors I will label C and B, C is who I work with in the mornings & B works evenings.
Now yesterday we had a morning class scheduled, I show up & am waiting around for about 15min for C to show up, slowly parents start trickling in & now almost 25min later still no C.
At this point I had called my boss & got no answer, so I leave a voicemail & send a text saying that C is not here & parents are starting to get a annoyed.
45min after class was supposed to begin instructor B shows up and tells me our boss called her & said to cover C's shift since she could not make it in.

Class was awkward because B kept having to stop to ask me questions or parents about what this age group was supposed to be learning for the day, I told her I had no idea what they were learning & that I am not given the rosters or schedule. 
I asked B if our boss had given her the roster or schedule for this class, she told me she did not & quoting what our boss said to B was 'Just go in & cover this shift & just pick up class where you think they left off at yesterday.'
I go in for this mornings class & again no sign of  C, call my boss & she tells me 'we have B covering mornings this week sorry I forgot to tell you.'
Class is going well, I get my lunch break, my phone rings, its my boss, this is the conversation.

Me:Hello.                  

Boss:Hey Mediocre_Bondage I have a huge favor to ask of you.

Me:what is it?

Boss:Well I really need a swim instructor for this evenings class & B is not answering, is there anyway you could teach the class tonight & for the next three nights. I know you have no training (literally what she said) but you can just follow along to what the other instructor (works at the same time but teaches an older group) does & ask him questions.

Me:Um I honestly would not be comfortable doing that, I've never taught a class & I feel like I would be too anxious to even teach.

Boss:Why would you be uncomfortable? You've been guarding for this class for almost a month now you, should know how the class is taught & what to do. There would also be another lifeguard on duty so nothing would happen.          

Me:I understand & I am sorry but I am just honestly not comfortable teaching class.

Boss: -sighs loudly- Well I have to go to three pools this evening & I can't be everywhere at once, so I don't know what I am going to do.

Me: I am sorry again but I am only comfortable being a lifeguard for the summer.

Boss: It's fine, just do your shift tonight & I will figure something out.

I hoping I don't lose my job or get my hours cut.

c5jkmb	2019-06-26 02:16:35	littlebravado	AITA for refusing to force a 'sibling bond' with my half-sister?	"
 Context: My (23F) parents divorced when I was 2 and my dad remarried when I was about 8, having a second daughter with his new wife when I was 10. My half-sister, let's call her S, is ten years younger than me and lives with my dad and stepmother, while I live with my mother. Because my dad is military he's lived all around the world these past 13 years, so I really only see S once or twice a year, and not for very long.
 
Problem: My dad has always been really keen on the idea of S and I having this super close sisterly bond, which I've always thought was a bit unrealistic given our 10 year age gap and the fact that we barely see each other. Now that I'm 23 and she's 13 he thinks we ""are at a time in our lives where we have so much in common"" – but I totally disagree. Now he's trying to force me to encourage this bond with S that I don't think is there by demanding I text her regularly and call her at least once a week. I’ve told him no, I’m not doing that, because neither S or I actually want that and it would only serve him.
 
When S and I do talk she never seems that interested (which I totally get, I remember being 13) and I can usually tell our dad has forced her to call me. He used to force me to call family all the time when I was young too. When I do see S we are pretty chill, but more like cousins than siblings and we have a very minimal relationship.
 
Dad says I'm being an asshole by refusing to ""put in the effort"" and ""be more benevolent"" (wtf dad?) towards S by encouraging constant contact. He's tried to guilt me by going on about how sad she must be that ""someone so important in her life doesn't talk to her"", but from all our interactions I've gathered that S is a typical 13-year-old who doesn't really care what her 23-year-old half-sister she barely sees has to do with her.
 
I'm not saying I don't ever want to speak to the kid, but I think my dad's being an overbearing asshole trying to force this 'sibling bond' that isn't there. At the same time though, I've got no other siblings (half or otherwise) so maybe I just have no clue?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

If I have to reach him during the day, I just can’t.  He gives people my phone number if they need to reach him.  Sometimes I need to reach him (sick child at school, etc.). Sometimes he is home while I am at work.  So I always try his phone first (never charged).  Then sometimes I drop in on one of the Alexas in the house or the Furbo dog camera.  I usually just say, “Hi husband, give me a call when you get a chance.”  Today,  I knew our daughter was having friends over and wanted to discuss those plans since he was to be in charge at home.  Called the phone, phone is dead.  I figured he was on his computer, so I sent a video message to his computer.  He called me back, and boy was he pissed.  He said he was sick of me spying on him with all of my cameras.  He went on at some length about me spying on him.  I’m not.  I don’t give a shit what he does at home.  Anyway he was so mean to me on the phone that I cried for about 15 minutes.  Then when I got home it continued.  Him yelling at me about spying on him.  I’m really not.  I’m just trying to get in touch with him however I can because he refuses to charge his phone.  I’m still upset about him yelling at me, crying on and off all afternoon.  Anyway thanks for reading.
EDIT:  Just to be clear, I ONLY contact him if I have to:  e.g., sick child, after school plans, flat tire.  I’m not calling him excessively or spying on him.  I don’t need to spy on him.  He sleeps, eats and watches TV."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Room enough for 1 person to lay down on, or 2 to sit upright on. My current roommate bought it from a previous roommate when he moved in. This and a coffee table he got for free from a friend are the only contributions he’s made to the shared living space. (I furnished everything else, dining set, kitchenware, lamps, tables, shelves, pantry, TV) Current roommate has a habit of spending almost all of his time at home on the couch laying down watching TV. If I were to join him I would have to sit on a separate seat 25% of the time. I got tired of never watching TV on my own TV while he was home, so I bought another couch. He helped me move it in cause he’s a pretty good guy. But now he doesn’t use the old couch. He lays down almost exclusively on the new one I bought. Am I an asshole for telling him to move from the seat I want to sit in because I bought it? I never have asked him to move from the couch when we only had 1 and I feel weird asking him to do it now. I legitimately don’t think he knows it bothers me.

c5jf6d	2019-06-26 02:04:19	thrwwyprnts	WIBTA for telling my dad that my mom might be cheating on him?	"So the other day I was watching TV with my mom and glanced over her shoulder at her phone. Some of the words on the screen immediately caught my eye. She was scrolling through an email chain and didn't notice me looking. Upon closer inspection, I realized two things:

1. The email chain was *extremely* sexually explicit, with her having sent a wall of text describing exactly what kind of sex she wanted to be having with the guy she was emailing.
2. The email she was exchanging these messages with is not my dad's email. It is a different man's name (e.g. my dad's name is John Smith and my mom is emailing Lucas Baxter - it's not even close).

I later borrowed her phone and surreptitiously forwarded the emails to myself, than deleted the evidence that I had forwarded them (and yes, I know snooping is definitely an asshole move - that's not what I'm asking about). 

Now that I have the emails, I can see that they are clearly my mother actively cheating on my father if he isn't aware of the situation, given the sexual nature of the emails and the fact that the most recent ones (that I have on my phone) were sent just yesterday. Of course, my dad might know all about it, and they might have an open relationship without me knowing, or this is some sort of RP thing, but I can't really find that out without asking one or both of them anyway.

My first instinct was to let my dad know, but a friend advised me that I should talk to my mom first and give her a chance to explain. I'm worried about doing this both because she might lie and try to cover up the situation if she really is cheating, and also because my mom and I have had a very turbulent relationship in the past and even if I try to confront her gently, she might blow up. 

Another friend suggested I should keep it to myself and let my dad find out (or not) in his own time and not ruin my parents' marriage, but that just seems morally wrong to me.

c5jcvn	2019-06-26 01:59:14		AITA for Buying a New Fur Baby?	"Hi Reddit.

&#x200B;

This past fall, my fur baby Brady passed away suddenly due to undetected cancer. Needless to say, I was devastated and it took me months of mourning (and therapy) to come to terms with it. My SO, Anthony, was extremely supportive during this time period, and continuously offered to do anything he could in order to help me deal with my anguish. 

&#x200B;

Roughly two months ago, I unfortunately lost my job. Anthony offered to let me stay with him until I got back on my feet, and charged me a small amount monthly for the convenience. It was during my stay with him that my depression continued to fester, until I could not deal with it any longer. I recently went out to a shelter and picked out a beautiful and friendly dog. I sent Anthony pictures on my way home, and he seemed less enthused than I anticipated. Over the next few weeks, he seemed distant from our new fur baby, until he told me that he was upset because he wasn't consulted and he was experiencing allergies from her. 

&#x200B;

I calmly explained to him how I needed this new dog, and the amount of happiness she brought into my life. I reminded him how this past fall he offered to do almost anything to help me cheer up. Further, I discussed that I paid to live there as well, and it was my right to own a pet. I suggested that as a compromise, he begin getting allergy shots.

&#x200B;

Anthony exploded after I brought all of this up, and told me that he didn't want to come home to a house ""covered in fur"" and wake up during the night to barking. He told me that my fur baby was ""ruining his life"" (his exact words!) and that I would have to choose between him and the dog. 

&#x200B;

Reddit, am I being TA in this situation? I feel like I was more than reasonable, and my boyfriend is intentionally trying to sabotage my happiness."		1	0

c5jcax	2019-06-26 01:57:48		AITA for not buying my coworker food?	"throwaway, mobile, etc etc

This week I had an allergic reaction to a food i’m allergic to, I wasn’t having a serious allergic reaction but my mom still forced me to go to the ER. I was scheduled to work the day I went to the ER, so I texted my coworkers and managers saying I can’t come in and if anyone would like to fill in for me. (I didn’t need to find someone to fill in for me but I still felt bad and I wanted to help my manager!)

I texted some dude saying “Hey I have to go to the ER so I can’t work, can you work my shift tonight? I’ll take one of your shifts one day and i’ll buy you some food!” He never responded. My manager texted me saying both people she worked with said no. One of the workers she told me said no was the dude I texted. I was lowkey annoyed at him like... why couldn’t he texted me saying no?? Anyways I didn’t care. 

I went to the ER and he texted me like half an hour later saying he is working my shift since the manager made him stay. I texted “okay cool!” 

I get to work today and he was like “Hey when are you buying me food?” I was like what do you mean??? He said “I took your shift so... you said you’d buy me food”. I told him yes I did say I’d buy him food if he took my shift, but he told my manager who told me No he wouldn’t take the shift. I said “just because you were forced to work for me doesn’t mean I owe you food anymore. I only offered if you were willing to fill in for me” 

I still stick by this. He declined the offer. Once he was forced he tried to cash out the offer he already declined. 

My parents say ITA and I should just buy him the food, but I stick with what I said. I believe I don’t have to buy it for him, he didn’t accept my offer so I assume it closes. You can’t decide once you’re forced to try and get food.

I’m in my twenties and live with my parents. My older sister has an 8-year old, works weird hours, and the dad only sees her once a week if anything. So, my parents often take care of her. She used to sleep in their bedroom on the floor but they got her a smart tv for Christmas to put in my sisters old room.   To put this a little in perspective I was one of four shared a room with my other sister and never had a tv in my room neither did my siblings. Back to the point, I have trouble falling asleep at night. I know I’m being a baby but I check my closet and under the bed, then I close my bedroom door before I go to sleep and will put something lighthearted on YouTube to fall asleep to. Tonight my mom asked me if it was ok if I kept my door open. She did this while I was downstairs. I came up to tell her why it would make me uncomfortable and she was with my niece so I couldn’t really explain. I stared getting upset and told my dad who said not to worry about it and just close the door. I feel like I’m an asshole because I’m in my 20s and should grow up but I also feel like it’s unfair for my mom to make me feel scared while going to sleep just to condone an 8year old who’ve in my opinion should be able to go to sleep by themselves. Am I an asshole?                                

Edit: for clarity I should’ve said I feel more comfortable checking my room. I’m a pretty light sleeper and get sleep paralysis if my sleeping situation is changed. It’s not a situation where I’m scared of monsters but more of a fear of waking up in the middle of the night. But I can definitely see that from nieces perspective now. Ty

Last I saw him on Sunday he was in the throws of it but in good spirits. I got him food, and we hung out for a bit until I had to go home. He said he would text me the next day. I didn't hear from him at all, and he stopped posting on his socials despite usually updating his Snapchat or story multiple times a day. He has stuff saved up to do this so even if he didn't go anywhere, he would still post.

I texted him Monday and heard nothing, I tried to call later that night, but he didn't pick up. Today is when I noticed the social media thing and got worried. I texted him multiple times saying this and that I just wanted to make sure he was OK. Honestly, I was terrified he had relapsed and ODed. We usually text all day, so not hearing from him was really weird. I texted him around 8 pm saying if he didn't respond, I was coming over. No response.

Tonight, I go over to his place and ring the bell, no response. Someone was coming out of the door, so I slipped in and knocked, no answer. I heard the TV blasting, and when I called, I could hear his ringer muffled. When I knocked, I didn't hear any noises change, so it almost sounded like the TV was playing to an empty room. The fact I could hear his phone and TV but wasn't getting a response terrified me. I knocked harder. I talked to a neighbor who came in to ask if they had seen him which they hadn't. After about 20 minutes he texted me saying he was sorry but to go away. I texted back I worried something happened and could he come to talk to me, I just want to make sure he's actually OK. This went back and forth until I left about 5 minutes later. He kept texting me, saying I was mad aggressive and crazy. I told him, multiple times, I was worried he had ODed or something and considering I don't know any of his friends or family, I wasn't sure what else to do. It became evident throughout the conversation and the eventual admittance that he has relapsed.

I am going to leave this as objective as possible using only facts and no input from those involved. We all have different ideas about the scenario, so we'd like outsider's input.

We have all spent the last night and day in a hotel, and today we decided to use the hotel pool. When we got to the pool, the lights were off and the sign said closed. The door opened using our hotel key however, and we all decided to use the area anyway. We figured someone probably forgot to change the signs, and we weren't really concerned about it as the water looked fine. We turned on the lights and flipped the signs around.

We all drank a beer and were swimming in the pool when a grandpa and his two grandsons (presumably) came in. When he came in, he approached us by saying that the front desk had said the pool was closed because the filter was broken. He was asking if we thought it was okay. My boyfriend beat around the bush kinda joking that we didn't really know, we just swam anyways. The grandpa then asked if we had ripped any signs off the door or anything. My boyfriend said no and made another joke (he justified this by saying that he hadn't ripped any sign off the door). I then said to the grandpa something along the lines of we didn't know the pool was closed, but if the front desk says it isn't okay, it probably isn't.

After he left, I convinced the guys to turn off the lights, switch the signs back around, and leave. Everyone has different opinions about the matter, so we are looking for some outside input. Thank you in advance!"		1	0

My daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

Basically, today I [14m] woke up and thought that the bathroom my brother and I share looked gross (it did). So, I cleaned the counter/sink, mirror, and the inside of our toilet as well as reorganizing the items in the cupboard under the sink. I then went and asked my brother [18] if he could clean the shower and the outside of the toilet. That might be weird but those are the only parts of the bathroom that I can’t stand to clean. 

He got annoyed and said that I was already cleaning, so it didn’t make sense for him to clean. He also said that the last couple times he had cleaned the entire bathroom by himself (which isn’t true at all). My dad heard us arguing and lectured my brother for a good half hour until he decided to clean the bathroom. However, my simple bathroom clean turned into a full house clean. 

So basically, AITA for causing my brother to get lectured and causing a full house clean?

It’s a huge opportunity for me to get some experience and connect with these rich dudes that work here and hopefully get a job once I graduate college in a few years. 

Anyway I was excited to start and soak up all the knowledge I can. They got me familiarized with what they’re doing and got me started as soon as possible. But the dude that was supervising me basically just gave me long and tiresome work that had nothing to do with the work they’re doing. 

Pretty soon, the other employees started giving me work of their own and i can’t really say no since I want them to like me. I thought at first, okay maybe they just want to test me before getting to the good stuff but this is all I’ve been doing for like a month. I’ve been insanely stressed doing multiple people’s work while I noticed they’re all just slacking off talking about whatever. 

Would I be the asshole for reporting them? One on hand it feels like they’re just giving me pointless work that’s not helping me or them. But on the other hand, is this just intern culture? I really enjoy coding but this experience is making me scratch my head about this. So AITA?"		1	0
c5j562	2019-06-26 01:41:37	Oxyshay	WIBTA for not sitting with my college friend?	"All of our classes are in the same room. For technical reasons we can't change seating unless teachers decide to or the students have valid reasons to.

Anyway. For the entire year, I was sitting in the same row as A and B. They're pretty nice and know when it's appropriate to talk or stay quiet. I couldn't ask for better seating.

Over the course of the year, however, C, D and F changed places a few times. C, in particular, is the one I do not want to be sitting with in the upcoming year.

C is the one I talk/hang out most with, however also the one I have the most rocky times with. Within a little while of talking with C I spoke up over something that bothered me and things blew out of proportion as they brought up their past problems in their social life. (Of which I thought was a huge red flag and I would cut off the friendship would such guilt tripping happen again.) C also told me then to be upfront about what's on my mind. With other untold things that bothered me from the friendship, I decided I needed to stand my ground and set some boundaries. C acts the same with A, whom can barely stand their ground in regards to C.

For the most part, I got away with boundaries pretty well for the rest of the year, especially when C, D and F were moved elsewhere in the class. It left me some much needed quiet breathing room.

Thing is, C wants to sit with me and A next year as they're tired of sitting with D and F. C says it would be more fun sitting with us. C is very excited to do so and has brought it up multiple times as the end of the year came around.

Problem is, as aforementioned, I have a rocky friendship with C. A lot of ways they act, imposing themselves through, is draining. They can be brutal and hurtful at times without knowing. They're also very extroverted and loud, which is also draining as I am an introvert. The times they sat beside us as we wanted to work on our school work, we barely did. C is extremely nice and fun to be around and talk to given it's the appropriate time for it, but they're a LOT to handle.

Second hand problem would be that I do want to spend more time to get to know A better but C is all over them all the time. I could count the times I've been alone with A since the beginning of the year on my damn hands.

That being said, I don't want to sit with C next year. I have boundaries AND breathing room I need to maintain to keep myself sane. I've confronted C about it and they've only dismissed it, as they do for many other things.

I've had my fair share of college struggles in the past, and after starting anew I don't want it to get ruined again. I'm afraid of things blowing out of proportion with C like it did that one time, which it surely will, and it ruining college for me. Yet I don't want to ruin it for them, either.

c5j3iz	2019-06-26 01:37:55		AITA for leaving my husband at home after he fell?	"Scenario: Husband (active 71 year old) and I (not so-active 60 year old) were walking down the sidewalk outside the school gym last night after watching our grandson play basketball. A couple of older teen girls were leaning against the wall, and a third girl was facing them, practicing her dribbling in front and behind her legs. The sidewalk was wide, plenty of room for us to walk, but I stepped ahead a bit to walk single file so as not to get in the girls' way. I assumed my husband was right behind me and I kept walking toward the parking lot.   


I heard one of the girls say ""Oh, I'm sorry!"" but I didn't look around, because I just figured she was apologizing for being in the way of other people behind us. Then I heard my husband yell ""You COULD wait for me, you know!""  He is a mild mannered man so I am not used to him being annoyed like that just because I'm walking ahead of him. (Note, this is not a relationship submission - we rarely argue. Been married 40 years, so I guess that works.)  


I turned around expecting to see him walking toward me - but was shocked to see him on the ground surrounded by the girls and a couple of other people!  I hurried over saying ""Honey! Are you okay?!!!"" By the time I got there the girls and another adult had helped him up and I asked again if he was okay. Naturally, all of my jumbled un-asked questions were contained in that second ""are you okay"" question, such as ""Can you walk? Should we call an ambulance?"" etc. He said, in an annoyed tone ""Yes!! I'm okay!""   


I took his hand and we continued on our way down the sidewalk. I asked what happened (the ball got away from the girl and he tripped over it), and then apparently I made the mistake of asking again if he was okay, to which he bellowed ""YES, I'm OKAY!  Another couple was walking toward us and they were startled when he yelled. I was hurt but I also have a flash temper when someone snaps at me, so I snapped back at him to not yell at me like that and he said I ""kept"" asking him if he was okay and he was tired of it. It was only 3 times!  


And well, you can imagine how pleasant the ride home was. I kept insisting he talk to me about why he got so irate and was so rude to me, because I honestly didn't understand it.  He refused to engage, but I kept trying all the way home. It was not pretty. Apparently I was harping. When we got home I sarcastically said as we pulled up to the house ""I'm going to town. I would ask if you need help inside but I don't dare."" And then I went to our new Buc-cee's for two hours. True story.  


So am I the asshole for making too big a deal about his behavior toward me and then being sarcastic and then leaving him at the house after he'd had a fall?  He's fine, btw. Just sore. But he could be walking around with a hairline crack in some bone and I wouldn't know because I don't dare ask him if he's okay."	No A-holes here	0	0
c5j351	2019-06-26 01:37:06	Tic-4-Tat	AITA for refusing to have a relationship with my younger sister because of how she treated me growing up?	" Gonna try to make this short. My sister and I were never close growing up. When we were children, I would always ask to play or hang out with her and she would cry and say she didn’t want to. When we were teens, she would never want to spend any time together. She’d never go to any of my games (despite the fact that I had to pick her up and subsequently went to her all of her track meets). We just never hung out and anytime I’d reach out, she’d always pass or make an excuse or just say no. 

She’s now 18 and got accepted to the college I’m going to (I’m going to be a junior). I’m not living at home this summer, but I’ve noticed that she’s been trying to text me or call me a lot more. She’d ask for advice about college or just start random conversations, but to be honest I’ve had no interest in responding with nothing but short phrases. 

Finally she asked what’s up and how come I didn’t really seem excited about going to school together and I just said she never really seemed to have a relationship growing up, I don’t see why have one now. She said I was being ridiculous and she was just a teenager and I told her that she really hurt me growing up (I have mild aspergers and didn’t have many friends as it was) and I was not interested in being friends or having anything other than a regular cordial relationship. 

She said I needed to grow up and a few minutes later, my mom called me and basically asked why I was being an asshole to my sister. I’m not; I’m treating her the same as she treated me all those years. Am I really being unreasonable?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

We talk on the phone for at least an hour almost every day, tell eachother everything. The only catch is she lives 6 hours away. I take a trip to see her at least 1-2 a year, she hasn’t come up once since she moved (8 years). 

So about 8 months ago my fiancé proposed. We were both super excited, but I asked my best friend of 13 years to be my maid of honor because she lives 15 minutes away and has been there with me every step of the way for this. She comes over at least once a week, and she was excited for the engagement for months. 

I made my sister a bridesmaid, but when she found out she wasn’t my MOH she lost her mind on me. We didn’t talk for over a week because every time we did she’d tell me how I’m an asshole and she’s hurt and she’d NEVER do this to me. I told her it’s only because she lives too far away to help with the planning. She thinks I should have my other bridesmaids do the planning but give her the title, even though she already admitted she’ll only be able to come up for the wedding week and nothing else. 

Even to this day, if I talk about the wedding she gets upset. My mom agrees with her, but my fiancé and other friends think she’s being selfish. She thinks I’m awful for not making her the MOH, I think she’s being awful for making my whole wedding about her and not willing to even talk about it.

We’re only sexy about once a month now. I enjoy sex quite a bit in general and I’m also horny a lot. So you can imagine the build up that comes from weeks and weeks of not having sex. But I’ve been finding that when the sexy time finally happens...

I just want it to be over with. Couple of red flags I’ve noticed a few issues:

1. My boyfriend doesn’t get me worked up. Usually I read or see something or I’m alone and think about something, and then I just try to have sex ASAP.  He’s not great at foreplay but wonders why I always skip it. 
2. I get really bored during the action. He keeps to the same stuff and doesn’t switch things up.
3. He’ll be close after a few strokes, so I have to stop a lot and wait. A lot. 
4. I’ve never really reached the climax with him. To the point that almost every time after I have to question myself if I actually did. 
5. I’ve taken a few opportunities to try to work on it myself by communicating with him I need more or I need more time and it always gets to a point where he seems annoyed it’s taking too long so I just fake it.

I guess I just feel like an old house wife that realizes she’ll never be satisfied and that makes me sad because I’m at a young (over 18) age where I should be enjoying sex right now and having fun.

Would I be the asshole if I told my boyfriend after all this time that he doesn’t get me “there”? Should I keep my mouth shut to avoid offending him and his belief that he pleases me? Is it too late?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My work place is throwing a potluck / bridal shower for one of the ladies. This is a combined celebration that she passed a super tough certification exam in our industry and a small bridal shower for her wedding in two weeks. There's a woman, let's call her Linda, who is planning the whole thing. Linda has been doing everything on the sly to keep it all a surprise for the bride.

The other morning, Linda cornered me and asked if I would make The Cookies. The Cookies are a triple chocolate mess that take 3 hours per batch to make. One batch is about 30 cookies. I was like ""the ingredients are like $30 and they take an entire evening to make, but sure."" Linda then asked I do two batches to make sure there's enough for everyone + some for the bride to take home. Ok, so now I'm in for like $60 and 6 hours. I guess, Linda.

Today, Linda sent an email to everyone asking we all bring $20 to her to buy a Visa gift card for the bride. This really bothers me because now I'm in for $80 plus an entire evening of baking. I'm especially bothered because I'm not even invited to the bride's wedding, where pretty much everyone else is.

Not even getting into that I'm flying out for a huge work trip as of Friday and will instead be spending my Thursday night making these dang cookies, instead of getting ready for my trip.

WIBTA if I didn't bring the cash? Should I say I spent it to make the cookies?

\*\*Edited to add The Cookie recipe by /u/[Not\_Cleaver](https://www.reddit.com/user/Not_Cleaver/)'s suggestion\*\*

**NotYourYear's Triple Chocolate Chip Cookies**

Makes 30 cookies

Ingredients:

* 8 tablespoons butter
* 8oz dark baking chocolate (or 6 squares Ghirardelli super dark baking chocolate)
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 & 1/2 cup flour
* 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup & 2 tablespoons brown sugar (doesn't matter if light or dark)
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 teaspoon vanilla extract (or 1/4 teaspoon vanilla paste)
* 2 large eggs
* 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Instructions:

1. In sauce pot, combine butter, dark baking chocolate and 1c sugar over medium heat. Stir constantly until completely melted. Place in fridge for 25 minutes.
2. In large bowl, mix all dry ingredients (flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, brown sugar and white sugar).
3. Remove cooled melted chocolate from fridge. In medium sized bowl, whisk together eggs and vanilla extract. Slowly add melted chocolate mixture. Mix until smooth and light. It won't become entirely like a mousse or whipped cream, but will be a little like a custard.
4. Gently fold chocolate mixture into dry ingredients. Add chocolate chips about half way through.
5. Place in fridge and allow to rest for a minimum of 30 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 375F.
7. Roll dough into 1 to 1.5in balls. Place evenly along non-stick baking sheet. Press down with fork.
8. Bake for 6-8 minutes, or until done on edges and gooey in center.
9. Remove from heat, cool on rack. Cry and eat like 5, because you earned it and no one will miss 5 out of a 30+ batch."	No A-holes here	0	0

c5iy2m	2019-06-26 01:26:03	cutieconsultant	AITA for spending my bonus on me?	"I know this is silly and first world problem but WTH.

I (F23) have lived a great life. I've had part-time jobs but my parents provided everything my sister and I ever needed. They both grew up poor and wanted to give us a great life. I don't think we were spoiled; we weren't allowed to have just anything and everything. I really do appreciate everything my parents have sacrificed so my sister and I could have a great life.

I graduated college with no debt and received a small designer purse as a grad gift (which I LOVE). I lived with my parents through August when I started working. I paid them back in full for summer ASAP. My parents pay for my cell phone plan (Family Plan, I bought my phone) and health insurance (doesn't cost them anything extra). I am 98% financially independent from my parents.

Over the course of six months I paid all my credit cards on time and put 15% of my salary into my 401k but was having trouble saving more than that.

Recently, bonuses came out for the year. I have always wanted a designer purse. Buying my first big item made me proud knowing I had worked hard for it and I knew it would last me forever. Being super into fashion my entire life, it's something I've always dreamed about. I had a purse picked out and after taxes it would be about half of my bonus money, so the other half would go into savings.

So, I went out and bought it. I posted it on my social media, and my parents flipped. My mom said it was obnoxious and disgusting that I would post this designer purse on social media. She was appalled that I would choose to spend my money on something this frivolous especially when I had another designer purse (that is completely different designer, style, size). A vacation would be worthwhile but this is stupid, she said.

She asked why I didn't put my money into savings? I said I put half and spent half. Well, she said, you should have put it all in savings (I have \~$30,000 saved). She said I should have thought about buying them or my grandparents a gift, which makes me feel shitty to admit but never crossed my mind. They can all buy themselves anything, which is not the point, the gesture was lacking. My dad said he thought I had a spending problem. My mom said she felt like she didn't know me.

I was so hurt and angered by her reaction. She and my grandma gave me old designer purses they don’t use, and between this and my parent's reaction I returned the purse and put all my money into savings. Basically, shamed into returning.

My mom asked for proof I returned it, which angered me more. I never gave proof because I don't have to prove anything to her, it was my purchase after all. She threatened to take back the purses she and my grandma gave me, but hasn’t.

So, AITA for spending half my bonus money on a ""disgusting"" purchase? For posting about my purchase on social media? For not saving my money? For not buying my parents/gparents something?

"Okay so my best friend, let’s call him Bob, have been friends since middle school and we are in our third year of uni. Last year Bob and I rented out a place with one of my other uni friend, let’s call him Doug. Bob and Doug didn’t know each other that well and were only connected through me but it worked out great and we all got along and became really close, at least I thought! A year passed and Doug who is an international student graduated and since he wasn’t too sure what his next step would be career wise and where it would be, we all agreed that it probably wouldn’t be  smart for him to sign another year lease with Bob and I. But we told him he could live in our living room for the first month rent free while he figured out what his next step is.

After the month was over Doug left to go visit his friends in another city that was across the country and he left a lot of his personal belongings with us, a couple weeks later he told us that his work visa application was denied (he was very dumb and filled out the wrong paperwork). He told us he would hire an immigration lawyer and appeal the decision in the city where he moved to. Two months pass and he messaged us if he could come for two weeks so he could pack his belongings and visit some people here.

Doug came over and he definitely made the living room his personal room which made Bob extremely agitated (I should probably not this was during finals season and his stress level was high). One night Bob snaps and tells Doug he had to leave and take all of his belongings with him, because he’s unfairly leaching off us and it’s causing him grief. I tell Bob that he is being way too harsh and bringing this up too suddenly. Bob gets angry and asks if I’m taking Doug’s side over his. I tell him I’m doing exactly that because Doug is my friend in need and that if I was in his position I have no doubt Doug would be supporting me however he could. However since Bob shares rent with me he can force Doug to leave, which he did. Since then I Barely talk to Bob at all and can’t see myself being close friends with him again. AITA for ending a decade long friendship over this?


TL;DR   Best friend of 10 years kicked out our friend (who was at risk for being deported) out of our apartment, because he was excessively leaching off us, and I can’t bring myself to ever be close friends with him again

EDIT: Just to clarify Doug’s position, since his work visa application got rejected and he is in the appeal process, he has been unable to find any employer that is willing to hire him, and his savings are going towards retaining an immigration lawyer

EDIT 2: Thanks to everyone who replied. You guys made great points and like most of these situations I see on this subreddit there’s a lot more happening in the background that I didn’t get into.

c5isbj	2019-06-26 01:12:58	whispersofaquarius	AITA for dragging my middle school by name in a podcast about class and race differences?	"I went to a ""posh"" middle school, where the tuition per year was basically the same as a small college. I was able to go because my grandfather donated quite a bit of his savings, and the school forgave certain things like student lunch debt for me because I had great scores/grades. Almost every child there was the child of millionaires or at least several-hundred-thousand-aires, with quite a few billionaires in the mix.  

The lunches were delicious, and there were good courses, but the goods end there. The school environment was suffocating. Students whose parents were large donors to the school were constantly given undeserved awards at public ceremonies, and bullying was virtually swept under the rug. One white boy vandalized $10,000 of African American art and got away with it because his parents bought the silence of the school and the artist. He was given only a 3 day suspension, which he bragged about on social media.  

The students themselves were cutthroat and blatantly racist and classist. Slurs were pretty much common. I held hands with a female friend who had anxiety issues (DUE to the intense pressure to conform) and was called a dyke in the halls. The whole thing was a bit of a nightmare overall.  

Recently, I got to be in a podcast about civil rights in my state, especially race and class issues, and I used many of these experiences. I named no students, but I did name the school, and one of my friends told me I was an asshole for dragging an entire school based on my experience. I observed these behaviors in every class, however, not just mine. My mother mentioned that she was worried that I could ruffle some feathers, but I don't really care about that. AITA?"

c5irfh	2019-06-26 01:11:10	SteviaSteve	AITA for thinking about shortening my trip to see my girlfriend so I can continue my internship?	"To preface this, my girlfriend and I go to the same college but live on opposite sides of the country during the summer. She's also going to be studying abroad this next semester.

&#x200B;

I go to college for documentary film and I was able to create an internship position at an amazing $3b net worth company doing film production. When I originally interviewed with them, I told them that I had planned a 3 week trip to see my girlfriend but I would still be able to do work for them while I was out of the office. At the time, they agreed to this plan although they sounded slightly hesitant. I started 2 weeks ago and over the last few days, the creative director of the company and my boss both made a few comments suggesting that I should shorten the length of my trip due to upcoming projects they have me scheduled to be in charge of. I didn't put much thought into it since this trip had been planned since before I interviewed for the job and they had agreed to it until my boss made a comment along the lines of ""I don't know if we'll be able to hire you back/give you recommendations if you're gone for that long"". This internship has already given me so many opportunities to learn new skills and lead my own projects for this which is a huge stepping stone in my career and I don't want to lose that. 

&#x200B;

I talked to my girlfriend about it and she sounded very disappointed although she was supportive of the idea, even to the point of recommending I ask my work to reimburse me for the cost of changing my flight back. I haven't made a definitive decision yet but I'm almost positive I'm going to shorten the trip to two weeks. 

&#x200B;

I feel like an absolute AH for taking away this time from my girlfriend since I won't be able to see her until January after this trip, but I feel as if I need to do this. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c5ioro	2019-06-26 01:05:02		"AITA For Getting Irratated When Non-Asians Are Trying to Act ""Asian"" to Be Trendy?"	"Please don't send hate as I'm only looking for an answer as to wibta and if I'm the only one out there.
Since 5th grade, classmates started teasing me about my ""yellow"" skin, my diet of cats and dogs, stereotypes, Buddhism, and even my own language that I speak. At some points I hated my skin and the Thai family that I was born into because I couldn't fit in. I started to learn to love myself again the summer before 7th grade year and ""embraced the Asian"" as my mom likes to say.
I went into 7th grade proud of who I am, even though the teasing still continued. I started to notice people trying to ""act Asian"" or even get interested in Buddhism because of trends though. I see some people that say they are Buddhist and have a little buddha head as decoration which is a BIG nono in Buddhism. The people who used to pull on their eyelids and say ""ching chong"" are now drinking boba, eating the most basic asian foods seen on the media (pad thai, ramen, etc.), singing kpop and jpop, and applying on makeup looks to look more Asian. How could people's opinions of Asians transition so fast? First you tease me for being asian, so much to the point where I wished I was someone else, and now you suddenly embrace the asian culture?
I've met people online and irl that say they like Asians, but what they mean by that is that they like the hot looking Chinese, Japanese and Korean girls/boys. A lot of guys and girls I know/know of became a victim to non-Asians only liking them because they are Asian, which is so messed up. Some people at my school even classified themselves as Asian or say ""I'm (this ethnicity), but I'm basically Asian because I watch so much anime/kpop and eat so much ramen!! Ooh and my great grandfather was Asian so I'm part Asian too!!"" Another common thing I hear is ""you are so lucky to be Asian! I wish I could be Asian."" But that's the thing. I don't feel lucky to be born Asian. My family was so strict about grades and I got whooped a lot as a child because I wasn't doing my math fast enough. I had so much pressure from teachers, classmates, and family to get good marks and do well. If I did achieve something, it wasn't because I worked hard or deserved it. It was because I was Asian. Now there is an issue with non-Asians saying or doing something racist like making ""Asian"" eyes, calling people chinks, or just straight up making fun of Asians and using the excuse ""no, I love Asians and Asian cultures so much!"" to defend their clearly racist actions.
I understand that there are people who genuinely do like the multitude of Asian cultures, traditions, and religions and I fully respect that, but the people who simply just like Asians for the fact that they are trending and popular are a different story."		1	0
c5ionq	2019-06-26 01:04:45		AITA for not wanting to pay for the train tix my friend bought	"My ex best friend and I had been best friends for the last 12 years and we're 20 yo uni students. We are having our summer break now and had booked all the stuff needed for our trip to Korea (I booked all of them and paid for her share first during the booking process) and was left with booking our train ride in Korea.

Leading up to this, I have been having this one sided tension with her for the last 3.5 months. To summarise everything that happened, I pais $1k for her first when I was booking everything and she assumed that it would be okay for her to return me the money over the course of a few months (define few months) without outlining how much and how often. I begrudgingly said ok to this at first because I thought she was broke (she frequently complained of having no money but blows them on shopping, eating expensive food, partying at clubs and drinking). Turns out she had enough money to return the $1k in full and reluctantly handed it to me when I asked for it.

I started to become resentful of her as I started to realise she has always tried to take advantage of me financially (eg. always assuming I would pay for both of us first when we went out and would return me the money only when I asked for it or paying rounded down amounts of money if I helped her to buy stuff)

I have been busy with work lately so I hadn't had the time to book the tickets despite the trip being 1 week away. So I asked her to help book the tickets. She says she's booking from rail.ninja and sends me a screenshot of the price of the train ride. We're not from the US so I asked if the price was stated in our currency to which she replisd ""It's obviously our currency! Don't you see the dollar sign hahaha""

I told her it could very well be USD and guess what? I WAS RIGHT. USD is stronger than our currency which means we have to pay a lot more. But she didn't realise it was in USD until after she paid. For the record, USD was VERY clearly stated as the currency used. Because she paid in USD, each of us had to pay $24 more in our currency when compared to booking the train tickets FROM THE KORAIL. I was furious because as uni students with barely any income, the $24 difference is significant (The train tickets were $70 per person if purchased from the Korail, now they're $94). I figured it was a lot cheaper to cancel the tickets despite the 30% cancellation fee and after telling her this, I ignored her messages asking me if I was angry at her. I replied 1 day later saying ""If you pay for my cancellation fee then no I'm not angry hehe"". Her mistake was just dumb and expensive and *100% preventable*. My bf said I shouldn't be subsidising her mistake so AITA for not wanting to pay for her mistake?"	Asshole	1	0

Short backstory, we graduated college several years ago and he unfortunately has not had a steady job or a clear direction of what to do next.
So as he’s telling me more and more about this new opportunity, I’m genuinely happy for him because I can tell he’s excited. However, as the conversation goes on, he starts to ask if he can come visit me and my wife so that he could explain a little more into detail what he has to offer. As it turns out, his company offers financial services and even insurances to individuals (and possibly companies). He then started telling me that if I wanted to, I could also become a representative for the same company and do what he does on top of my current full-time job.
He goes as far as mentioning it might be a good opportunity for my wife during the summer since she’s not working (she is a teacher and enjoys her summers off, which I don’t blame her).

c5iizu	2019-06-26 00:51:50		AITA for refusing to watch my sister in laws children anymore so I could fly back home?	"So. A little background. My sister in law needed someone to watch her kids because she “forgot” to renew their paperwork for daycare. (She’s on a gov’t program so it may work differently, not to sure on the specifics). The point is, they couldn’t go to daycare until they had their stuff up to date. They are 4 and 7 years old. Mind you, I have a soon to be 2 year old of my own. Firstly, she never even told me directly that she needed me to watch them. My father in law (her dad) was the one who asked that she needed that favor done. I called her and told her that I would watch them simply because she really didn’t have any other option. Their dad lives in NY and everyone else works their 9-5 jobs. She doesn’t have a car and she asked me if it would be better for me and my son to sleep in their house to “make it easier for me”. I told her no. Her house is super disorganized and quite frankly, not clean. I did not want to stay there with my son. I told her the kids could sleep in our house until she got her stuff straight.

That was fine. Now, these kids eat A LOT! You’d think she would supply food? Nope. We have supplied everything. Now we’re shopping for 3 kids plus ourselves, adding to our already strained budget. She sent me $50 for the whole WEEK to cover anything. 

Now, fast forward and I’m on the THIRD week of watching them because for some reason, things still aren’t figured out. She said the 4 year old should be back by the end of the week, I doubt it. The 7 year old will take longer because they’re waiting on her epi pens. (She’s allergic to peanuts). 

Well, I get a phone call from back home in NY from my cousin telling me that she and my other cousins have pooled their money together to fly me out to surprise another cousin for his bday. We are a super close family and I’ve been very homesick since I moved from NY. I left everyone behind and I’ve been dying for the chance to see them again. So of course I couldn’t pass this up. 

I call her and let her know that I’ll be flying out on Sunday and she tried to guilt me. She asked me if I could take the bus home (a 9 hour bus ride from where I’m at to NYC) so i could take the 7 year old to her dad. I vehemently said no. I do not feel comfortable riding in a bus for so long with my own kid, let alone someone else’s child. She seemed desperate and asked me what she was supposed to do now? I’m like idk, but I cannot pass up on this opportunity to go home simply because you can’t get your stuff together. She got mad at me and hung up. I told my husband everything (her brother) and he called her back to talk to her. She was telling him that she’s going to have to end up quitting her job to stay home with the kids because she can’t afford to miss work but had no option for anyone to watch them. RIDICULOUS! 

Now today, lo and behold, I go on FB and there’s a status from her saying goodbye to the people she works with and saying she had to make this tough choice. I feel like she’s trying to guilt me and manipulate me. And so reddit I ask, AITA?"		1	0

My mom also attends support groups for women who have been cheated on, and she would often tell me stories of how her friends' kids have stopped all communications with their fathers who cheated.

Anyways, a bit of background first: my daughter is 7 years old and currently in elementary school, and also currently attending their summer school program. At her school, there are these things called ""(school name) Prizes"", which are given whenever a student does something outstandingly kind, helpful, etc. They are cashed in at the office to win candies and such.

My daughter gets these prizes a good few times a month, I'd say 1-3 times. In addition to school given candy, me and my wife often buy her small treats like toys or milkshakes, to encourage her to do nice things and all that. It's been a tradition of sorts to her. 

Anyway, as of late, we've been putting together money to move to a nicer apartment. Both of us make decent pay, but we've both mutually decided that we will have to cut a few monthly expenses here and there to be able to pay for said apartment. Today, my daughter brought home a prize from her day at school, and had a very specific request: she wanted to go to Target and get a Unicorn stuffed animal. I know exactly what she's talking about, and the stuffed animal is around seven dollars. It isn't much compared to the apartment, but things do add up.

I told her sorry, we can't, and drive her home instead. Crying ensues. When we get home, she tearfully tells my wife about me not getting her a unicorn. Wife gets mad at me. Wife is currently still mad at me, and tells me that I should have bought the unicorn.

c5if9b	2019-06-26 00:43:32	GreatLongbeard	WIBTA if I started dating my alcoholic co-workers ex girlfriend ?	"
It goes like this. Me, Girl and coworker worked together at the same resturant for 4 years. We + two other colleuges used to hang in group from time to time. Coworker and girl started dating for half a year, she broke up and he was devestated. During this time I became severly depressed due to a life situation and started talking with girl. She turned out to be depressed aswell and we became good friend, talking everday on facebook. **1 year** passed since we started talking, and **almost 2 years** since they broke up. My coworker told me that he still has feelings for her.

I have always viewed Girl as a friend only, since when we first started talking I was in a relationship and after that wasn't interested in dating for a while. We both decided to get our lives together and try being more positive. And as it happened, we started hanging out and doing fun activities together. Suddenly I started getting feelings for her and I also noticed how she acted like she did too.

Now here's the twist:

I felt okay with dating this girl since it was 2 years since she and my coworker broke up.

But then my coworker called out of the blue. He told me that he actually had a drinking problem and did some bad, bad decisions the day before calling. It probably started with some new friends of his that parties a lot, and I think he has a lot of issues that just made it easier for him to fall into that trap.

I don't know why he called me, but I'm glad he called someone. We met up and talked, and he's going to AA meetings now. But he's so broken right now and at the bottom.

So now I stand here with a girl I like, who I think likes me back, and a coworker who still likes her and is really depressed.

If I get accepted to my school I will quit my job in 3 months, so I'm probably not gonna see that coworker again.

c5ib45	2019-06-26 00:34:06	Lady_Airam	AITA here for not approaching this seriously enough?	"Here’s the background. I [F14] am on competitive swimming and horseback riding teams. I’m also a hard righty so I tended to use my right side a crap ton for things, and thus it got noticeably more muscular than the left side of my body. It used to be very noticeable and now you only notice if you’re staring for a while or are looking for asymmetry. 

The problem has gotten better just by me fixing old habits in sports and working out more. However, my dad noticed recently and pointed it out to me. Here’s the thing, I HATE it when my flaws are exposed. I would cover up anything so other people who aren’t my closest friends wouldn’t see. This made me super on edge because my kick (in swimming) was already better and the issue was shrinking. My dad then took in upon himself to help me out by going on amazon and spending $250 on a leg curl machine that would supposedly help me. 

I was super on edge about this and didn’t want him to A, spend the money and B, interfere in what I was doing. I told him that it had been wayyy worse and just by me acknowledging it and working out more I’ve improved. He then got on my case and loudly said “this won’t fix itself on its own” and “it’ll just get worse.” 

I finally relented and genuinely thanked him and then went back to doing math olympiads in preparation for the SAT. I don’t know if that detail was relevant. 

Today, the package with the machine arrived and my dad put it together for me so when I got home from swim practice he showed it to me. I was ecstatic because I thought it would help out my performance but I didn’t look as happy as I was because I had just had swim practice, was tired, and hungry. 

My dad asked if I knew how to use it and I didn’t so he showed me and then explained how to add weight onto it and so forth. He also told me how I could use just the bad leg on it. To which I respond (not in a serious way) “but how much would be too much?” I don’t want the same problem but with the other side. 

Granted, I said it a bit casually and I smiled.

My dad then proceeds to say that I’m ungrateful and told me to “get the f*** out” of the excessive room. I stood in the doorway in shock because I hadn’t meant to sound negative but I was just asking and that I was sorry if I came off the wrong way.

He just shook is head and I took it as my cue to leave. 

I’m so confused. My dad is the only parent I have and I would never be negative like that. I love him so much and appreciate all the effort he had put into working for my brother and I.

My ex-wife cheated on me throughout our marriage and I only found out four years in. I guess I was one of four suitors and when we got married, she didn't split ties with any of them. We have a 3 year old daughter who is mine as determined by paternity testing. She has custody as she's more well off (family trust, etc) but we're at least somewhat amicable with each other.

I have my girl every weekend, starting at Saturday at noon and ending Monday 8am or so when I drop her off at daycare. Sometimes I'm asked to take over Friday afternoons, though, and I learned this uptick in Fridays is due to my ex-wife trying to date.

Am I the asshole for refusing Fridays because it puts a damper on her plans? She goes on dates almost every Friday now.

c5i8qq	2019-06-26 00:28:51	pyrobove	AITA for not wanting to take care of my older brother's dog while he goes to the beach?	"My father (I am 16) has recently informed me I'm going to have to take care of my older brother's (an adult) dog while he goes to the beach. My father will be out of town for the next week, my mother will be at work all day for the next week, and my brother who lives at my house is simply just...out of the question...I know he's not going to do anything. Lengthy explanation required for that. Which leaves me as the only person who will be left to take care of the dog. Did my older brother even plan ahead or ask about the situation he was about to leave his dog in??

One problem - I have never taken care of a dog before, we've never owned a dog, I don't know how to take care of a dog, and I simply lack the energy to take care of a dog. They're very high-maintenance, high-energy animals. They know all of the aforementioned details. I'm nowhere near being a dog person and while they're fine to be around and all, I know I will never own one, as I know I won't be able to properly take care of one. That wouldn't be fair to the hypothetical dog.

I tried to raise the possibility of leaving the dog at a kennel, getting another person my brother knows to take care of the dog, all of which were shot down by my father...The reason given to me was ""he's your brother, just do it, he's family"", and I'm ""16 so I need to listen to directions"". The same reasoning was given to me when I was forced to loan $2,000 to my sister so she could pay a down payment on a house she couldn't afford. 

Long story short, I guess the dog is staying here. AITA?


**Info:** I will be taking care of the dog for a week. My brother also knows other people he could potentially ask, some of which are dog owners. And yes, even though I don't want to and I don't believe it's particularly fair to me, I intend on taking care of the dog as best I can. All he'll have is me. If I were to just sit and do nothing, it sure as heck would be way less fair to the dog than it is to me, who's just an innocent dog. I won't let any unfairness get in the way of his care."

c5i4uj	2019-06-26 00:19:49	jkdshfkjshdfksh	WIBTA if I declined to meet the new guy my mom has started dating (less than a year after my dad died) because he's a felon?	"I'm a 27-year-old guy.  My parents had been happily married for 25-30 years when my dad died on June 20, 2018.  At some point this past spring, my mom (52) started dating a guy (37) from work.  She talks about him a lot, and while things seem to be moving surprisingly quickly between them, it's not my place to say what she can and can't do with her life, and ultimately I want her to be happy.

Several weeks ago she mentioned to him that I enjoy target shooting as a hobby.  Apparently he immediately went out and bought a gun despite having no prior experience with firearms.  I thought this was a little weird, but whatever, everyone has to start somewhere.

However, last week my mom told me that he introduced her to marijuana, which is still illegal for recreational use in our state.  She said that they ""only"" use it about three times per week, which seems like a lot to me, but again, it's not really any of my business.  The problem is that I've purchased enough guns to know that the following question appears on the form when you buy one:

> Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?

Lying on this form is a felony, and as a lawful gun owner with a license to carry, it bothers me that he committed a crime like this, even though it's unlikely that the police will ever find out about it.  And not only did he break the law while buying the gun, but he's also continuing to break the law simply by possessing it per the ATF:

> Therefore, any person who uses or is addicted to marijuana, regardless of whether his or her State has passed legislation authorizing marijuana use for medicinal purposes, is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, and is prohibited by Federal law from possessing firearms or ammunition.

My mom has been asking me to meet him.  My younger brother immediately refused because he doesn't want to see my mom with anyone other than my dad, and I could tell that she was upset by that.  I don't particularly want to be friends with this guy either, but I was planning to suck it up and do it for her because I love my mom and treasure my relationship with her.  But after she told me about the marijuana, I just don't know if I can respect him as a person.

**I want to be crystal clear that I have nothing against recreational marijuana use in and of itself.**  In fact, I wish the government would hurry up and legalize it at the federal level so I can start using it occasionally too.  What bothers me is that he committed a felony by lying on his 4473, and it's hard to see my mom with a criminal (regardless of whether he's been charged), let alone welcome him into my life.

c5i403	2019-06-26 00:17:44		AITA for not helping my friend in need when he didn't help me in my time of need?	"Four years ago I was in the middle of a divorce with a violent toxic woman. One winter I was attacked with plates which caused a few cuts and I had to run into the bathroom and lock the door to protect myself. It was a very dark time. I needed only a couple of days away from home because she destroyed my laptop, phone, tablet, making it next to impossible to find somewhere to move. It didn't help I lived in a rural area where houses are separated by long stretches (10-15min walk) and had no license. As irrational as it sounds, if I left the house, I'd fear she'd take the car and run me over. It was this bad.

I phoned my friend to see if he could come over, help defuse the situation, and perhaps give me a place to stay while I finalized new living arrangements. I was turned down, and I learned after the fact it wasn't because he couldn't, it's because he didn't want to get involved.

Three days ago, I'm in a much better situation. I have my own house, have a new wife and a little one on the way. My friend contacted me about needing a place to stay for a couple of weeks as he's being evicted and new housing doesn't open up for another few weeks. I told him he couldn't, not because I couldn't help, but I remember when he didn't help me in my most vulnerable of times. He said he'll be homeless for a couple of weeks which would be rough in our area, so I told him he's welcome to come eat, shower, etc but he can't stay. I was told off and that's the end of our friendship I guess.

c5i35t	2019-06-26 00:15:57	passedFIL	AITA for telling my wife to move on from the death of her father?	"My wife and her father were very close. She adored him. About 4 years ago he was diagnosed with cancer and it progressed very rapidly. My wife deicded to move back in with her father to help care for him. He lived in the same town so its not like she moved across the country or to another state. We still saw each other and our marriage continued. I wasn't happy about the choice but I supported her because I know what her father meant to her.

&#x200B;

He died a year ago. She has been devastated. He left her a large sum of money, and the house. She was his only child and he's been divorced for years now she inherited everything. She refuses to moved out of his house. She is still crying almost daily over this. She's not eating right or taking care of herself. She is seriously depressed. I tried to tell her that her father wouldn't want her to be living like this and it was time for her to move on. I recommended we take some of her inheritance and use it to go on a vacation somewhere maybe it would cheer her up but she got extremely upset and accused me of wanting just caring about the money she inherited. She said living in the house makes her feel close to him and that I was an asshole for not understanding how upset she is. I get it was hard and all but its been a year now. I think its time she start to move on. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit a lot of people have suggested therapy. I did try that. She wont leave the house. I'm telling you guys SHE NEVER LEAVES THAT HOUSE. When I say shes not taking care of herself I mean it. She orders everything off amazon, she doesn't cook for herself anymore, she just orders take out. She has barely left that house in a year. This isn't normal grief. I've lost people too this is way beyond that.

&#x200B;

Edit 2. I usually do the cooking and cleaning over at her house when I can. I also take care of our house. I think I am going to put in for a leave and use up my pto. I am going to move in with her and list our place on Airbnb so its not empty. The suggestions for in home counselors I will look into. I will also look into getting her on some sort of anti depressant."	No A-holes here	0	0
c5i2v4	2019-06-26 00:15:18		AITA For being reluctant to go to my girlfriends house?	"I suck at starting these so bare with me! My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year and a half now, we met in college and coincidentally live only 30 minutes apart when we’re home for the summer. We both live in Georgia (I moved here from New Jersey when I was 8) and attend college here. 

I don’t really fit in with southern crowds as much as I’d like to, you could obviously tell I’m from up north and I stick out for sure. This isn’t really a problem to me but I think it contributes to this current issue.

I love spending time with my girlfriend, I love her to bits! She’s always coming over (or I’m picking her up) and gets along great with my family, they all love her too. Which is great because my family is VERY loud and I was scared they’d scare her away haha. 

I feel like it’s wrong to keep asking her to come over to my house and for me to not want to go to hers as often though. I’ve of course been to their house before, but not as often as she’s been to mine. 

The reason for this is that her dad just... can be (I don’t want to insult the guy) very rude. He’s the stereotypical conservative southern type and is very rooted in his way, which isn’t an issue to me but he seems to always have something to say about me. I thought we were making progress and we even had a chat one night over some beers and hashed it all out and I was like “great he’s finally coming around to me” because before this he couldn’t stand me. I have no idea why, he was probably just being defensive of his daughter, I can’t blame him for that. But even after I thought we were improving whenever I’m there he’s practically insulting me or making snide remarks about me. Her sister and mom call him out about being an asshole (their words not mine) and it’s becoming a thing every time I’m there. I hate having people dislike me, especially when I did nothing wrong. This has lead to me being super reluctant about going over there... it just always stresses me out but I don’t think it’s fair to ask her to come here more often than me going over there and idk if saying this to her would make me seem like an asshole or not because I can’t suck it up and be a man about it.."		1	0

I told her that she was the nerdy one ( she uses glasses, is skinny, likes to read a lot, etc ). 

She laughed about it and we didn’t talk about it anymore. But she didn’t talk with me during the rest of the day, when I asked her why she told me “ you were rude, I don’t want to be the nerdy girl “ and proceeded to go to her room.

My wife suggested we take the subway because 1. It’ll save time and 2. It will be cheaper than an Uber/LYFT. She takes the subway everyday for work. I walk to work. She wants to just put him in the baby body carrier and take the 20 min subway ride.
Full disclosure, I hate the subway. Yes, I know it’s New York and the subway is part of life and all of that, but I avoid it at absolutely any opportunity possible. We can easily take an Uber which will take us about the same time but cost a bit more than the subway fare. No, we don’t have money issues but my wife keeps playing up that the subway is cheaper.
My reason for not taking our 9 month old on is because of the very loud noise, the germs, the huddled masses at 8:30AM rush hour - it just sounds like a terrible thing to put our not even 9 month old baby through, if we can avoid it. 
Am I being an asshole?

c5hzzl	2019-06-26 00:09:01	batteriesnotrequired	AITA for demanding an apology	"Tonight we went to my wife’s grandparents house on our way home. Her grandmother has been having some health issues and my wife wanted to stop by and check on her. Turns out the whole family was over, ok no big deal I get a long with them. While we were talking her grandmother kept asking for snacks. She was being told no by her husband and everyone else, that dinner would be ready soon and she needed to wait. I should note that her health issues are because she’s diabetic and doesn’t watch her sugar levels or what she eats. 

So she looks at me and says “that she wants the little tomatoes from the fridge!” I calmly say “No, tomato’s are fruit and fruit equals higher sugar.”  I was about to add that dinner was almost ready when she looks at me and says “You shut up!” For the record she has never been a nice lady and I don’t put up with the disrespect so I turn to her (I’ve been standing in the living room the whole conversation) and snap back “Don’t you tell me to shut up!”  And I turn to leave the room because I don’t put up with her when she’s a jerk, and I’ll admit I yelled at her like she yelled at me but you would have thought I’d hit her. My father-in-law jumps up and grabs ahold of my arm and is screaming something at me, I have no idea what and I am trying to shrug him off telling him to let go and that I’m leaving. But he won’t let go and he keeps trying to yank me around. So I finally lose it and scream “Let fucking go of me!” And I turn with the intention to hit him. My wife screams “Just go to (our son’s name).” At this point Father-in-law lets go and I proceed to leave the room and find my son and get ready to leave. 

As I’m in the other room, my grandfather-in-law walks in and asks what the hell happened. My father-in-law proceeds to tell the whole family about how I “snapped” and was “going after” my grandmother-in-law. A whole load of bullshit. 

For what it’s worth I have no history of violence towards women and I was at no point remotely going to attack her. I might have hit my father-in-law for not letting me go but in the end I did not hurt anyone. 

On the way home I tell my wife that I am not going anywhere near her father again until he apologizes for what happened. She told me that her dad never apologizes so I should just get over it. I told her that I am standing firm on this. 

I am not having anything to do with her father until he apologizes. This means things like family vacations and stuff we have planned I am no longing going to any of it. I am done with being treated like crap. 

So, here it is. Am I the asshole for saying I won’t go back around her family without an apology?

Edit: 
My most sincere thanks to everyone that offered constructive criticism and advice. After I had some time to cool off last night, my wife and I talked this morning. I am going to make plans to sit down with FIL, with my wife willing to mediate if needed, and figure out what happened from his point of view. I also want to make sure that he knows I was never and will never be aggressive towards a woman. That I was trying to follow my wife’s instructions and leave the room when he grabbed me and that I am sorry for escalating with him. I’ll also work to make sure he truly understands why I went from 0 to 100 when he got physical with me. 

As for GMIL, I’m just going to take a step back from that situation completely. She’s not taking care of herself and while it upsets my wife, it’s not my business. So I’ll just do my best to support my wife in the situation and I will not be waisting any more energy interacting with GMIL. That’s not to say that I will be rude or disrespectful to her going forward. If I must interact with her I will be cordial and respectful. But mostly I’ll avoid having to interact with her at all, as my wife even agrees that would be for the best. 

Yes I am an asshole to demand an apology. I’m working on fixing the situation as best as I can. And I’ll do my best to keep something like this from happening again."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

So i went over her house wearing the boots not in spite or anything just what I had been wearing today and she’s looks at me and makes a displeased grunting noise. Then we walk into her room and she asks me why I’m wearing them and I tell her because I like them. And I think she’s being very rude about it. So I express my displeasure with her and she tells me don’t wear them ever again. And I just stay silent for a moment. And she’s like well if you don’t agree then you can just leave she says. I tell her I would never tell her what to wear or say that about something she liked. She says but if you did I would listen to you. But I would never ask that because what someone chooses to wear and it makes them happy then who cares. I don’t know why she got so worked up about them then she proceeded to kick me out.

I mentioned that there are boarding places he could go but she said they cant afford it and B couldn't handle it. It's making me feel like an asshole for not wanting to. If it were a long weekend or something we could figure it out but 12 days is too much. 

Some background info: Her dog is crazy scared of everything outside, we can't take him on any walks because he practically chokes himself to death every time. They just let him out in the morning and evening to go potty and he chills around the house all day. He has free reign at their house and he jumps on their couch and bed all day long.

Here’s the problem...my second to youngest wants to get an art degree to become a freelancer. I usually wouldn’t care, since it’s her life, but I care since it will affect whether or not she can pay us back. 

I’m worried that I’m being unsupportive, and overstepping. We loaned to our oldest, but she’s paying us back reliably. I don’t think that I’m playing favorites, but perhaps I am. Then again, our oldest’s career path is one for a relatively well-paying job. 

If she doesn’t pay back, frankly, we’re screwed. We’re not rich, to say the least.

Well, what do you think? Feel free to ask any questions?

Edit; There was a condition that said “You most be likely to be able to pay back”."	Asshole	0	0
c5hwk3	2019-06-26 00:01:04	BeeBopBeth	WIBTA for packing up all of my kitchen items while my roommate is at work?	"Sorry if this is kind of long, TLDR at the bottom :)

&#x200B;

So a bit of backstory:

&#x200B;

I am living in university housing but it's apartment-style. My lease runs through the end of July and I was assigned a random roommate. We had a couple of issues throughout the year but we resolved them and decided to live together again next year. Since the beginning of June or so, her boyfriend has been living with us, since his lease ran out and his new one doesn't begin for another month or so.

&#x200B;

I didn't think this would be an issue in the beginning because he's not a bad guy. I was wrong. They constantly leave the kitchen and living room a mess. They are incredibly loud when they watch tv in the living room, which is partly because the acoustics in our apartment are awful and the walls are paper thin. On top of that, they have almost tripled the amount of garbage and dishes being produced, which are still included in my helping with the chores, despite the fact that I don't really use dishes (long story). Because of this and a lot of reasons, I decided to just move home in July and she is finding her own place. 

&#x200B;

Today was sort of the last straw. I came home from a pretty difficult day at work and all I wanted was a nap and some quiet time. I told roommate this. I was just falling asleep when they got really loud with whatever they were watching on youtube. Like obnoxiously so. Whatever, I'll just try to sleep through it. Then they decide it's time to cook dinner. Because we have one of the heat coil-type stoves, things can fall into it if you're not careful and it will smoke. They don't clean the stove. They start cooking, it starts smoking, and our fire alarm goes off. For a full 15 to 20 minutes.

&#x200B;

So yeah, maybe a dumb reason to be mad, but it's more that it's all been accumulating for the past month, despite my efforts to make the best out of the situation. But here's where my question is. At the beginning of the year, I bought almost 90% of what is in our kitchen, including all of the really nice pots and pans (because I was told that she would reimburse me for half and she never did). WIBTA if I waited until she left for work tomorrow (it is my one day off) and packed up everything in my kitchen that I personally bought and took them to my parent's house for storage? This is partly probably out of pettiness but also I paid a lot for them and don't want them to ruin them because they aren't taking good care of them. My friends and family that I have talked to are backing me up but I still feel like I might be TA here. So I bow to your judgement.

&#x200B;

c5hw10	2019-06-25 23:59:57	AITAThrowaway35	AITA for changing my stance on money with my boyfriend after he moved in?	"Back in July 2017 I met a guy who I fell in love with almost immediately. Things moved fast and before I knew it we were talking about him moving from his home state to a state several hours south where I had bought a new home in April. He had a great job and had some rather expensive obligations in the form of a car, a boat and a jetski. He told me that if he were to move he would need to sell these things to be comfortable and contribute to the house while he started his business and I agreed. I told him I didn't want him to change his lifestyle at all because of the move and that he could contribute when he was able. Cue the night in December that he drove down 10 hours to move in and I had been cleaning the house and going through paperwork to make room for him and in doing so pulled all the house bills out so he could see them and begin preparing on how best to contribute. He had sold the jetski already but the boat and the expensive weekend car he had not. It took him 6 months to sell the car and he had to pay $19k to the bank to get out of the loan since it was brand new and really expensive. He still has the boat although it's been on the market the whole time. A few months pass and we had a sit down about money where I told him the reason we weren't having sex as much was because he wasn't really contributing. I also had offered him 10% if he sold my old car and when he did I gave it to him but I felt like he shouldn't have accepted it since all he was buying was food and booze for the house, paying the internet bill and watching my dog which used to cost me $400 a month for when I traveled for work but it didn't seem like enough to me and I began building a resentment towards him for it. He gave me that money back but the fact he initially took it bothered me.

My job then gave me a huge promotion and I decided to sell my new home and move 10 hours north, virtually where he had come from but a bit west of it. In the process of the sale he payed a few random bills and did somethings around the house to help with the sale since he is handy. He decided to move with me to the new state and in the process had to restart his business and agreed to pay his share of rent on a sliding scale I came up with since the expensive car had sold. During the move I was paid a bunch of money for the move itself by my employer and we bought a big trailer to move everything but it wasn't quite big enough so we rented a Uhaul to fit the last bit of stuff. 90% of the stuff was mine, I packed it all but he loaded it all in the trailer with the help of two guys, one I paid for and the other he paid for. He was really sour about the move since he had to restart and take a few days off work to make the drive and do the move itself. A few months after getting to the new place he sold the trailer and gave me the money I put towards the trailer.

c5huwu	2019-06-25 23:57:23		AITA if I don't bring my girlfriend with me this weekend?	"So my girlfriend and have been dating for 1.5 years with a brief break up last October. We had been going through a rough patch in which I felt we were not working. By bettering our communication things have largely worked out.

This breakup happened a day after going away with a certain group of friends which includes a girl who I have hooked up with in the past I'm college. We got back together and later went into the city that weekend. Inside a pair of my pants were a pair of women's underwear. I truly have no idea how they got in there besides the fact that everyone's crap was in the living room of the Airbnb that weekend and stuff got mixed up. She sees this and I convinced her that nothing had happened, which it didn't, and all was well until the next time I went to see this group of friends.

I wanted to go alone and she was uncomfortable bc she thinks they are the reason that I broke up with her or that I hooked up with the female friend and that's why I broke up with her. She now's feels like I'm trying to hide her when I really just want to hangout with my two guy friends that I never get to see.

This weekend is one of those male friend's birthdays and when she offered to drive because i wasn't feeling 100% this week. I said it was really okay I think I would be fine she was upset with me because she feels insecure about the whole thing because the last few times (3) i saw them I didn't bring her and she feels like either they don't like her or I'm hiding her.

That female friend isn't even going to be there so we seem to be at a stalemate. I understand the optics and insecurities aren't great from her perspective but I just want to spend sometime with friends I hardly ever see. Am I the asshole for not wanting to bring my girlfriend?

I feel like I'm being treated as if I did cheat on her."	Asshole	1	0

c5hrx1	2019-06-25 23:50:30		AITA for not wanting to be friends?	"This happened a few years ago, but I figure why not find out once and for all if I was the TA.

So I met this woman in university and we became school friends. Eg. chatted in class, helped each other with homework, etc. She had recently moved to this part of the country and did not have many friends or family members close by.

After we no longer had classes together we would occasionally text and see each other maybe 1-3 times a year. I considered her a friend but not necessarily a close friend.

During the whole time I knew her she was was dating a guy who I did not like. She would tell me about their relationship and he sounded verbally abusive and like a total loser. He was a stoner, conspiracy theorist, and just generally kinda lazy. I never understood why she was with him but whatever, not my life.

Eventually they became pregnant by accident. He seemed only mildly better a father than boyfriend. She would complain about him whenever we hung out.

Then, she got pregnant again... More complaints about her boyfriend and how he doesn't bring his A game as a father and partner. She asked me to be the emergency contact on her eldest child's daycare form. I assume it's because she doesn't know any other responsible adults that live nearby and she doesn't have many friends, so I say sure.

Then, she gets pregnant again. Now, I am thinking ""why the hell are you still making babies with this total loser?"" I don't think bringing more kids into a bad situation is a good plan. I keep my trap shut though because I know it's not my place to say anything.

At this point I am pregnant as well with my husband and I just don't want to invest anymore time in this friendship and listen to complaints about someone she should have obviously dumped years ago. I figure it will be easy, since we text maybe 5 times a year and see each other 1-2 times per year by this point.

She contacts me soon after and tries to arrange to hang out, I take a while to get back and say I am busy. She directly asks me via text what is up and says I have been distant. So I text her back and decide to be honest, I basically tell her that I haven't been feeling the friendship and I have limited time so want to focus on my family and a few close friends.""

Then she gets pissed and tells me something like ""what the hell, I thought we were close...I guess not! Thanks for letting me know that I have to find an emergency contact for [child]??!""

I was kinda bothered by that last bit because I would definitely pick up her kid if the daycare called me whether we are friends or not. I honestly, only agreed in the first place because I thought she had no one else to do it.

c5hqxh	2019-06-25 23:48:11	Muffinman1111112	AITA for leaving less than 15% tip at a restaurant?	"No one really said I was, but as someone who’s served before, I always have this cognitive dissonance, and I’m just curious if it’s an A-hole move. 

There is this restaurant that I go to quite frequently. Maybe like twice a month. I get the same thing every time- a burrito supreme with no meat, add beans. Every freaking time I go, they mess it up! Like multiple times in one visit, even! Even with a different server every time. 

I feel like it’s the servers job to check to see if the correct food is going out. Most of the time, I send it back, then I have to sit there, wait for my burrito, everyone finishes, and I have to scarf my food down because everyone is waiting on me. The first and second time it happened, whatever, the third time it happened, I was frustrated, but still sent it back. The third time, I thought, you know what, I’ll just sit here and eat it and leave a crappy tip and maybe that’ll knock some sense into these people because me sending my food back every other time didn’t work. So I left like $3.20 on a $25 bill. 

EDIT- YOU CAN SEE THE CONTENTS FLOWING OUT OF THE BURRITO! Otherwise, I wouldn’t even be mad! 😂

c5hqwl	2019-06-25 23:48:06	throwaway-saturn	AITA for not adding my boyfriend to a group chat?	"So my boyfriend (25M) and I (24F) have been together for a long time now and we usually spend every weekend together. This last weekend was a festivity here where we live, and we thought about going to the beach on Sunday to celebrate it with my roommates and friends. 

&#x200B;

On Friday they created a group chat to talk about it, and they added me, but not my boyfriend (I guess they planned me to add him). I didn't add him straight away because nobody was chatting and he doesn't get along with some of the people who were on it. Later that day, I sent him a voice message telling him about how I was feeling kind of low, and towards the end I mention the group chat. I told him that I hadn't added him yet because nobody was talking and that if he wanted me to add him he only had to tell me. He answered to some of the stuff I had told him on the voice message, but he didn't say a thing about the chat so I thought he didn't really care about it. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to Sunday afternoon when he asked me ""Which beach are we planning on going?"", and I sent him a screenshot of the group chat where they were discussing it. He jokingly said something about not being on the chat, but we kept on talking as usual. In the end I wasn't feeling good and I decided I should stay at home. We played Stardew Valley together that night and he seemed fine while we were talking via Skype. However, once we turned off the computer and he sent me a goodnight text I had a feeling he was not okay, so I asked him if he was fine. He told me he felt let down and neglected, and that it was my fault for not adding him to the chat. He's been distant ever since. I already said sorry and that I thought he had listened to my voice message. I never meant to make him feel that way.

c5hp67	2019-06-25 23:44:10	falehorserider	WIBTA If I reported my roommate for food stamp fraud?	"So I have a roommate who collects 190 dollars a month in food stamps. The thing is, when he went on food stamps he was homeless and easily granted the food assistance. However, when you sign up for food stamps you are required to notify the office if you have a change in employment so they can adjust the amount accordingly, and failure to do so could result in having to repay the monthly stipend.

Well my roommate got a full time job about four months ago and is still collecting food stamps. He never told the office that he got a job because he would surely lose his monthly stipend. He even tried to talk me into doing the same thing he did. I told him no way I'm not that stupid.

Would I be the asshole if I called up the department of economic security and told them he has had a job for months and is intentionally not notifying them just to get free money?

Edit 1: the roommate makes  $750 every two weeks for a total of $1500 a month. His monthly bills consist of $240 (rent) and $30 (phone) for a total of $270, leaving him with  $1230 to buy what ever he needs.

Edit 2: I should mention my reason for considering this in the first place. My roommate started a passive aggressive war when we moved in together. I have done my best not to get involved, but this last weekend he upped his ante. At this point I'm ready to drop the bomb and end it, but in all actually it would probably only make things worse. Which leads me to edit 3.

Edit 3: I'm not going to report him because after reading all of your replies I've realized he will inevitably get caught come tax time. The fight has already been won."	Asshole	0	0
c5hp3z	2019-06-25 23:44:03	sillykitty6	AITA for snapping at my mom that no flower is constantly in bloom	"My mom got an orchids plant for mothers day from my brother she put me incharge of watering it  and now the flowers are slowly falling off, but the stem looks fine. it's coming out of it's bloom. I told her 2 time that the type of orchids has a bloom period of 2-3 months and we don't know how long that orchid was in bloom when she got it. She has now continually blamed me for it getting root rot and that's why it's ""dieing,"" and that this shows why I'm irresponsible and all sorts of stuff. I snapped at her and told her that if she's such a good gardener then why it her garden  over run with weeds and her flowers are on the ground turning into dirt. She used this to bring up a seasonal plant I had that just died and said that was another example because that plant was dead too and now I'm killing the orchids my brother had gotten her. I stormed off at that point and yelled ""seasonal and perennial, look at the stems your orchids fucking alive and thriving considering this cave you keep it in"" 

The room she has it in gets vary little light and with minimal lighting even from the lights In the room. I've been sneeking it into my room where theirs grate sun when it was starting to droop. so it doesn't die from lack of sun. She took this as me trying to steel it. 
She claims she's a grate gardener and has a green thumb when I've been the one keeping things together on this front. Her garden got all the weed filled and I tried to help and, She freaked when I pulled a lavender plant that was yellow on the ground the other day, it probably died from the weeds choking it out.  

No matter what happened I probably shouldn't have cussed her out about an orchid but I hate how she pulls this responsibility crap she didn't teach me any house hold choirs she just yelled at me that I needed to do them and eventually my brother taught me.  I started learning how to garden due to my doctor suggesting a grow some medicinal  herbs due to curtain allergies, my mom took this as a chance to get me to clean out her garden she hasent touched for 2 years and when I did help She just got pissed at me, I'm doing grate with a basil plant i got from my a friend and I'm trying to convince her to let me get a water mint so I can use it as an ant acid but she keeps putting declarative plants that just give me sneeze fits over the herds I started doing this for. The only reason I agreed to the orchids is because their my favorite flower and I didn't want to watch it die.

Sorry if this is confusing with my writing skills English may as well be my second language lol.

"I'm a college student who is working for the summer and desperately trying to save up some money for the next semester. I have an unfortunate 6-week gap between apartment leases that I originally planned to stay with a friend during. However a couple weeks ago she had a family emergency and her parents ended up moving into her spare room, so I no longer am able to stay. She was extremely apologetic about it. Totally understandable, shit happens and she gave me a few weeks notice to sort my housing situation out. I couldn't find any subleases within my budget so I sent out a general ""does anyone have a spare couch I can crash on for five weeks"" status on facebook to see if anyone would be able to help me out. My aunt messaged me to say that she's been paying my cousin's apartment lease for the summer but he's living at home so she would talk to him about letting me stay at his apartment. He agreed and everything was settled, I just needed to get his key. Well, today, four days before my lease is set to end, he messaged me very late at night and told me he doesn't want me staying in his room because he and his girlfriend never moved their belongings out of it. I woke up at 6 am for work to find this message and had a  panic attack while taking my shower. Moving home is not an option for me because I have PTSD and going home severely triggers my PTSD, it is very bad. 

My boyfriend lives about two hours away from my college town and his family has offered to take me in for the five weeks which is extremely kind. However it does mean that I will have to quit my job and it is unlikely that I will be able to quickly find a new job (given that it often takes one or two weeks to start a new job and I'm only going to be there for five weeks). I will be missing out on hundreds of dollars of income because of this. I'm extremely fortunate that my boyfriend's family is able and willing to support me but a big part of me feels that I was really fucked over by my cousin. I don't want to sound entitled because I was given the opportunity to live somewhere for free in an area with high rent costs.

c5hlp7	2019-06-25 23:36:34		AITA for stopping my friend buying condoms	"A bit of context. I had a friend called J (F) and a friend called K (M). They were both pretty close to me at the time and I introed them for the first time. They seemed to hit it off and J and K became close and started hanging out without me. K slowly developed feelings for J after a few months, however J said she wasn't ready for a relationship. J and I had a bit of a falling out around that time due to an argument about putting K and my other friend circle before her. J rejected K, however in the next month she would go on multiple tinder dates and ask him to save her from multiple of these dates. K would drop anything he was doing to go see her. 

Fast forward to a few weeks later. I have been talking to K about the situation being unhealthy and he should back away from her until he is less infatuated with her. J recently got a boyfriend just 1 week prior and my other close friend in the same circle of friends let's say J, told K she had a boyfriend. He was heartbroken, however K ditches our friend circle meeting and went to hang out with her instead on this day. K would always say 'she's just a friend' and deny his feelings like that. J texts me what K tells him, which is 'I bought condoms for her boyfriend' for their 1week anniversary. I was infuriated that she would have the littlest respect to buy condoms in front of him. I immediately reply to K and ask him if he bought condoms for her and the context behind it. J is mad I sent that to K, but I sent it immediately before J told me not to send it. But even then, as a friend I feel as though my natural instinct should be to help my friend from this situation and I would be a worse friend if I didn't talk to K about it. K is also furious at me knowing about it and talking to him about J being unhealthy and he thinks I am creating a rift between their friendship.

c5hk0z	2019-06-25 23:32:53	Batheir	WIBTA if I told my mom she's part of the problem?	"Sorry for the length.


First off let me tell you that I love my mom, she's great but I'm also really frustrated. She complains about how we do nothing in the house and how it's always messy.

She's not working right now due to having surgery on her hand. She's been not working since January and it hurts our money situation- she gets money from the government due to the injury but its only about half her wage. Obviously her health is important to us and while it sucks she's not working we understand. 

However, her hand is healed to a point where she can use or now-  it's not 100 percent but she can drive, draw with it, play video games, grip and grab etc. We don't expect her to go back to work because it's a fairly physical job and it could hurt her healing process. 

But she does minimal housework. Like, she'll cook dinner maybe 3 nights a week, She doesn't do dishes whatsoever and by the time my brother and I get home there's a massive hoard of them. She falls behind on laundry to the point of us never having clean towels etc. I do my own laundry and have since I was 12, but she hasn't taught my brother how to do his own and complains about it. The floors are always messy with food and stuff. 

My dad helps out too but he works almost 7 days a week to make sure we have enough money.

I've been working 25 hour weeks while finishing my last year in highschool maintaining a 90+ average. In May I had 3 IB subject examinations, 8 papers total while still working. So I'm not home until 10-11pm for 4 days a week, eating there and making my own wage so I can save up for University. I have 4 exams I'm doing right now as well to finish off highschool. 

I understand I'm a part of the household, but I keep my areas clean. My room. Our basement/basement bathroom. My own laundry. I do help out in the kitchen when I can as well, but it's been really overwhelming trying to keep up with stuff and seeing that the only time the kitchen is clean is when I clean it and then having my mom complain and yell at me for it while she literally is at home all day doing nothing except maybe a load or two of laundry that isn't even mine (I wash my own towels as well) 

She also complains about money to me and how they're struggling but it's a little frustrating. She and my dad smoke cigarettes and vape, and they smoke weed too (legal where I am) regularly. I try not to be a burden, hence my working, and pay for most of my own stuff, but she won't stop complaining to me about me my dad and my brother. 

So, WIBTA If I told her that a lot of the problems she's complaining about are because of her?


TLDR: Mom had surgery (healed) and is currently not working. Complains about the house not being clean but doesn't do much to clean it, instead blames it on me (working 25 hours a week in highschool while doing exams) and dad (works 60 hours a week trying to support us) while complaining about money while she smokes cigarettes and weed."

c5hjdv	2019-06-25 23:31:38	yoshidabest57	AITA for arguing with my friend over sleeping?	"TBH I couldn't think of a good title but whatever.

&#x200B;

This was a couple of months ago, I have this Discord server, with me, my cousin, and my trans friend (We'll call him Z)

&#x200B;

Me and my cousin were texting each other on Instagram DM's, We were really tired and said GN to each other, I check my discord before going to sleep, since it was 2 AM, I see Z typed 2 new messages, saying ""nvm,"" and, ""it's not important, I deleted it."" I reply, ""What was it?"", and instead of reposting it, he typed, ""I deleted it."" I was, of course, confused, replying, ""Can't you just repost it?"" He replies, ""No, it's gone.""

&#x200B;

The rest of the conversation went like this:

&#x200B;

Me: I'm sorry, It's 2 AM, and I was trying to sleepZ: You should know I can't sleep at nightMe: Why can't you repost it?

Z: Nobody cared

Me: Nobody is awakeZ: I'M AWAKE BECAUSE I CAN'T SLEEPMe: OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T BC THAT'S NORMAL

&#x200B;

Now, this offended Z

&#x200B;

Z: F\[redacted\] you

Me: You're not making any sense

Z: I can't sleep because of ADHD

Z: It's health problems

Z: Unlike you ""normal"" people

Me: I didn't say normal people

Me: Nobody is normal

Me: However, sleeping is a normal activity

&#x200B;

Z then left the server after my cousin stood up for me

&#x200B;

AITA?

&#x200B;

PS. Don't call Z the A-Hole, He's very sensitive, and is sorry for doing this, we're still friends. I just wanna know if I did an A-hole move.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I understand Z was the asshole, but don't full on ridicule him, he has changed and is a lot less sensitive and doesn't get as offended. He is sensitive because he had a rough childhood. Z is a great person now, he just did a wrong thing, I was just wondering if I messed up back then."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5hjc9	2019-06-25 23:31:34		AITA for going to a wedding when the bride hates me?	"You read the title. Friend’s bride can’t stand me and I know it but I got an invite. She straight up tries to avoid seeing me. She’s never been able to take jokes about herself and I’m not one for political correctness. For example I like to joke that she’s a nurse not a doctor and she’s got this big stick up her ass over me telling people she didn’t really go to med school. I’ve always been a love him or hate him kind of guy and that’s my personality, not planning on changing it for some female.

AITA for going to the wedding anyway? Girl I’m casually seeing says I shouldn’t want to go to her party and mess with her day if she hates me so much. But clearly only one of the people getting married wants me out, and the other one I used to be pretty damn close to way back when. Not so much these days, probably because of the girl. Lol.

c5hj5s	2019-06-25 23:31:10	BCayer	AITA for asking people to quite down while my baby slept?	"
Went to my in-laws for a dinner party which we were invited to so that a few family members could meet/ see our 4 month old daughter. At dinner time baby was asleep in my arms while I sat in the living room which is an open floor concept connected to the dinning room. The conversation began to get loud so I asked my husband to ask them to quiet down a bit. When my husband asked them to quiet down they laughed at us and said we were rude. I mentioned we could leave, and one of the family members said to leave then. So we gathered our stuff and began to leave at which point my mother in law ran to close the door to prevent us from leaving, she then began a screaming match in front of my daughter which lasted for over an hour. So are we the assholes for asking people to quiet down while my daughter slept?

c5hi5y	2019-06-25 23:28:54	hella_cious	WIBTA for telling my sister’s friends to be more respectful or they can’t come over anymore?	"I’ve had a shit day. It started with sister’s two thirteen year old friends, A and B, walking in on me changing. They wanted to hold my pet rats, and I had to explicitly tell them to get out because I didn’t have pants on. Do parents not teach kids to respect others’ privacy anymore? Oddly enough, I (18 M) don’t feel comfortable having young girls watch me change.

Later on that day, my sister brought over another friend, we’ll call him C. B straight up said to C “Yeah, they have cleaners come every Wednesday and look how gross their house is already.” This had me LIVID. My house isn’t very clean, because I’m the one taking care of a five person household while my mother is bed ridden and my father works 80hr weeks. I almost told them to be more respectful then, but I had to go take care of my mom.

Then, maybe half an hour later, I hear laughing and yelling from my room, and my sister yells “A rat is dead!” I go upstairs and see my sister and her friends all laughing while poking my dead pet rat. After I took the rat out to check on it (Yes, very dead. She was the runt of the litter and had been sick for a few days), they all fucked off and my sister left me to handle our dead pet, while insisting I give it a proper burial instead of throwing it away like I had planned. (It’s a rat. You clearly don’t care about it and don’t take care of it, so how about you either bury it or let me handle it how I please?)

I’m planning that next time she plans to have them over she either has to tell them to be more respectful or I will, and that if they don’t change their behavior they will no longer be welcome in our home.

I don’t think I would be the asshole here, but I knowing if strangers on the internet agree with me would be very helpful in standing strong against my sister’s inevitable bitch fit when I tell her this. So, Reddit, WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5hhyq	2019-06-25 23:28:27	MobileCustomer	AITA for kicking my Aunt and Uncle out of my wedding	"Background: My uncle has a nasty temper and is verbally abusive, his yelling and berating me caused me to struggle with my self esteem throughout my life. His wife isn't any better, nor are his kids. They allowed them bully me throughout my childhood: I have cerebral palsy, and while it's not really obvious now, when I was a kid I had a speech impediment and I walked like a baby deer. He let his kids call me things like ret\*\*ed and Bambi. When I turned 18, I had a falling out with all of them. I don't remember exactly what triggered it, but the end result was me calling my aunt & uncle abusive and saying they should be ashamed of themselves--in front of several dozen friends and family at a BBQ. It went about as well as one would expect. They said I wasn't allowed at anymore gatherings or anything until I apologized to them. I told them that they owed me an apology for years of bullying. 

&#x200B;

My mom has maintained a relationship with my aunt and uncle, and has held onto hope at our reconciliation. As of current, neither party has ever been willing to apologize. The difference being that I'm respectful to them but I don't care and I've moved on, and  they can't seem to keep my name out of their mouths, and they try to stir up drama with the situation however they can. My aunt has actually texted me several times asking me to apologize to her, but not apologizing herself. I've ignored them. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward: About a month ago, my mom ran into aunt and they got to talking. My mom ended up inviting my aunt and uncle to my wedding. She tells me it's important to her, it's her brother, blah blah blah, I'm a little annoyed but whatever, I tell her that's fine. 

So the day of my wedding roles around. Ceremony was beautiful, get to the reception and my husband and I are walking around to the tables greeting our guests. We get to my aunt and uncle's table. I greet them warmly and thank them for coming, like I said, I'm polite to them, I'm not trying to stir up shit--especially not at my own wedding. My aunt looks at me and says loudly ""Seems a little fake of you to be so cheerful to us. If you really feel that way, it would be nice to have an apology for what you said at the BBQ to Bob and I, it was very out of line and very hurtful."" and then she looks at me and then looks around the table at other family members seated. I looked at her dead in the eyes and very quietly said ""Auntie, y'all gotta go"" and my husband and his best man escorted them out. They didn't leave quietly, they wanted to dig through the pile to find their gift, they tried to triangulate my mom to let them stay, it was ugly. My aunt started crying. 

&#x200B;

People are saying she shouldn't have said that but we should have just let it go. But I felt like she wasn't going to stop there, I didn't want her there to begin with especially not spreading drama. I just didn't want to deal. Her invitation was precarious, and she ruined it herself imo."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5he98	2019-06-25 23:20:18	SakuOtaku	AITA for losing some respect for another classmate's writing?	"Last semester I took my first college writing class in an effort to write more since I hope to make a career out of it one day. 

In the class there were about a handful of people who I would consider to be great writers. One of these people was a girl in my writing club, who I'll call K. I ultimately respected K- not only did she give really good and constructive feedback and had gay characters which let me feel more comfortable sharing my works with gay characters without feeling like the odd-one-out in class, but her stories were really good. 

When we were put into small group workshops I read K's story and I loved it a lot. The premise seemed so original and creative, and it happened to be one of my favorite genres.

Then came the larger class workshop.

For some background, I've heard her talk about Wattpad before and that she uses Tumblr. I use Tumblr too, which is what led to the next part.

The larger workshop involved sharing with the whole class. I forgot when I realized it but K's story reminded me of a popular tumblr post. When asked by someone in class what inspired her to write her piece, she said her inspiration was wondering ""what if _ were like_"".  But after class, I went up to K and said ""Hey, your story reminded me of one Tumblr post-"" and then she told me ""Yeah that's where I got it from.""

This by itself didn't really rub me the wrong way. K didn't plagarize, and the OP of the post said it was okay if people used it as a prompt. It was well-written anyhow and had original elements, so I just figured she needed a break near the end of the semester. Besides, we spent the first half of the semester writing with prompts.

But a few weeks later when I was on Tumblr someone reblogged an old but popular post. Lo and behold, it was the premise of the K's first workshop story.

With that  I lost some respect for this classmate's writing. Her writing itself was still really good, but the fact that her really original-seeming concepts were recycled from popular posts online kind of made her writing seem lazier to me and more fan-fictiony. Fan Fiction has its place, but between the teacher stating at one point to someone that he would rather us write original stories, and the fact that for me a big part of writing is trying to be creative/create something original, it just feels kind of... lower effort?

AITA or at least a snob for liking K's writing less after finding out she based at least two of her stories off of Tumblr posts instead of coming up with her own concepts (and for being a bit critical over a school-based writing class), or am I justified in having a lesser opinion on the works she shared because they aren't original?

**TL;DR: Found out a classmate used popular Tumblr posts as story concepts in my writing class. I originally really loved her stories but after finding out she did this at least twice, I lost some respect for her writing. AITA?**"	No A-holes here	0	0
c5hdy5	2019-06-25 23:19:33	timothy_green	AITA For Wanting to Light of Fireworks This Year?	"I know the title sounds a bit stupid but hear me out.  I live in the U.S. in a fairly rural area and am currently in high school.

I own 5 acres, and each of my neighbors has 5 acres, and the ones across form us and next to us have horses.  I’ll call the one next door Rachel.  Rachel is *super* uptight, and when we lit off fireworks last year, she ran out midway through and started screaming at us that we were scaring the horses.  Mind you, we specifically bought tame fireworks: no mortars, just some small firecrackers, bottle rockets, fountains, and a few roman candles.  My dad basically told her to piss off, but 20 minutes later he told us to pack it up.  We were pretty disappointed because this was the first year in 8 years we had got to light them off, and I had wanted to just stand up to Rachel.  The horses really didn’t seem scared (they were a few hundred yards away in a barn), and our neighbor across the way actually came out and watched the fireworks with us, saying that her horses were completely fine.  Rachel has a long history of being a crappy neighbor, but this really pissed me off.

My dad said that we would light off the rest of the fireworks over the next week, but we never did.  Since then, he has been adamant that it would be rude and inconsiderate to light the fireworks off this year.  I don’t know why the change of heart, but considering that Rachel has only ever been a total bitch to us, I don’t really have any sympathy.

I’ve been trying to find a friends house to light fireworks off at this year, but to no avail yet.  I was talking to my parents about possibly doing it here, and my mom asked my dad if he could talk to Rachel’s husband and see if she will be out of town on the 4th, as she has been out of town for a few weeks now. 

When she proposed this, my dad got really angry and started going on a rant about how fireworks are rude and inconsiderate.  I get his to an extent, but I think this is a bit ridiculous.  We live in the sticks, in America: fireworks should be a given, no?  I mean, am I the only one who wants to light off fireworks?

I guess what I’m getting at here is: am I an asshole for being so persistent about this, or is my dad being ridiculous?  Thanks for the help Reddit!"	No A-holes here	0	0
c5hd9f	2019-06-25 23:18:03	vanduran5	AITA for kicking out a single mother?	"NOTE: This story isn't about me. It's about my uncle and takes place in 2001-2002.

My mom and I moved to the US a week after the 9/11 attacks. She was recently divorced from my biological dad. Her sister (I'll call her S) and her husband (I'll call him U) offered let us stay at their place rent-free for a year until my mom could get back on her feet. My mom was 24 when she had me and usually had my older cousins or my aunts watch me while she went out partying and SOMETIMES looking for a job. S had a son who I got along very well with (He was a year old at the time). We were like brothers and he usually punches me in the arm nowadays (that's how he shows he loves me).

I don't know how S and U met (I never really bothered to ask), but I do know that U has been working hard every day of his life. He grew up poor in Mexico, but after years and years of blood, sweat, and tears, he got enough money to move to the US and start up an Italian restaurant (still open BTW).

However, S got pregnant again and this time, she was expecting twins (a boy and girl). S and U had enough money from the restaurant's success that they bought a big house with a pool and hot tub in the backyard (Tub is gone due to a plumbing failure and has since been replaced with a bird bath; the pool opens every summer). My mom said ""I'm moving in with you guys too!"", but U said there were only enough rooms for S, U, their son, and their upcoming twins. My mom got upset, tried pleading with S to let her move in, but they both said no.

To this day, my mom refuses to even be near U (The rest of my family loves him for being the ultimate ""MAH MOM"" Repellant). She never appreciates that S gave diapers and food that were for her son to me or that my oldest cousin (14 at the time) always watched me, her brother, and my other cousin for free.

She doesn't know that U works harder than Masahiro Sakurai (creator of Smash Bros and the hardest working man in Japan) to support his household. S does help with bills sometimes, but mostly cleans, cooks, and takes care of the kids. U now manages a food truck along with the restaurant, working so hard and so long that he takes medication to manage his stress. He uses the money to buy iPhones for himself and his family, his two sons who both need glasses, braces for all three kids, and you know how expensive daughters can be. He considers his wife and kids as ""the love of his life"" (yeah, he calls all of them that.)

My mom on the other hand, met a guy at one of her jobs who adopted us into his house and family. We're fine now, but I still keep questioning who is the asshole here. She raised me to believe that U just ""kicked us out for no reason."" If you wanna know more about my mom, check my post history.

c5hd0a	2019-06-25 23:17:26	tiredofthisdamndebt	WIBTA if I asked my in-laws to help pay some of the debt they accumulated on my partner’s credit card they forced him to get in the first place?	"UPDATE:  My partner and I discussed the situation and decided he would confront his parents. He made (what we think is) a very reasonable request that they pay the minimum payment for a year or 2 as a show of good faith.  The minimum payment is currently around $50–we talked the bank about getting it down to that a couple years ago. 
They immediately got defensive and claimed they can’t do even that because they’re “a month behind on rent.” 
Unsurprisingly, there was no indication of future intent to help pay this debt once. They definitely hoped to get away with it and we are now sure that they are financially abusing their other child as well. Scumbags.

So I (F/26) live with my partner (M/28) and we have 2 kids together, yadda yadda yadda.

When we first met, he told me his parents were really controlling of his finances and I didn’t think much of it until I pried further. It turned out since the day he graduated from high school, his parents (one of whom is on ODSP and the other was unemployed by choice at the time and still is an alcoholic) forced him to not pursue a college education and instead turn his part time job at a high end grocery store to full time. 

They did this so he could pay all the rent, groceries, and other things like take out and fancy cable and Internet packages while he was living at home and forbade him from moving out (until we dated for awhile and convinced him that this was super unhealthy.) He worked so many hours a week he barely even had time to himself to have a social life, meet new people, save for him future, etc. 

Anyway, part of the financial control they had over him was forcing him to apply for a credit card. They then forced him to take cash advance after cash advance on the card because they wanted nice things like TVs and to buy his younger brother an XBox One and crap like that. 

They kept doing this until it maxed out his credit card and then told him he’s stuck with the bill. He’s been unable to keep up with more than the minimum payments because of unforeseen financial circumstances we’re going through.
Because of this, his credit score has tanked and it’s really difficult to repair.

So I ask you, Reddit, am I the asshole for wanting his folks to help with at least half the credit card balance?
Edit: when he moved out, they let him have only 1 of the 2 TVs."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Some 6 years ago, my husband's narcissist mother cut me out of her life - again. It's a pattern; she's got a long history of throwing these tantrums, cutting ties, and then doing the on-again, off-again thing. Usually with boyfriends; this time, with me.

About a month later, she cut out husband over a spat about her recently-born-again-ness. It was the first time I've ever seen husband stand his ground against her. His mother ended the phone call - I could hear her screaming, furious - ""I GUESS I'LL JUST NEVER TALK TO YOU AGAIN!!!""

Over the years, husband has begun to resolve some long-standing anxiety and self-esteem issues. We've started our own business, moved several times, moved our business into our home. I can't stress enough how good for us being no-contact has been.

A couple years ago, MIL just...showed up one day. No idea how she found us. Husband spoke with her - very briefly - and sent her on her way. No contact info exchanged.

We've moved since, but it didn't stop MIL from showing up two weeks ago. Again, how she found us, no idea. Which I think is fucking terrifying!! I have started having nightmares about her showing up and dismantling our hard work, our stability. Wrecking everything we've fought so hard for. The panic has started to creep into my days. Every time I leave the house, I'm terrified she will be here when I come home. She keeps popping up, when she shouldn't have any way of knowing where to find us.

I told husband I want her to be legally precluded from setting foot on our property by filing the stalking protective order. I told him he can have a relationship with her, if he has to, outside our home. I think that's a monumentally terrible idea, but that's his choice.

Husband said he won't file the protective order.

I need this, for my own piece of mind. I need this, to protect us and everything we have from the corrosive narcissist who is back, again, trying to bully her way into husband's life. She didn't come to apologize - she came to ACCEPT MY APOLOGY???

Fuck right off with that noise. MIL - **you** cut *us* out. Stay GONE.

I remarried around a year ago. She had a then 44-year-old daughter, who was living in her house. It hasn’t changed. Why is she living here rent-free at 45, you might ask? Because she’s a part-time freelancer. Meaning that she spends two hours a day on making charm bracelets that cost $5. You’re probably asking, you’re exaggerating, right? Well, yes I am. She usually spends four hours on week days and zero on weekends. So on average, almost 3 hours per day.

I wouldn’t even ask here, but I have a 21-year-old who lives with us, also rent-free. In my opinion, there’s a major difference. My daughter works during the summer, 12 hours a day (including weekends), in order to pay off her student loans (she’s on her way to law school). Even with that alone, she works 4 times as much as my stepdaughter does. Also, she’s had 3 years. Her stepsister had 27. (Counting since they were 18.)

I’m worried that I’m not being supportive enough, and that “I’m expecting wayyyyy too much” (from my sister-in-law). On one hand, she had student loan debt that took a lot of time to pay off. On the other hand, it’s her fault for getting a degree that she never needed, and for working 20 hours a week to pay off. Not to be unsupportive, but did she really need a degree to make charm bracelets? F***ing charm bracelets?  Then again, I’m might very well be “not supportive enough”, considering what I just typed.

I’m also concerned that because it’s her house, maybe I shouldn’t ask her to kick someone out of her own home. On the other hand, I’m paying my share of the bills, and her daughter is draining her finances (we have separate accounts).  If she continues, she might not be able to retire by 80, which is rather concerning. In order to afford it, she will have to downsize consideringly. I mean her living in a one-bedroom apartment. Which means that she’ll have to kick her daughter, unless they’re going to share a room. Even then, her daughter would have to pay her share of bills, which mean that she’ll have to get a more well-paying job.

"My partner is a very selfless person with time and money, but is very possessive over his belongings. He just recently bought a grill and said as soon as he got home with it to me, that no one is allowed to use it because he doesn't want anyone to mess it up.  It is a fairly nice grill. 

&#x200B;

I said to him that it is rude to flat out say no one can use it, and that it has the potential to be a shared item in the house like furniture, dishes, cookware, television etc.... I said it would be better if he laid down ground rules for using it/how to take care of it THEN if someone messes up, for people not to be able to use it. 

&#x200B;

He thinks its ridiculous and since he bought it with his own money he should be able to say who can and can't use it. I brought up the idea of it being like pots and pans (one of our roommates has a nice cookware set that is close to the price of his grill that we all use). He said he's fine using his own pots and pans, and thinks I'm being rude for saying he should allow people to use the stuff he bought?

c5h642	2019-06-25 23:02:53	SlightDragonfly	AITAH for charging non-residents full price admission?	"Hi, so don't know for sure if this is the right subreddit (completely open to suggestions), but this is bothering me and my coworkers, and this was the best sub we could think of.

So we work at a touristy location in a large American city. We have local appeal: decent membership prices, free community tickets, special community days, and evening events specifically tailored for our area. Yet in the past, we've had locals be pretty upset about the price, and I honestly don't blame them. It's gosh darn expensive.

When upper management decided to raise the prices again a few months ago, they added a local discount because they felt that locals would be even more upset. This has helped local support for our attraction, as locals have stopped harassing us as much about price (mostly psychology because the price didn't change), and my team and I thought that everything would be fine.

 The problem is that now, people from out of town are coming in with locals, and expecting to get the discounted price because they are with a local. We deny this, because the discount is designed to get more locals to visit our attraction, not the tourists (which management thinks we get plenty of anyway). In the end, we end up charging the locals in the group the local price, and the tourists the non-resident price. Eight out of ten times, the non-residents are shocked that we don't give everyone the discount, and ask if the resident pays, if we'll give the whole group the discount. We still say no, as the ticket price covers the people in the group, not the person who's paying. This isn't an isolated incident either. I personally get this ten to twenty times, at least, on a SLOW day. They tend to act like we're the assholes because we won't give non-residents the discounts.

This has been baffling my team and I because we think that this is the normal way to run this discount, but everyone is acting like it isn't. So reddit, my coworkers and I need to know, are we the assholes?


Edit: I do not hold any real authority at the attraction. My coworkers and I posted this so that we could get unbiased third party opinions on the policy. I sadly can’t change the policy, only make suggestions to my boss. We are also not what you’d consider “small”. Trying not too give out too much detail, but let’s just say it’s several buildings and many staff. We have an executive board. Sorry for the confusion!"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5h5so	2019-06-25 23:02:22		AITA for being upset over being blocked on Facebook?	"My sister (19F) and I(22F) used to have a really close knit relationship. We use to be eachother's best friend at one point. However, at the time, I had a crush on one of her close guy friends. I told her and even asked her if it was okay if we dated. She said she didn't care. Plus, this is the time she was going into the military. Fast forward a few months, he asked me out, I said yes. It also seem to have started our differences in our relationship. It lead to her friend choosing to hang out with her over me. I conforted her about it, but she said that he was her friend first. With that, I decided to break it off.

After a while, she left for the military and we barely talked. I tried multiple times to call and message her, but she hasn't picked up. When she does, it is really short conversation. I started to notice she wasn't popping up on my social media accounts. I asked her and she said she deleted them because she wasn't using them anymore. 

She came to visit this week and she was showing the family pictures of her trip to Hawaii. That's when my friend asked her if she had a Facebook where they can message eachother. She perks up and says, ""yeah, let me add you real quick."" So, at that moment I look at her and tell her I thought she deleted it. She was like, oh, no. I actually had it for a while. That's when she finally admits that she blocked me out of anger.

I am honestly devastated. I don't even know where it is coming from. She says that she's sorry, but I shouldn't be punishing her for something she did out anger. That she is going to continue making mistakes and I need to deal with it. Hearing that made me more upset. So, I decided to tell her not to bother. If she didn't want a relationship with me that's fine. I just wished she had the decency to tell me. That at this point, it is whatever and not to bother trying to talk to me.

AITA for cutting ties over her blocking me on Facebook?

In one of the trainings (I forgot the exact title of it) it explained what Export Controls are, and then went into detail that an employee is not supposed to share info with other persons from specific countries until they have an ""Export license"" documentation. Even employees working for the same company.

I talked with my manager, and told him I was under the impression that the company would take care of all this, so that I can freely interact with fellow employees. However, he admitted that due to liability and legal reasons, the employee too was responsible for checking this.

Now the moment in the title. We were in a meeting, and my Russian colleague was present, and I remembered Russia was one of the countries marked under Export Control. So I asked him if he had the necessary docs (not to show them to me, just an affirmation would've sufficed), but he got offended and told me it's not my place etc. My manager was present too, and he didn't say anything, didn't support me nor support him. I told the colleague okay, then I can't present my data in this meeting. He seemed really offended and took off from the room.

I really don't think I did something wrong, although I agree this is a shitty policy on the company's behalf. That being said, I don't want to be liable for anything happening to sensitive info, and that takes precedence over ""being nice"" for me at workplace. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"A coworker decided she wanted to play D&D for the first time after talking to her husband, and since I had played a lot and they were both new, I volunteered to DM. Before I realized it she invited 6-7 other people. Putting our party at 8-9 players(ideal is 4). It's starting in 2 weeks but we planned this over a month ago from today. I've been asking people to make their characters before hand because with this many people we can't do it all the day of or we won't actually be able to play. And I want peoples first experience playing it to be fun.

But nobody is doing it even when I've repeatedly offered to sit down and walk them through it over discord or their house or whatever. I can plan a session but if we wind up having like 5 people instead of 9 then I have to completely gut or improvise all my encounters. And if I don't know party dynamics then some encounters will be far harder or easier than normal depending on what they bring.

Am I being an asshole for nagging people to spend 15-30 minutes with me now rather than eating up 2-4 hours together the night of? Especially since with a crowd it in invariably go even slower?

c5gzj7	2019-06-25 22:50:24	its_average	WIBTA if I cancel plans with my girlfriend’s brother?	"A bit of background: My girlfriend and I have been together for a couple years now. She’s from a town a few hours away, but is living with my family and I for the summer because she landed a co-op position in my city.  She is very family oriented and it’s tough for her being away from home, so we try to visit her folks every few weekends or so at the very least.  

Anyway, we just returned from a weekend at her place.  This coming weekend will be spent with my family, with plans to head back down to her place the weekend after where I’ll be participating in a charity ball hockey tournament with one of her brothers. I’m pretty pumped to play, but she’s doubly excited that I’m going to be doing some good bonding with her brother.  Unfortunately, my parents reminded us today that we had already agreed to go out for dinner with my aunt and uncle to celebrate their 50th anniversary on the same day as the tournament.  I figured it’s a bit of a no brainer, that it would have been nice to play some ball hockey with her brother and visit her family but that we already made plans with my family. She strongly disagrees, and says that it’s a no brainer that we go visit her family and that a single dinner isn’t that big of a deal.  

Some extra info that might be relevant:  I work as a landscaper.  Early this summer, I booked a weekend job that would have made me ~$2,000.  However, I had previously promised my gf that I would go away with her that weekend, so I cancelled the job.  To her credit, she was supposed to go home and get an MRI done this coming weekend, however she canceled it as a surprise to me so we can go up north with my family this weekend.  So at this point we’ve each canceled weekend plans for the benefit of the other. 

Will I be the asshole if I bail on her brother, or will I be the asshole if I bail on my aunt and uncle? Am I the asshole either way?  
Bonus asshole: will she be an asshole to my family if she visits home herself and I go to dinner with my aunt and uncle?"	Asshole	0	0
c5gyva	2019-06-25 22:49:12	MarinaraBlue	AITA for telling a friend to stop whining about his depression?	"Title sounds bad, but I'll explain.

&#x200B;

I have a group of close online friends. We often play video games together and have known each other for years, and for the most part things have been pretty good. But one, who I'll call R, has been sort of a problem for pretty much the entire time we've known him. He's made it very clear to all of us that he's been struggling with depression for a while, which is completely understandable as several of us do as well, but R takes it to the point it's unbearable for the rest of us and making every situation about him and how miserable he is, but he always does it in a weird joking way.

&#x200B;

For example, recently several of us were in a voice call having a good time and one friend was playing a game losing and got frustrated and said ""Why do I even still play this game?"" to which R chimes in and says ""Why am I even still alive? That's a question I ask myself every day"", but suddenly made the situation very awkward and uncomfortable because obviously we don't know how to respond to something like that, and within a few minutes everyone's made excuses to leave.

&#x200B;

Another instance, one of us had a birthday recently. We were all wishing them happy birthday in our group's discord server, but R only says ""a birthday is just a normal day except you're one year closer to death""....

&#x200B;

Or if we're all logging off for the night, he'll often say ""goodnight everyone, see you tomorrow if I wake up this time"".

&#x200B;

Imagine situations like these, but nearly every single day.

&#x200B;

Now keep in mind, we've all tried reaching out to him MANY times, offering help or if he wants to talk, suggesting therapy or calling a hotline or something, but he refuses everything and brushes it off saying he's fine or it doesn't matter. It's usually only with multiple people around that he makes a big show of it, and it's been getting very frustrating lately with this guy being a massive bummer just to have around.

&#x200B;

So yesterday there was another time with a bunch of us in a voice call, someone comes in and asks how everyone's doing. R replies ""horrible, how about you?"" like he's trying to be funny or something. The friend does a nervous awkward laugh and tries to change the subject but R throws a fit about how it's not something to laugh about and making everyone uncomfortable yet again. 

&#x200B;

I got really annoyed, and I'm not proud of my response but I snapped and said ""Then stop treating it like a joke, if you're actually depressed then go get help like we've been suggesting instead of whining to everyone about it all the time for attention"". He started crying and left the call, and I felt a little bad afterwards but I also felt like it was something that needed to be said with how he's been acting. I've talked to other friends in the group and they're mostly split, some agreeing with what I said and some saying I was too harsh about it and I've likely made his depression worse.

“How long have you been on the screen?” 
“I don’t know, a couple hours? Maybe 3?”
“That’s too much.” 
“I was learning sign language and working on my website.” 
“Yeah, but it’s still too much.”
“Would you rather me go all the way to the library to get a book on asl?”
“The screen does something to your brain that a book doesn’t.”

He and his mom and little brother decided that we should go to the spa on the way back from our trip to LA. They've thought about this for the past couple days and I was clearly hesitant to go, even the mother said don't go if you aren't willing. In the car I eventually said I'll try it I guess but was still hesitant.

We arrive at the spa and we all pay for admission ($25 each), the mother kindly pays for us. As we enter, I realize that I must strip down everything which makes me extremely uncomfortable. I do not want to be naked in front of other people. 

My friend starts calling me a pussy for not participating with them and I stand my ground saying I will not strip. He then starts to threaten canceling a planned trip to Korea that takes place next summer which will consist of a couple friends and lasts 6 weeks. I still stand my ground because I feel very uncomfortable about stripping.

Anytime one is in her room, she comes to me to get it and I always do. However, lately she has been really rude to me, and although I never really seek revenge, I do when an easy opportunity arises. So anyways, last night, my sister came to me about a spider in her room, obviously wanting me to catch it. I saw this as a perfect opportunity to get back, and I refused. I said I didn’t want to. She threw a little fit, but I held my ground and still refused, as she left I told her why. She tried making excuses for her behavior and eventually apologized out of desperation, but I STILL refused. She stormed off and decided to sleep in the living room. She hadn’t spoken to me since, nor has she entered her room out of fear of the spider.

Now, today I feel kinda asshole-ish about what I did. Not exactly for refusing to catch the spider, but she’s not speaking to me, and I feel I am damaging our relationship over a spider. I’m starting to feel I am petty. Please give me honest feedback, AITA or not ?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c5guvr	2019-06-25 22:41:59	daaHamster	AITA for feeling mad towards my Dad?	"Backstory: 

My dad works for the military and spent a lot of time learning English when he was young to be qualified for jobs in America. Our family was originally from Taiwan and my dad's knowledge of English gave us a rare chance to go to America for lengthened periods of time.

So far we've moved to Maryland for 3 years, went back to Taiwan, Virginia for 2 and a half years, went back, then we came to Hawai'i where I currently am right now.

My dad came to Hawai'i a year before me, my mom and little brother so he could find a good place for us to stay and buy a good car. He met a girl here related to his work during the first few months. They hit off great and they went to dancing lessons together as well as learning instruments. My mom knew this the whole time and didn't really care since she has -69% ~ 0% of jealous emotions.

So me, my mom and little brother rides a plane and nyooms to Hawai'i. After we arrive for some reason the girl my dad's been seeing starts turning sour and accuses my dad's harassing her by email, holding her hand too hard during dancing and wounding it, and basically blaming him for a bunch of stuff. My dad claims to have done those actions but he says the girl is being hyperbole and over-exaggerating everything.

Now the girl filed a report towards my dad because she wants him and our whole family to go back to Taiwan. I have my suspicions why but I'm unsure. The thing is when she reported my dad, he had to go back to Taiwan for around a week just to confirm what was true and untrue in the report. It's completely unfair that he has to pay the airplane ticket on his own just to go over the report and lose a week of time. We can't exactly claim the girl of false accusations because somewhat of the report is true but still, she knew my dad never had any intentions to hurt her in anyway. I'm angry at the girl for doing this to my dad just for her own satisfaction.

I'm also angry towards my dad for having a ""fling"" with this girl. If he never continued with her then none of this would happen. Now we face being sent back home 2 years early. It's hard on me because I just came to Hawai'i for not even a year and I literally just got used to the enviroment and people just recently. If I was to go back, I'll basically have to start from scratch again.

I'll have to do adjust again anyway when the 3 year's up but I feel like the conflict between the girl and my dad shortened my time here so much. I would have to explain to my new friends and teachers that I'm leaving even though I told them I would stay here for 3 years.

AITA for feeling mad about my dad shortening the time-length of my stay here in Hawai'i even though he was the one to give me the chance to come here and study?

Meanwhile, my mom's just chilling in the corner and doesn't even care. She's that type of people who doesn't even know what a open relationship but she simply does not care about my dad going off to other women because she knows that he'll always come back."	Not the A-hole	0	0

At age 18, I bought a car  with my own money and they would sit in it and help me drive, but then I went to college without fully mastering it...

I worked throughout college, taking buses/trains etc, even getting robbed at gunpoint  coming off the subway for my internship. 

I graduated college in May and got a job interview or two and got a job offer from a company I thought was public trans accessible from my house. 

They are moving offices to somewhere that isn’t accessible this summer.

When I found out, I was very sad. Here I am, I worked so hard in spite of everything and I still am suffering because I did not have a mother or father to teach me how to drive. Those insecurities last a lifetime.

"First time poster here, yes I've been lurking for a while. The story is pretty much exactly as the title says but il give more context. Just before I start, I would like to mention the joke itself was poorly executed and extremely low effort anyways lets get to it.

Characters: ME: you already know SS: Step sister FDS: Friend dating my step-sister OR: Old Roommate

So after high-school i asked FDS to move to BC with me, he says yes I go first he comes a month later everything is straight jazzy, around Christmas of that year (we moved in summer) we come home to see family and friends and I find out from a few friends that FDS and another friend slept with my sister.

Anyways I was pretty pissed cause it took them months for someone to tell me so i ask my sister about it and she tells me it was all just for fun and she doesn't care about either of them and says shes all good, dating someone else etc.. talked to FDS and other friend about it they both made ~~decent~~ apologies and all is well.

Now fast forward another 6 months and we both moved back to hometown started to drift apart a little bit probably due to living together and working together for almost a year, I think nothing of it and then through another one of our friends I find out FDS is now actually FDS, I'm on its no big deal IDC its their life not mine plus she's not a blood sister so its not like that whole he's Dating me in a way sort of shit.

And now the part you all came for if you even read this far, its Thanksgiving of last year. Our parents live out at a lake about an hour outside of the city I offer to pick everyone up and drive out in case they wanted to have a couple drinks or something. Supper goes well, good conversation on the drive up and back I honestly dont mind them dating because then i get to see FDS at family functions. Anyways I ask them to come hangout at my house, mainly cause at this point I barely ever see FDS. So we go back to my place and its all gravy until OR comes home, then this happened.

\*Enter Old Roommate\*

me: "" Hey OR what up""

or: ""nothing man, oh shit didn't know you had people over""

me: "" Yea just FDS(probably said something insulting dont remember) and my sister who sleeps with my friends""

AND I SHIT YOU NOT FOR A SPLIT SECOND FDS CRACKS THIS LITTLE SMIRK, right before SS almost decks me in the damn head, I get up and started the whole its a joke thing while shes tossing shit at me, spitting all kinds of rude things about how it wasn't funny which, okay yes maybe it wasn't a funny joke however it is true she did do that on two occasions and seemed to not care when i asked her about it. So anyways she stormed out FDS followed her i texted both with honest apologies, after a while she accepted I think for FDS' sake, but its been a year and shes still holding a grudge so im at the point where i dont give a flying shit if she actually accepts it or not.

My friend came and stayed with me for a few days, stayed in our guest room, and left last night. I hadn’t been in the guest room yet until this morning and when I walked in there was garbage everywhere. Snotty tissues, a trash bag full of food trash, literal snot covering the trash bag, pink eyeshadow all over the floor that stained because it was left for an extended about of time, and the room smelled like marijuana but I won’t even rage about that.


I texted her this morning, commenting on the garbage and she left me on read, despite me knowing that she didn’t have anything to do (I know this for an absolute fact.) I go to work, work a full shift, and come back to see she never responded to I texted her again, a little more aggressively.

She read that, didn’t respond, but her boyfriend called me and basically said “You can’t talk to her that way just because she left some trash in your house. You were way too harsh on her.” And my parents and sister agree.

But I don’t think I was. I think I was levelheaded but stern and I had to get my point across.

c5gpan	2019-06-25 22:32:14	throwawayacctmarie	WIBTA for blocking my ex after taking my car from her driveway	"About 2 years ago, I took on a lease to get a car for an ex of mine. Loan is in my name so it's my property. We split up about 3 months after this happened and the breakup was messy, I basically kicked her out of the apartment after giving a couple of weeks to pack her belongings. She had a kid, no job, and had to find a place to live, so I figured I would at least let her keep the car until she got back on her feet.

After a few months she got a job and started paying me back for the monthly payments on the lease. This worked pretty well for about a year. About 3-4 months ago she stopped paying me and said she was struggling financially. I figured it wouldnt take long for her to get back on track, but I've sent her multiple messages to seek payments and she has been either saying she needs more time or doesnt respond. Given knowledge of her behavior and personality, I'm positive she has no intentions of paying for the car and is hoping I'm too lazy and nonconfrontational to do anything about it.

I've decided I'm ready to get my car back so I can sell it and use some of my money to pay off the lease. She has the only copy of the keys, so I will go to the dealership I purchased the car at and have another copy of the keys made. After this I will probably show up in the middle of the night to her neighborhood and use the keys to unlock the car and drive out of her driveway. I would leave any bulky items in front the house and drive off.

At this point I'm ready to cut the ex out so I can move on with my life. Obviously losing the car would be a big deal for the ex as it's her main mode of transportation and would affect if she needs to take her child anywhere or get to work. However she has made no effort to obtain a cheaper car and return mine so this is my only option. Since I had lent her the car willingly I dont think this would qualify as a stolen vehicle and police wont get involved in civil matters. Also the car is worth more than 10k, so this is beyond the scope of small claims court and I have no interest in the headache of taking this to civil court.

Once I have the car I was hoping to block my ex's number and other social media accounts. I would send her a brief message that I would return the rest of her belongings on my way to work the very next day or the day after, and then block her again. The only thing I can think of is if I dont say anything initially, she will obviously freak out and may think the car has been stolen (I doubt she would make the leap of logic that I had spare keys made or would tow the car myself), and I dont know how mean it would be to let her freak out about that.

WIBTA for taking the car and then blocking her afterwards, only sending a message a couple of hours or maybe more later to say I took the car and will return belongings in the future?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So, I worked in customer service as a cashier for several years in college, and occasionally I would have to go and collect the carts if our typical cart retriever was not at work. One of the things I always hate were the people that would leave their carts outside of the stall. 

It’s been several years since then, but every time I go to the grocery store, someone leaves their cart beside their car. The two ladies that work in the store have enough to worry about. They shouldn’t have to keep up after lazy people, so I have taken it upon myself to fix the issue. 

Anytime I see someone do this, i wait until I’m sure they aren’t going to put their cart up, I walk over shaking my head, look them in their eyes, sigh, and tsk while I take the cart and put it up.

Some people don’t care, others look offended, and one lady got out of her car and put up another cart. 

I think this is justified, but my wife thinks I take it too far. What do you think?"	Everyone Sucks	1	0

c5giqu	2019-06-25 22:20:25		AITA for yelling at my mother-in-law	So, there's my mother-in-law, a very very sweet and loving person, who just sometimes doesn't think about her words before saying them - or take consequences into consideration. And then there's me. Short tempered, but honestly trying to improve myself. Over the past seven years, there has been more than one occasion when she got me so fuming a snapped at her - which is not cool, obvious. My Mr asked me to try staying calm more often, breathe in deeply before I give her a reply or just don't comment her behavior at all. And I try, I really do. It worked ok-ish, until today. The Mr was talking to her over the Bluetooth car to phone connection while I was sitting in the passenger seat. They were making plans for a trip to the beach - it's boiling hot, we'll hit 40°C/104°F tomorrow and the beach is probably the only cool place at all. It would be my Mr, his 8-months-pregnant sister, their mother - and three dogs. Mine and the two dogs the in-laws own. All three of them big breeds. So the Mr asked how that should work- three dogs, two of them quite wild when put together, and only him who could tame them. He wants to swim, too, and neither his mother nor his sister could control all three of them at the dog beach, if some kind of trouble would come up. So his mother suggested to put the dogs into the car while he would swim. Until then, I was just listening, but kept quiet. But when she suggested to put the dogs into the car, including my dog (who I maybe treat a little too much like a baby, yes) I couldn't hold me back and yelled at her. I was fuming and asked if she was f*cking serious, sweared a lot more and maybe even called her insanely dumb. It was obvious that she got upset. She suggested to call the Mr later again to clarify the details and hung up. The Mr wasn't happy at all about my reaction and said I just should have ignored her, he never would let that happen. And of course, I know he wouldn't leave the dogs in the car during this heat. But still. I think she deserved my reaction for even suggesting it. Am I wrong here?		1	0
c5gga0	2019-06-25 22:16:13		AITA for making a sex joke around my dad?	Recently my dad and I have been going through a rough patch. We have been fighting non stop and don’t have the same relationship we used to. Last night, we were on our way to dinner and had a huge blow out in the car. We were both super tense when we got to the restaurant and then he asked me to give two numbers because he was playing the lotto. In order to lighten the mood I said “6 and 9”. I was just fucking around and I was hoping it would make him laugh. Instead he got SUPER pissed and said it was disrespectful to say something like that to your father. Just to give background to our relationship: he’s made many sex jokes to me in the past that were even more vulgar than what I said. When I brought that up he said there was a difference between what a father can say to his daughter and what a daughter can say to her father. My mom agrees with him and said it was super inappropriate regardless of what he has said to me in the past. Personally I just think because we’re going through a rough patch he’s just looking for something to pick on me for. (I’m 19 if that makes any difference)	Not the A-hole	1	0
c5gg0d	2019-06-25 22:15:44	Flostyyy	WIBTA if I don’t go to my cousin’s wedding	"So I was hyped for a month to go to a end of school year party with friends from school and we were planning it for some time when my mom tells me about how my cousin is getting married and I have to go. I didn’t think much of it until three days before Thursday (the day of the party and the marriage)

I was really sad that I was going to miss out on the party that I wanted to go to so badly. I didn’t want to disappoint my cousin either but I decided I would rather go to the party since I have nothing to do in the wedding and usually end up getting bored and was sure my cousin would understand.

I asked my parents for permission to go to the party instead of the wedding and they said that I had to go to the wedding. I told my friends I wouldn’t make it and was quite sad for the next few days. Suddenly my parents sat me down and told me that they really want me to go to the wedding and they would be disappointed if I don’t but that if I do want I have the choice to go to the party. While I was happy I was also really pissed since this is literally less than 24 before the party and the organizers asked us to give them the money to set the party up  already and I didn’t obviously because I said I wasn’t coming. They also made me feel guilty if I wouldn’t come and I don’t really know what to do. WIBTA?

c5gfjk	2019-06-25 22:14:53	NoKidsNotNowNotEver	AITA for Telling My Family I Wanna Be a Kid Forever	"MY BACKGROUND:

I'm 31M, only recently found a career (almost 100K/year). Prior to this, I graduated university with horrible grades, did some odd part-time, or dead-end full-time jobs here and there (think minimum wage like Wal-Mart), am a virgin (I don't advertise this), never had a girlfriend before, and I'm balding (Dad's side of the family is almost all bald). I don't have a lot of friends, and I mostly stay inside the house outside of work, only occasionally seeing friends on the weekend. I am an introvert.

I live with my parents, I'm saving a TON of money (I do pay rent, expenses, and broken appliances like if we need a new washing machine), and after recently discovering day trading (stock markets), I am making money hand over fist. I work a full-time job, and pay my taxes. My Mom and Dad do cook/buy meals for me. My mom does the laundry, cleaning, etc. My life currently involves going to work, coming home, playing games online with friends/co-workers, eat, sleep. Rinse/repeat.

INCIDENT:

So it's my sister's baby's (my nephew's) first birthday, and our family (aunts/uncles/etc) are invited to a backyard BBQ to celebrate. My sister, brother-in-law, my parents, and a couple of aunts/uncles are eating around a table when one of my nosy aunts ask when I'm going to get married.

I say ""Probably never, it's not for me"". Cue the awkward silence or muted gasps from everyone. My sister chimes in and says, ""Well now that you're making so much money, you can actually afford a girlfriend now"".

Me: If a girlfriend can be afforded, then she's not going to be my girlfriend.

Sister: So what else are you gonna use your money for?

Me: Literally anything else I want.

Sister: You're so childish. When are you going to grow up, man up, and start acting like an adult?

Me: It's childish of you to assume everybody wants to live like you do. If you can't accept people can live different lives, then you're just immature.

Sister: Who *wouldn't* wanna live like me? (she gestures to the giant house, luxuries etc. My sister doesn't make a lot of money, but she married my bro-in-law who comes from an obscenely wealthy family)

Me: If I wanna be a kid forever, that's my choice. It's my money, my life, my decision. What are you gonna do about it? Whine some more?

She just stares coldly at me and I can tell my family doesn't like what I'm saying, but I don't care. I just sit there and enjoy my meal.

AITA for Telling My Family I Wanna Be a Kid Forever?

&#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people are telling me to move out. Why? Parents want me to stay, they've never even hinted at wanting me to move out, housing prices are INSANE where I live, and WHY would I pay rent to a stranger as opposed to my own parents?

Now if you are extremely wealthy and can afford your own place, or you would rather give money to a stranger than your own family, sure, go for it.

&#x200B;

EDIT numero Deux: Talked it out with my folks (we're traditional Asian, living in North America) about whether they wanted me to move out. My Dad said I was stupid for wanting to pay more rent to a stranger and my mom said I should save up to buy my own house so I wouldn't be 'paying other people's mortgages'.

My parents clearly love me and my eyes have been opened by the people of Reddit. I know in America it's expected for a kid to hit 18 and just find a job and pay for their own way but wages just haven't caught up to costs of living.

A lot of people assumed I was mooching off my parents, which is fair, since I can only fit so much in this post, but I suppose I'll just have to live with opinions from people without the whole picture. In your opinions, I am the asshole. /bows"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5gek1	2019-06-25 22:13:07	TheMaxish	AITA for ending a friendship over a dick joke?	"&#x200B;

I was playing my favorite vidya game (Rocket League) last night with some friends when this all went down.

The whole issue has been going for a long time, as I have been playing games off and on with the person I was possibly the asshole to (let's call him Bob) for quite a long time (+2 years). His language, way of speaking, and pretty much everything else has been somewhat crude as long as I've known him (and always obnoxious), but in the last few months, he has just gotten over the top. This is to the point where every other word that comes out of his mouth is ""fuck"" or something similar. Not to mention the constant dick jokes that start and end with a reference to a penis (i.e. nothing really funny about them IMO, just crude) to which I would politely laugh.

Over our relationship, I have for the most part overlooked all of this because he was pretty good at the game, and by the time I realized that he wasn't ever going to stop being like this, I had already known him too long to just ghost him without making myself feel like an asshole, until, as stated before, recently.

Note: My vernacular isn't exactly clean. I'll swear at just about anything myself, but almost always AT something (like a missed shot, or a lost game) and not just as a way of speaking. I use swears as an exclamation point.

I realize there is nothing inherently wrong with how Bob spoke, and until last night, he had no reason to stop. But then I got fed up. I just started by asking him to tone it down, and then, when I was ignored, I put on a more serious tone and asked him again to tone it down. Ignored again. Eventually, I told him I would kick him from the party in-game if he kept on doing it. He acknowledged what I said, as if he was to stop, then just kept going. Not just one last jab (which would have been totally ok), but again no change in behavior. Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with how he spoke, just that I, his friend of multiple years, asked him to stop, with little to no change. At this point I have little choice but to kick him from the party, otherwise, nothing I say has any meaning. He is pissed off a bit by this, but nothing serious. Once again, no change. Eventually, I just straight up tell him that one of the jokes he told isn't funny. He acts like there is something wrong with me, or that I don't get it, and (I can't remember the exact words I used) I respond by saying 'It wasn't funny the first time, or the other four times you've told it.' At this point, he just leaves in the middle of a competitive match. For context, doing this screws my rank, as well as the other friend we were playing with's rank, gets him a short ban, and is generally considered in the Rocket League community 'A Dick Move'. I then immediately removed him from my friendslist.

This could be an ESH, and I know I could have handled it better, but I just don't know if I was the bad guy in this situation."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5gbox	2019-06-25 22:08:09	sortamelted	AITA for getting cats?	"Around 8 years ago, I had a toddler and a baby, and 2 cats that were not getting any attention and were hiding from the kids all the time. I was overwhelmed with all of my obligations and motherhood in general, and I didn't have time to make the cats a priority at all.

My dad and his wife lost their elderly cat around that time, and I half jokingly offered they could take our cats. A couple weeks later, dad's wife called and said they would take our cats but we'd ""better not turn around and get a kitten!""

I had NO interest in getting cats whatsoever, until about a year ago. My kids are older now and absolutely LOVE animals. We have goats, chickens, parakeets, and dogs, but the one thing they wanted more than anything was a cat.

I reached out to dad's wife to say that we were considering getting cats again, and we would take back the cats we gave them if they preferred.

Dad's wife responded with a nasty email saying that we were ""taking advantage"" of her, and that we know she would never give them up, and it was in the spirit of the exchange that we wouldn't get any more cats as long as the two other cats were around. She then said ""If you're looking for permission to get a kitten you don't have it."" 

I'm in my 40s and barely have a relationship with these people (talk to them maybe 3-4 times per year, see them less than once per year). So we need her fucking PERMISSION? 

We got 2 kittens last summer. Anytime I would post about them on social media, I would hide my dad and his wife from the post. It was annoying, but I just wanted to avoid the drama.

A couple months later we ran across a newborn kitten at a gas station, and we brought him home. We bottle fed him and had to get up at night and help him poop and everything. Everyone thought we were so awesome for doing that (even though I feel super lucky we got to), and I figured dad's wife would be ok with that cat since it was a rescue situation. We have not been hiding that cat on social media.

For the first time in about 4 years, they stopped by our house, just to pick up my kids and take them for a picnic (never mind the fact that we hadn't seen them since April and they just wanted to pick up the kids quick and not really visit). Dad's wife met our rescue cat and I could tell she was seething, but trying really hard to not say anything. We hid the other 2 cats in our upstairs room. It felt fucking awful having to hide our cats in our own home, but I just wanted to avoid drama and keep the visit easy. The whole situation has me pissed off and wondering if maybe I'm an asshole. DH says she's the asshole but told me to ask here if I wanted to see for sure.

c5gaht	2019-06-25 22:06:04	mangeloid	AITA for not wanting my son to play with a doll that's the likeness of my wife's ex?	"So my wife used to date a guy years ago before we met, and he used to make quirky stuffed animals and things. She was in a touring band at the time, so he made a doll that looked like himself so she could take it with her while she was on tour for months on end, and be reminded of him. Very sweet.

Anyways, he and my wife eventually broke up. She kept the doll as it clearly means a lot to her. Fast forward to now, many years later. My wife and are married (obviously) and we have a young son. When my son was very young my wife pulled out the doll from the closet and would put it in his crib with him. When I asked if we could please put the doll back in the closet where it's lived for the last 5 years, she said that the doll is important to her and that it's important that our son has it. If I was cleaning up and I found it on the floor, I'd put it back in the closet instead of the toy bin, and the next day it would be back in the toy bin.

I'm really not keen on my son playing with a doll that's the likeness of my wife's ex-boyfriend. I think it's super weird that she's insisted my son play with it, and I just want it to go away.

Just to be clear, I have NO problem with my wife keeping the doll. She clearly has an emotional attachment to it and that's fine. I totally get why it would be meaningful to her and why she'd want to keep it. It's pretty cool looking, buddy was talented. I just don't like that it's now my son's toy and I have to look at the image of my wife's ex every day."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5ga0b	2019-06-25 22:05:15	IScreamYouDance	WIBTA to reject my girlfriend's offer to try another double date with her best friend?	"My girlfriend just texted me asking to try a double date with her best friend again. TL;DR below.

Backstory; we tried to do a double date once, but it went wrong. The other girls boyfriend had to work ""last minute"", but my GF didn't tell me that, so I got all dressed up and fancy as I do even though we just went to Ihop, I brought flowers and everything, I'm a romantic ok sue me..

 As we were on the date my GF mentions while her friend is in the bathroom that I need to pay for her friend too.. I said no, because I'm not made of money and her friend has a boyfriend so I thought it's kinda weird that I'm paying even though I don't know her at all, and she got mad. Like real mad. Thinks I'm being cheap and unfair to her friend because her friend wasn't working so she had no money.... Eventually I caved... Paid for her friends $17 meal... And got kinda quiet, I was pissed... 

After a while they decided, without me, (as I was in the bathroom) that they wanted to go to the nearby mall (originally we had planned to go bowling, but she said I'd have to pay for her friend for that too and I absolutely refused, so instead we went to the mall). Her friend didn't have a car so I had to drive her, not really a big deal but I thought I'd mention because later it is a big deal.. 

At the mall I followed them around while they were interlocked arms and talking, I was the ""not enough room on the sidewalk"" person my whole life so I'm kinda used to it I guess, but it still made me a little mad.. they went into a bunch of women's only stores (men are allowed to go in and buy stuff obviously, but they only sell women's clothes) and I literally just stood around kinda walking a little not talking, because they were talking the whole time. Four times FOUR times they left a store without telling me and I was walking around looking for them for about 15 minutes until I eventually got a call from them. I kept saying they were allowed to tell me they were leaving, but  she just kept saying she didn't want to bother me because she thought I was mad and ""gazing at the product""?? Dafuq does that mean?

(I did have some fun, smelling candles while they were in the bathroom and of course ignoring them in the Disney store, I was definitely gazing the products in that store) 

Anyways, after about an hour and a half being there I said I wanted to leave, but they said they didn't yet... Me being their driver I had to stay an extra 2 more hours... 

Anyways, you get the picture but a fun day and I felt like I was taken advantage of hard. WIBTA regardless if her friends BF will actually be there to not want to go on a double date with them again?

TL:DR- first double date went horrible, I was a third wheel to their own best friend shopping day, because the girls Bf Didn't show and I was pressured to pay for her friend and wait for them to be ready to leave (because I drove)."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So the next day I sent him a text: 
""You know what dad? It's okay you didn't tell me that you had a girlfriend because I didn't tell you that I like girls.""

We had a pleasant conversation which turned into a bitter argument. During this argument, my great-uncle passed. My dad didn't tell me. 
I find out on Facebook the next day that my uncle passed. I was furious. Absolutely pissed. This is the second time someone has passed and he let me find out on Facebook. So I sent him a message.

Me: You've got some damn nerve to talk to me about respect. Why should I respect you? Taking care of me is your job and yeah you do make sure I get whatever I want. You know what though. You can take your ""respect"". I don't want it. If your version of respect is to let your daughter find out on FACEBOOK that a family member passed I don't want your respect. Keep it. I don't want it. This is the second time I've found out on Facebook that something happened. You know what? I'm done. Don't text back and don't call I won't answer.

Dad: Who in the fuck do you think you are talking to?
Listen let me tell you one damn thing if you ever in your fucking life talk to me like that again I will break your neck don't you ever talk to me like that again
You have me confused don't you ever in your life talk to me like that. I don't know what your problem is. 
And you have a good day I don't have shit else to say to you.

I went with my aunt and attended the funeral. The day my aunt and I are set to leave. I'm in the kitchen working on something with my dad next to me and he gets a video call from his girlfriend and he makes me stay and talk with them. Between the living room and the kitchen/dining room is a wall but, there is a huge window so you can hear everything that's happening.
Grandma: [ dad's name ], who you talkin' to?
Dad: Brooke.
Me: Don't be lyin' to my grandma like that. 

He gives me a look and he continues his conversation with his girlfriend and I move my thread, jacket, and ginger ale to the living room to sit on the day bed. He walks into the hallway and my grandma starts again.
Grandma: Who were you talkin' to?
Dad: I was talking to Brooke,
Me: You a lie.
I take a sip of my ginger ale and it went down the wrong pipe so I cough a bit. I thought my dad was concerned because I started coughing really bad and he had a look on his face.
Me: Excuse me I was choking a bit. 
Dad: Yeah, I'm finna choke you.
Grandma: Brooke just needs to choose her words better.

""You a lie"" is something I would say as a joke at home. This all went down in front of two of my great aunts, one of my great uncles, and my grandma. No one said anything to him at all.

c5g3zf	2019-06-25 21:55:08		AITA for telling my bf to not let another girl send him nudes?	"A bit of background, I've recently ""taken a break"" with my bf for various reasons, but we both agreed that we're still exclusive and any interactions of a sexual or romantic nature with others are considered cheating, same rules as always. We are on good terms but mutually decided to take things slowly as he is under stress from work and I am preparing to start college. 

I can be a bit jealous, but I don't think I am controlling and I care about my bf's wellbeing as much as my own. I don't think he would ever try to cheat behind my back, but the dynamic between him and some female friends makes me uncomfortable. He provides a lot of emotional support to friends who need it, though most of them are females.  He calls these female friends his ""daughters,"" which I find weird but haven't really mentioned. I don't usually say much about his friends, and I know he is reluctant to confront or abandon people. He often seems oblivious to the possibility of people having different intentions than they let on. 

So yesterday we were talking and getting cuddly like we tend to do, and he mentioned that one of his female friends had sent him nudes a few weeks ago to ask his opinion before sending them to another guy.  I asked him if he had told the girl to not send him nudes and if he still talked to her. He said that he did not mention it and he still talks to the girl. He seemed confused when I acted hurt by this and said she wasn't flirting and just wanted advice. I don't doubt that's how he sees it but I felt that it was really inappropriate for her to be sending him nudes for any reason and for him to be okay with it. I explained to him how I felt and why it made me uncomfortable, though I really thought it would be common sense. He listened and eventually agreed and apologized. 

This also seems like a conversation I have with him often and usually if I tell him it makes me uncomfortable, he laughs it off as if I'm cute for being protective unless I explain that I'm genuinely upset. He told me before that he'd comfort some female friends by hugging them and kissing their forehead. I know he means well and assures me the girls are platonic friends, but I would definitely feel awkward about a male friend kissing my forehead (maybe it's a personal/cultural difference?). Am I overreacting or am I justified in being uncomfortable and telling him I don't want this girl sending him nudes?

Backstory; we tried to do a double date once, but it went wrong. The other girls boyfriend had to work ""last minute"", but my GF didn't tell me that, so I got all dressed up and fancy as I do even though we just went to Ihop, I brought flowers and everything, I'm a romantic ok sue me..

 As we were on the date my GF mentions while her friend is in the bathroom that I need to pay for her friend too.. I said no, because I'm not made of money, and she got mad. Like real mad. Thinks I'm being cheap and unfair to her friend because her friend wasn't working so she had no money.... Eventually I caved... Paid for her friends $17 meal... And got kinda quiet, I was pissed... 

After a while they decided, without me, (as I was in the bathroom) that they wanted to go to the nearby mall (originally we had planned to go bowling, but she said I'd have to pay for her friend for that too and I absolutely refused, so instead we went to the mall). Her friend didn't have a car so I had to drive her, not really a big deal but I thought I'd mention because later it is a big deal.. 

At the mall I followed them around while they were interlocked arms and talking, I was the ""not enough room on the sidewalk"" person my whole life so I'm kinda used to it I guess, but it still made me a little mad.. they went into a bunch of women's only stores (men are allowed to go in and buy stuff obviously, but they only sell women's clothes) and I literally just stood around kinda walking a little not talking, because they were talking the whole time. Four times FOUR times they left a store without telling me and I was walking around looking for them for about 15 minutes until I eventually got a call from them. I kept saying they were allowed to tell me they were leaving, but  she just kept saying she didn't want to bother me because she thought I was mad and ""gazing""??"		1	0

I called my dad to talk about a project of some sort. We are both engineers so the conversation was pretty technical. At some point (maybe before the call started) my mom entered the room my dad was in. She eventually made a comment about him not putting me on speaker phone so she could be in on the conversation too. My dad obliged but said something along the lines of ""You wouldn't have understood anyway"". This was obviously not a nice thing for him to say and he apologized shortly after. However, my mom just went on a **TIRADE** of insults calling my dad a ""stupid fucking asshole"" or just Asshole with no shortage of ""fuck you""s in there too. She would leave the room and come back a few minutes later with about 5 more ""assholes"" and a few ""fuck you""s for good measure. She did this a few times. Meanwhile, my dad is apologizing a lot and we are still trying to discuss this engineering thing. 

Finally coming to my part. After about 20 minutes of this abuse, I have had enough and I say ""Oh my god shut up mom!"" After a bit of the same treatment for me, she finally leaves and my dad decides it's best to end the call. I have never apologized but it seems that the event has been forgotten as our relationship is back to normal though there were a few cold weeks where we didn't talk.

c5g3ge	2019-06-25 21:54:10	Gorgonsoxz	AITA for telling my religious grandmother that I don't believe?	"Pretty much the title, but here's some context for you:

I personally have never really been religious since I've been old enough to think for myself, but I did VBS and Sunday School when I would visit my grandparents as a kid. I've never really made a secret of the fact I don't believe, but for the sake of not being an asshole, I've never really paraded that fact, either.

So, last Christmas, I'm (26M) on vacation with my mother and her family and having a talk with my grandma. She asks me if I want to be saved. I told her that, honestly, I didn't. She asked me why not and I came out to her as an atheist. She half-heartedly tried to change my mind with basic arguments like Pascal's Wager, but otherwise dropped it, ending the conversation by telling me that she hopes that I find God and save my soul.

Later, I'm talking to my mom (who knows how I feel, as we've had numerous arguments about my beliefs) and I tell her I feel bad for making grandma cry. She then asked me why on earth I would tell her the truth and insists I should have just lied to her, that telling her the truth was an asshole move.

So, how 'bout it, Reddit: AITA?

c5fyvh	2019-06-25 21:46:30		AITA for snooping in my husband’s phone and being mad for finding homosexual messages?	"I’m really upset right now. My husband has a pretty big twitter account. He gets messages from tons of people all the time, most being of sexual nature from girls. He’s good about ignoring them or curbing the sexual comments. He’s not usually rude to people, he’ll just send a meme and that’s the end of it.
Last night I couldn’t sleep and I just grew curious about his message content. We don’t hide passwords from each other, so I know all of his, and he knows mine. I logged on to his twitter (which he knows I do occasionally) and found these weird messages. This guy just started being extremely sexual and graphic (it’s about to get graphic here, trigger warning) about being “horny” after smoking weed and “beating his morning wood” and basically making innuendos to my husband! Asking if he does the same and if he had “morning wood”. My husband was NOT being sexual back, but I’m extremely disturbed because he just kept sending memes and taking about weed....The guy KEPT MESSAGING HIM! It got to the point where he wasn’t even having a conversation, he was just saying nasty, graphic shit to my husband. Like each message was even worse. Finally, my husband just stopped replying. This guy occasionally still will send him a meme or and my husband replies.
I immediacy confronted my husband and told him how disgusted and disturbed I was that he was enabling this type of conversation. I said that to some extent, he has to be a little homosexual to not set this weirdo straight. I mean it wasn’t like this guy said he was cute, he literally was asking my husband if he was horny and had morning wood. I’m sick even just typing this. I said that he is wrong for entertaining this, because had it been a female saying these same things, it would definitely be micro cheating. 
All day I have been laying in bed, just really disturbed and shocked. I honestly consider what my husband did to be micro cheating, so the fact that is was with a man is just even worse. I told my husband I’m upset and need time to think.
He’s mad because he said “he didn’t do  anything” and I’m weird for going through his dm’s. I straight up told him I don’t give a fuck he’s mad, because when I find shit like this, it justifies the whole reason I snooped in the first place, and obviously when your defense is “it’s wrong to snoop on my stuff” even when we password share, you’re caught as fuck and trying to deflect the attention.

c5fyhr	2019-06-25 21:45:53	RustedCornHole	AITA for purchasing my roommate a spare (lower quality) cannabis oil cartridge, and telling him to just pay me back instead of letting him use my higher quality cartridge until he gets paid?	"I know the title is a mess (I promise I'm not stoned rn). Let me explain.

My roommate and I each purchase our own carts. I pay a premium price for mine. They're medical grade made with organic bud and contain no solvents, colors or flavors. My roommate purchases flavored carts from a different source. I do not like them. They often give me a headache and make my chest rattle after a while. This is why I pay more for the ones I get.

Even though his are half the price of mine, he seems to go through them significantly faster than I use one of mine. I don't have any issues with his consumption other than the pattern that has seemed to immerge: he finishes his and then asks to use mine until he gets paid again.

At first I wasn't bothered at all. I love to share. If you're around me, and you want to get elevated I will oblige. However, the same thing keeps happening. For about two days at the end of the week he chiefs on mine. At first I was fine, until I really started to feel like he was beginning to revel in the fact that his were gone because he would get to use mine.

One day I made an off the cuff remark like, ""hey man with the way you're chiefing on mine, I know what you're gonna get me for my birthday."" He was like, ""oh man, anytime you wanna hit mine (when I have one) feel free!"" This doesn't seem like a consolation to me, but I just said thank man. I'm starting to think missed a genuine opportunity to communicate about the way I felt.

The last time I was picking up a premium cart for myself, I picked up a flavored one as well to give it to roommate. It's different than the ones he buys, but the flavor is inline with his taste and IMO it's actually higher quality. So the next time he goes to ask more mine, I tell him I got him something. I go get it, hand it to him, tell him I think he might like these more, and tell him he can pay me back when he gets paid.

For some reason (maybe it was my tone?) he got offended. He told me that if I didn't want to share that I should have just said so. He wasn't really being a dick about it. It was more like he was hurt, not trying to hurt me.

He and I don't fight. We don't yell and we're not passive aggressive either. We're good roommate and friends. I'm not looking for a verdict of NTA just to feel better. I would like some perspective and some sage advice. Please let me know if I'm overlooking something!

This is how I found out: I was staying over at my uncles house with his wife and two kids. My uncle, mom , cousin went out to see her in a hurry, and I chose to stay behind. We got there late after a swimming team practice. My aunt received a call from my uncle on speaker, informing us of the news. My two cousins? They started balling their eyes out. 

But me? I shed no tears that day. 

In fact, I probably only felt a moderate amount of surprise. When I saw my younger cousin cry, I almost laughed. When my uncles FaceTimed , I had to pretend to look visibly upset, and in that act I almost laughed.
Mind you, this was someone that I spend a good majority of my life around. My mom and I even lived with her and my grandpa for a few years.

His cat has always been (for lack of better words) a little fucker. Still intact male and goes out just about every night getting into fights and trying to fuck all the other lady cats. Anyway.... I offered to watch over him and feed and water him for a measly little $100 for 6 damn weeks. It is litterally not my fault his cat ran away and I have been taking care of him and cleaning up all his shit (the cat sometimes shits right on the carpet floor). I have done everything I possibly can to make sure the cat is doing well. It's out of my control weather the cat comes home or not. My roomate is well known for being a broke boy and a cheap skate so I think I will wait 2 more days (thats when he promised to pay me) until I get my money to tell him about his cat.

c5fwyd	2019-06-25 21:43:05	ttrowawway234567	AITA for not Letting my Wife get a gun	"Just want to say from the beginning I am not anti gun. I respect the 2nd amendment and people's rights to have them. I personally do not like them and don't like being near them.

So the backstory of this is my wife's best friend had her house broken into 2 weeks ago. They lived pretty close to us. Two guys broke in and didn't really steal anything once they realized her husband had woken up and they left almost immediately. They had already broken into the car outside and taken everything inside of it. One of the guys was carrying a large knife (Sword kinda?) that was visible as he ran off. Police still haven't found them.

This has absolutely terrified my wife and she wants to get a gun. She comes from a different background than me where guns are really common.

We have two daughters and I absolutely do not want guns in the house at all. We have an alarm system on all the windows and doors and Cameras in the kitchen, garage, and on the stairs.

She is saying that isn't enough because once they are in it is too late and won't matter that they go off if they are there to hurt us.

I put my foot down and said we aren't getting a gun and she is calling me (literally) an asshole who doesn't care for the well being of her or my daughters' lives which I think is completely untrue.

Am I the Asshole here?

Texting with her has become utterly boring, exhausting and frustrating because 1: she responds 4 hours- 1 week later and 2: we don’t really have a lot to talk about anymore so it’s just boring small talk and I’m always carrying the “conversation”. 

She’s supposed to be my best friend so I’ve personally always confided in her yet she’s never really been the type to talk to me about personal stuff or anything that happens in her day so even if i try to have a meaningful conversation it’s basically impossible since she takes so long to answer. It’s not like she doesn’t answer because she’s really busy, I’ll see she’s active on WhatsApp, Instagram or Twitter yet she just doesn’t respond to me. I used to think it was maybe that she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore but whenever I go back home she’s really insistent on meeting up and she acts pretty normally.  I have to admit, our friendship has lost its spark and even when I see her in person I don’t really know what to say anymore.

c5fpvc	2019-06-25 21:30:44	Into_thesky	AITA for asking my boyfriend to cut back on how much weed he smokes?	"My boyfriend (early 20's) and I (mid 20's F)  have been together for just over a year. He knew from the beginning how I felt about drugs really of any kind, I have never had any interest in trying them and I don't like how they change your state of mind. I have lost two cousins and came very close to losing my brother to drugs. I understand weed is not the same as cocaine or heroin but I still find I associate it as such. 

I knew that he liked to smoke on occasion and he never tried to get me to smoke and never did it in front of me. When he smokes, he becomes very lethargic and just wants to sit around doing nothing but eating any junk food he can get his hands on. He looses all motivation and slowly becomes depressed. Then he says he needs to make a change and cut back. He does for about a week and then is right back where he was. 

He has given up on now three jobs because he ""didn't like them"" and all he does in between is get high and eat and sit around. I don't like seeing him like this, and he keeps saying he will cut back because he knows it makes me upset but he never follows through. Recently, I had asked him to hold off for one night and he said he could. Literally an hour later, he was in the bathroom getting high and he said he ""had too."" 

Is it wrong of me to ask him to cut back so he is only smoking a couple times a week, instead of every single day? He sets this goal for himself that he is going to go a week sober and when he goes to smoke, I reminded him of the goal he set and he waits for me to walk away and goes and gets high. I;m not asking him to stop completely, just ease off a bit."	Asshole	0	0
c5fpbt	2019-06-25 21:29:49	atomw0lf	AITA for wanting to take a short break?	"I’ve (18M) been talking online to this girl (17F) who lives 320 miles away from me. What led us to start talking is a different story and not relevant to this one.

For the first 3 weeks or so I was very affectionate to her and complimented her on various things a lot. At first this was reciprocated, and I told her I would travel the distance to see her in real life.
After about a week, she explained to me that she didn’t want to be in a relationship just yet and that she needed time to recover from previous traumatic events before getting into a relationship. I told her I’d wait for her and told her not to rush herself. 

Fast forward 3 weeks to now; I text her and say I’m paranoid that we’re going to grow apart (I worry a lot about things that aren’t worth worrying about) And she tells me she isn’t interested in a relationship with me because the distance would make it unbearable for her. I agreed, because it would make it unbearable for me too. However, I was still harbouring very strong affection and emotions for her, so I explained that I wanted to take a break from talking to her for a few weeks just to get my head straight. I didn’t word it exactly like that, since I’ve never been any good at properly explaining complex emotions. In my head I could use this time away from her to get over the fact that we would never ever date and then I could return as a friend. and we could continue talking without these horrible and confused emotions happening my head.

Her reaction was very angry to say the least. She thought I was being a “typical lad” and she accused me of being selfish, self centred and thinking I could talk to her whenever it suited me. I tried to tell her that I didn’t want to stop talking to her, but that I needed to in order for me to get over my feelings for her. You see, I was having lots of unhealthy subconscious delusions and fantasies that we would meet irl, be together and be happy and in love forever. My conscious mind knew it would never happen, but my subconscious was still crazy about her.

I kept trying to say to her that I didn’t want to hurt her. She said it was creepy that I had these emotions for her. She acted like I’d went out of my way to hurt her, which I honestly didn’t do.
All I wanted was to stop talking for a few weeks so that I could come to terms with the rejection and move on, and then I could stay friends with her. Am I the Asshole here? Have I done something wrong?

Edit: For those who want to know exactly what I said; 
I said “See ya” and when she asked what I meant, I said “I’m sorry, I don’t want to do this, but I need to remove you from my life for a few weeks to get over you. I know this will upset you but I don’t know any other way to get away from these confusing and unpleasant emotions.”"	Not enough info	0	0

c5fogy	2019-06-25 21:28:21	Tindly123	AITA for wanting to leave my lease early because my roommate is terrible, even if I found a tenant to replace me?	"Hi All,

I live in the 3BR apartment with two other females (I’m a female too), I’m relatively close to one of the people I’m living with (Let’s call her M) and I absolutely hate the other person (Let’s call her F). M and I decided that when our lease is over in 2 months we would get a 2BR apartment together. We were browsing at places and found the perfect place in terms of cost, location, and the actual apartment itself, and we have been scouting places for months. The catch was we had to move in at the beginning of next month. We decided we would leave our lease early and find two people to replace us for the last two months of the lease. We tried to find females to take over but to no avail and found a very respectable guy and girl that were willing to take over our part of the lease. 

The issue was that we had to get our roommate F’s agreement to transfer our names off the lease. Once she found out that a guy would be moving in she told us she would not sign any paperwork if a guy would be moving in. A little bit of background on F, she is an absolutely terrible roommate and the main motivation for me wanting to leave early. She never cleans up after herself and even after pleading with her to to clean or dishes or anything of the sort it will take her days to, and my roommate and l are always the ones that clean after her or tell her to do something. At this point it has been death by a thousand paper-cuts and Now she is preventing us from moving on to a great place because she refuses to share an apartment with a guy for two months. When she spends 95% of her time in the room and I have gone weeks without seeing her. 

Ultimately, I just hate that I probably will have to live with this PoS for two more months and I’ll be stuck imagining what could’ve been.

c5fmon	2019-06-25 21:25:22		WIBTA if I didn’t structure my work the way my teacher wants?	"So I’m a last year high school student with my graduation in November. So really only a few months away. 

The other day I got somewhat into an argument with my art/photography teacher over how I was structuring my written work for an internal. 

Basically she wants my photographs to be annotated with bullet points, which is definitely not my style of critiquing my own work. And have such listed the conventions used, and then gone on to explain why I think they are working. Why I don’t think they are working, and how could I possible make those conventions used stronger. 

An example of how I’ve been doing this as follows. 

Depth of field, cropping, lighting, rule of thirds, texture. 

The conventions of cropping, rule of thirds work well together, as they create a sense of closeness to the subject manner. Cropping allows us the see the subject manner up close, instead of being far away. Therefore we can see more of the texture it has. Meanwhile the rule of thirds create a natural looking image. Possibly cropping in even closer could be an interesting way of exploring more of the convention of cropping and texture. 

I don’t believe lighting is working as well as it could be, so I could try adding some artificial lights and seeing how that reacts with the subject manner. 

Meanwhile my teacher wants something like this.

Strengths
Cropping
Depth of field
Texture
Rule of thirds

Weakness 
Lighting 

And then explain how you might explore more conventions. 

This is completely different from my style of writing which is quite formal, but is apparently a pleasure to read. Which I’ve been told by many of my teachers over the years. 

But I believe the many reason she wants our class to do it this way is because she has dyslexia. We have been told this, because it can take longer for her to read through our work if we’re wanting help or something. 

Mind you this internal is due Friday, and while I still have work to do, I’m definitely not in the mood to restructure my work. 

So WIBTA if I didn’t change the structure of my work?"	No A-holes here	1	0

c5fjkp	2019-06-25 21:19:52	jephimikes	AITA for trying to whip my 18 year old into shape?	"My daughter’s been back from college for a month. Frankly, she has not been doing anything. I told her that she should get a job over the summer because we all have to work to make a living. Moreover, she’s 18, so we’re not obligated to support her anymore. While she has been taking a summer English class and has gotten A’s on her first few papers, she has said that the class doesn’t interest her, especially the Shakespeare part.

I am getting really pissed off because I think she’s acting spoiled, lazy and entitled. She isn’t getting a job and she is not engaging enough in her classes. Last night, she was lying down on her bed texting instead of writing her essay, and when I asked her what she was doing, she said that she was tired.

I told her that if she was tired, she needed to see a doctor. She didn’t really reply to that, so I told her that she frankly was not doing enough to accomplish her goals--she wants to be a doctor, yet got a B in organic chemistry, and asked her what she would do if she didn’t graduate from Berkeley. I was expecting my daughter to review material for her next organic chemistry class and told her she would never be a doctor if she didn’t step it up in her science classes (her GPA is about a 3.67 or so, and her science GPA is a 3.5). 

She later locked herself in the bathroom, and I knocked on the door multiple times to tell her to get out because I knew she was texting her friends in there to complain about me or ask for “comfort.” My wife even asked if my daughter was sending an email to a teacher/other adult to do something similar about the situation: bitch about us as her parents and ask for support. My wife didn’t really take sides--she didn’t defend my daughter but didn’t stand by me either. 

It has been a pretty stressful time for us: my wife’s mom is very sick despite having around the clock care at a nursing home and I am a research scientist trying to get a proposal together for funding--lately it hasn’t been working out.

Perhaps I should not have taken that out on my kid, but even if my research were going better, I would still be angry at her for not working productively towards her goals and complaining about her English class. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

c5filr	2019-06-25 21:18:18	normyenergy	AITA for not supporting my ex-boyfriend when his dad kicked him out of the house?	"My ex-boyfriend and I ended on bad terms. We met on an online groupchat on Discord with other kids from my HS, and started dating after he asked me out. The bad part is that he ignored how I felt for the majority of the ‘relationship” and didn’t talk to me irl at all, even on dates, he would give yes/no answers or talk to other people. I brought it up repeatedly to him and he just used it as a way to further berate himself. He had an unfortunate home life, and he frequently described his dad as verbally abusive and cruel. The only thing he ever talked about to me over text was about how horrible his father was and how his life was awful. I asked him what I could do to help, but he said there wasn’t any way. He never talked about anything other than it- it was like he was obsessed with himself having a terrible life. To everyone, it seemed like he had a pretty good life- he’s in senior level orchestra, plays multiple instruments, skipped a grade in math, maintains almost all A+s, and had a girlfriend (me). Eventually, I couldn’t handle keeping up my grades and sports while playing therapist with him daily for hours, so I broke up with him over text while encouraging him to get a professional therapist. He became desperately needy and continued to send me extravagantly long texts describing how terrible his life was, and I ended up leaving all of them on read. 
Fast forward six months later. A mutual friend told me that Ben (my ex)’s dad had told him to get out of the house. In real time, my friend told me that Ben was currently looking for a place to crash and was on the streets. The friend asked me to get on the Discord groupchat. The thing is, I live an hour away from him by car, and I didn’t know how I could help, so I said no. Frankly, dating Ben was a huge mistake and I really don’t have good feelings about him. The mutual friend insisted, and so I eventually re-joined the groupchat (which I had quit after the breakup). I wasn’t of much help since I didn’t live close by like most of the kids on the groupchat did, so I ended up quitting the groupchat again. My mutual friend is still mad at me, and Ben’s started sending me gloomy messages again since I joined/left the group chat. Did I do something wrong?

TL;DR: Ex-bf had mean father and incessantly complained about it to me. After the breakup, he was kicked out of his parents’s house and I didn’t “support” him.

Ben eventually crashed at his friend’s house who was in the groupchat and his parents came looking for him. “get out” was a bluff."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5fic0	2019-06-25 21:17:51	woohoothrow	AITA for kicking my friend out of my apartment	"I have a friend (who we'll call Joan) who occasionally makes snide remarks that ""belittle"" me and my lifestyle: I'm not sure whether Joan's comments are malicious or just indicative of her being naive. Joan comes from a ""different culture"" since she's an international student, but our ethnicity is the same; they also come from a wealthier background though she often acts like she comes from a more moderate background (which she usually makes a big deal of.)  Also, some friends of mine agree that she's not super self-aware and is a little bit ignorant, but sometimes, I feel like its more of an act.

We're in an organization together and I host a lot of get-togethers at my place, which she's invited to because she's part of the org. Every time she comes over she makes some public remark about me/my place/lifestyle in front of the whole group that I feel like attacks me. (e.g. ""Your closet is so tiny,"" or ""When was the last time you washed the sofa covers?"" or ""What is that smell?"") I always feel a little flustered and don't really know how to respond with humor/lighten up the verbal ""attack"" but I don't visibly get annoyed, esp. with a lot of other people around.

Anyways, the last time I hosted something, I told Joan beforehand something along the lines of: ""Sometimes your comments are a little embarrassing, and I'd prefer if you didn't share them in a group setting."" Later that evening, she made a joke about the aesthetic/look of my room and I just laughed but I was somewhat offended. So later that evening, I pulled her aside and asked her to leave my apartment and told her she wasn't welcome back. I did my best to be nonchalant/calm so that it didn't draw too much attention to avoid drama.  


Joan eventually told our mutual friends in the organization and they said it was wrong of me to kick her out since she didn't ""mean"" it. But I feel as though I gave her a clear chance.

c5fhim	2019-06-25 21:16:39	ThrowawayJustCuz1111	AITA-For blaming my wife?	"Context: Me and my wife have two sons, one’s 15 (Mike) the other is 8 (Ben).

My wife wanted us to take a week-long vacation, just the two of us. There was a problem, who would watch Ben? My wife suggested that we force Mike to do it. I objected, saying “Let’s be honest, this isn’t going to end well. Besides, we shouldn’t force him, he’ll just resent us”. 

My wife disagreed, saying “Considering how much money he costs, he should at least babysit for free”. I disagreed, but she still did it anyway (when I was out, after which we left. She said that she paid him for it, and I was too tired to question her.)

Turns out that I was right (in that it won’t end well). To get revenge, he:
1. Played rather vulgar music loudly, just so that Ben would hear. 
2. Repeatedly had loud sex, just so Ben would hear.
3. Told him just about every curse word, and two slurs (n-word and the f-word, the one used to insult those who are homosexual.)

I mainly blame my wife because I told her that it wouldn’t end well, but she did anyway and then lied about.

My son’s to blame as well, but he’s 15 and was justifiably annoyed, so I don’t blame him too much.

Why it might be YTA:
Sure she messed up big time, but you should at least have some sympathy. Also, why aren’t you blaming the son more? He’s the one who did it.
Why it might be NTA:
She did something that I warned her against, and then lied about it.
Why it might be ESH:
I suck for blaming her more than my son, she sucks for going behind my back, and Mike sucks for obvious reasons.

We were hanging out a few days ago and went for ice cream, and she started talking about him again and I kind of snapped at her. I basically told her that it's been 7 months and she needs to get over him, because I'm tired of hearing about it.

What happened after was total chaos. My sister basically started crying and yelling, told me I was an asshole and the worst brother ever, that I was dead to her. My mother heard all this and before dropping me off to the apartment said she isnt going to support someone who acts like that.

My other friend, let’s call her May, wanted to take her out for drinks. Since I’m under 21 I was selfish and said no, I don’t want to pay for drinks if I’m not drinking. I also didn’t want to be a babysitter. I explained to her that I only wanted to go out for a nice dinner and that’d be it, since I also had work the next morning. 

May and I agreed to split the dinner cost, and that was it. Well the day came, and May decided she wanted to take our friend to a tavern-like restaurant. I reluctantly comply, and go grab a burger. During dinner my friend got one or two drinks(she was supposed to have a party the next night, so she didn’t want to drink too much), but May went all out. May had more than a couple of drinks, and was past drunk. Which I’m not judging her for, but i didn’t want to spend the night holding May’s hair as she puked.

Our bill came, and it’s a lot more than I wanted to spend on dinner. I was thinking at most $50-70 each, but the bill ran up to about $375(which I know drinks can be expensive, but damn). I told May I’d pay for my food, and for our birthday girl’s dinner and drinks, but not May’s. May got extremely upset and wanted me to stop being “stingy” and just split the bill with her. I told her we’d settle it later, because I didnt want to fight with her right there and then, and we paid with her card. 

I ended up sending her the money for my food, and our friends food and her 2 drinks, which was roughly $100, so I sent her an even. She called me up the next day and pretty much cursed me out and sent me multiple threats through text. I’ve been ignoring her for a while now, since she told everyone I bailed on paying for dinner.

I live in a city about 300 miles away from a friend, I was texting about a month ago about replacing a table I have for my dining room. She says I HAVE TO HAVE IT FOR WHEN I GET AN APARTMENT. Currently she lives rent free with her parents. I was like yeah sure whatever -thinking this most likely will not happen as she has no plans to move out. 

Fast forward to now.. I live in a very small space, which said friend has been in and is aware of, anyway here is where the issue happens. 

I have a friend out in my current city who has virtually nothing in her apartment, and cannot afford anything at all, so I was like dude I am so sorry, you can just take this table, and she is picking it up this weekend. My far away friend approaches me that she wants to pay to stay in my city for an evening to get the table this weekend - I already have plans, and I tell her I gave it to someone in immediate need. 

She proceeds to fully have a meltdown and say how dare I, and that she is my closest friend and I have no broken a huge promise to her, to which I say you have no current plans of moving out, and it has been sitting in my small apartment for a month, and I offered it to someone with zero furniture as I felt for them, and you live at home and make great money, I believe you can afford a $250 table such as this."

But this friend is toxic. Complains more than anyone I’ve ever met, and only wants to talk about himself. If you tell a story he will not comment on it at all (not even a word), and will just immediately reply with a story about himself that he thinks is better. I used to lock my door to study when I had a heavy course load and every day i would do that he would knock multiple times throughout my study session, even though he knows I’m doing school work, so he can tell me some completely random and irrelevant thing that happened earlier, and then try to stay and talk for as long as possible. Even if he gets the hint and I’m not responding much, it’s guaranteed he’ll come back. Literally nothing is his fault. Loses in a sport? Excuse. Loses in a video game? The game was lagging but obviously only for him. Tries to guilt you into anything he wants you to do. I don’t think he has bad intentions, but that constant complaining and blaming and talking literally non stop only about himself with no interest in what you’re saying is too much. Not mention he is literally delusional, what ever he wants to be the truth because it’s comforting is the truth to him. I got different roommates but this friend still calls me all the time, and finally I have the strength to just ignore it. He lied about everything all the time for no reason, like will just make something up out of thin air for actually no reason. Other people that know him feel the exact same way, but he definitely likes me the best and wants to be good friends (probably because I put up with it for so long).

My problem is that he seems to care more about Army Vets than me. I have struggled with mental health my entire life and have been hospitalized, but never once has he cried for me. I have written him poems and letters about how much he means to me and he only says thank you. I thanked him in an important speech but he never mentioned it.

"So the main story happened fall 2016, but something recently happened that made me think of this and the moral ambiguity I still feel towards it. So back in 2016 when i was still in college it was the start of the new school year so my fraternity threw a party one of the first few weekends, when everyone was back in town and all of the freshmen were trying to party.  So things are rolling pretty solid, good stream of people in and out, and one of my brothers GF's brought some of her sorority sisters and their equivalent to a pledge (they technically weren't supposed to call them that). So i'm explaining flip cup and other drinking games to everyone and getting pretty hammered all the while. i'm casually chatting with one of those girls and I guess she found something about my drunken babbling pretty attractive and said she wanted to dance.  So we dance and make out for a little, then i stop for a min to grab another brew, I over hear in the kitchen that one of these freshmen sorority pledges has a boyfriend.  I'm thinking it's not the one i'm with cause we made out and why would she do that if shes taken (drunk me is pretty naive).  So we continue dancing but this thought is still in the back of my mind, eventually i guess it bugged me enough that i asked if she had a bf.  She takes a while to respond, and im a solid 7-8/10 drunk at the time so it must of been much longer in actuality, but she finally says no. I think all is good, i'm in the clear, it smooth sailing, no moral dilemmas to deal with here.  I get her number talk about hanging later that weekend/week, make kiss her one more time before she leaves with her friends, and like the gentleman i am I proceed to projectile vomit off of the front porch.

&#x200B;

Surprisingly that horrific goodnight farewell didn't totally tank this operation, and she actually slid in dm's on insta cause she forgot to hit save on my number.  So we start talking back and forth about the night before, and since she hit me up on IG I start stalking her pictures I lucked out cause she was actually prettier than i remembered.  But right after that came a big red flag, a ton of pictures with her and some dude, always the same guy and the most recent picture was only a few weeks old at the time.  I'm thinking he's either a really good friend, or she lied to me and that's her bf.  I start to assume the worst but she keeps texting and wants to hang out and this is where the moral dilemma arose.  I specifically asked her if she had a bf and she said no (maybe they had just recently broken up and I was the rebound), yet there's all these pictures and they're pretty recent and I have that gut feeling with up to a 98% certainty shes got a bf.  and so if she came over and we had sex would i be the asshole for, whilst being told she is single by her, know that was BS and knowingly have a potential hand in breaking up someones relationship?  She did end up having a boyfriend, i'll reply with more if someone asks, character limit."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Throws “fuck” around at all the employees when he’s mad, yells at us all, micro-manages, then turns around and tries to apologize constantly (bipolar or something). I’m the only accountant and have been given more and more non-accountant duties as I go since it’s a small business and I’m good with computer programs and general problem solving. 

I’ve been looking for more jobs with my Finance degree but obviously I’m going to take a pay cut since all I have is a bachelors and 1 year experience as accountant on my resume. I’m looking into financial advisor and other sales jobs so I can try to reach my current pay after building my customers and sales skills. 

Am I the asshole for looking to leave even if I only make 40k at the next place? My fiancé knows he’s an overstepping ass but she loves him and wishes this would work out. We have a mortgage that we can pay with a 40k salary + her bartending pay, but our budget will be tighter of course. 

Most nights I get home from work and am too depressed to enjoy my personal life.  Honestly I feel trapped by the expectations that I should stay forever.

Thanks guys and gals."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5f1st	2019-06-25 20:50:27		AITA for getting upset/uncomfortable by my girlfriend doing pot?	This past year my girlfriend has started smoking pot and telling me all about it despite me explaining that it makes me super uncomfortable and that it has really messed up my family. Earlier this week she cut our date short to go on a planned smoking meetup with a couple of my “friends” from high school that I absolutely wouldn’t trust alone around my girlfriend. Whenever I express that I’m upset or uncomfortable by stuff like this she gets furious at me and stops talking to me until I apologize. Is it my fault or is it okay for me to feel this way?		1	0
c5f198	2019-06-25 20:49:27		AITA for Ruining a Pre-Planned Sex Romp?	"So I have a story that happened about a year and a half ago. I met this woman through my job. She was very pretty, sweet and funny. One day, I built up the courage to ask her out. She readily accepted. We made plans to go on a date that weekend. I'm super excited but the day of the date she ghosted me.  The next morning I get a text and she's really sorry but her friend was in a car accident. I was still pretty upset and confused that she couldn't even send me a text letting me know what happened. She texted me a few days later asking me if we could reschedule and I agreed. The morning of the date she texted to cancel. I forgot her reason but it sounded really strange.

&#x200B;

Six months later, I got a call from her out of the blue sky. She told me she was really sorry but she was trying to get out of an abusive relationship. She told me she was moving to a town about three hours away to start over with her life. One night, I sent her a semi-steamy text and she reciprocated. I asked her if she would like it if I were to visit her so we could act out some of these fantasies. She said it sounded like a great idea. I made the 3+ hour trek to the town that she lived. She met me at the hotel room and we went to a very nice restaurant.

&#x200B;

Dinner was going well but about halfway though she started swearing like a sailor. I'm not a tabernacle choir-boy and I certainly don't mind swearing. However, we were in a very nice, intimate restaurant. The way I was raised, when you're in a restaurant, you bring your manners A-game. Especially a nice restaurant like this. I was become more and more embarrassed by the minute. I kept hoping that she would stop swearing on her own but she just kept at it. I was expecting the couple next to us to ask her to stop swearing any minute. I ever-so-politely asked her to stop swearing. She looked like she was taken aback but complied.

&#x200B;

As we were sitting outside, I tried to put my arm around her but she wasn't having it. I tried to talk about the fun things we could do in town the next day and she seemed very unenthusiastic and non-committal. I asked her why she didn't want to do anything the next day and she told me she has a job interview and has to take her friend to a doctor's appointment. I knew this was a lie. I told her I've had enough with the excuses and that I deserved an honest answer. She told me she was mortified at what I told her in the restaurant and that our date was over. I was stunned.  I walked to my car in a daze, not really knowing what to say. As we drove back to the hotel, I apologized profusely. I wasn't really sorry but I was still hoping we could make up and still have sex.  She clearly didn't want to listen to anything I had to say. I texted her that night apologizing and asking if she could possibly put it behind her. She said she'd think about it.  She texted me the next day telling me she couldn't get past it.  I thanked her for ruining my trip and wasting my time and money."		1	0
c5f0xs	2019-06-25 20:48:58	Ailishmb	AITA for being frustrated with a friend over planning a trip.	"So long story short, my bestfriend and I were thinking about doing a roadtrip to the mountains in August. Now when I mentioned this to my parents they told me it would be extremely busy and expensive to go in the summer (and this was obvi true). I understood that . My friend however, wanted to go to this one place that was the busiest and most expensive part. I told her that it would be better if we went to another part so that our bank accounts don't get damaged. She then proceeded to tell me that this place (that has mountains and gorgeous lakes and hiking trails galore) was boring to her. 

Now this shocked me because I am so grateful to be able to go the Rocky Mountains and see those kinds of views. They will never get old to me, ever. Through the 5 yrs we have been friends I never expected her to say this was boring. It makes me wonder what her values are with money and experience. (not that she should be the same as me its just ive never seen this side of her.)


What I am currently frustrated with is that I (being the only one to look up hotels to stay at) I told her that when I found out that it would cost over $1000 dollars just for a few nights and that this was the case for all parts, we would have to change our minds and think about going somewhere else. Her response to me telling her this was ""Hm"".  I am so annoyed atm because she isnt communicating well and I value money and time highly with trips so that they can be breezy and comfortable.

c5ezy6	2019-06-25 20:47:18	Quickly12	AITA for not wanting a dog to stay in our apartment	"I live in a house with 5 people total.  We’ve all been friends for a years and have a mutual friend staying with us for roughly a week’s time over the course of two weeks coming up.

This mutual friend is bringing her puppy with her and asked us if it was okay.  My roommate sent a text where she asked us “is it alright if ______ brings her puppy with her while she stays” in a house text.

The house response was “no we’d love a dog”, except for me.

Here’s the thing, I really don’t like dogs.  I know that’s an unpopular opinion, but it’s one that nonetheless is true to me.  I find them irritating and bothersome and while I generally withhold that opinion publicly and play nice at friend’s houses and when out and about, I really don’t like the idea of a dog being in our house for a week, particularly because it is a puppy and I don’t really want to be bothered by the intrusive nature of a pet in an apartment that I rent.

I followed up to the text raising concerns that 1.  Our landlord wouldn’t allow it and that I wasn’t sure if it was a good idea because we have two cats.  My roommate countered they’d hide the dog and then called me out for not liking dogs.  I pretty quickly said that was also true, and that I really didn’t like the idea of a dog being in our apartment because I do not like them.

My roommate is giving me a guilt trip, telling me to “be a good friend and help a friend out” and that I should be more accommodating and understanding of her situation.  

It’s turned into a 4 against 1 fight with a guilt trip  if my roommates telling me I’m being unreasonable and me simply stating that I don’t really want to have a dog in my apartment and that should be enough of a reason.  The idea of a puppy in our house for 7-10 days is not one I want, and I feel like I shouldn’t have to bend on that to allow someone to stay.

Am I the asshole here for my stance?  My one roommate is really digging in and telling me I am being one, and I’m conflicted on if my personal stance of not wanting to live with a dog is unreasonable.

Please set aside the “you’re an asshole for not liking dogs”.  That part I’m well aware of - but given the premise that I already DONT like dogs, am I wrong for my objection?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

They divorced about 5 years ago. My mom kept her last name for professional reasons and my mom and dad are civil to each other. My dad has a big family and one of his sisters passed quite recently. My mom has known my dad's side of the family for 40+ years and ever since the divorce, my dad's oldest sister has had issues with my mom where she never has before. 

Right before my aunt died, the whole family had gathered for a graduation party for my cousin. (this included my mom, who was invited by my cousin despite my other auntie not wanting it to happen.) 

Basically, my mom asked my dads youngest sister if she could come to the funeral or if it would cause issues and the youngest sister said, ""It would cause too much issues, honestly, you shouldn't come."" My dad said something similar. My mom searched through all her old pictures for pictures of my late aunt and gave them to my dad to have. I feel like my mom and dad are capable of being civil so his family should be able to as well. 

I told my mom we're going to the funeral. We're not going to cause drama, or issues, I just want my mom to be able to say goodbye.

c5ex4f	2019-06-25 20:42:26	ShyJasmine	AITA for getting my boss into trouble with HR for constantly disparaging millennials?	"I just wanted my boss to stop making snide remarks about millennials because his behavior was really bringing morale down for many of us younger employees.

I looked up the ADEA and researched how EEOC enforces age discrimination. Unfortunately, “reverse age discrimination” against people less than 40 years old is not unlawful, at least at the federal level. There are a handful of states that prohibit age discrimination including reverse age discrimination but we’re not in those states.

My boss makes fun of millennials regularly. He spouts the usual stereotypes about us, and has a real issue with work-life balance priorities that many people in our generation value. This has gotten so out of hand that some people have feared asking for paternity leave or time off for fear of retaliation. Since we’re not in a protected class per se, I thought maybe I can ask HR for assistance on how to prevent my boss from acting so hostile towards the younger generation of workers because his behavior is really unacceptable. 

So last week I went to HR and made a confidential report with specific instances where my boss’s toxic attitude towards millennials has created difficult work place conditions for us. I just wanted them to tell my boss to stop generalizing millennials and treating us poorly simply because of our age.

This week, I found out there is a full blown investigation and some of my co-workers have already been summoned for interview by HR. I think I made this a bigger problem for my boss than I had intended, but I noticed he has not said a single bad thing about millennials, which is highly unusual.

But, then she started flipping over smaller things. Like she would have a problem if I didn’t call her for a few days even though she would not try to contact either. Then if I called her and she missed it or hung up I should be the one to call back cause ‘she never calls people.’

I tried talking to her about this but she was super cold and didn’t care. Now I didn’t talk to her for several weeks, I didn’t make contact neither did she. We had planned a surprise for her and asked her a few things like what do you want for your birthday and who all do you want. She knew we were throwing her party cause she asked for one, but, then didn’t really care and was like I hate parties. So I decided not to do anything even though she was expecting stuff. I messaged just three words on her birthday and she called me to tell me, ‘like seriously?’ I wasn’t feeling well that day so she understood my pov and was like take care and stuff and don’t stress.

c5evw2	2019-06-25 20:40:18	realcheesemonster	AITA for not going to a Pilates class?	"Hi all! First post here, big fan, etc etc. 

Backstory: I work at a fairly large company with a gym on the premises that’s looking to expand their workout class options. I managed to get on the waiting list for some Pilates test classes, but given the popularity haven’t been added to a class yet. 

Yesterday I get a message from someone we’ll call Jane asking if I’d like to attend a class the next afternoon (today). I haven’t met or heard of Jane before, but it seems that she’s managing the student lists for the test classes. I say yes, thank you, and that I’m looking forward to it. Totally normal, if short, conversation. 

When I arrive at work today, I find out that a meeting I need to attend has been scheduled over Pilates class. I sigh a quick sigh, send off a little note to Jane explaining I won’t be able to attend and why, and go about my day. Maybe half an hour later I get a response from Jane saying, essentially, “that’s a real bummer, when you commit to something you should commit, and now it’ll be really hard to find someone to replace you”.

I’m sure this sounds petty, but I feel like I’m going crazy - AITA for not trying to reschedule the meeting to attend class?

Potentially important notes:
Jane and I have never met
I informed Jane that I wouldn’t be able to attend class between 4 and 5 hours before class was scheduled to start
It can be difficult to schedule meetings where I work, as schedules are often very busy
These classes have between 20 and 30 attendees, so it’s not a super small group or a 1-1 session or anything
The classes are, at least for right now, free"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I suspect she's doing that to get me to ""chase"" her, so I just end up going into the store next door to wait for her. 

We end up going back to the hotel separately, and later on she gets even more mad at me, telling me that I abandoned and left her on her own in a foreign country (mind you this is a very safe first-world metropolitan city, not some crime-riddled warzone).

"so an hour or so ago, i was at a restaurant that just opened up, so it was really busy. the way that the restaurant was structured was that the line backed for the cashier up and obscured the entrance to the self-service kiosks. when i entered, i waited in line for a bit and then noticed that the kiosks were completely open but obscured by the line so i cut through the line to go to the self service kiosks. i didn't know what my brother wanted to order, so i waved my hand above the line to get my brother over to order his food. 

after i did that and my brother came over, some girl left the restaurant and then knocked on the window in front of us, made eye contact, and flicked us off. i took that as a sign that i shouldn't have gone to the kiosk even though they were open, so i left. the kiosks were empty for a while after that. i went to the back of the cashier line, but other people were entering the restaurant and going straight to the kiosks.

my brother was calming me down in line because i have a bit of an anxiety issue and was panicking, and he said that we weren't at fault for going there, and that the girl was just looking to flick someone off. however, everyone does things for a reason, so i feel like i must have done something wrong.

He and his in-laws are on vacation in a beach-house nearby where I live, so I’m going up to see them tomorrow. Typically, I see my brother about once every six weeks, as he lives about two hours away. The last time I visited (about three weeks ago), his oldest son was really into being a hockey goalie (we played knee hockey and he was the goalie, and we also played with little hockey figures, where he was the goalie). 

When I got back to my house I decided to buy him some street hockey goalie pads, because I find this interest really cool, and want to encourage it. They came in the mail, and the box measures 7”x10”x10” (it’s a small box, like the size of a toaster). I told my brother that I’m excited to bring the goalie pads with me tomorrow to give to his son, and he told me that since he’s packing for a family of four for a full week that he literally doesn’t have room for them in the car. He and his wife had their in-laws carry some of their family stuff, and had to leave some stuff behind as their own car was too full to bring everything that they wanted to.  He said that I can bring them, but that if the box doesn’t fit he’s going to leave them behind at the beach house. 

I told him that I think that’s a dick move, as part of the reason I was driving up to visit was that I was excited about giving his son the pads. I also thought it was a dick move that his response would be to leave them behind. For additional context, I’m moving out of my apartment mid-July and into a smaller space meaning that a) I’d prefer to not have to bring the box with me and b) Because of the craziness of moving I’m not sure when I’m going to get a chance to see my brother again, and bring them directly to his house.

c5enzf	2019-06-25 20:26:58	mashchaii	WIBTA For Hiding My Money From My Mother	"I'm gonna make this as brief as possible, so please excuse any kind of jumps in the story. I'm more than happy to answer any info requests.

Okay so, my mother and I have an unhealthy relationship to put it bluntly. She's mentally ill and depends on me heavily to take care of her, my disabled sibling, and the house. In the words of my own grandfather, I'm a live in nanny without pay.

Part of her illness is very severe manic episodes that cause her to spend what little money we have very carelessly. After it's over, she blames me for not stopping her (I try so hard it never works) and the result is us being tight on cash for the rest of the month (which I'm also blamed for).

My paternal grandmother has begun to send me a bit of money every month. It's quite a lot for me (100-200$ altogether in a month), and I'm extremely grateful. My mother has caught wind of this and now expects me to pay for a lot of stuff. She has done it slyly though, like telling me all about something she wants her and I to do (most recently it was tanning) and then drops the bomb that I'll pick up the tab. Usually I'm able to say no but sometimes she forces me to go anyways. She'll also guilt trip me about how she shouldn't have to pay for so much stuff (fyi she gets child support for both of us) and I should help her out. Which of course I usually bend and break to her will. If I don't, like I said it doesn't matter. She'll just do it anyways and her telling me was just to be polite. She's the mother and I am a child (I'm 17), it is her way and that's final. Her words.

She has also told me to call my grandmother to tell her to put more on the card. Usually it's to pay for something she hasn't told me about yet. If I say no, she gets very angry at me for disrespect and will do it herself. My grandmother is very sensitive to our needs and she always does it.

So, reddit, what do you think? Would I be an ass if I began literally hiding the money from her? This would be the first time I've ever majorly stood up to her and it's gonna be big. 

The reason I'm so conflicted is because she is a single mom trying her best (my dads a deadbeat and my brothers dad is unstable) and me withholding a means of funds just seems kinda cruel.

It's also worth saying shes unemployed, but that's because of her disabilities. I'm seeking employment but it's hard to obtain and I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing, but its okay. Soon I'll get one and save up so I can get out of this prison.


EDIT: Thank you guys so much for the feedback. I will definitely go forward with my idea. You guys have made me see that I was just blinded by the guilt she's instilled in me. It's time I put my foot down."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So a couple of weeks ago, the girlfriend and I go out with some friends and everyone but me (DD duties) got pretty trashed. On the drive home, my girlfriend decides she is going to vomit but catch it in her hands instead of going out the window and you can imagine what that ended up looking like. 

I rush home, get everyone out of the car and try and clean up the mess as best I can but there are still vomit stain on parts of the leather seats and the door panel. At this point I know it has to get some professional cleaning. 

Now, I have only gotten my car “detailed” once before and it was a pretty standard affair where I paid money and they completely cleaned my car. So, I go to this place and expect the same thing. I pull up and the person working the front asks what service I want. I open up the door and say I need the best cleaning package they have because I have a bunch of stains on my door and seats . They tell me it is $220 for the “full detail” and it will take 3 hours to complete, so I pay and go on my way. 

Fast forward three hours and I go to pick up the car and the detailer asks to see me . I am thinking that the seats are ruined or something but he shows me a pristine looking car.  Then he asks if there was vomit on the seat and I told him yep but he did a great job getting that dried stuff out. 

Now he starts getting angry with me saying that vomit stains are not included in the package and that I didn’t tell anyone and that he could have gotten sick. I am super confused and the manager comes out and asks why I didn’t say anything. I said I didn’t know TO say anything and that I figured the full detail covered everything (plus I showed her the stains). Now everyone is pissed at me, I am embarrassed , and not sure if I am in the wrong. I just told them I want to get out of there and tipped the detailer $20.

My boyfriend asked if I wanted to go for my birthday next month and I said of course, I even have a Bring-A-Friend coupon so it'll be free entry for both of us. 
I went to my hometown this weekend with my family. My mom's boyfriend has a fourteen year old son that lives in another state and came into town, he hasn't gone since he was like 8. Me being the only one in the family that likes rollercoasters, he asked me to go with him and I said yes. Of course. 
So I call my boyfriend today all excited, and say ""Guess where I am"" 
Him - ""Where?"" 
Me - ""Six Flags!! Jay's kid wanted to come so I came with.""
Him- ""Oh well okay.. we're going for your birthday so why would you go right now?""
Me - ""Well it's not like I haven't been here a million times. I'll be just as excited to go for my birthday. I love it here.""
Him - "" yeah well who the fuck goes somewhere they're already going to go to right before hand?"" 
Me - ""Eww. Well I called you to share my excitement with you and you're being an asshole right now I don't really want to be on the phone anymore""

c5emny	2019-06-25 20:24:43	downvoteforwhy	AITA for being direct at my friends GF for sitting in my seat?	"I know the title seems childish but my friends girl friend constantly sits in my seat when I get up... at my own house. She kind of wears the pants in the relationship so my friend kind of has her back as nonchalantly as he can like “cmon man let her sit there”

How it happened was we have about 5 seats in my backyard and every once and a while someone will have to sit on the concrete garden bench next to the fire pit. We do have a bench with three more seats from the same patio set and whenever I see this situation arrive I usually tell whoever showed up to grab the bench they just need to move it to the table. This happened to my friends girlfriend and she was sitting on the concrete seat, not sure/can’t remember why my friend didn’t get up for her. 

This girlfriend is generally a pain in the ass to be around for many reasons but she has her good moments, except when it comes to respecting where someone was sitting apparently. I get up to let my dog out with us and call fives on the seat because I could feel her waiting for me to get up. Once I was inside I turned around about 70% sure she was going to take my seat and sure enough she did. I let my dog out and tell her to get out of my seat, she starts out by brushing me off, I tell her again to get out of my seat she asks me “Really?!” I tell her yeah really “I called fives” (I know it’s a bit childish). She gestures to the concrete bench and says why can’t u sit there? This is where I got really mad and told her that if I were at her house I would never take her seat because I’m aware that it’s incredibly rude. 

She eventually got up and got really mopey and now my friend kind of shakes his head at me for upsetting her. Once they went to smoke with my brother my other friend told me everyone told her not to take my seat. They know how upset I get at this and she has done this at least three times before. 

TLDR friends girlfriend stole my seat, I yelled at her, now my friend is kind of mad at me and she mopes around in my pretense AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5ellu	2019-06-25 20:22:47	faux-fox-paws	AITA for not wanting to ask clients for social security numbers?	"I'm an admin assistant at a small doctor's office. I'm responsible for getting a prospective new patient's intake information over the phone, as well as reviewing the paperwork they fill out when they get to the office. 

One bit of information we ask for is the social security number.

It hasn't always been 100% mandated that we collect the social--some patients are kids whose parents don't know the number off hand, and some would just rather not write it down. I've never been comfortable asking people for it. It's sensitive information and we keep *most* of our records on paper. I'm not saying it's super-likely that someone would try to sneak a look at patient files, but I *am* saying that exact thing happened with a former member of the cleaning staff. If the wrong person knew where to look, hundreds of people's social security numbers would be up for grabs.

So, I don't ask new patients for the number over the phone. A lot of them will fill it in on the paperwork when they get here, but some skip. If they ask if it's all right that they leave it blank, I tell them they're not legally required to fill it in. 

I've been getting a little push back on this for the past few months. The general manager says that we *need* this information for billing purposes. I've told him that I've done research and that clients aren't legally obligated to give it to us (we only accept a handful of commercial insurances, so we're not seeing Medicare patients, who I believe *do* have to give their SSN). He argues back that we'd need the number if a patient goes to collections, or to look up their insurance if their member ID is wrong. 

It's my understanding that you can be sent to collections without a social, and that if an insurance company needs it for billing, *they* can ask you for it. 

I've continued to not ask for them. Today, an office-wide memo came out. One of the part-owners of the practice is saying that we need to make sure *every* patient has a SSN on file. She referred to this as a ""serious issue"" and says that it's to blame for a lot of the office's financial issues. 

I still don't want to ask clients for a SSN. I'm committed to leaving this job soon, but not immediately. I can live with being fired from here, tbh. I just feel that so many places ask for your SSN and it's not always great to just give it out. I don't want to encourage that kind of habit, nor do I want to see a patient's personal information compromised. Am I just being stubborn?

TL;DR: The doctor's office where I work wants me to ask for social security numbers, but I don't, because it seems ill-advised. They're doubling down and so am I. AITA?

Edit: I'm also willing to compromise and ask for the last 4 digits. Does this seem fair?

Second edit: So far, it seems pretty unanimous that ITA. Those of you who said I need to do my job as instructed are right--it's either that or leave. A doctor's office isn't a place to trot around on a moral high horse, who knew! Thanks for the responses.

Third edit: Despite how things look, I swear my actions are *not* a personal attack against people working in insurance. I don't mind at all being in the wrong, but please realize that this case of assholery came from a place of ignorance, not willful idiocy. Much appreciation to those who called me an asshole with respect and objectivity.

I think its pretty obvious where im going, im debating between asking if i can have it back, offer to buy it back (but i dont think they would let me, they would insist in that case for me to just get it) or just save more money and buy one from a stranger (but they would know about that, they are really close, and would probably ask why i didnt ask for my old one).

To explain why I want to change my name you need to know that my parents are absolutely awful people who care more about heroin than their children. They've done nothing for me growing up and I had to leave as soon as I turned 16 to get away from them which led me to living in a hostel and struggling for awhile.

I've decided that I want nothing to do with them including sharing their surname or the name they chose for me.

I have thought about this quite a bit and I love the name Wolfgang, it just has a nice ring to it and I like the meaning behind it too.

My girlfriend says the name is childish and to pick something better as she can't see herself calling me that, she said if I change it that she will still call me my normal name. I even told a friend about it and he said it was a really good name and sounded quite impressed with the choice.

So even though it may annoy my girlfriend should I change my name to Wolfgang or should I choose something I like a bit less to make her happy?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c5egpl	2019-06-25 20:14:41		AITA for not inviting my friend to my best friend’s surprise party?	"Last month, my best friend turned 18. Me and my group of friends (four of us, not including my best friend) all planned to hang out at her house and give her gifts to celebrate, and we made this agreement with my best friend. However, the day of her birthday, her mom rang me and another friend (we are the closest people to my best friend) and told us that she was having a last minute surprise birthday party for her at a restaurant. My best friend had no clue this was happening, we all surprised her, and she was so happy and excited. 

However, the next day, the two girls who my friend’s mom didn’t invite left all the group chats we had, ignored us completely and wouldn’t speak to my best friend because they weren’t invited to the surprise hang out. They gave my friend a 10 dollar gift a week later, and completely ignored us. They also wouldn’t speak to me or the other girl that was invited.

I’m not sure why they took all the anger out on me, the girl who was invited and my best friend because NONE of us had anything to do with the organization of the party, it was extremely last minute, and my friend’s parents wanted to keep the party small since they have 8 other children and were having it at a restaurant.

I have filled in on occasion, but I politely refused and told her I wouldn’t do it. 

My mom’s argument is that I should want to do it because it’s the right thing to do, and that I’m being selfish because God has given me a gift. My dad is supporting her and saying that I’d be paid so I should just do it for the money.

These plans revolve around a sport they all enjoy. I don’t share this interest but my boyfriend wants me there and I enjoy being supportive. I also love his friends.  


However, I do have difficulties: I‘m more introverted but am very sociable  while I’m there despite not really understanding the sport. There are also times my boyfriend & co. are busy and I’m left feeling alone and awkward. This interest also requires being out from early morning to late night. While I overall enjoy my time I have to admit I get very physically and mentally drained. 


Recently we shared a room with his friends for the very first time after one of these days. I was exhausted but unable to relax because I felt I had to continue being social. I also couldn’t sleep as other people in the room were making loud noises and being restless throughout the night. 


This resulted in me being uncharacteristically tired and irritable the next day. I tried to not let it show but boyfriend noticed so we talked about it and I expressed the above to him. He said he would always keep in mind having our own room moving forward. 


Plans are coming up that my boyfriend would like me to join and after checking with me he is planning on booking us a separate room even though his friends are sharing a space together again. 


While this is what I want I feel bad; I apologized for making things more troublesome for him because he couldn’t spend as much time with his friends, had to go an extra step for accommodations, and so on.


He told me I wasn’t being troublesome, he didn’t mind either way, and that his most important concern was my happiness and comfort.

c5ed95	2019-06-25 20:08:17	80sMusicAndWicked	AITA for arguing with my mother over her homeopathic medicine	"Sorry if this is a bit rambling, I'm just going to launch in to it. About a year ago my mother got an operation for arthritis in one of her toes. It went ok but unfortunately she suffered from nerve damage because of it. Luckily with some time and that bioil stuff, the pain and scar have faded quite a lot, as she got some pills and stuff. At the same time she also got into homeopathic medicine and other things like that; acupuncture, physiotherapy, dodgy supplements, Epsom salt foot baths, mixed essential oils, Etc. I don't support or believe in that type of medicine, and made my stance pretty clear (Yes I did try to convince her they were mostly fake) but whatever, it didn't affect me and I guess the placebo effect can kind of work.

However, one of the things she tried is this energy healing thing called reiki which she really seemed to like and she said it helped her quite a lot. One thing the apparent healer told her at the end was that she could take reiki classes and learn to be a practitioner, which I thought was just a bit of a scam to take money from her, but again, she didn't really want to hear it from me. So she took the class and gained her level one in reiki. This gave her 'the right' to practice on family and in fact she needed to practice to earn her next level. Well, my dad was ok in supporting her but me and my sister made it quite abundantly clear we didn't like being touched like that. Reiki involves sort of stroking the body to locate areas of pain which we're definitely not very good with that kind of thing.

The problem was, she REALLY kept going on about it, pushing us to accept, even when we constantly refused. She would constantly get into bad moods and strops when we didn't. We both agreed once when she said she would stop if we told her we felt uncomfortable with it. But when we did, she just got even more mad and even punished us, restricting phone use, Etc. when we disagreed. One day as I finished revising for my exams, she literally came up to me and just started doing it to me, stroking my shoulders and back. I felt uncomfortable but there wasn't much I could do and I was tired of being randomly punished about it. But really it was the final straw.

At breakfast the next morning I just burst out with it when the topic was broached- how it was a scam, it was stupid, irresponsible, how she used to be sensible (she works in VAT) and we got into a really big argument. She ended up in a terrible mood and just confiscated everything from me. My dad said I should have just kept my opinion to myself but I was tired and she just crossed the limit with the whole reiki thing. So, reddit I really need your opinion- AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I am of the opinion that Jar Jar binks is the true sith lord and slowly gave examples of talking back to elders and questioning their reasoning around anakin to get him to the dark side . (More on youtube if you want to know about it) Anyway, word has gone around that my niece isnt actually my brothers daughter and is someone elses kid but nobody has ever actually spoken up about it. 

Reasons we all have been angry about lately: 
1. My niece never ever had a birthday party or celebration of her achievements while her brother is given everything, new Ipad, money and games the whole 9 . My niece? Few toys and a couple balloons 
2. This month was her birthday again, small gathering . Her brother had a first communion just a few days later and a huuuuge celebration . 
3. Her clothes is much more raggedy looking than her brothers and doesnt nearly get as much attention.  
4. They pulled her out of the only thing she enjoyed gymnastics,  so her brother could be on a soccer team . 
5. Her weekends this summer? Spent at her brothers soccer games. 

I could go on and on about little discrepancies, but to counter all of this Ill talk about it with my parents in front of her . Things like "" they give my nephew everything and dont give her anything"" .."" its not his fault they treat her like that I dont want her to hate her brother for how her parents treat her""  . Im basically instilling in her that her parents are treating her unfairly and shes began to talk about it a lot more lately when her dad is around . How my nephew always gets more this and that ,and that his birthdays are better and he gets better christmases and so forth . 

She'll complain to my dad now her grandpa and he's very blunt and loves her so he'll go and argue with her dad about how its not right that they treat her so different.  And its caused a lot of tension between them personally. But my nephew and niece love me, they tell me everything and I mean everything,  and they trust me like no other adult and take my opinion very seriously.  I just never directly give it to them if they ask. Ill just say ""its not right for me to talk to you about other people, because you need to see these things for yourself.

c5eckk	2019-06-25 20:06:57	nicoleinatorx69	"AITA if I tell my moms "" boyfriends "" wife about their affair?"	"Basically my mom has had this relationship with a guy we'll call Scott, and he's married to a "" carol "". Scott goes over to her apartment twice a week and they go on romantic drives and other stuff. She swore they never did anything sexual but they've sent multiple dirty texts and pictures back and forth. She has this idea that it's NOT an affair and she isn't the other women because he's going to tell Carol he wants a divorce. He's been saying this for 8 months and I'm 99% sure the wife has no idea what's going on, they've been married since after high school as well. my mom also justifies it by saying his wife is abusive, ugly and terrible to him.

I'm pretty hardcore against cheating and am disgusted with the situation and now being told and involved. If I was carol I would wish ANYBODY in the world would tell me this so I could leave the guy. I'm really flustered on maybe telling her or just minding my own business and keeping away from it.

EDIT TO CLEAR THINGS UP:one) I'm not involved in her sex  life, I only found out about the texts when she was in the hospital in and out of consciousness and asked me to grab her phone and text Scott that she was okay. When I went to text him, the last messages were pictures and the inappropriate texts. I saw this totally by accident and she has no idea I even know.

two) I was introduced to him as a friend, then a boyfriend of sorts who was separated and getting a divorce, I only recently found out that was not the truth and he is in fact no separated.

Three) My mother and I aren't that close and actually don't see each other frequently. The relationship is unhealthy and that's WHY I keep a distance from her but when we do talk it's typically about how life is going and whose she's seeing and such. I'm also an adult so telling me she has a boyfriend isn't a bad thing, we don't speak about their issues or anything, this is all I really know about him."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

&#x200B;

Back in March, G started talking to a man, P, who was going to buy a house in our area, and rent it for $750/month (3 bed, 2 bath house in California, mind you) to G. Two weeks ago, P sent G a standard rental lease, which included: a cleaning deposit, a note that rent might increase by 10% for each year she lives there after the first year, a hard limit to no more animals, the requirement that any other adults (18+ years old) must be added to the rental contract if they move in with her, and that there would be inspections of the property.

&#x200B;

G called P on speakerphone while I was sitting next to her. She yelled(!!) at P that his rules were shit, and went off. P tried to tell her this was a standard rental lease, she yelled at him again, told him to go fuck himself, and she didn't want the house and he could rent it to whoever he wanted. She hung up on him, and when he called back, she answered the phone with ""Fuck you, P, I don't want anything to do with you again. Don't ever contact me.""

&#x200B;

My partner and I are looking for a new place to rent, too (under hard deadline). We reached out to P last Tuesday. I asked if he was renting the house he'd bought to G. P said he never would. I asked him to reconsider, letting him know she was under a lot of stress. P said that the way she spoke to & treated him was unacceptable & that he wasn't going to rent to her. We asked P if he would rent to us. He said he would, at fair market value for the place. I tried to talk to G every day, but she never responded to anything.

&#x200B;

After a week of ignoring P, G called P up and asked when she could plan on moving into the house. P told her that he was going to rent to us instead, as he didn't want her as a tenant

.

G got upset with me, and began yelling at me for being such a bad friend. She said that P would never have rented to us if I hadn't ""stolen it"" out from under her . She told me I was a shitty person and an asshole, and that she couldn't believe I was going to make her and her children homeless etc. 

&#x200B;

I told G that friends don't talk to each other like that. She said, ""Well I guess I'm not your friend, cause I'll say whatever the fuck I want and if you don't like it, we ain't friends."" I told G, ""We don't have to be friends. But since you're no longer my friend, I need to know when you'll be making payments on the car we've been letting you drive since March."" G hasn't said a thing to me since.

I am young. Like so young, my parents have to pay for me to go to places like arcades. There is an arcade near my house (called Cactus Pete's. Go check it out.) and I know the owner on a personal level, for he is one of my dad's best friends. I helped him advertise when he first opened up and still do. To pay me back, he said I can go for free one time. Now it cost $25 to play for 60 min, so that is good that we get save money. 

The problem is, my mom always pays for it because I am just a kid. I'm the one who did the advertising and I want to ask my mom to pay me the money instead of not having to pay for the 60 min. In my head that makes sense, but I feel sick every time I think about doing this.

I never 'earned' any money, so should my mom have to pay me for getting her something for free?"	Asshole	0	0

When I was 7 years old she left my family and wasn't in our lives for years... I am now 31 and this is the first time since I was young that she's really been around. That being said, Last night she had a bit to drink and ended up having a mental breakdown in front of me and my niece and to be honest it made us both uncomfortable. She was crying like crazy and saying thing about the past and what not. I went to my roommate who was in him room at the time, and asked him to please not come and listen to our conversation until I can get her to relax and calm down. I felt that it was really personal and that I would like us to have a bit of privacy as we deal with it. Right after I left his room he came out of his room shortly after and sat on the couch petting my dog and just sat there and listened to her talking about personal family issues. This made me lose a lot of respect for him since I just asked him nicely if he can give us some privacy. I understand this is his home too, but am I wrong for asking him to do that?? what do you guys think?	Not the A-hole	1	0

Oh all the wasted hours I went to church for and was not allowed to access the internet! I resent it.

I want retribution for it but I don't know what. It's almost like I want money but I don't want to be greedy. Plus our income got cut by a K for reasons I will not list.

Me and my friend took a selfie on our phones, not a serious selfie, more of a joking around selfie.

One of the guys started to get weird with us saying weird stuff which we just laughed off and continued with our conversation.

Me and my sister went to the garage to get some things for my mom. I thought it'd be funny so I turned off the lights while me and my sister were in and she started screaming and saying she's afraid of the dark. (which she's never told or shown before so I thought she was faking it) I looked for the light to try and turn it on because I couldn't see where it was. Then randomly the door shut, we got locked in and my sister started screaming even more. The thing is, there's a key on the indoor of the garage in case this happens so all we had to to do was turn the light on. I managed to find the light so I turned it on and opened the door. My sister hits me so many times saying that it wasn't funny. We got back into the house and she told my mom. My mom starts blowing it out of proportion imo and telling me how I have no remorse.

c5e0x9	2019-06-25 19:44:57	drastile75	AITA for being upset that my sister missed my graduation?	"Okay so this actually happened a while ago, but it still comes up pretty regularly so I need to know if I'm being TA.

My sisters (I have 3) were all pretty close growing up. The sister I am referring to was the closest. However, she has a tendency to get in relationships, fully invest herself in the guy, start shaping her personality and interests around him, then forget about most everyone else in her life. She has been doing this since high school. Inevitably, she gets her heart broken, we all come to her aid and offer support, then she gets back with the guy and resents us for not being supportive of her relationship with him and saying mean things about him (that she also said) while they were broken up. It gets pretty frustrating, so most of us have just stopped weighing in on her relationships and we have mostly grown apart.

The drama starts when I was in my senior year of college. I am getting ready to graduate (first in my family) and my entire family is going to be there. I don't usually care too much about this stuff, but I was excited to have everyone together. About a month before the ceremony, I text my sister asking her something about the weekend, and she tells me she isn't going. She explains that she has to go to her boyfriend's son's soccer game - her bf is the coach, and she feels that she needs to support both of them. I get annoyed at this and make a remark that it's more important to support family, and she blows up that her bf and his son ARE her family and are the biggest part of her life. I find this ridiculous and will admit that I said some pretty candid things about how she always does this - alienates herself from her family in order to make a relationship out to be more than it is. She loves to play the victim, and I didn't hold back in telling her this. It turns into a huge argument, and our relationship has never really recovered.

Fast forward to now, and my other two sisters have also had their own similar fights with her. There is definitely a pretty huge division between the 3 of us and her, and my graduation comes up regularly as an example of how she has brought this upon herself. She has never apologized for this incident or for not attending my graduation. I think she believes that she made the right choice to go to the soccer game. AITA for not forgiving her and letting this drive a wedge between us? 

tl;dr My sister chose her boyfriend's son's baseball game over my graduation, and I have not forgiven her. AITA?

c5dxzf	2019-06-25 19:39:30	BlokblokRecipe12	AITA for being upset that my sister got all the nice jewelry from my grandmother?	"Recently my grandma passed away. I didn't get to see my grandma very often; she lives on the West coast, and we are on the East coast. Though I don't have remember a lot, I've loved being with her whenever I could. In my grandma's older years she loved to collect jewelry. When I was younger, if we were visiting her and it was Sunday and I had to wear a dress she'd give me and my sister some nice costume jewelry to wear. It was always very fun and I loved even as a child getting to hang out with granma and get ""gussied up"" for church.

The reason I'm posting this is because when I was 13, a cousin got married and and she was having a very elegant wedding, and I remember my older sis (15) having a nice necklace to wear, yet my mom never got anything for me. She took me and my sister out to a department store and everything she held up for my sister was ""Stunning"", whereas everything I looked at or picked up ""wasn't right for me"". So I didn't get anything, and didn't really think about it until now. My granma saw me without anything except my dress and a watch, so she went to her room to give me a string of pearls to wear to the wedding dinner. I didn't ask for them, nor did I complain about the fact I didn't have jewelry; she just gave it to me to wear for the evening, which I was highly appreciative of. When the party was winding down and I went to thank my grandmother and give her back the pearls, she told me one day, when I was older, if I'd like to, I could have it to keep when I get married.

Now my grandmother has passed, and pretty much everything was left to my mother. Mom found all the jewelry and told me and sister that once we get back home, she'll go through it with us and split it up. I was really happy at the idea, but all I wanted was the pearl necklace and the one cross necklace grandma let me borrow for church and dinner.

Fast forward to now, and my mother apparently decided to divvy up the jewelry according to her whims and God, I feel awful for saying this, but my mom gave me a box of my grandma's ""chunky"" costume jewelry. I didn't want to sound greedy or unappreciative so I just said ""thank you mum, I'll find a place for these."" I did inquire as to the where the pearl necklace was, but my mother said ""someone else wanted that and you already have so much from Grandma,"" and emotions are still running high so I didn't want to press the issue.

And then I was helping my sister clean and she started sorting the necklaces and oh, She had the pearl string and *a lot* of the other nice pieces my grandmother owned. I mentioned ""oh, this is the pearl string I wore to cousin's wedding!"" And my sister seemed to snap at me(?), which she never does, and said that mom had given it to her and if I wanted to borrow it, I had to get her and mom's permission and I could only take it out to church and I had to bring it straight home and back to her.

c5dw1d	2019-06-25 19:35:43	Hyperjansson	AITA for ghosting most of my friends due to their religion	"Soo. My wife and I just had our first child, and we couldn’t be happier about it! We both have a strict religious background and that brings us all here.

First of all, that religion is extremely conservative about everything (for example birth control, listening to rhytmic music and even watching TV is forbidden). We both have religious families and they have brought us into that cult. However, my wife and I decided that we will not raise our child with their rules, because we don’t believe in those. Almost all of our friends are from that religion too and all of my friends are very conservative. We have no problem telling this to my wifes friends, because they are very open-minded about these things, but my friends are the problem.

They stalk me and remind me if I haven’t attented in cults events and act like they are worried about the strength of my faith. I haven’t told them, that we don’t believe like they do anymore, because i’m afraid that they try to effect to my parents and siblings who are still in that shit. So in conclusion I have decided, that I will ghost them out of our lives. We already have moved to other town because my school is here, and i haven’t called them in few months. They have been calling me few times, but I haven’t answered them. I heard from some other people that my ”friends” have already spoke about me and my wife, that we are serving the wrong god and turning our backs to the realms of god.

So I just want to find the answer that am I being the asshole here, or should I be satisfied with my decision to keep my child apart from all of this?

Edit: Since few of you have asked about the religion, here are some ”rules” they have:

- no alcohol
- no rhytmic music
- no TV or movies or anything
- no opera or theatre
- no dancing (causes lust apparently)
- no premarital sex
- no birth control (I have 9 siblings)
- no moving together before marriage
- no kissing before marriage
- no swearing
- no make-up
- no pearcings or coloring your hair
- no drugs

c5dvsx	2019-06-25 19:35:19	highbyewhy	AITA for telling one of my employees that her achievements aren't important?	"I manage an office of a financial services firm. Recently I was to put forward someone for a senior analyst role. There are two in our office who I thought would fit the bill. 

Emma is a lovely young girl who was different as soon as she walked in. Most applicants for our positions have relevant degrees. A few of them apply with degrees that aren't anything to do with the industry, but it's very rare for someone to apply with no degree at all. She left school at 16 with her GCSE's which were acceptable but not exceptional. In spite of this she managed to secure an entry level role with a much smaller company. She paid to study and complete her certifications herself and is the most enthusiastic, dedicated and hard working person in the office. First person the office every morning and often the last to leave. In a depressing industry like this her enthusiasm is brilliant. 

Alice a graduate from an elite university, and even among her peers her performance was exceptional. She was headhunted as soon as she graduated and the company paid for her certifications. She isn't as hardworking as Emma though. Numerous times I've seen her on her phone or using facebook or instagram on her work computer and have had to tell her to do some work. There have also been some problems with behaviour. She's a pretty girl who walks around like she owns the place. She made fun Emma when she first joined which I nipped in the bud, and argued with the admin girl. I also gave her a formal warning after she verbally abused one a man from from IT for taking too long to sort something for her. 

For the promotion I thought that Emma deserves it, but on the flipside, Alice is more talented than Emma. In the sense that during a high-stress period in which everyone is working to their limits, Alice can produce results far quicker than Emma, but on the flipside Emma can still get the job done sufficiently, and on a normal day she makes far more effort than Alice. I've been in this industry long enough to know that those who make no effort and rely solely on natural talent crash and burn fairly soon, hence why I put Emma's name forward for the promotion. 

When Alice found this out today she came into my office saying she thinks I made a bad decision, and that the post is more suited to her than it is Emma. I tried to reasonably explain why I made my decision, but it got to the point where she was saying that the fact that she was an elite student who was given the job proves that she deserves it more. I then clearly stated that what she achieved when she was a teenager do not make her more deserving of something that depends on much more than that. She then left my office upset and was down for most of the day. When she was heading home she was clearly close to tears. 

While I absolutely don't regret choosing Emma, I feel like I may have belittled Alice's achievements."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5dv4q	2019-06-25 19:34:00	TheHost1995	AITA for making the girl I was babysitting eat her lunch off the floor?	"Let me start out by saying I  (23F) have been babysitting now for 11 years. I work in early childhood education and a church doing children's ministry. I LOVE children, I love educating, raising, and learning form children. I have never yelled at a child, said anything hurtful (I will say things to make them think like ""You are not behaving like a leader"") and would probably be caught dead laying a hand on a child.

&#x200B;

Well I have been babysitting for a family of two; a six year old girl and a three year old boy. The family is wealthy, but they live like they weren't proud of their home (house is a mess every time I come to babysit). The parents both work, but the grandmother lives in the basement however the parents don't like to leave the kids alone with her for long periods of time (ore than an hour). This family doesn't seem to be organized at all, and it is clear the kids have not been disciplined in any way... In the beginning they were what most would call ""demon children"" they would scream, throw things, lock you in a room... etc.  However, I made it really clear this is not going to be accepted. After the first week of babysitting (Friday&Sat night) they really began to behave. Months went by, while it was a struggle they learned how to behave whenever I babysat.

&#x200B;

OK-- so the last time I babysat was rough. It was a Saturday morning, and the rule was this ""If you clean up after play-time, we will make slime after lunch."" Well the kids didn't clean up, so I said ""no slime."" Both the kids cried and begged for slime. Lunch came around, and the boy had gotten over the crying and even cleaned up. The girl however was still upset and started yelling at me telling me she was going to hit me if I didn't let her make slime (this is after ""running away"" and us having a talk). I asked her if it would make me happy or sad if she hit me, and she said ""I don't care, I'm going to hit you."" She then proceeded to take a towel and slap me hard with it out of her rage. I was fine, but I told her to go to her room, and that she was to eat lunch in her room to think about what she did.

&#x200B;

I  made lunch ( grilled cheese with mash-potatoes and veggies) I brought her her lunch, and she then threw the plate across the room causing the food to go everywhere. She then demanded a new plate. I said no. She said she was hungry and I said ""your food is on the floor, pick it up that is your lunch.""

She began to cry and scream at how rude I was to her. She did pick up the food and she did end up eating it. After that she took a nap and she was fine afterwards.

&#x200B;

I told my friends about this (we are in education) and a couple of them said that it was abusive of me to make her eat off the ground. They kept telling me that she's just a kid. I feel horrible if i truly am abusive, I would be up for therapy and help to understand how this was wrong. AITA here?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I did tell the parents, they seemed ashamed but not surprised. They've been in the home when I've told the kids they  have to eat their food before desert. They know that while I'm kind, I don't just let the kids run the house.

Also, I told her to pick up her plate and pick up the food because that was her lunch. I didn't make her eat off the floor like a dog, she picked it up and put it on the plate.

Edit 2:

If this were at school or church, there would have been different consequences-- I have never had an issue with a child being blatantly disrespectful. I assume because the child was in HER home she felt she could hit me, yell at me and throw things at me. Her parents have not shared if she has mental health issues for those assuming that.

Another one of them is like ""We would prefer that you would tell us so that we know what the problem was"" I say "" unfortunately we can't all have what we want :c "" They add "" ...  unfortunately not. I don't understand what your game is"" and then they both proceed to leave the group chat. I @ the acquaintance in the group chat, he's online but doesn't answer me, next day (today) I want to check the chat and it's not there anymore. 

I message the acquaintance, ""what's up with your friends? Am I kicked out of game night?"" He says ""they were just annoyed that you didn't wanna say what was up, I did tell them to leave it but they wanted to know. And we didn't think you really wanted to be in the game night, or maybe I was wrong?""

c5dqw1	2019-06-25 19:25:52	sadtowel	WIBTA to ask my best friend to not keep talking about her new potential BF.	"Im 19F and so is she. We are close, super close. We can talk about anything and we do. Which is why I think I might be an asshole to stop her from sharing things she may value a lot. We openly communicate about how one may feel if the other does something that may upset them. Ex: I used to lie a lot to get out of hanging out, or she used to just drop down to my house without asking or a heads-up. We talk about it, understand eachothers position and then respect it.

Recently, she met a new guy a month ago-ish. He sounds great. Nice to her, funny, they're both interested in medicine, both volunteer at the student run clinic. Great. I'm happy for her since her past relationships have been shitty and she always ended up hurt or mistreated. But I honestly don't want to hear about how he asked her out for lunch tomorrow or how he made her a playlist or how he is falling in love with her (her words). I'm very happy for her but I don't really see the need for me to get these constant updates on their relationship. Is it wrong?? I don't want to keep hearing about how he is ""soo cheesy"" or ""soo sweet"" or ""soo attached already"" almost every time I see her. 

If I'm the asshole I will try to keep supporting her as I've been doing and listen to her relationship stuff."	Asshole	0	0

"For a bit of context, I am 19 years old and have just been recently diagnosed with OCD and major depressive disorder and come from the Middle East. In my country, any signs of mental illness is chalked up to lack of faith, unfortunately, I have been subject to this regressive mindset since I was just a kid, and none of my calls for help were ever acknowledged by my parents. With mental health not in the public discourse I felt scared as a kid, scared of myself; I would bite the insides of my mouth until my mouth was bloodied and I would cry in silence in my room, I'd feel a compulsion to read the first word of every sentence in multiples of 5s or 8s and when reading with my father he would yell at me for 'pausing' at the beginning of every sentence (I would actually be whispering the word so he wouldn't get mad), In addition I would feel the need to memorise 50 letters of Pi as a child or else I wouldn't be allowed to go to bed (many sleepless nights), among many other compulsions. Anyways, I graduate high school at 17 and manage to get a place to study at a medical in the UK. Long story short, I spiral out of control and can no longer bare it a few months ago after feeling numb and lost, living in a country on my own with my parents saying I have no mental illness and I'm just being lazy. After my attempt, I drop out at the end of my second year and fly back home to my parents, where they decided to go out and check a psychiatrist with me and I am medically diagnosed with the aforementioned mental conditions. I am now angry at the lack of action by my parents and got into a massive argument with them and can't help but despise them for ruining my life, they say my anger isn't justified and I'm overreacting, after all, they apologised. I have lost a competitive spot to study medicine abroad, I turn 20 in a couple of weeks and have nowhere to study or plans for the next scholastic year, all because of my parents' lack of care which happened to tumbleweed into the mess I am into today. Is my resentment justified? AITA?

TL;DR: Parents say I'm overreacting for their lack of action and refusal to get me medically diagnosed as a child, which has now spiralled out of control.

I absolutely hate how i look without my hair, and everyone knows it.

I recently got a haircut and i don't like it, so i was wearing a hoodie so people won't see me barely having hair.

When i got to school, i noticed some work i needed to do before class and i had one hour before classes started so i figured i might aswell do it.

Then a friend came, cracked a few jokes and dipped.

He came back, telling me if i wanted to see memes while i was very clearly working.

I saw 2-3 memes and told him ""Hey, i need to work, leave me pls"" and he refused and kept showing me memes. I ignored him and tried to keep working.

He started leaning onto me (Quite literally, i was just sitting there casually and he used me to relax), i told him ""Hey could you not"" and his answer was ""You are not eating so this ain't no excuse"" (This happened around 12:10 to 12:30).

He then stood up and started pulling my hoodie back so my hair could be visible.

Now, i have anxiety and my appearance is one of the main triggers.

I started to counter-pull my hoodie and said ""Please, let me work"" and a second guy joined, he seemed to help me get my hoodie back on its place and out of nowhere he just pushed it backwards and held it there.

My hair was on plain sight and needless to say, i freaked out and snapped.

I punched the friend that joined and he didn't fucking stutter, he just kept pushing and i almost started crying.

I screamed and snapped, almost started crying.

This was an unpleasant experience.

Last July I went to Warped Tour with my cousin, ""M"", my brother, ""T"", his girlfriend, ""C"" and her friend ""B"". It was my birthday present. The plan was to drive down to Nashville, stay the weekend, go to the show and go home. The day of the show I'm coerced into driving while everyone else gets drunk on the way(Warped Tour does not sell or allow alcohol during the event). 

We park, we head into the show, and we eventually split up. It's me and T at one stage and M, C, and B at another stage. T and I have a great time at our stage and the other three are having fun at their stage, but it's VERY hot and I have arthritis in my ankles. Needless to say, I'm feeling it. The one show I had to stay for was The Used. So, T and I rejoined the others at the stage The Used was coming on. 


After The Used went off I made it known that I wasn't wanting to stay at the stage, but I'd go sit in the bleachers. T said he would join me because he was worn out. The other three said they wanted to stay, but they didn't want to stay if we wanted to leave. I reiterated maybe half a dozen times that I was omay hanging out in the bleachers, but they kept on. So, I said ""fine, we're leaving."" And immediately headed for the exit. They followed, but complained the whole time about how they really wanted to see another act.

c5ddjx	2019-06-25 19:00:45	hungrytireddrained	AITA for being upset with my dad for eating my food	"I live with my parents and work for my dad. We both work late constantly and my mom used to handle food shopping and cooking but she no longer does much of anything mainly due to mental illness. I recently developed some medical issues myself and need to follow a strict diet, so quick prepackaged foods are not an option for me. So a combination of working late and basically needing to have home cooked meals has me eating dinner at 11 pm once I’ve gotten to go food shopping if needed and then cooked everything and keeping the kitchen cleaned. Because of my late dinner my sleep schedule is suffering.

Here is where the issue is - I keep trying to make larger quantities of food so I can have lunch and dinner for more than one day and hopefully can eat earlier and sleep earlier. But every time I make more food, my dad just eats more of it, and he doesn’t ask about what I have planned for the leftovers and will ultimately bring it all into the office and he eats unnecessarily large portion sizes. So if I make an 8 serving meal with plans to have it for lunch and dinner for 2-3 days I end up only getting to eat 2 or maybe 3 of the servings and am stuck again needing to go food shopping after work again and then cook more again and it just keeps repeating. Mind you, due to my dietary restrictions it’s hard for me to make super cheap food and also he has no dietary restrictions and could be supplementing my meals with things I can’t eat that are much cheaper like rice and bread (if I make rice or buy him bread he will eat that with my meal but still the same amounts).

I have told him I do not mind him eating the food, that I want him to eat the food since he probably wouldn’t have lunch or dinner unless he buys something somewhere, but that he needs to ask me in case I am planning to have the leftovers and if he does take some he should eat normal portions so I can at least estimate what I will have left. He still keeps eating the majority of the food. I am starting to get extremely upset over this and when I say something he kind of laughs at me and says “sorry I won’t eat it then” in a way that suggests I’m being an asshole, even though I have repeatedly explained that him eating the food isn’t the issue, it’s eating so much of it and taking it without discussing it first. I can’t move out right now for a number of reasons, and he won’t accept rent so I feel even weirder treating the situation as a roommate who won’t stop eating my food. The way he responds when I comment on the food issue has me wondering if I am being an asshole and should just accept this situation. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Last year I got engaged and asked both to be bridesmaids. This year friend one (A) got engaged. 
Friend two (B) and I really dislike the man A got engaged to, he’s cheated on her multiple times and has forced her into sex in the past. A knows how B and I feel as we were very honest with her during one of their break ups. 

B and I thought we’d be bridesmaids as the three of us would class each other as best mates.

I’m getting married next year (cue happy dance!). I know it’s a while away, but I’m waffling on whether I should invite my closest guy friend to the ceremony. He and I grew up across the street from each other and spent every day together pretty much from 7th grade until we went off to college. About a year into my relationship with my future husband, he confessed his feelings for me. He said he never intended to tell me, but had to say something once he realized my relationship was getting serious because he realized it would eat at him if he never opened up about it.

I (clearly) stayed with my future husband, told my best friend I appreciated his honesty and I care deeply for him but only in a platonic way. He accepted this, and largely the subject has been dropped. Sometimes he’ll get drunk and make a comment about it, but otherwise our friendship has been normal. 

My future husband knows about this by the way, but he’s not the jealous type and knows for certain i don’t return my best friend’s feelings. He says I should invite him to the wedding as it would be insulting / dismissive not to invite my oldest friend. But I feel like the opposite could also be insulting. I can’t imagine sending a wedding invite to someone who’s clearly expressed they’re in love with me, without feeling like a huge jackass.

c5daop	2019-06-25 18:55:21	not_cinderella	AITA for not cooking for my picky sister and husband?	"I consider myself to be a pretty good cook and baker; many people, my friends and family and especially my brother who is a trained chef, have told me this. I am a vegetarian, so I only cook vegetarian meals but most of the time they turn out really well and everyone’s happy with them. At family gatherings and events, I don’t care that everyone else eats meat but I always bring a dish or two to share and a dessert. 

My sister and her husband are not very good cooks, and they eat out probably 4-5x a week for dinner if not more. She’s been pressing me for almost a year to tell me how fun it would be for me to come over to her apartment and help her cook dinner or something.

Now I would be totally happy to go over and help her cook something vegetarian or bake a cake or something. But that’s not what she wants. She and her husband are picky and won’t eat a dinner without meat, won’t eat anything too spicy, won’t eat certain vegetables etc. I don’t feel comfortable cooking meat and especially wouldn’t want to help her cook it and then just watch her eat it while I don’t. She’s specifically mentioned i should show her how to make butter chicken, our mom’s ribs or a roast. I’ve suggested several vegetarian dishes I could help her cook, or suggested she could come over to my house and I would just host a dinner for them. But she refuses. I rarely eat with them and when we do we always go out to eat because there’s just nothing I can cook for her. 

I kind of feel like TA for not cooking for her when she gets all disappointed because everyone else tells her how good my cooking/baking is, but at the same IDEK what the f I would make for her. She’s just so picky and has so many preferences whereas for me, as long as it’s vegetarian, I’ll eat it. She’s weird about food in general and had mentioned before how excited she Ks to try a dessert i’ve made, and then doesn’t eat any. Well go out to eat at a restaurant and we’ll go early because she’ll say how starving she is, and she’ll eat like maybe 1/4 of her plate. It’s frustrating to watch and I feel like she wouldn’t even appreciate anything I made for her. She’s the only person in my family who hasn’t really tried my cooking, except a couple bites of something as a side dish here or there. I’m somewhat offended by it, but more I’m perplexed as to what she actually wants from me when she says I should cook for her?

c5da7h	2019-06-25 18:54:26		AITA for not wanting to put up with a friend's attitude as his wedding day approaches?	"Friend (B) and I have known each other at an acquaintance level for the past 10 years since college. We started really being friends about 6 years ago playing xbox live basically daily, including both PVP games in larger parties and PVE games that were just the 2 of us. 4 years ago, we started playing Smite (like LoL). This community, including both of us and our friends, has its fair share of toxicity, but its always heat of the moment frustration and never irl ""you're a terrible human being, never talk to me again.""

You see where this is going. 4 years, no issues, until last week. 

We're queued for a casual game and B picks an objectively bad god for the role he is in. While the game loads up, a third friend (N) offers to trade him roles so that B's god is in its more regular spot. N's god is maybe 3% better suited for the role, so it wasnt much of an improvement for the team, but N takes the bad matchup over B. B accepts. 

Here's where I come in: N is notorious for whining and getting mopey when stuff goes bad, so I take it upon myself to go out of my way and make sure N doesn't get his shit stuffed in. I shirked a lot of responsibilities to help him out, because I didn't want his good deed to go punished, but now B and the rest of the guys are getting plowed.

B blows a gasket accusing me of deliberately losing us the game because I'm salty about everyone's picks from previous games and he's done with this shit. Nobody disagrees with him because I'm typically the smartass that micromanages people and they always reply in a  ""you're not wrong, you're just an asshole"" kinda way. 

We lose, leaves like normal. Next day, he starts a party and invites all the regulars but me. N invites me a little later, and it's obvious B has me muted (I realize he removed me from his friends).

The next day, I text B with a genuine apology for snapping at him when he accused me of throwing. He's getting married soon so instead of making it about me, I'll take the fall here, admit being in the wrong, so we can move on. 

A couple days later, we play again, and everything is someone else's fault. Game 2, same thing. I'm done with being verbally abused so I hop off without starting anything.

New update today. N texts the group how the new god looks overpowered and I make a sarcastic comment about how there aren't enough OP mages in the game. B argues that mages are totally fine and the ""meta"" isnt centered around them. N and I point to how the most powerful god in the game right now is a mage. B: ""That has nothing to do with what I said"". Ok.

So I text B directly, asking if he's really stressed about the wedding because he's been argumentative lately. B: ""Oh so I'm not allowed to contribute to the group chat now?""

Is this the type of thing people let slide when their friends are real-life stressed or am I right to feel offended at being treated callously? I don't want to spend $250+ on attending a wedding for someone whom I have to walk on eggshells around."		1	0

Over the last few months, I've noticed that she frequently talks about how guys look and one time actually said how that's all she really looks for in a guy (not exaggerating, she actually said that). Normally, I don't usually care about other people's opinions, so I just ignore those remarks usually. I'm also not an amazingly attractive dude either but I also believe I'm not at the bottom.

Earlier today, I joked that my other co-worker (who is much better looking and a good friend of mine) and I were the same person and have synchronized our work perfectly to which she replied that we could not be any more different. I then replied and said ""it's what's on the inside that matters, but I'm sure you wouldn't know that,"" smirked, and walked away.

My co-worker/friend and I are actually very similar in interests and personality, so I pretty much concluded that she meant looks and only looks. What I said basically just slipped out and now I feel kind of bad for saying that, since it's just her opinion and I was essentially being a ""nice guy"".

But I have this coworker ""Rachel"" who's really, really nice. Like, if there's a retirement party she always stops by my cubicle and brings me a slice of cake. Or she leaves nice notes on my desk. We're only a 4-person department in a much larger company so we all talk and get along, but Rachel is easily the nicest, and she's honestly...too nice for my liking. I know that makes me sound like a dick, but hear me out. I know she probably wants to be my friend because we're around the same age in a company of people who are mostly older.

Lately she's been offering me rides to the train station I take home after work. Usually I have to walk about 6 blocks to the bus stop, then a bus to the train that takes me home. I've politely declined her offer several times, for several reasons:

1) I genuinely enjoy my walk to the bus stop and my bus ride. It's one of the only times I get to myself, and tbh I play pokemon go and listen to music and like doing that a lot. I like routine.

2) I don't know Rachel well enough to really enjoy small talk with her for an extra 10-15 minutes. We've only been working together maybe a month and I wouldn't get in a car with anyone I've only know that long, even if she's a 5'0 110lb coworker.

3) I'm not really interested in being friends with Rachel outside of work, and I'm concerned if I start accepting rides from her it's going to become a whole thing

4) To give me a ride, Rachel has to stay late and I have to leave early, about 15 minutes on both of our ends. I don't want to feel responsible for her staying late, nor do I want to catch flak for leaving early.

Like I said, I've politely declined, saying I enjoy walking every day, several times, but she keeps offering with more and more insistence. When I talked with some friends about this, they said I should just let her do something nice for me because clearly she wants to befriend me or something. But it's not something I appreciate or want. AITA here?

edit: Really wasn’t expecting this to get any traction lmao. Rachel if you somehow see this, I appreciate the work chitchat but I’m terrified of conflict! Keep being your nice self!

edit 2: Finally got to read through all the replies and everything, just want to add that I get absolutely no sense that Rachel is interested in me as anything beyond friendly. To my knowledge she’s very straight, and we’re both in serious monogamous relationships. Maybe if we were both single I’d read it differently, but I hope that context helps!"	No A-holes here	0	0
c5d2yb	2019-06-25 18:40:39		AITA for wanting to be alone for a few hours to recharge?	Alright, so I am currently on a trip with my dad and older brother to visit family. Before I begin, I should point out that I’m not only a huge introvert but I have crippling social anxiety. It’s a terrible combo. Obviously, on this trip we are going to be going around visiting all our family. The last 3 days straight I’ve been interacting with the family, taking pictures, playing with the kids etc. just to pass out at the end of the day with no time in between to mentally rest. I’m doing my best really, but so much at once is causing my anxiety levels to sky rocket. Last night, my dad said it was okay for my brother and I to sleep in today since we don’t have any plans as of right now. This was great news for me, I just wanted to wake up early anyway and spend few hours I have to myself to recharge. I made sure to talk to them both that I needed to rest and they seemed to understand. All was well until morning comes around. Things didn’t go exactly that way... this morning I was woken up bright and early by kids screaming and running around the room wanting to play with me, family around. My dad is telling me to get out of bed right now and go eat breakfast with the family. I take a moment to process what’s happening, and I just ask what the deal was since he said it was okay that I needed rest but this just ticked him off and he started going on a big rant that I’m on this trip to visit family and how I’m being extremely rude and selfish by trying to isolate myself. That my family were so kind to make us breakfast (I was not aware of this until this morning) and I should have woken up to go eat and thank them. I ended up being forced to go out there. Right now I ’m sitting in the living room with the family typing this out on the verge of having an anxiety attack. I’m trying to put on my best face but it’s really difficult. AITA?

"It’s a long story but essentially for the last two years my mother and I have been the foster parents for my young nieces and nephew. Their mother (my sister) has had a long history of substance abuse and two years ago on a bad trip CPS caught her and took the kids away. They gave them to us and we’ve been watching them since. Today their ages are 5,4 and 2. Being one of their main care takers I have grown a strong bond with them and love them dearly.

This last month the mother got them back and is living with us now. She says she’s clean but it’s hard to fully trust her after her long history.

I recently finished undergrad and have received a very generous scholarship for graduate school that is on the other side of the country. Graduate school was always part of the plan as a graduate degree is required to advance in my field of study. The cost of living would be much cheaper and I could finally move out of the house. Something that I really have been wanting to do.

I am having a really hard time living at home but I feel if I leave the kids it’ll be like I am abandoning them. The plan is still to move right now as I am in the final steps. I guess I have normal anxiety that comes from a big move but it’s made worse by the fact that I feel like I’m abandoning my nieces and nephew. Am I an asshole for moving 2000 miles away?"

c5cyth	2019-06-25 18:32:45	luxmoa	AITA for being upset my GF is going to a party?	"My gf is going away with her family tomorrow night for a week and half.  We planned on spending last night, tonight and maybe tomorrow before she leaves together. Today she tells me instead of hanging out she’s going to an art show/ party that her high school friend is throwing, and she’ll come to me after. She did tell me about this party a couple weeks earlier, and I said I didn’t want to go because it’s on a Tuesday night and I wake up early for work. At the time we didn’t know it was the night before she was leaving. Anyway her dropping this today out of nowhere, really upset me. She regrets not being closer with this group of friends, since they are close with her ex (who will be there tonight). She complained that since we don’t really go to dress up parties like this often she wants to go. I said sure, but don’t plan on coming back to me after.  I also fully explained why this upsets me so much (a swanky affair shouldn’t hold precedence over a last night together). She said I’ll just see her tomorrow before she leaves, but hanging at her apt for an hour while she frantically packs and has me help doesn’t count to me. She agrees this “not totally okay”, but not a big deal. To me it is though. Am I overreacting? , AITA?

EDIT:  I would go with her, but tickets are extremely expensive. I don’t have that option anymore and she knows that. When she plans on showing up I’ll be in bed getting ready to sleep, she knows that too. I know I’m answering your comments like I’m arguing, I just want you guys to have all the info. Honestly, I want to be wrong about this, just feels wrong to me. Seems like I am.

EDIT 2: I want to clarify, that she put much, if not more emphasis on being together these nights.  That being said, I still took all of your advice,  apologized and encouraged her to go and have a good time, and that I’d be home waiting. I’m insecure, I know that. It’s hard not to be. I’ve been played before, it kinda fucked me up. Anyway thanks for the help, if you want an update I’ll give it."	Asshole	0	0
c5cyn9	2019-06-25 18:32:28	PoliticalBitch69	AITA for waking my bf up when he snores?	"My bf (23M) and I (22F) have been dating for almost 3 years and living together for over a year. 

&#x200B;

My bf doesn't snore every day (he really only snores once in a while) but when he does it's like sleeping next to a jet engine (you can hear him from outside the apartment) and it is almost impossible to fall asleep. 

&#x200B;

He is a really light sleeper but is able to fall asleep really quickly. He'll usually get up a few times in the night to pee or because the cat was being needy etc. I am a really heavy sleeper but it takes a while for me to fall asleep. If he snores after I'm asleep I don't wake up at all.

&#x200B;

So the nights that he snores I might cough intentionally, or nudge him a bit, or just sit on the bed a bit more forcefully than normal so that he'll wake up and roll over. He almost always ends up back asleep in about 5 minutes or less in a different position and he won't be snoring.

&#x200B;

I kinda feel like a dick for waking him up even though he falls asleep quickly and would otherwise wake up at some point during the night, but there have been times I didn't want to wake him and I've laid awake for at least two hours unable to fall asleep and ended up extremely sleep deprived and cranky in the morning.

We’ve moved twice in the past five years, and she’s really been the only person to use this among other things as an excuse not to show up to family events, especially birthdays, and my maternal grandfather has been coincidentally showing up a lot more lately. She showed up to my younger sister’s birthday party in March, completely unannounced, and only stayed long enough to take (very poor quality and unexpected) pictures of the other guests in order to prove that she was there in the form of a FaceBook post. We announced about 2.5 weeks in advance that my birthday party would be this past Saturday (June 22nd) and that it would just be a chill BBQ. She posted on FaceBook that morning a picture of her and her husband (not my grandfather) going camping for the day, with the caption ‘Love surprise camping trips with [Husband]’. At this point, it had been a while since we’d seen her, and how she acted last year around my birthday left a bad taste in my mouth (Said she’d show up, didn’t, no apology text, sent a card in the mail with my name spelled wrong in her handwriting and right in her husband’s, with $50 which felt like a bribe, and no text on my actual birthday, only one wishing me a happy ‘birthday party day’ and one two days after to ask if I’d gotten the card) so I decided I would text her and get those sour feelings off my chest. On the morning of my birthday, she texted me to wish me a happy birthday pretty early (surprise) and I responded with everything I’d been wanting to say for the last year.

c5cw8o	2019-06-25 18:28:03		AITA for saying I wouldn't go get milk?	"Long Post Sorry!

Backstory: My Great Grandmother passed away last week and I was unable to attend her funeral with my family. It was in another state 8 hours away. I F(21) still live at home with my parents and we live out in the country surrounded by cows, chickens, and woods. I didn't want to stay by myself and before I could ask my parents, they asked me if my boyfriend M(22) was going to come stay with me and I said yes. 

They left on a Saturday and planned to come home that Monday. My Mom ended up calling me at work and saying they were going to stay another day and I said okay. The funeral was that Monday and they planned to drive through the night to come home but I knew they would change their minds and stay another night. Anyways, I got home that night from work and my boyfriend was still there because he was going to stay with me until about 10 and then leave because he told his friend he would play games with him. He still thought they were coming home that night. 

I asked him if he could stay another night with me after I told him my family would be coming home the next day. He knows I'm scared to stay by myself (especially since our two German Shepherds kept barking the previous night). I brought him back some food and he's warming it up and looks in the fridge and notices we don't have milk. He says will you go get me milk and I say no because the nearest store is closed (It was 10:00 at night). He goes well I'm not going to stay if you don't go get me milk. 

I was so upset because I couldn't believe he said that. First, I thought he was acting like a child because he wanted milk so badly with his cookies that he would threaten to leave if I did not go get milk. I was really upset because I saw it as manipulation and he saw it as if you do this for me, i'll do this for you. I didn't like that because he knows I needed him and I was afraid to stay alone so to make sure I went and got milk and he said he would leave if I didn't. He told me I was acting like a child (I got really upset and was crying) and didn't understand why I couldn't go just get milk. I kept telling him it wasn't about the milk, it was about how he said he would leave if I didn't get it and how that was manipulation. He looked at me was like so what basically. He said he was staying with me even though he told his friend he would play games with him. Mind you he brought his computer over and was still able to play games with him. I even told him I would leave him alone. He said it would be uncomfortable because his computer was hooked up to the Tv and he has to sit on his knees to play because the keyboard was on the coffee table. I tried to make compromises and he kept turning them down. 

  
 I ended up going and getting the milk at gas station. I also ended up crying on the way there and having a panic attack just about.

A few months ago, i found out he was talking badly about me behind my back again and when I confronted him about it, he blocked me and I haven't heard from him since.

The other day, he texted me out of the blue, thinking my number was his cousin's number. When he realized who he was talking to, he expressed interest in reviving the friendship, even though he kind of seems like the same old jerk.

c5cswd	2019-06-25 18:21:40		AITA for calling my Girlfriend's parents to stop her from harassing me?	"So some context is needed before I dive into the actual situation, my 25 year old girlfriend and I (28 year old male) have been dating for 3 years. I noticed based on a number of arguments we have had that she has separation anxiety issues based on being adopted, having a nice yet neurotic step-mother and being abused by exes.

That said, she had 15 free sessions with a therapist for a school related program and was taking anti-anxiety medication. During that period of time, she was more relaxed and not freaking out if I wasn't available to hang out. Things were going super well and we were happy.

Flash forward to now, she no longer has therapy and she had to stop her medication because it was giving her heart burn.

One of my close friends was having a bachelor party planned such that we go up north to do activities such as Axe Throwing and a 2 night stay at a Chalet. The problem for her was that she was going to a bachelorette party for only one night and had nothing planned for the second day. After weeks and weeks of her telling me to come back on the first day with another friend who was leaving because he is a father and wants to get back to his kids, I finally agreed and decided to stay for 1 night just to avoid any drama. She even agreed she would not disrupt or bother me since I was only going for 1 night. Ho boy was I wrong.

As we start the Axe Throwing activity, she starts texting me saying she needs help setting up her voicemail. I tell her I am busy and I'll figure it out the next day, she doesn't stop and starts flooding me with messages. I tell her I am going to turn off my phone because it is taking up my time with my friends. She reacts by starting to message my friends, I tell her to stop and she doesn't. She says she will call 911 and send them to our Chalet if I don't answer. I react by calling her father and telling her that she is harassing me and my friends.

This makes matters worse because it just makes her even more mad and she constantly argues with me for 1.5 days about how calling her parents makes me a tattle-tale but I literally had no choice. I explain that what she did was way worse and she doesn't seem to fully comprehend her actions.

After her rushing me and making my time up north less enjoyable, I finally talk to her in person and calmed her down and talked about boundaries. I almost broke up with her and gave her money back for a resort vacation we were planning to go to. A good handful of my friends were on my side, but my best friend says I shouldn't have called her parents at all.

c5csw2	2019-06-25 18:21:39	preemptiveguilt	WIBTA for stopping my mom from seeing her parents?	"I just graduated high school and, due to a disappointing college admissions season, am seriously considering taking a gap year. My plans are still murky, but I definitely want to learn some subjects that I didn't get a chance to explore in high school, such as computer science. My mom offered to teach me CS, as she used to teach it at a college. However, before the whole gap year idea came up, she wanted to go back to her home country to be with her parents, who are old and not in the best health, while I am supposed to go to college. Taking a gap year would delay her from going home by another year.

&#x200B;

It is so awful to think about, but if my grandparents passed away within the next year while my mom was at home to take care of me, if would be my fault that she didn't get to see them one last time. I would probably die of guilt. But I also really want to take a gap year, as I feel like I have a lot of room for growing personally and I don't feel ready for college. I am still heavily dependent on my mom for money and transportation--I applied for a job, but haven't heard back yet, and I can't get my drivers license until October. Really, I am asking if I should take a gap year or not, because my mom wouldn't leave me at home by myself while she is across the globe; in other words, she would definitely stay home if I took a gap year. If I don't take a gap year, I would go to an okay college that I am not very excited about, and kind of afraid of, attending.

c5cspv	2019-06-25 18:21:17		AITA for drinking around of my mom?	"My father was an alcoholic. A bad, violent one. I never met him (he died from a heart attack when I was 2), but from what my mom told me he was pretty bad. He got jealous, beat her, made her go through a literal warzone to buy him alcohol etc. (once she even fell and broke her arm and hip because she had to run). He'd get extremely jealous when he was deployed and then whenever he got back he'd always get drunk and beat her for the most innocent things, like talking to someone, being dressed normally etc. Then after the war he went into rehab and died soon.  
  
Also her stepfather was a horrible alcoholic who she literally ran away home from when she was 17.  
  
Obviously, terrible traumatic experiences.  
  
My mom drinks too sometimes, and she never cared if me and my sister socially drunk a bit. Alcohol was never really a taboo at all in the family.  
  
Recently (past year or so) I was in a (still am) bit of a rough patch mentally. Not to get too into it, but it was pretty bad. I started drinking to alleviate it, and it worked. I know, terrible idea. But it helps. It was the only way I could cope. It makes me feel normal for at least a few hours. I drink (imo) moderately, just to ease the nerves. Or when I have to mingle with people a lot (I have bad social anxiety). When class is on, I usually down a few shots of something strong and a beer in the morning. And if it's a long day in college I'll carry some booze in my bag, so I can renew the effect when it wears off instead of being the usual anxious mess I am. Sounds bad, I know, but this is maybe once a week tops, when I have a lot of classes.  
  
I don't have a dependency. I don't have an urge to drink. I literally have to force myself to drink the horrible liquid. I never just get an urge to drink.  
  
She only told me her experiences a few months before I started drinking, so I felt bad about it from the start. But I thought it would be better if I was honest and she didn't just find a hidden bottle of cheap vodka under my bed or something. I wanted her to see that I'm drinking fairly moderately, and from a selfish standpoint I was also sick of hiding it.  
 
I didn't just want to tell her at first, so I started leaving booze in the fridge so she would get the message (and ask me about it). Soon she did, and she took it pretty badly, I think. She started bringing it up very often but I always tried to be completely open with her. I told her why I was doing it, how I'm careful not to become dependent, how it's just temporary etc. But it's clear she's still bothered by it. My mother is a very strong woman though, so she's a bit hard to read emotionally. So for a while I thought she was taking it alright but was just cautious, understandably. But I can see she's still bothered.  
  
Well, yesterday my sister attacked me for being a selfish asshole. I already felt bad, but I didn't think it was that serious. So am I a massive asshole or what?"	Asshole	1	0

This morning, when taking her out, she went to the bathroom and it was a disaster. We haven't had dog food for a few days because we have no money, and so she's been eating whatever people food I can find. It breaks my heart, but I'm doing the best I can. 


Warning: it gets a little graphic from here.

Anyway, this morning her poop was liquid. I mean it had no substance. I just sat trying to figure out how to use the doggy bag to pick this up. I tried and totally failed. I figured that if I couldn't pick it up, I should do the opposite. So I tried to bury it, like you would do when camping. This was moderately successful, but I still was afraid that someone might step on it. So I tried to leave a marker, so that people would look twice. I stuck a stick in the ground up right so that people wouldn't blindly walk by it. 

I thought that was the best I could do, given the circumstances, and left.

c5cnor	2019-06-25 18:11:46		AITA for telling my mother that I will not live up to her standards ?	"I'm a 20 year old guy and my mother has a big psychological problem. I don't know why, but she is extremey focused on everything being clean. Sometimes she comes homes from work and when I didn't do the dishwasher she literally cries because of it. It's not even something serious. I mean she can literally just tell me to do it then, and I will do it and after 10 minutes the kitchen is clean again.

And she has that with everything else too. As soon as she is home she starts cleaning the house. On the weekend when she doesn't have to work she is cleaning the house 12 hours a day. And it actually got better in the last few years, she used to mesaure the distance between her clothes with a ruler and stuff like that.

Of course I can not keep up with that amount of work. So every few weeks she bursts out in tears and tells me that she can't continue like that, and that she feels like a cleaning lady and she feels like she has to do everything herself.

So now the thing is, it's not like I'm doing nothing. I take care of the kitchen every day. I cook for myself. Sometimes I cook for her too. I vacuum the house. I take care of the dog and so on.

The problem is that my mother expects me to do as much as her. And I can't do that. I mean I could. But I don't value the difference between clean and extremely clean as much as she does. For me it's completely fine if the house isn't 100% clean, it doesn't bother me as long as it isn't dirty. 

So when she tells me to vacuum or when she tells me to do the kitchen I do it. But she expects me to do it by myself, out of ""motivation"". And I don't feel this motivation. I have this mindeset of ""Ok, it's not 100% clean, so you can study today and then tomorrow you will vacuum. Won't make a difference anyways"" and my mother has the mindset of ""Ok, it's not 100% clean, so you can vacuum today and tomorrow it won't be 100% clean again so you can vacuum tomorrow too.""

So today she cried again because she feels like she is doing everything.. and this time I didn't try to comfort her or anything, I just told her ""Listen mom, I know you love it when everything is 100% clean, but I don't care about it that much. I will support you with various things, but I will not live up to your standards of cleaning the house, because they are not healthy and you know that yourself.""

She just left my room.

I mean I will move out next year anyways, but I still feel a little bit of guilt. Am I the asshole ?"		1	0

c5cmdw	2019-06-25 18:09:25	throwaway26283889	WIBTA if I decide to cut off my father from my life?	"Hello all, first time poster here, using a throwaway for this.

I'm at a complete loss, and honestly I don't know what to think anymore, at this point I just need some external opinions. 

I'm a 19F who immigrated with my parents to another country, a more liberal one, when I was a little kid.

Both my parents worked so hard to give me a better chance in life in a better country, and for that, I am very grateful.

My dad, especially, worked very hard doing manual and back-breaking jobs to support our family, and to this day I can see the toll that all these years have taken on him.

However, since I became a teenager, I stopped having a good relationship with him.

You see, coming from a much more religious and homogeneous country, he still kept his prejudices against people he perceived as “different” to this day, and refused to adapt while living here. 

He would complain daily about black people in our country, saying how they're all useless and how they stay afloat selling drugs, and how they should go back to Africa.

He complained also about other immigrants and especially Muslim ones which, in my opinion, is highly hypocritical of him since he immigrated here too.

He would always talk negatively about people we saw on the streets, always complaining about old people who are too slow and young people who, according to him, are always on their phone and don't care about the world anymore, and so on.

Honestly I loathe his negativity and prejudices against others, since I've always tried to see the humanity in everyone, and I've always thought that every single person had a story we didn't know about, so we shouldn't be so quick to judge. 

Lately his negativity is becoming more and more difficult to endure, it has brought down not only mine, but my mom's mood too.

He's not only full of hate for other people, but is so old-fashioned to the point of saying that women should always be submissive to men, and do all of the household duties.

The straw that broke the camel's back, however, were his thoughts on homosexuality: when I came out as a lesbian, he started crying, insulting me, and, to this day, he keeps on asking me when I'll settle down with a good man.

Suffice to say he didn't take it well, and I feel oppressed every day, unable to be myself, unable to talk about the girls that I love, unable to have a conversation about things that matter to me in fear of being repudiated.

My dad outright refuses to travel, to be open-minded, to get to know other people, to find happiness; he's always living in his bubble full of hate, negativity, ancient mentality, and me and my mom are getting tired of his shit.

Thing is, me and my mom are planning on leaving him, finding a house for us two and cutting all contact with him, and he has no idea.

On the other hand, it was mostly him who supported the family financially in all these years, should I feel guilty?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5clzq	2019-06-25 18:08:41	HinsdaleCounty	AITA for telling my dad I want him to stop unloading on me about my mom?	"Hello all. I'll be brief. My dad \[58M\] got upset with me \[21M\] after I told him I couldn't take any more of his telling me how bad his relationship with my mom is. My mom flat out abuses verbally and emotionally abuses my dad, and he just kind of takes it in the moment because he does basically whatever he can to keep peace, but then he'll tell me what she says behind my back \*and\* also swear me to confidence, even though I tell him it's really hard for me to be secret about this. He'll say that he has no one else to talk to and that my brother will always just blab to my mom when he tells him, which makes the situation worse for all of us.

Not only does he tell me about my mom, but he'll also tell me about how consistently broke we are. He tells me that ""I'm the only one who can know"" how grim our financial situation is. So I'm basically all he's got and I know it's important to have someone to talk to about bad stuff, even if just to vent. Being of the emotionally supportive type, I really want to be able to help him or at least just listen.

My dad recently showed me some horrible, aggressive texts from my mom (not unusual), and then after I was made visibly upset by them, he once again forbade me from mentioning them. So I majorly lashed out and he got very upset. I feel really bad because it's probably totally normal for parents to confidentially tell their kids what's happening between them, and I also feel awful for yelling, but in my case I feel that what I'm seeing is just too f\*cked up, even though I'm an adult now.

I'm extremely burnt out from the company and my stress levels have never been higher. At one point I needed to go to the hospital for what the doctor believed was a stress-induced seizure. There's a bunch of other reasons, but this is the biggest. I gave my final notice of July 19th to give proper notice and also help train new employees, notify accounts I will be leaving, etc. 

So here's the issue: my assistant manager has been nothing but antagonistic since my notice. She has not only berated me for fixable mistakes in front of customers, but has openly spoken badly of me in front of me to the other employees. While my other assistant manager and branch manager think it's BS, the newer employees (ones I've trained) have started saying things about me that the Assistant manager has said.

These things are mostly based around small mistakes we have made, but fixable mistakes or issues that are really non-issues. Things like unhappy customers that end up being happy, logistics issues, etc. And note, these aren't issues that are exclusively my fault. They're issues that come up every time we get super busy. But somehow I'm at fault and the assistant manager is making it my fault in front of everybody.

The crazy thing is, at work she's acting like this and then when I'm on lunch or off the clock she acts like a totally normal person, asking how I'm doing and what I'm doing this weekend, etc. I feel so betrayed by what she's been saying about me that I feel it is appropriate to tell her that I don't want to talk to her except for exclusively work-related things until I leave.

c5ce5s	2019-06-25 17:54:31	paapeepii	AITA for ghosting my dying grandmother?	"A little background: my father died when I was 1 (I’m 30 now), leaving his mom (G) as one of the only surviving members on his side of the family. I have a brother and a cousin, so G has 3 grandchildren.

&#x200B;

G has always lived on her retirement pension and eventually would reach out asking for money to buy groceries or medications - she would ask me or my brother telling each one a different story as to why she needed the cash, but we would help anyway. My mom always warned us that G had a history of being a compulsive liar, but if your grandma is old and asking for money to buy groceries, there's not much you can do, specially if you don't live nearby.

&#x200B;

About 4 years ago, she told us she would have to stop paying for her medical insurance. Instead, I suggested that the grandchildren could split the cost in 3 and send it to her every month. Well, once this started, she would ask us for money almost every other week. I would send here something whenever I could, but eventually she would only message me to ask for cash - she didn’t ask me how I was and if I was ok, didn’t show any empathy or curiosity for my life. Suddenly, ALL of our communications revolved around G asking me for money, and she would get pissed if I told her I couldn’t. She started treating me like a bank.

&#x200B;

I lost it the day she simply sent me some pictures of bills saying I had to pay for those - she didn’t even say hello, just pictures of the bills and a message saying that I should take care of it. I didn’t reply. In the next days she sent messages containing other bills and reinforcing that I was responsible for them. I've never paid them, and that’s when I decided to ghost her. I’ve cut all communications but continued to send her money for her health insurance - something I still do every month despite her treating me like crap. She stopped messaging me as well, but would complain to my brother or mom whenever I was late sending her the money. She didn’t complain that I was distant or ghosting her, she only missed the $. Recently she asked my brother for cash and he couldn’t send it to her, so she had a friend of her that claims to be a psych call us telling us that our father reached out to him and was very disappointed with how we were treating his mother. I told this guy to go fuck himself and blocked his number.

&#x200B;

A couple days ago, G was admitted to the ICU and is now in an induced coma. My mom and brother are freaking out making arrangements to visit her because they think she's not going to make it, and I simply don’t give a fuck. I just can’t stand how in these past years she only reached out to me when she needed money, sometimes berating at me telling me I HAD to send it to her, failing to show any interest in my life. I’ve already told my family that I’m not visiting her and that I won’t be attending her funeral when she dies; I'm not going to give her a free pass just because she's dying.

I had just moved and was living by myself for the first time. I desperately needed kitchenware. My grandmother bought me a fairly nice purse that I expressed I didn’t really want, although generous. I was trying to steer her towards the kitchenware but my grandmother loves high-end clothes and wants me to “grow up” and dress like I am a businesswoman, even though I have no reason too. So she tends to buy me stuff I will never wear or want despite my protests, because I don’t want her to waste her money. But it makes her happy to have buy me these things so I only can do so much. 


She had left the receipt for the purse with me, I don’t remember why. So I returned it to Macy’s and waited for a good sale so I could buy myself all the basic kitchenware I needed. 


This was a few years ago and I still use my kitchenware everyday and I love it. I feel like an asshole because this wasn’t her intention with the gift. I’d like to think she would appreciate that I am getting good use from her dollar, but for family reasons I can not tell her. I won’t go into the reasons because they are personal, but she is not “all there” anymore and it’s better to not chance upsetting her.

So, a couple months ago one of my friends (26f) told me that they had a one-night stand. Pretty normal thing to do, I've done it before and had no issues about people knowing that I did. My friend is also quite open about their sex + personal life.

After that one night stand, I was talking to a coworker and friend (29m) who I've known for years. My friend and my coworker have a bit of history with each other. They've hooked up a couple times, but never progressed into an actual relationship. They haven't been involved with each other for nearly a year (as far as I know).

Anyway, during conversation I mention my friend's one night stand. We had a laugh about it, then continued with the conversation as normal. I didn't think anymore about it until I got a text from my friend, saying that it wasn't cool for me to tell my coworker about the one-night stand. I spoke to my roommate about it and he says that I was kinda an asshole for telling him.

However, without even doing a shred of research themselves, my parents say it might be unsafe (they don’t even know what it is). They are insisting I see a doctor to have them consult wether creatine is safe for me. I feel this is unnecessary and I have explained to them I could get similar levels of creatine from eating a couple steaks. 

They still insist I get a doctors permission, and then give up my privacy with the doctor so they can have a conversation with said doctor.

c5c73s	2019-06-25 17:41:23	enigimpatic	AITA for not letting my younger brother have my PS4?	"Hi reddit 👋🏻

Well, here we go. I’m 20, my younger brother is 12. He’s had an Xbox One for about four years now, and about three years ago my mum bought me a PS4 as a present. I’ve paid for PSN ever since out of my own pocket. 

Last year, my younger brother was taken to buy his own PS4 too, but instead begged to get a second Xbox One (in white instead of black) for his room in our summer home (bougie, I know). He never lets anyone play either Xbox, apart from once four years ago when I wanted to play Witcher but didn’t have a console to play it on. I played maybe once or twice for an hour or so, but he then deleted the game off the Xbox because he complained he didn’t have enough space.

I’ve just got home from uni for the summer and was just sitting in my room when he came in and asked if he could have my PS4 to play on as all of his friends have PS4. Bearing in mind, he hasn’t spoken to me in about three days, the last time of which he mocked my relationship and said generally cruel things about my weight. I said no, I didn’t really want him to have it. He asked if he could play on it for the evening, then, but I explained I was waiting for a friend to come online to play. 

He then complained I had different games to him and he wanted to try them, but most of them were online (and the others he had expressly said he thought were shit) and I didn’t want him playing on my account (as he would have to pay to play online on a new account). 

He then got our mum involved who screamed at me about being uncaring, an evil sister, and that as she’d bought me the PS4 she could take it back from me at any point she wanted. I felt like that was really unfair and explained that even if my brother did take my PS4, he wouldn’t be able to play online as I wouldn’t continue paying for him, as explained above. My mum and brother left my room in a huff and I can still hear them calling me a huge piece of shit, etc. 

I would have let him play on my PS4 for a bit but he’s been positively cruel any time he spoke to me since I’ve been home and just in general, to be honest. He’s also got a nasty habit of deleting my progress in games so I don’t trust him at all. I also don’t like his friends and he’s not great at regulating his volume, so would have been yelling down his headset next to where I was sitting. I also can’t easily unplug my PS4 as the wires are quite high up so it’ll be a pain to plug it back in again. Minor, I know, but still annoying enough that compounded with how he’s acted towards me I don’t really want to do much for him.

I don’t let them run around the house because they eat plastic (2 kids with lots of plastic toys), terrorize the cat, etc. I have 2 acres so I let them run around a few hours in morning and in the evening until we go to bed. Other than that they are crated. I am not always ready to get them inside and crated. Our property is not fenced in but we have an electric grid with collars for the dogs. They know their boundary and I’ve never seen them cross it. It’s also good to add these dogs are big teddy bears and wouldn’t  hurt someone on purpose(maybe accidentally knock them over) even if they crossed the perimeter into our property. I do not have any beware of dog signs, but there are maybe 15 houses on the whole street so I know most of my neighbors and we are on a private road. 

This morning I’m inside with my kids and I hear screaming. Again 15 houses on the street and it’s mostly quiet. I look outside and I see an older lady, that I have never seen before, in the middle in the road screaming while my dogs are standing excitedly at the edge of their perimeter. I am not ready to have them inside because, 1 they don’t come in through the front (crates are next to the back door), 2 the cat is inside and they would chase him around the house. I go outside to coax them by me so she can walk past the house, but I don’t put them inside. The whole time she’s yelling that I shouldn’t let my dogs run freely and I need to put them inside or leash them. All I yelled was they don’t leave the property and I went back in. I have never seen that woman before and if you live there you would know I have dogs and that I have them out every day at that time. AITA because i didn’t bring in the dogs so she could feel safe walking by my house? My mom says I should have, and my husband said I shouldn’t have even gone outside at all.

c5c6il	2019-06-25 17:40:15	MyLifeIsAMessBruh	WIBTA for suggesting my girlfriend has a hormonal imbalance?	"Throwaway, on mobile, yadda yadda

For context we're both women in our early 20s, I am white and she is black. This is relevant because while all women are told they are too emotional/need to calm down, black women deal with this ALOT more. Therefore any suggestion regarding her emotional responses carries more weight. I recognize I need to be careful with how I word this.
 
Now for the situation: my gf has HUGE mood swings and even she recognizes it. She'll be extremely happy when her friends are visiting then crying and moping when they leave (she talks to the daily and sees them every few weeks). Her mood fluctuates very rapidly over very minor things, good and bad, and while she is very good about talking things out with me, it's definitely straining to our relationship to have her consistently vent/cry about these small instances. 

I don't want to discount her emotions and I know everyone handles things differently, but I am worried that there is a physical problem here such as a thyroid issue leading to her hormones being wonky. I want to talk to her about going to a doctor over these mood swings but I don't want to offend her. I really am just worried that these mood swings are a symptom of something else. 

TLDR: gf has severe mood swings, WIBTA for suggesting she seek medical help in case it's a hormone imbalance?

EDIT: I appreciate all the responses! And I'm sorry for suggesting I was diagnosing her, I meant that I was worried the mood swings could be a symptom of something and I want to suggest she go to a professional- either an MD or a therapist is up to her- not that I wanted her to get tested for a thyroid issue specifically (that was just the first example that came to mind)"	No A-holes here	0	0

She agrees and we were off on our merry way. We both had a great lunch and ordered standard meals but at the end, the bill was more than allotted for the day so I decided not to tip. When we left and my girlfriend realized what happened, she got angry and went back into the place and tipped our waitress. When she got back she was furious at me for not tipping the regular 20%.

c5c55q	2019-06-25 17:37:41		AITA for charging ex-roommates to pick up their trash?	"Hi Reddit. Yet another person wondering, AITA? Tl;dr at the bottom.

I lived with my 4 previous roommates for the past 2 years in 2 different houses. They've never been particularly awful, just minor things like dirty dishes and not picking up after themselves. Annoying, but nothing out of the ordinary for roommates in their early 20s.

3 of my roommates were moving multiple states away for work. They looked into cleaning services and were quoted for $280 to clean the house. Being the frugal person I am, I volunteered to clean the house -- at most it would take me 10 hours, and at $20/hr that is certainly cheaper than a cleaning service. I explicitly mention my time estimates to clean the surfaces and floors, about 6 hours. They do not mention a house full of trash.

When I arrived, there was a LOT of stuff left behind. Bags of clothes, boxes of office supplies, clothes hangers randomly throughout the house, bathroom supplies, you name it. The pantry and fridge were entirely full of (mostly expired) food. The house looked like 3 people still lived in it, or perhaps 3 raccoons since so much stuff was just strewn about the house. The 4th roommate didn't leave any of their shit...except for actual hedgehog shit embedded in the closet carpet.

So, I immediately inquire, why is there stuff everywhere? The plan was to come in, clean, and leave. The response? ""Trash is part of cleaning."" Ha, no. I offer to leave and have them hire a cleaning service. No clear answer. So, I get to work.

Now, I know I am cut from a different cloth than most people, but I find it baffling that someone -- friends, no less -- would surprise someone with that. Genuine shock. This was not a 6-hour 1-man job anymore. I text some people, including a friend that used to professionally clean. Best response: ""lmao is this a joke?"" A gracious soul offered to help me out.

Over the course of 10 hours (8 of it with additional help), we bag up everything, put it into the garage, and clean the house. Around 12 person hours were needed for the trash.

At $20/hr, that's $360. No company would do what we did for that price. In our house, we kept track of shared bills. I owe about $200 at present, and with the last electricity and water bills will owe probably another $120. I said, cancel my debts and we are even. I believe this is not only fair but definitely under-valuing the work we put in to clean that house. Cue ex-roommates getting pissed off about additional charges and insisting they could have paid someone to do it for less than that.

AITA?

Bonus: I found recently-purchased condoms in roommate's bag. He's been in a LTR, and she has an IUD. Hmm...

Tl;dr: I volunteer to clean our previous residence at $20/hr for an estimated 6 hours. Ex-roommates move out of state and leave behind an entire garage's worth of trash. The job took 18 person hours so I charged them ~$200 additionally for dealing with all their trash. AITA?"		1	0
c5c556	2019-06-25 17:37:39	throwaway26283889	WIBTA if I decide to cut off my father from my life?	"Hello all, first time poster here, using a throwaway for this.

I'm at a complete loss, and honestly I don't know what to think anymore, at this point I just need some external opinions. 

I'm a 19F who immigrated with my parents to another country, a more liberal one, when I was a little kid.

Both my parents worked so hard to give me a better chance in life in a better country, and for that, I am very grateful.

My dad, especially, worked very hard doing manual and back-breaking jobs to support our family, and to this day I can see the toll that all these years have taken on him.

However, since I became a teenager, I stopped having a good relationship with him.

You see, coming from a much more religious and homogeneous country, he still kept his prejudices against people he perceived as “different” to this day, and refused to adapt while living here. 

He would complain daily about black people in our country, saying how they're all useless and how they stay afloat selling drugs, and how they should go back to Africa.

He complained also about other immigrants and especially Muslim ones which, in my opinion, is highly hypocritical of him since he immigrated here too.

He would always talk negatively about people we saw on the streets, always complaining about old people who are too slow and young people who, according to him, are always on their phone and don't care about the world anymore, and so on.

Honestly I loathe his negativity and prejudices against others, since I've always tried to see the humanity in everyone, and I've always thought that every single person had a story we didn't know about, so we shouldn't be so quick to judge. 

Lately his negativity is becoming more and more difficult to endure, it has brought down not only mine, but my mom's mood too.

He's not only full of hate for other people, but is so old-fashioned to the point of saying that women should always be submissive to men, and do all of the household duties.

The straw that broke the camel's back, however, were his thoughts on homosexuality: when I came out as a lesbian, he started crying, insulting me, and, to this day, he keeps on asking me when I'll settle down with a good man.

Suffice to say he didn't take it well, and I feel oppressed every day, unable to be myself, unable to talk about the girls that I love, unable to have a conversation about things that matter to me in fear of being repudiated.

My dad outright refuses to travel, to be open-minded, to get to know other people, to find happiness; he's always living in his bubble full of hate, negativity, ancient mentality, and me and my mom are getting tired of his shit.

Thing is, me and my mom are planning on leaving him, finding a house for us two and cutting all contact with him, and he has no idea.

On the other hand, it was mostly him who supported the family financially in all these years, should I feel guilty?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I fly every 2 weeks to NYC. I’ve learned to only take a backpack on board and check a bag. I do this so I can put my carryon overhead.

Here’s the story, boarded early, put bag overhead and sat with my headphones on waiting on everyone else to board. I noticed a passenger (one of the last to board) over my head cramming her bag in. I asked her if she was crushing my bag. She said no that she put it on the floor to put her bag in its place. 

In the nicest way I could I told her that she doesn’t have the right to just move my bag. I called for the fly attendant to check her bag and to put mine back where I had it, which didn’t work exactly. My bag was moved further up the plane but at least it wasn’t at my feet. 

I filed a formal complaint on the flight attendant for mishandling the situation. The company agreed that my bag shouldn’t have been moved.

Edit: forgot that the flight attendant said that I could get off the plane if I didn’t like the situation. I never raised my voice or got out of my seat. I only pleaded my case to not have my bag touched."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"My friend who lives near me told me they'd pick me up and drop me off to work since we work in the same office. He picked me up for 2 days, I offered to pay for petrol and he refused. During our commute I was talking about work and a course I was doing came up. They found out that I had a class during work hours on a Monday (work related). Then during the next 2 days he doesn't talk to me during the commute but still picks me up. At work he doesn't talk to me as well .

Monday comes by and I'm waiting out front of my place to be picked up but he doesn't show up after 10 min. Thinking he's upset with me I go to work myself. Got there in time luckily. He sees me and I was pretty annoyed so I ignored him for the rest of the week.

When I asked him what happened he said he assumed the course wasn't at work when it was being clearly discussed in the office that it would be at work. He said she wasn't mad at me when we were in the car. Still pretty annoyed at him snd and things are obviously not the same. I don't talk to him unless it's for work and he does the same as well.

c5by6t	2019-06-25 17:25:04	TrueHotDog2	AITA for slightly resenting my girlfriend for getting a job soon-fed to her by her mom?	"So I just finished my sophomore year of college studying chemical engineering, and my girlfriend just finished her freshman year studying neuroscience (premed). After graduation I hope to enter pharmaceuticals, which is coincidentally the industry my girlfriend’s parent’s are involved in. My parents have blue collar jobs, but it’s not relevant.

During the whole semester I busted my ass applying to literally 100 internships, complete with cover letter and all. My goal was to get something in pharmaceuticals, and my girlfriend’s mom told me that she’d try pushing my name along if I applied to position(s) at the company she works at, which I did. It was a very nice gesture and I was really appreciative of it.

I got a decent number of responses and interviews, but in the end I got 1 internship offer in a different industry (but still a big company and I ended up loving it). 

Meanwhile, my girlfriend didn’t apply to more than 2 or 3 positions all year. She spent her time focusing on other important things, including her mental health and applying to transfer away from a school that she was incredibly miserable at. Eventually she decided to spend her Summer volunteering (which is important for premed people to do) and she was happy with that.

Then three weeks into the Summer, her mom tells her that she *created* a job for her, and that she’s going to be working & learning underneath her at her pharmaceutical job. 

My girlfriend has said she feels a little guilty and feels like a fraud for it. But she also said it isn’t a crime to have connections, and that she isn’t doing anything wrong as long as she stays humble and understands her privilege. 

Another important note is that before this happened, I was complaining to her about a couple of the interns at my company who got jobs in the same way and are obviously under-qualified. So she was worried I would look down on her when the same exact thing unexpectedly happened to her. But I instantly changed my tone since that’s not true and I was supportive for her.

I do agree with her about it being fine as long as you’re humble/grateful, and I’m still being as supportive as I can. But internally I’m kind of salty about it. She didn’t apply, didn’t interview, isn’t knowledgeable/interested in the industry, and frankly has no qualifications other than being the daughter of an employee. AITA? I figure I am, but I just want to change my perspective. At the end of the day I love her and want to be happy for her.

TL;DR busted my ass for an internship while my girlfriend got a nonqualified position created for her which isn’t relevant to her studies. I’m trying to change my perspective so I can be happy for her and not resentful."	Asshole	0	0

c5buc3	2019-06-25 17:17:52	Lebonin	AITA for playing Runescape at work?	"Alright alright I know at first glance everyone would say yes but let me give you some backstory:  28th May 2019: I get an interview to work in X inc. (not the real name obviously) as an archivist for the summer. During the interview they ask me if I can easily pick up the phone or i’m too shy to handle it. Back then I had no clue what they were talking about and just said “yes of course!” I mean I’d work as an archivist...what kind of call would I be doing? Just to confirm some past info with other company? I don’t mind. Seems simple enough. At the end of the interview they told me I’d get an answer in the next 3 days (wow that’s quick!) if I get the job or not. 31 May: get an e-mail saying I have until June 1st at 20:00 to accept their offer. If I accept I’ll be starting Monday the 10th. Agree and they show me around the place on the first and second day of work. Turns out X inc wants me to contact all the restaurant in a specific region to promote an event made by the company and try to get their info like name of the owner/cook , email adress etc (wait what I didn’t sing for this!) Finally on june 13  I start to do some actual work of archivist like transferring files and reorganizing stuff. No problem! On June 17 I finished everything they asked me to do. Clearly they seems embarrassed because they thought it would take me until June 25 to do the whole thing. So for the whole week (17 to 21) I had to call restaurant and trust me it’s shit to do because clearly they see me as the annoying one (multiple restaurant just hang up as you speak) . But here’s the fun stuff: I work from 8:30 to 16:30 and we’re told to always contact them during 9:00 to 11:00 and from 14:00 to 16:00 (so we’re not bothering them during rush hour) . That leaves me with 4 hours of doing jack-shit everyday (minus the lunch time of course). I tried to find myself some work around the office but they just don’t have anything until 25th + you HAVE to call the restaurant to confirm the info. At this point I just say to myself : fuck it. Open my phone and start playing runescape mobile (10/10 would recommend) at my desk while everyone around do their ACTUAL work...I feel like shit cause i’m basically getting paid to watch meme online and play  but at the same time doing cold call isn’t even in my work contract and yet I’ve been doing this all week. As I’m typing this from my office it’s 1 pm and I have yet to get any sings from my superior to do some actual archivist-related-work. They wana get someone to do their dirty work for cold call? No problem but pay me more (cause yes there’s someone else assigned to ONLY do this kind of work) and even then I have zero clue to what they do during off time (aka the rush time for restaurant)

TLDR: I get paid to play games online 4 hours a day at work cause I’ve finished my main task and nobody gives a flying-fuck about me in the office...AITA?

I’ll try to answer as much question as I can if needed."	No A-holes here	0	0
c5bubv	2019-06-25 17:17:51	Richmond-Avenal	AITA for skipping my grandfathers 90th birthday?	"Some family history, I guess. I used to be very close with both of my mothers parents, when i was around 16 they got a divorce, and he moved out. some time later she sold that house and moved into a condo for retirees. the old house was the first building on a side street, and while we were moving all of her stuff we noticed my grandfather parked across the main road watching us, it was creepy as hell at the time, he never came over to say anything, never offered to help, just sat there and watched us. Some time later at a christening or communion or similar event he told my 12 year old brother that the reason they got divorced was that my grandmother had an aneurysm and it was pressing against her brain and made her crazy, and it could pop any day now and kill her (none of which was true). This kid was terrified he was going to lose his grandma for like a month before he asked our mother about it and she set him straight. Years later he told my unstable uncle that my mother was the reason the two got divorced resulting in a blow-up on christmas eve where the uncle screamed at her and blamed her for everything. He also beat my mother repeatedly as a child leaving some pretty awful trauma that persists to this day. I haven't talked to him in over a decade at this point by choice, any family event that he's at I just pretend he doesn't exist. Whenever I've brought girlfriends to family events I've pointed him out after having told them his history.

My uncle (his son) sent me the invitation to come to his birthday dinner, which I politely declined. I was asked what big plans I had that would keep me from seeing my grandfather. I was honest, I told them I didn't have anything planned I just didn't want to go. They all know his history, my family are a bunch of gossips, everyone knows the stuff he's done but they just don't care enough to cut off contact. I got messages from aunts, uncles, and cousins telling me i was being rude and that I would regret not going in the future since he likely doesn't have many birthdays left, he's family, i was being dramatic, etc and begging me to come out. Should I just suck it up for a night to give the old man a better party? should I have made up plans that didn't exist?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5btlw	2019-06-25 17:16:40	throwaway_dogsss	WIBTA if I refused to go to my friend's house because I'm afraid of dogs?	"I (20F) made a new friend ""Kate"" (20F) while working together on a project last semester. We've been hanging out more and more as of recent and she's invited me over to her home for a pizza and movie night.

The problem: her family's got 5 dogs that just roam freely around the yard and the house. And I'm deadly afraid of being approached by them.

To explain the main reasons behind my fear:

1. When I was about six or seven, my neighbor had a huge Labrador (well, huge from my perspective) that he'd often take on walks without a leash. One time, the dog rushed towards me because I was playing with a ball and tackled me. I wasn't physically hurt but that incident pretty much traumatized me.

2. Two years ago, during my freshman year, my friend and I got chased and bitten by what we thought was a stray, but it turned out it was actually a dog kept by my an irresponsible and mentally unstable dude from our dorm. We had to get our rabies shots and file a report because the dog wasn't microchipped or vaccinated.

And yeah, now I'm pretty much terrified of any dog that isn't on a leash and don't like being touched by them. However, I feel bad because Kate talks about her pets gently and I'm afraid she'd be offended (and that it would be unfair) if I asked her to leash them just for my sake.

So WIBTA if I told her I don't want to come over and maybe asked her to hang out at my dorm instead?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c5bt1p	2019-06-25 17:15:38	Shoopuh	WIBTA: Friend wants to surprise boyfriend with a dog	"For clarification, I'd just like to start off by saying I love all animals, especially dogs. I would have my own if I had the time. I also love my friends, the boyfriend came on later but he always seemed like a cool cat and I even helped him a bit get with my friend.

Anyways, my friend hits me up asking if I'd be willing to drive with her to pick up a dog to gift the boyfriend for his 21st birthday. I am rather experienced with long drives so I am done nonetheless. However, she wants to buy a dog to surprise the boyfriend with the dog. They had talked about it, just about what dogs he liked, and he seemed to like labs and german shepherds.

However, I think this is a terrible idea. Both her and her boyfriend are both in school. Her boyfriend is in business school and has internships, while my friend is also in school and works to support herself pretty long hours. She currently has a dog, a french bulldog, but it is perhaps one of the worst-behaved dogs I have ever met in my life. He bites hands whenever anyone reaches on the ground, and you can't even pet him for too long before he starts to snarl. This is because when she first got the dog, her and her sister [who works full time] were just as busy as they are today. That dog does not heel, and the only tidbits of training he really has is peeing somewhat near the peepad when he is home for most of the day and the fact that he can sit and give a high five. They refused to train him any harder because they read somewhere that negative reinforcement with frenchies will get them depressed, but I have another friend with a frenchie that is a very good boy through training.

Now if they get a lab, or even a german shepherd, I know those dogs are highly intelligent, and need constant supervision and training at a young age. I am just worried that the new puppy would suffer the same fate as their french bulldog. My friend says that she would help out with the dog, but it seems like her options to do so remain quite limited. WIBTA if I tell her this is a bad idea?

Regardless of whatever happens, I am more than willing to support my friend wherever, and I will help out wherever needed. In the end, I'll probably be the one driving with her to pick up the dog."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So on our wedding website we told people that we wanted money to help us with our down payment for a house. I created a registry at Target but it only had 15 to 20 items, because we really didn't need items. Most of those items were perchased months before the wedding. Then we started getting complaints that nobody knew what to buy us because there were no more items left on the registry. I responded that we wanted money for a down payment and they responded that they didn't want to give money. They wanted to give us a gift. So I went back on the Target website and registered for tons of items, stuff we had no use for. When the wedding arrived we got tons of gifts.

my friend, lets call him Bob and i are 36. we have been best friends since we met in middle school at 14.

after high school i went into engineering, and he went into the hippie nomad type of life.

one of our most recent topics of discussion (started about 5-8 years ago) is conspiracy theories.

2  days ago,  the topic of mind control cannabis strains came up while he  was at my house.  specifially MK Ultra, which i know someone who grows.   he thinks there are specific strains of weed created by the Gov to be  used for mind control

so, i ask ""how this could be possible?""

he has no answer.  he says stuff like ""you dont know"" and ""the government""

then,  i made a mistake.  i said, ""you know there are real things to worry  about and then there are fake things to worry about created by the media  and conspiracy theorists.""

then he goes ""well, what is real then.  i mean, how does a magnet create electricity?  we don't even know!""

i cringe, and then i give him a little 5 second explanation on faraday's law

he goes ""how do you KNOW its right?""

i  say ""because i am following the lead of tens of thousands of scientists  over the last few hundred years who have been devoting their life to  disproving faraday  and other electromagnetism theories....and they have  failed to disprove it, so, as it stands today, we KNOW EXACTLY HOW  MAGNETS CREATE ELECTRICITY""

he goes,  ""yeah, i know what is real man, you don't have to be a dick about it.  i don't have to be here helping you, ya know?""

right then and there i stop giggling, and i sincerely apologize.  for like, 2 minutes i explain why i am sorry. and i mean it.

after a short break he says:

""how  about a discussion on the most controversial thing ever, ""remote  viewers"".  you know, the military uses these people to help solve  crimes.  they dont need any clues, they can just ""see"" what is happening  and can tell the MP or FBI where the crime was or whatever.""

i ask ""can i give you my opinion, or would you like me to skip this one""

he says ""go for it""

i  say ""there COULD be someone out there with special powers, the majority  of the people who claim to be able to see the future or to beam their  mind thousands of miles away to see something...are faking it for money.  OR, that these remote viewers, are actually just really intuitive  people who can look at crime info and provide an additional piece of  insight to the crime.

he got mad again  ""so you are saying that there is no way that ""remote viewers"" are real,  you just want to dismiss it like that.  you are not as smart as you  think you are.  I read articles too..  whats so different from my  articles than what you read in school!?!?!""

then, i'm done.  i'm seeing red.

""EVEN WHEN I AGREE WITH YOU, YOU STILL ARGUE WITH ME, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HERE, THEN LEAVE""

5 minutes later...he left.

am i the asshole?

i really needed 10,000 words to fully explain this, so i will answer questions regarding the details of this if you want."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Massive parties for every birthday. I grew up poor and was lucky to get a few presents. She has two great boys (5 and 8 years old) and spoils them like she was spoiled.

Recently my gf has had her hours cut in half. Well her sons birthday is coming up and before she started planning this big party I told her that I’d be happy to treat him to a nice dinner out and do some stuff with the her and the boys obviously but s few presents but we can’t spend the normal amount we have in recent years. She went off about how I should’ve been cutting back more than I already do and she’s not willing to sacrifice these times with her kids so we can be “comfortable”. I’ve transferred all of our money into a separate trading account until she realizes we can’t continue like this or else we will literally run out of money. Her family is livid. Even my family said that I shouldn’t have done this and that it’s not just my money.

c5bnra	2019-06-25 17:06:13		AITA for not removing the sticky note off guys chair? Background. Guy at work who is kind of weird sits in our area but we don’t do the same kind of work. He’s weird in that he acts really needy, is a people pleaser and keeps trying to chat and won’t take hints when	"We’re busy trying to work. However me and other coworker is always friendly towards him and chat when we can, there’s no animosity and he is always polite. 

When we’re busy and trying to work but me and my other coworker is always nice to him and chat when we can.

So he’s been here about 3 months and he put a sticky note on his chair saying “Bobs chair”, so no one will take it. On Friday coworker and I saw that someone put a sticky beside it saying “no it’s not”. Coworker and I didn’t take it off, thinking it was a joke from someone he knew. 

He came in this morning, turned around and asked us “hey do you guys have a problem with my sticky on my chair because you can just let me know”

And we’re both shocked that he automatically accused us. I said no we don’t and we wouldn’t do something like that. I said, maybe it’s from someone you know?

Isn’t he being really weird? And should we have taken the sticky off so someone’s feelings wouldn’t have got hurt"	No A-holes here	1	0
c5bnn4	2019-06-25 17:06:00	SavMac14	WIBTA If I complained about my disabled neighbor?	"TL;DR at the bottom

A little background.... I moved into some low income studios about a year ago. It's only me and my brother so it's a pretty chill spot. It's not in the best part of town and most of the occupants have or have had a troubled past, either with drugs, addiction or lifestyle choices. I stumbled upon them when a friend made a post in Facebook about the complex accepting applications for new tenants. The units are what you can expect out of low income housing. Thin walls, crappy insulation, the works. It was an opportunity that I don't regret taking, for the most part...

Now, I have a neighbor that we'll call Frank. I've met Frank before. You can tell by looking at him that he's been through the worst, but is still standing. I'm not sure if he has a speech impediment or a mental illness (or both), but I've been able to have some BASIC communication with him when he's on his meds, as he calls them. He grunts at me when we see each other, and I've been able to understand a few words here and there. 

The thing with Frank is he yells, for hours on end, every day and every night. I'm not talking a short yell and then stop. No, no, no. Frank yells at the top of his lungs, stopping every 10-15 seconds to catch his breath, for HOURS on end. It's not a scared type of yell but more of a ""Make it Stop"" kind of yell. Every day and night. At night, it makes it EXTREMELY HARD to sleep. Both my brother and I work early AM jobs and it's been countless times where we wake up at 5am to get ready and Frank is still yelling his lungs out from the night before. There have been 5 or 6 times where he wanders throughout the complex while on his yelling tirade. When he's on his meds, he's a completely calm person but He doesn't like taking his meds. I know he has some caretakers that come visit him, and I've spoken to some but they're always different when they come see him. It's never the same person for more than 2 times. 

We've tried everything from insulating our door to wearing ear plugs over the past year, to no avail. When I first moved in, I called the cops multiple times because I didn't know if he was in danger. I can't move out because I don't have the means of doing so at the moment and am here on another year lease. My last option is to file a formal complaint with management, but I don't want to do that as they have a 0 tolerance for complaints and have been known to evict people over complaints.

TL;DR WIBTA if I complained about my disabled neighbors constant yelling, every day and night?

Update: I spoke to one of his caretakers today. She gave me the card of the agency that works with Frank. She mentioned something about them working with the budget he has. I don't know how disability assistance works but I'll try to look into it when in between jobs. She also mentioned that people don't stay long with Frank because he tends to be very aggressive and dislikes most of the people that work with him. In regards to his meds, it's not that he doesn't take them on purpose but literally forgets to as he suffers from mild dementia. She couldn't go into detail due to patient confidentiality but advised me to have some patience. They're working to relocating him to an assisted living community but are trying to find one that would work with his problems and aggressiveness"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5bmse	2019-06-25 17:04:26		AITA for asking for the biggest room after moving?	"So first of all some background knowlegde:
I am 16 and live with my mum and brother. We have atleast moved 10 times already and in that time I only asked once for a specific room and that was in a apartment where all rooms where the same size just a different shape(2 were squares and 1 kinda a rectangle). My mother also just sits at home all day(most of the days) like my older brother, while I drive about 1hour and 20 minutes to school atm.

 In all of those different House's/apartments my mother spent basically next to no time in her room. She basically spent most of her time in the living room.

Now we are moving again and I want the biggest room(its only a little bit bigger than the other two), because I feel like I need it the most. On the other hand my mother wants it.

I've tried multiple times explaining to her why I feel like I should get it. 
Firstly, like I just said she doesn't spend any time in her room except for sleeping, when I bring this up she just keeps saying that she'll spend more time in it in the future.
Secondly, if she would get the room(which is highly probable because I don't get a say in this) her room would be more than half empty, while mine is pretty much 3 times as full as her room is atm, but when I bring this up she also just says she'll get some chairs and other furniture for it.

So people of reddit, who do you guys thinks should get the room?"		1	0

My 4 little cousins (the oldest is 9 and youngest is 4) saw my car in the driveway from the window above and they were banging on the window yelling my name and yelling hi. My mom told me to say hi back and I really didn’t want to. I was tired from working all day and I had to drive across town so I could get my mail. I was really not in the mood. She yelled at me to wave back at them and called me a “bitch” after I begrudgingly waved at them asking me why was it so hard.

My mom knows that I’ve never been a fan of kids. The sound of kids yelling and crying is like nails on a chalkboard to me. I’m usually able to tolerate them of the most part, but that day I was tired and ready to go home. Am I really a bitch for not wanting to deal with kids that day?

c5bkxa	2019-06-25 17:01:18	LineBetweenBorders	AITA for not letting my mom back into my life?	"Hey Reddit

&#x200B;

As a bit of back story I'm 1 of 2 adopted kids in a 3 child home. I'm the only girl, the youngest, and quite possibly my mom's greatest regret. My mom and I had a very tumultuous relationship growing up. I had attitude and mood problems and she and my brothers would aggravate me on purpose. My mom used to laugh at me and call me bipolar, flash forward a few decades and I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) so she was definitely in the right direction assuming I had mental health issues even if she was unkind about it.

When I moved out my mom and my relationship got a lot better, until a few years ago. We got into an argument about politics and her husband did something inappropriate in a crowded restaurant that I responded to poorly by loudly scolding him for his actions. Not my best move but I also don't feel wrong about what I did and refuse to apologize for it so my mom stopped talking to me. She always does things like this when she is mad at me or doesn't get her way.

So we haven't been talking much for the past few years. It makes me very sad but then there are moments where I remember things from my past, like her telling me she regrets adopting me or how she always brings up things I did in the past - a decade or longer ago - and demands apologize even if it's an event I had already apologized, and then I feel validated in my choice to not reach out or continue to have a relationship with my family. I love my mom but our relationship has been very toxic.

A few weeks ago, around my birthday when I originally thought of making this post, my brother started to catch up with me and let me know I was going to be an aunt. Eventually I broke down in our conversation because there's a lot going on in my life like a really rough breakup, my bpd, and just general life stresses. I didn't mention any of that to my brother (my family doesn't know about my bpd - my mom would just use it against me) but I did mention how I had recently been hospitalized and was on work leave due to a recent attempt on my own life.

Cue phone spam from my mom moments later. My brother took the time to tell her about what I had said and now she wanted to reach out. After ignoring my phone calls and giving me short text answers for 3 years she wants to talk.

I ignored the calls. I don't want to talk. I reply to her texts though and I tell her I don't want to talk. I feel bad because I am torn between two feelings right now, wanting to reconnect with my mom and wanting to avoid that cycle of toxicity.

I know she's worried about me but if she only cared when I'm in crisis what kind of relationship do we even actually have..?

I'm back at work and struggling with the weight of some many other things I'm not sure this is another stress I want to deal with. I love my mom and she is getting old, I would like to reconnect at some point but... it feels like now is not the time.

c5bker	2019-06-25 17:00:25	Pink_Flamingo96	AITA for hanging up and refusing to talk to my aunt?	"My(23F) sister(22F) has to go and get her VISA done soon and I am busy making all the bookings (flight, train, hotel, application center). I have also prepared most of the paperwork, all I need to do know is make copies and get them certified at my local police station.

Now here is where my aunt(32F) comes in. While I am busy making the flight booking she video calls me. As soon as I answer she start laying into me. She says she doesn't understand why it (the bookings and the verification) is being left until the last minute, she says I should have done it earlier. She then calls me a child for not being prepared enough and tells me I am useless. I then told her I will not talk to her anymore if she carries on. She then told me ""I am your elder, I will talk to you like you are a child because you are acting like one"". That's when I hung up. 

She has repeatedly tried to phone me and has even phoned my family frying to get them to talk to me. 

I work full time, I am also a mother of a 5 month old and my husband is starting a business so he isn't of much help at the moment. I am trying my best and I have everything sorted for my sister. I did not have time earlier to do this and I literally took a day off of work to finalize everything.

 This is also not the first time my aunt has been like this and it for sure isn't the worst. But I know that once she starts acting like this it will just get worse. I seriously sometimes don't know if I even want her to meet my son ( she hasn't made the effort to even come and meet him even though I was willing to pay her travel costs)

My whole family is now sending me messages telling me I need to apologize to my aunt because she was just trying to help.

A few weeks ago me and my friends M and S went to the movies. We came back to S’s place and played video games and slept over. During that time, we were making a lot of dark jokes, it was no big deal to us. 

A week later, M’s girlfriend texted me and said I was an asshole and racist, sexist. Etc. what confused me was that she knew I made those jokes. Turns out M told her.

It's in my profile on my dating apps but besides that, I don't mention it very often. There are a few guys who have asked me on dates in the past that have called me a greedy b*tch or that i lead them on because I'm not looking for a serious relationship due to me moving. I think one of the reasons they are upset is because I'm also not the type of person to sleep with random guys and they feel like they are wasting their time. 

If it were you, would you feel cheated if you went on a date with a girl and then found out they not likely to date you or sleep with you?

Should I just avoid saying yes to going on a date with them in the first place?

I'm try to stay open to the possibility of anything happening, but now I feel like I should just avoid the dating scene all together.

So AITA if I continue to go on dates knowing that there is little chance of it going anywhere?

So I'm a pretty lonely guy, not much in the way of appeal to others, and when a girl shows interest in me it's a once in a lifetime thing. I met a girl who seemed dead set on being with me, telling me how great I would be, how happy I'd make her, all that fun stuff, so I decided ""hey, why not meet up"" and so with a bunch mutuals alongside we met up. Before we met up I had 3 friends tell me to stay away from her and I had no idea why. I'll spare the details but we had an awesome time and I thought for sure I had my person. Well shit was I wrong. 

Later that night she told me that after everything she didn't actually want a relationship, and instead wanted to ""keep her options open"" when she was going to a bunch of parties later on. Now that hurt because anybody with a brain knows what that means.

So I told her that's fine, and said (in a rather rude way that I now regret) to nevermind the plans we had to hangout later that week. I quickly apologised but the damage was done. 

Fast forwards to yesterday I decided to un add her after being left on read everytime I tried to have a conversation. Big mistake again.

c5b80z	2019-06-25 16:37:18	YS2ElectricBoogaloo	AITA or was this text super offensive	"Throw away subject but I don't know how to put it

Background:
Having a FWB stay with me so he can be closer to dad's hospice. Shortest version possible I loaned him my whole emergency fund to help out. He did not ask I offered. He got here on Memorial Day. The only time he asked for money was Sunday to bail out his brother. Which caused friction between us that I asked about in another post here that almost no one answered.

I have been trusting him up until yesterday. Yesterday he immediately blocked me from Twitter after he posted dad videos and I sent a nice text about how great it is that his dad is feeling better. That made me suspicious so I was trying to figure out what he is trying to hide. The question I asked was pretty aggressive:
""So you guys are happy and laughing and making plans to leave because your brother's out? Or because he was never in?"" That was pretty harsh of me I think.

Anyway he said he blocked me because I'm getting ""faaarrr too attached"". Note: I only follow his Twitter because he initially asked me to for the dad updates and in the whole time he's been here this is maybe the third time I've ever looked at it

I sent a long response how I'm not letting myself get attached because he's here for his dad not me, and as much as I like having him here I've always known it's temporary. But if he wants more distance he can go and just give me the keys.

This is his response, verbatim:

I'm not gonna fucking go anywhere 

I just really need some more money to stick around 

If I can get 600 I can stay for at least 6 more months 

Here* just lemme know. I'll sign the documents. Well you don't really need it we're conversing during text, even if it's not til you get paid. Just lemme know what the deal is 

I can just take care of him hete, at my brothers new place but I need 600

Sex included 5 times a week put it in writhing 

I'll sign a declaration of partnership for 1000 

That's how much I need it 

...

I flipped my shit. To me he's treating it like he's doing me a favor by staying here and offering to stay and have sex in exchange for $600. This is how 2 of my friends read it also.

He says that he was only trying to say that he needs money so he can stay in the area with his dad  (& by extension me) and that I'm disgusting for thinking He was asking me to pay him for sex and thinking he's a scumbag


TL;DR he's offended that I think he's trying to use me for money but is there any other possible way to interpret his text?!

If y'all tell me there's a way to read this that isn't him asking me to pay him money  to stay with me and have sex rather than staying at his brother's I will gladly apologize when he gets here.  The relationship probably can't be saved but if I'm in the wrong I'll admit it to him.

I will say that this text doesn't sound like him and this and the whole argument following he was acting like a completely different man than the one I've known til now.

I've known his sister (30s and also seeing other people) for the almost the same amount of time but as of recent we've been FWB (Jack didn't know but one of our mutual friends did)

Jack is getting married later this year so we (our group of friends and I) decided to take him down to Spain for a week in a rented villa for the summer.
The trip was going quite well and about 3 days into the trip I made friends with a lady who was also on holiday - we clicked and we hooked up that night.

The next day the mutual friend saw her leaving but didn't say anything at the time.
She wanted to spend time with me that day and I told the group that I'd be catching up with them a little later 

Turns out they all went to get drunk at a bar and my friend admitted to me being FWB with his sister.

That night I was heading back to our villa with my lady friend and as soon as I walk in, he's on the couch and I introduce her to him and he's got a really soured expression on his face, after a good 10-15 minutes of talking he starts asking awkward questions regarding my relationship with his sister and I tell him that now is not the time. 
He starts berating my lady friend, calling her names and asking me how I could do this to his sister and it was slowly inching towards a fist fight.

Eventually the rest of our mutual friends arrive and tell us to stop and I took her back to her hotel room. 
The next morning I calmly explain to him that I'm not dating his sister and that its really not any of his business.

Eventually the week was up and we headed back. I caught up with my lady friend and we started dating. Unfortunately as soon as Jack got home he told most of his family and I got a few messages as to how I ""betrayed"" the family and a few of my friends have called me an a**hole for what I did.

At this stage I kinda had enough.

I wanted to stay connected to them so I made an Instagram account because I wasn’t allowed other types of social media (Snapchat). It was my first time having any social media, besides YouTube, so I didn’t quite know the do’s and don’ts.  I posted basic stuff like photos of me on vacation and other stuff like that. Most of my friends know that I’m super into art and I love to color, but I’m not good at the actual drawing part. So I would shadow trace (look at a drawing and draw it) other popular drawings to work on my own skills and color them. This wasn’t something I kept hidden at all, most people knew the coloring part was what I was into. I posted some of the things I colored on my Instagram account without tagging the OG (I didn’t know how to or that I was supposed to) just to have some more photos on there. 

This is when I ran into trouble...  a few weeks later I got a DM from a person who i used to talk to at the old school. She sent me screen shots of my art posts and other screen shots of of the drawings I used. She was furious with me and said that I couldn’t just change the colors and pretend that they were mine. I tried to explain to her that that wasn’t at all what I was trying to do, I was just working on my coloring skills. And that I had no intention of saying that I came up with the drawing myself. 

I deleted all of those post because I felt so terrible about it. But the girl who DM’d me kept posting really mean things about me and the art on her twitter and Instagram without using my name, but I knew they were about me (I later learned that it’s called sub tweeting). I ended up blocking her on Instagram so she would stop DMing me and so I wouldn’t see the posts anymore. But then one of my friends who I was very close too made a post with a caption of “don’t take credit for things you didn’t do.” Written about 40 times. I asked to take it down because I couldn’t handle all the things people were saying about me in the comments. She didn’t. 

I ended up deleting my entire account in order to get away from it. But about a week after that, one of my friends got invited to a Instagram group chat thing, and the group chat was made by the two girls and it was entirely based on talking about me. She told me about saying she denied the offer. 

I got my parents involved after they came into my room while I was crying, so I told them everything. They talked to the girls moms but not much changed.

I know now that what I did was terrible and that she was right to call me out on it, but I need help to figure out if the rest of it was deserved."	Asshole	0	0

c5b30k	2019-06-25 16:27:53	PFTA7878	AITA for not going to church on Sundays with my boyfriend's family?	"We're mid-20s, and have been dating for 5.5 years. I love their family and get along just fine with them. Since they live close by to the major city we live in (Boston), we see them fairly often. I did not grow up going to church since my whole family is Buddhist.

The mom and grandmother (who is frequently over at their family house) are diligent churchgoers. They go every Sunday, and mom spends a lot of time volunteering and helping out with the church. I've been multiple times over the years for big Christian holidays when I felt like it was truly important to bf's family and isn't a hill to die on, so to say -- Easter, Christmas Eve, etc. It's a nice church, but it's an environment I'm not used to and I feel weirdly self-conscious when I realize I'm an ethnic minority among all the other churchgoers.

I politely decline any other time I'm asked. For example, if we spend a weekend at the family house, we always get asked on Saturday, ""Are you coming to church with us tomorrow?"" Boyfriend has no strong feelings or ties to church, and knows that I really do not enjoy going, so he typically replies, ""Nah, we're going to sleep in if that's alright. See you guys when you come back!"" Grandmother especially has made some passive aggressive comments saying that going to church is the right thing to do, and how bf's sister is such ""a good girl"" when she goes to church (she also refuses to go most times). Mom is very nice and has not made comments, but I can't imagine she feels totally neutral about it.

So...AITA? I'm just wondering if it's a ""my house, my rules"" situation."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5b2p9	2019-06-25 16:27:22		AITA for wanting my boyfriend to ask his son to move out?	"I’ve (37F) been with my boyfriend (40M)for 1 year, living together 6 months. We don’t fight, all disagreements are resolved respectfully. We both feel like this is a great relationship.

His Adult son (21M) moved into his home last August (I’ll call him Bill)Bill has had an air of hostility in most of our interactions and his father has had some conversations with him about how his behavior is unwarranted. Bills behavior will improve for a couple weeks but he always returns to his hostile.

The last bad interaction was 2mo ago. A pair (one) of my underwear somehow got mixed in with his laundry. He screamed at me and accused me of sprinkling his laundry with my underwear?!

My boyfriend asked me to give him another chance and try to forgive him for the crazy outburst. 

My boyfriend assured me it was handled he won’t be awful to me again. Apparently my boyfriend told Bill that if he does anything like that again he will need to move out.

Bills behavior has been acceptable for the last two months.

Come to this past weekend, Friday night my boyfriend invited his closest friend to come to dinner. We all talked and laughed. His friend showed me old pictures of their shenanigans, it was a nice evening. Bill came home about two hours into our visit.

My boyfriends friend excuses himself to go smoke and Bill follows him as they are close too because of my boyfriend so I thought nothing of it. 

Later in the evening the friend told my boyfriend and I, that Bill went on a 30 minute rant about how awful I am, the friend specifically mentioned that Bill doesn’t ever want me to tell him to do anything, however I’ve never so much as asked him to take the garbage out. Bill said he wants me to leave him alone. (I pretty much already do?)

I am told what set him off was the fact that I made a passing remark that I didn’t think anything of, when Bill was talking about his future plans and job stability I said “well, Bill you are always welcome here”. The friend told us that Bill said “how dare I tell him he is welcome in HIS FATHERS home” I really didn’t mean anything by the remark. Maybe it was thoughtless of me???

He went on to say I was awful in every way and he was apparently making faces at me like he was disgusted with me when I had my back turned to him. I am beyond humiliated and angry. 

My position is he has an irrational hatred for me. I’m polite, friendly and have a healthy relationship with his father. I work full time. Maybe our personalities are just too different?

My boyfriend wants us to get along, of course he does, he loves his son.  But I feel like I have tried and tried.

So this is where I am at... I don’t want to live in a house where I am made to feel uncomfortable and disrespected on a regular basis. 

I feel like he thinks I’m over reacting and that what Bill said to his friend was no big deal.

c5b2km	2019-06-25 16:27:07	LK23EDJNBN3RK02	AITA For refusing to provide my father with a reference to buy a handgun?	"I live in a state with the US with very strict gun laws. My father is a Vietnam veteran, very conservative type person. As you would expect, he owns a large number of guns and likes to buy and sell them on the internet as a pastime. 

I am a college student currently attending and I live with my parents to save money. My parents have saved a large amount of money and have been generous enough to pay my tuition, buy me a car, let me live with them rent free, and provide me with anything else I need as long as I continue to get perfect or near perfect grades in school to get the maximum financial aide available and generally stay out of trouble and make good decisions. 

Today, my father asked me if I would be a reference for him to buy his latest handgun. He has a very short temper and tenancy not to listen when people talk, and I honestly don't think he should be allowed to own guns. I told him that I don't feel comfortable being a part of his gun ownership process, and after a brief back and forth over the difference between guns and cars and their role as weapons, I told him that I wouldn't do this for anybody, not just him, that I don't want to be a part of anyone's gun ownership. He then threatened to start forcing me to pay for my health and car insurance and phone bill (I work very little so I can continue to get very high grades in school). I know that I'm not entitled to any of the help that I'm getting, but am I the asshole for refusing to provide a reference?

EDIT: Since some people have been asking if this is the hill I want to die on, at the time of the argument I told him I thought that if he did something crazy, references can possibly be held liable. But I didn't tell him I am concerned about him going to far as he gets older.  So I decided possible legal ramifications would be worse than losing my financial footing for a while. According to him, he couldn't find anything on reference liability after looking on the internet for an hour. So I might have been wrong about that. Don't believe everything you read on reddit."

c5b1wd	2019-06-25 16:25:55	brokeafthrowaway22	AITA for asking my partner to split bills equitably instead of equally?	"Pretty self explanatory title. We have been together for 4 years. He brings in well over half our household income. After I pay bills, I am basically left broke because we split them down the middle, and he has been able to save up several thousand dollars. I asked him if we could split bills a little more fairly and he got upset. He wants to talk about this again tonight. So, that being said, AITA for asking if we can split bills equitably instead of equally?

Edit: this was a conversation we had last night, and he had some time to think it over. I came home today to talk further about it with him, and he’s realized it’s probably for the better that we don’t split things 50/50 anymore. I really appreciate everyone’s responses and I’m glad that neither of us feel like the asshole anymore. Talking about finances makes me feel yucky but it was a talk that probably needed to be had.

c5b1hk	2019-06-25 16:25:14		AITA for refusing to babysit my newborn nephew?	"My SIL (husband's sister) just had a baby almost 2 weeks ago with her bf who none of us our fans of because he is irresponsible, a bum, etc.. They live with my MIL. SIL works part time but now she's on maternity leave (unpaid) & her bf doesnt work & never really has & he's mainly supported by SIL & MIL.

So, for her entire pregnancy he was never really around despite them living together. He was never home when we would visit. SIL just recently bought a car & he's always using it & taking off to God knows where. He only pops in to eat, shower,  or sleep for the night. He doesnt really help out with his own baby. Yesterday he came back high (weed) changed a quick diaper & fed him a little of a bottle & was out the door within 15min.

My SIL & us dont really get along & there's some bad history between us & my husband but ever since the baby came we put our differences aside & we all have been getting along beautifully which I'm really happy about. Recently she asked if we would wanna babysit him sometime (she has another kid who's elementary school aged) so she could spend some one on one time with her other child since she's felt a little left out since the baby came.

Now, I LOVE my nephew & I would not mind babysitting him (we have a 2 yr old daughter ourselves) but I told my husband no because I feel like her bf is a dead beat & he shouldn't be ""let off the hook."" Why can't he man up & watch his OWN child while she spends time with her other one for a few hrs? All he does is ""hang"" all day & smoke weed so it's not like he's working or anything. 

I havent told her this yet cuz we're now just getting along finally & I know she'll feel attacked if I tell her how I feel about her bf & I don't wanna mess up how peaceful our relationship has been. AITA?"	No A-holes here	1	0

c5aytn	2019-06-25 16:20:12	BigNutHD	AITA for interfering in my roommate’s relationship?	"My roommate and her SO started going out for a month before she went to college and have been long distance since. I have no problems with the guy but he is super emotional and will often fight with my roommate over trivial things. 

In February of this year, I was at a party with a girl I was getting pretty close with along with my roommate. After hanging we all went into the upstairs bathroom and the girls began kissing each other. I was into it, but pretty drunk at the time, and began making out with my roommate instead of the girl I brought. Later that night the girl I brought told my friend that she thought I liked my roommate more than her because of this.

I’d like to mention at this point that this wasn’t my roommate’s first time messing around with other guys, as she once started stroking one of my good friend’s under a blanket during a Superbowl party we had earlier that month. Her boyfriend definitely doesn’t know about this.

Three days after this my roommate tells me that she told her boyfriend that I pinned her and the girl I brought up against the wall and started feeling them up. She told me that the girl I brought with told her so and that her boyfriend was going to call me later tonight. I talked to my friend who picked me up that night and he said just to admit to it and apologize since if I fought it with my account I would just be in a deeper hole than I already was. 

I took his advice and apologized to her boyfriend for what happened that night and then apologized to all the girls in our group. After that I pretty much stopped hanging out with my friend group for the next few months so everyone could move on. I felt horrible about the entire thing while at the same time was frustrated knowing that what my roommate told her boyfriend wasn’t actually what happened.

I started to hang out with my friend group again recently and things were fine. Her boyfriend moved into our house and I didn’t have any problem with it but my roommate started to take advantage of my situation by using my appliances and even taking my couch without asking. I let it all happen since I knew if I got mad about it, I would just look like a jerk to her and her SO. 

Everything was fine until a couple days ago when we all went swimming in a lake and I was skinny dipping with a girl and another one of my friends. This was a pretty normal thing to do in our friend group and we had all done it once before. My friend who picked us up that one time called out to each of the girls to get in and skinny dip and I followed suit in egging them on. They weren’t feeling it so we just kept swimming. 

The rest of the day her boyfriend stayed away from the rest of the group and refused to talk to anyone on the drive back. Later my roommate told me this was because I had told her to skinny dip with us and he didn’t know that she’d done it before so he was pissed at me. She told me to not say weird stuff like that again and I apologized for it.

c5au48	2019-06-25 16:11:12		AITA for being annoyed by my mother in law’s encouraging my husband and his sister’s relationship?	"My MIL encourages DH to have a better relationship with his sister. I'm not sure why this rubs me the wrong way and I'm wondering if IATA? 

MIL and FIL both have 2 adult children. The four of them seem to be a really tight knit family. I was at first excited to be a part of this dynamic, but quickly realized it wasn't as perfect as it seems. SIL and I are cordial but not friendly. She's cold to me and has been slightly rude at different points of the 10 year relationship. I am polite but don't make any effort outside of ""hi how are you"" and ""bye! it was nice seeing you"". I am a very talkative/warm person to everyone else so it's obvious that I don't make a huge effort with her.

SIL (28) and DH(30) have a competitive and teasing like relationship. They don't talk about personal or deep things but he loves her dearly.In the 10 years I've been with my DH, he does not feel comfortable going to dinner alone with his sister and asks me to come as a ""buffer"" and makes no effort outside of a group dynamic. I am older (36) than my DH and just prefer neutral communication and if I have a strong relationship with a person I can tease, but I don't enjoy starting a relationship that way. I also crave alone time with my adult sibling so I think that’s odd.

Here are examples of MIL's advice to DH about improving his relationship with his sister:

-SIL and I exchanged words in a group chat and my DH took my side and told SIL she was being rude to me. His mother then sent him an email basically telling him to be nicer to his sister and family will always be there for you.

-Another time when we planned our wedding, we gave SIL a reading to do at the ceremony. She also asked to give a speech. We initially said no. MIL privately texted DH encouraging him to allow her to give the speech because it's really to honor DH anyway and to put his foot down with his wife. I find it cringeworthy to give a speech at a wedding when everyone knows we are not close like that. It's not his birthday, it's our wedding.

-We have been trying to get pregnant. We have been having complications and invited only the parents over to discuss.  After this discussion, MIL privately texted DH saying she thinks he should tell SIL about our fertility journey. 

-For our anniversary, MIL offered to purchase us tickets to a play DH has wanted to see for years. I said (multiple times) that I don't want to see that play, but suggested other plays we both want to see. SIL said she wants to see the same play as DH. MIL suggested the two of them go to the play together and problem solved! 

-General texts that say: invite your sister to do ""x y and z""

-Creates a competition by offering a reward for who is better at a mutual hobby of theirs for the month

c5asur	2019-06-25 16:08:50	blah_fkin_blah	AITA for not “reminding” my husband that my birthday is coming up?	"My husband is really a good guy, just very forgetful about specific dates. I have to constantly remind him about birthdays coming up, smaller holidays (i.e. Mother’s Day, Father’s Day etc.), anniversaries, things like that. Usually I don’t mind all that much, but I think it’s a little awkward to remind him when my own birthday is.

I’ve made the decision not to remind him that it’s coming. We’ve been together for over 5 years, married for 3, with two kids together. Definitely long enough to figure out when my birthday is. I’ve never been huge into birthdays so it’s not as if I expect a huge party, I honestly just like it to be acknowledged and we move on. Also, with social media he has plenty of ways to see when it is to know the exact date on his own. 

However, when I told my brother this, he told me I was an asshole and being petty because it seems like I’m “testing” him. I guess I can see his point of view because I’ll honestly be pretty upset if my husband forgets but no one has to remind me when his birthday is coming up. He’s a grown man, I feel like there’s somethings he needs to figure out on his own. So Reddit, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5arbi	2019-06-25 16:06:07	throwingaway163647	AITA for asking my coworker to stop doing my job	"Throwaway because I know coworker in question uses reddit. Also on mobile 

A bit of background: My job consists of producing employee training manuals for a large corporation. My coworker ""Connor"" used to work in the same department as me, but took a job in our shipping and receiving department after the other guy left. I am now the only one in my department.

The controversy: Connor has a habit of coming in to my department and putting manuals together that he needs to ship. I have repeatedly asked him to come to me when he needs something done right away and I will do it for him. This is what our previous shipping guy did and it worked out well. As Connor no longer works in my department I feel as though the work should be delegated to me. Connor on the other hand thinks that since he knows how to do everything that he should just do it. My stance is that it is no longer his responsibility and that it is disrespectful for him to take work that is meant for me. I have had multiple conversations with him about this, but today got a bit heated. I did not raise my voice or become unprofessional. I just tried to once again explain why I did not want him doing my job and he got upset and told me ""Do whatever the fuck you want!"" And he stormed off. I walked past the shipping area a few minutes later and saw papers all over the floor that he have evidently thrown around in anger.

We were all really good friends and hungout alot over the years and a half we were friends. During that time Kara had told me about her troubled life and about alot of shit she hadn't told anyone else.

So after a year and a half of friendship I invited Jack and Kara over for my birthday. After Kara left for the night I asked Jack if he wanted to smoke some weed for his first time and he happily said yes. Unknown to me though Kara had told Jack before she left to not smoke with me bc she wanted their first time smoking to be together.

About a week goes by and I had forgot about the fact that me and Jack had smoked together and didn't think I needed to inform Kara of this deed due to Jack being a very open person with her. Well apparently I needed to because out of the blue Kara gets in my face and starts screaming about how she thought I was a better friend and that I'm a shit person for not telling her we smoked and blah blah blah. I apologize whole heartedly and told her that I didn't think i had to bc Jack would've and she interpreted that as me putting all the blame on Jack which pissed her off even more and she stormed off. I blew this off as her being the crazy bitch she is and got on my bus. 

When I got home i found my Instagram and Snapchat banned for violating terms of service and a text from Jack ""I'm sorry buy we cant be friends anymore because Kara doesn't want me talking to you. Also she had everyone report your social media. Sorry."" In the course of 3 hours I had lost all my friends bc of the bitch and was sent into a depression for the last month of school and first 2 months of summer. Idk how I did it but I pulled my self outta the depression but came out with very little sympathy, commitment issues( to the point of not getting to know my new friends as to avoid another incident like this) and alot more sarcasm and assholeish behavior. 

Skip forward a year and I find out one of my friends is having the same shit done to her by the same girl. This girl was friends with all the same people I was (before i got kicked out) and the all stopped talking to her. So with my new found ability of not giving a shit I posted all the personal shit she had told me and then just sat back and watched as she had her life partially ruined and her friends dropped her.

c5aoiu	2019-06-25 16:01:09	gemrose666	"AITA for standing up to my mum and being ""rude"""	"So as a little back story, my mum and I have had a rocky relationship for a couple years. We've had quite a lot of arguments ever since I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety because she doesnt believe mental illnesses are a ""thing"". 

So she calls me up, and I haven't spoken to her in about a week because I go to work, come home sleep, go to work ...etc. 

So she calls me up, I'm like oh I think I can pass my driving in a few weeks and she's like ""you'll never pass your driving"" the she starts screaming at me and because I'd been feeling fairly confident, I spoke back and she did NOT like it lol 

She goes ""I haven't heard from you in a few weeks and suddenly you can pass your driving""

I'm like ""yeah my instructor said I'm really good"" 

(This is my third time trying to do my lesson, so over the years I have racked up about 30 hours of lessons but my mother forgets this) 

She goes ""oh your sister instructor said she's good, that's what they say"" (sister literally had her first lesson that day) 

Anyway we're arguing about it, then she's like ""why are you talking like that? Is your boyfriend there?""

And I'm like ""what?! What has that got to do with anything!"" 

Then she's racist (because my bf is from a different country) and she said that I'm talking like the polish do. It's at the point my bf tells me she's crying. Anyway, I have to go because I have work at 7am and I don't want to spend all evening arguing with mother. 


So I hang up. Literally just can't be bothered. In my mind she's toxic, she never likes it when we talk back (she had 5 kids and I was also forgotten about because I was easy). 

So she calls me up the next evening, when I'm at my second job being a waitress, and my phone is in my apron ringing like crazy but I can't answer it because it's a Friday night so it's SO busy. Im texting her ""can't talk at work"" she keeps ringing me all damn night.

Finally when I leave work she calls me again and is like ""how dare you be so rude to me"" and I'm like wait what, here I was standing up for myself but all of a sudden I'm being rude? Anyway she yells at me for like an hour. As soon as she's gone I call my dad and just start crying, wishing I didn't have a mum how much easier would it be. Is that horrible? Every time I talk to her my mental health deteriorates. 

My mum ruined my relationship with my dad my entire childhood, they're divorced ofc, and she always said that my dad didn't care and didn't love me. And over the last couple years we've rebuilt our relationship and we're so close, and I always feel like he has my back. It just seems like everything I do disappoints my mother so I would rather just not talk to her. Like ever."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5anoc	2019-06-25 15:59:36		AITA for telling my therapist she was cherry picking the entire Second World War as a way to prove her point about systemic anti-semitism in the global climate today when I was making a point about the US getting involved in certain countries under false pretenses	"So to provide some context, therapy is going rather well and I find myself having normal conversations with my therapist instead of talking about my problems.  Which, I agree, is not the purpose of the time allotted for therapy, but it naturally happened so here we are.

I mentioned in passing that I don’t know a lot about world politics but I wonder why the US has to get involved in countries where the United States citizens were misled about what was occurring.  This is a vague point but I was interested in her thoughts.  She says that the USA is a beacon of hope and freedom in the world and our aim should be to protect freedom where it is being threatened.  I said fine that’s a valid POV.  I agree to that extent.  I specifically pointed out situations like “WMDs in Iraq and Gulf of Tonkin” to show her my path of thinking for the conversation.  I was specifically asking her opinion on those types of situations.

She posed to me whether I thought it was appropriate that FDR didn’t get involved in WW2  even though he knew about the concentration camps in Europe.  

I paused... and then told her she was cherry picking one specific war.  She then started saying “are you freaking kidding me?”  To which I replied,” I’m talking about today and Bush, Obama, Trump, and modern political decisions that I don’t fully understand and I’m wondering if you have an opinion on getting involved in things that don’t necessarily concern us due to being misled.”  I also mentioned that I was talking about how the UN exists to show global support in opposition to such crimes against humanity and that I believe they should take a larger role in dealing with humanitarian crises as opposed to single countries.  And I mentioned AGAIN that I simply don’t have a lot of information yet I’m saying in general terms that’s my opinion.  And she starts a rant about how the UN is against Israel and FDR was an anti-Semite.

Is there any way to have a conversation these days with someone that cares about a topic deeply but doesn’t let their emotion get in the way.  I can’t equivocate anything in my life or ancestors past to the holocaust but I don’t understand how she can suggest that I was being insensitive when we were clearly having two diff conversations.

c5alr5	2019-06-25 15:55:44	Benshapiroepictime	AITA for telling somebody his wife is a cheater	"Last night was my uncles birthday. to celebrate, my family went out to one of those restaurants that cooks the food right in front of you. If you’ve been to one you also know that they’ll sit other people with you too, to save space I guess and have you interact with others. Anyways, my grandparents start talking to this guy who was sitting with us, probably aged mid 50’s to 60’s, and it turns out that he’s married to my grandparent’s best friend/neighbor’s ex wife. 


So they talk that for a minute, having a laugh about what a small world it is and such, yadda yadda. After a while the husband says “maybe let’s not bring this up to G (neighbor/ex husband), I wouldn’t wanna get him jealous or upset.” Here’s where I come in. To this, I reply “I seriously doubt he cares about that cheater anymore, I’m sure he wouldn’t be upset haha.” Apparently he didn’t know she cheated and that’s why she was divorced, she just hadn’t told him the reason for divorce. 


I thought things were fine up until today, a few minutes ago, when I got a call from my grandparents telling me that all on the ex wife and current husbands Facebook there were posts about not being trustworthy and it looked like they were fighting pretty seriously. My grandfather called me an asshole and said I should’ve just kept my mouth shut last night. I thought it’d be fine if I just interjected into the conversation. No one else has really said anything to me about it, so I’ve come to reddit to see what you guys think.

I (F24) am an university student struggling with depression and anxiety issues which made me impossible to go through my academic carrier properly.

c5akra	2019-06-25 15:53:47	gametalking	AITA for limiting what games I talk about with my gamer friend?	"My friend (A) and I have been friends for years.  We’re both adults, hang out on the weekends when we can, share multiple things in common.  We’re both gamers and used to game together a lot more when couch coop games were more popular.  I work a 50+ hour a week job, not including commute or on call time, and I only really get to game on the weekends.  A, however, has up until recently been unemployed for an extended time and spent a lot of that time gaming.

We talk about games, new games coming out, what games we are playing or played, etc., although it is not our most common subject.  A and I have different gaming styles; A is a completionist and wants to get every trophy and accomplishment, find every hidden item, etc, while I am story driven, focus on side and main missions, and have zero interest in trophies.  While we both enjoy the same games we often focus on and enjoy different aspects.  Because of this and our schedules, while we do often play the same games, we rarely play them at the same time.  Recently, however, I found that once I mentioned that I’d started a game that soon after A would pick it up.  I thought this new behavior strange and mentioned this to A who replied that they hear about me playing a game, it sounds interesting, and that inspires them to play.  This is where the friction starts.  A frequently makes comments like “it wasn’t fun until I started playing it on ultra hard” or “did you complete all of <blank>?  I finished that in the first phase”.  While these are common comments from A now that A has a lot of gaming time and it always felt like subtle bragging it never bothered me much until now that it was a game I was currently playing and it was starting to take the fun out of talking about the game for me.  I brought it up to A and they admitted that it could come across as oneupmanship.  I mentioned how it had started taking the fun out talking with A about games I’m (we’re) playing and stated I was going to avoid mentioning to A about what games I was currently playing going forward, which made A angry.

**Players: C - my boyfriend , J - my best friend, M - my best's friend boyfriend/my boyfriend's best friend**

I moved into an apartment with C, J, and M back in December. Since then it's been complete & utter chaos. J & M are immensely dirty and just never clean up after themselves and contribute to the house very little. I always buy the necessities like toilet paper,paper towels,soap & etc. I've asked both of them to chip in and the response is they never have money, yet I see them buying unnecessary things. I barely have money myself sometimes but try my best to spend what little I have to make sure we have the things we need. C & I have always been very clean people and tbh I genuinely enjoy cleaning lol, but not to the extent that I have to in order to pick up the slack. I clean the bathroom,sweep & mop the floors. C & I take turns cleaning our dishes and he always helps me clean in general. J & M leave their dishes in the sink for a long time, once for a week & a 1/2. They treat our living room like a closet and have clothes strewn across our high top table/chairs and shoes on the floor. This irks me to no end for obvious reasons. I organized the living room a few weeks ago and now it's a disaster again.

C & I went on a mini vacation at the end of May & made sure all our stuff was neat and clean before we left. J & M are on vacation right now and they didn't clean any of their dishes and of course the living room was still a mess. J's birthday was on Monday and they come back tomorrow. M asked me if I could go buy a cake for her (I currently have no car as I was in an accident & my dad is annoying about driving me places. C is gone for work by the time I get home) and set it up and what not. I love my best friend but I politely refused as it's not my mess in the living room. Her & I agreed that she only wanted a card from me for her birthday (as did I for mine) so I feel it's not my responsibility to get her a cake and set it all up on top of having to clean up after them in order to do this. M also does not have a plan and wants me to do all of this when I get out of work (@ 6;30) and they still won't even be home yet. This is his idea and has no plan for it either. I feel it's a bit rude of him to ask/expect that from me when in turn nether of them can help out around the house.

c5ahrt	2019-06-25 15:47:34	rosieb1	WIBTA if I didn’t go wedding dress shopping with my sister?	"TLDR at the bottom.

So basically my sisters getting married early next year. I’m moving to another state to re-start studying in 8 days (today’s Wednesday, leaving next Thursday). Keep in mind, it’s an 18 hour drive from where I live to where I’m moving to. From where I’m living now, my sister is a  1.5 hour plane ticket away.

Months ago I mentioned to her that this was going to be a busy time for me and, if she wanted to go wedding dress shopping, to sort out some dates earlier. She said it was fine and she’ll probably just go with whoever is around at the time.

Fast forward to two weeks ago, she asks me out if the blue if I can come shopping that weekend (last week). She realised how much it meant to her to have me there. Now I’d made some really exciting plans for that weekend that I really didn’t want to cancel, I was seeing a guy I’d been dating for the last time (he also lives in another town), and I’d been waiting a week to see him again. It may not seem as important but it was important to me and I’d already had the plans for a while. She asks if I can do this weekend, 5 days before I’m moving, and I know that’s going to also be really tough. But it means a lot to her and I want to be there so I buy plane tickets for the weekend with insurance.

Fast forward to now, 3 days before I’m meant to visit her. I’m getting a nasty case of tonsillitis, I have chills and am really fatigued. This is stressing me even more because I literally don’t have time to rest and as shit as I feel I need to be packing, seeing family for the last time, and applying for jobs (and also mentally preparing for a 3 day car trip).

I know she’s really excited to see me and my opinion means a lot to her but it’s getting to the point where I’m sacrificing my own mental health. I really want to be there but I’m so stressed at the moment, so much that my body is breaking down. Im considering canceling the flights and staying at home. Keep in mind my mum was also meant to go so she would still have her, and the week after all her friends are going with her.

So reddit, WIBTA if I didn’t go wedding dress shopping with my sister?

TLDR: I live a 1.5 hour flight away from my sister and am moving to another state (3 day drive) in a week. She wants me to come up 5 days before I leave to look at wedding dresses with her after short notice. I agreed and bought a flight but now (3 days before I’m meant to leave) I have a nasty case of tonsillitis and I’m stressing a lot because I have to much to do before I leave and not enough energy to do any of it. I’m thinking of canceling the flights and staying home."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I start my second job on thursday as a camp counselor. I'll be working 8 am- 4pm on thurs, and then go to my other job from 4:30-10:30. On friday i work at camp again, and saturday night I have to work. Last weekend, my friend asked me if I'd drive him to the airport saturday at 4 am. I said yes, not knowing my future work schedule.

I realized I'm gonna be working 50 hours a week or so bc of camp and my other job. My only weekend night off is Friday, and my friend doesnt even get out of work until at least 10 pm, so we wouldnt be hanging out. Just going right to sleep. I feel bad as I told him I could drive him, but I think I have a lot on my plate and need Friday to do what I want or else I'll kind of just crumble.

If it changes anything, he has the money to get himself an Uber and since we've been best friends for a while, I told him my mom offered to drive him. It may be an awkward situation, but the offer is on the table and hes traveled with my family before so he knows her well. AITA for saying no? He hasnt opened my messages but I think he might be mad at me for doing this

Update: Thanks everyone for taking the time to respond! I apologized a lot and offered to pay for his Uber like you all said. He's asking another friend to drive him and he doesnt seem that mad. I've learned to not make promises if I dont know I can keep them"	Asshole	0	0

He was really excited about this car and said it would make him very happy in life. So I asked him if he was taking his meds ( I can tell when he’s manic) and he said he’s not and that he got upset cause he felt attacked that I brought that up when we were talking about the car. I told he needed to make sure he could afford insurance and everything and have money left for his child. He’s really bad with money.

So, yes I take my job very seriously. We had a girl here who worked in a different department and her and I kindled a friendship over this time.

I have been in a serious relationship (LDR) for over 4 years, and also we have an open relationship. During the last few months, I made some friends and one among them was a girl (same age), let's call her R. I was always kind of attracted to her and I felt that she too was. She also knew that I was in a committed relationship. A few days back,  I decided I would let her know how I felt. I asked her out for a movie. Before and during the movie, I had multiple chances to make a move on her but I could not because I wanted her to know (before anything happened) that I was not interested in a relationship. After the movie, when we were in a secluded area, I directly said to her, ""Hey, I know I'm making this awkward for us but can we be like friends with benefits?....My gf knows."", to which she casually replied 'Nooooo'. I said I was really sorry and she said that it's okay. We parted our ways-SHE shook my hand (I was too embarrassed to even look at her).

When I reached my place, I realized she had sent some messages which clearly showed her displeasure regarding what I asked. Her exact words were ""...I mean how did you even think of it? Do I look so easy for you to be FWB?....you left me speechless and hence my response was 'it's ok'....."" I called her which she did not pick up. She replied to few of my texts and I'm sure that she's not going to forget this very easily.

c5abw7	2019-06-25 15:36:15	Nir_Kap	WIBTA for interfering with my neighbors' memorial ceremony	"First, let me explain what I mean by ""memorial ceremony"".

I live in Israel, and in the Jewish culture after the death of a relative all of the family and friends are getting together in the person's house for seven days (called ""Shiv'a"" in Hebrew, which means seven). Well, obviously not everyone is around for the whole seven days, but the close family sure is, and friends and other relatives are paying them a visit every now and then to show respect, keep them company and take care of them while in grief.
To make things clear, at the end of the day, which can be as late as midnight, nearly everyone returns to their home and comes back the following morning.

To the case in hand. My girlfriend and I are living in the lobby floor of a building, and unfortunately one of the neighbors passed away the other day.
His family asked the neighbors' representatives for a permission to have the Shiv'a at our lobby, which I geuss is just a good sense of courtesy by them to agree.
As my girlfriend and I had no idea of this whole chain of events (no one spoke to us about it beforehand), we were surprised to see dozens of people next to our apartment this afternoon, while getting back from work.
Although this supposed to be a modest ceremony, they came to be quite loud, which makes it hard for us, as students, to study for our upcoming exams.
Next, we spoke to some of our neighbors and figured out what is going on.

Now, we have found ourselves with the following dilemma (that you must have figured out by now): since they are going to be there for the following seven days, and the noise makes it hard for us to study, will I be the asshole if I'll make them have the ceremony somewhere else?

c5aalx	2019-06-25 15:33:42	Grymlin	AITA for getting a neighbor fined $1000?	"i am a 24M who recently graduated and have since moved to Dallas, TX. This took place a few months before moving, in a college apartment complex.  I have a 3 year old hound mix who is very  sweet and loves people, as well as other dogs. The only thing he doesn't like is when random unknown dogs rush him all of the sudden, it makes him nervous.

 I have a ton of neighbors and many of them own dogs. The apartment complex has a very obvious leash policy, as it's posted up in multiple places as well as being in the lease/agreement. This is for obvious reasons. I often see ppl walking large dogs with no leash at all. There are a few people who have MULTIPLE dogs out running around at once.  It was at a point where I had to check outside every time before walking mine. This went on for a few weeks.

At first, I would go up to anyone I saw walking their dog without a leash and just remind them that there is a strict leash policy. Most of the time they would apologize and go back inside. Most of them  continued to walk the dogs with no leash though. At this point I had called the front office multiple times about the problem, and they always said they would keep a look out.  But i never noticed a change, the dogs continued to run around without leashes daily. I contacted my apartment through instagram trying to get something done and that's when they started telling ME that I needed to start taking photos of them and collect as many photos as I can of all the people and send them to the manager. This seems absurd to me, as I am a resident there and I should NOT be the one having to enforce their own rules. it seemed that this was the only way to get them to do anything about it, so I took a few pictures and sent them. There was one girl in particular who would go outside with her THREE large black labs and would sit on her phone while the run around. She did this multiple times a day. after the apartment thanked me, and then I didn't hear anything after that.

Fast forward to a week later, and I got a knock on my door. I open it, and it is the black lab lady screaming and ugly crying. I had never actually talked to her before, and she immediately asked ""ARE YOU THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN TAKING PICTURES OF ME AND MY DOGS?"" I was in shock, as I expected my identity to be kept private since the apartment complex was ASKING me to do this, even though they shouldn't. I said yes, as there is a strict leash policy and she violated it multiple times per day, and I was tired of having to deal with it. She tells me that she got fined $200 five times, all for walking dogs without a leash. I told her that she was breaking the rules and she needed to take responsibility, then shut the door. I have since moved to a different city but I think back to this and $1000 is a whole lot of money for a college student. I kind of feel like the asshole. So am I?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

2) i don't generally buy people presents because it's never been a thing amongst my group of friends- we don't buy other people presents

So, I've known this friend for most of my life (since I was 10, and I am 25) but lately, I've been repressing feelings of anger towards her. I love her very much - she is really fun, not a mean bone in her and she has the same values as me. To put it in a nutshell, she is anything but boring. But for the last year or more, I felt that she was cold with me. What I mean is, I am always the one who contacts her to meet. Then, she will act very enthusiastic at the idea of doing something together, even though most of the times she leaves me hanging the day we are supposed to meet. She won't call or text, and when I do, she keeps it very short. So, since I am not that stupid, I simply thought she didn't care anymore and, even though it was painful for me, stopped contacting her. When she felt I had enough of her though (she had stood me up for the third time in a row), she wrote me a long message apologizing, a very sweet one, saying she knows she hasn't been the best friend, but she is feeling very, very down and is in a dark place, so it is hard for her to keep in touch with anyone.

Now, that I get. I know how it feels so I realized I needed to forgive her and be more present. I decided I would keep on calling, and trying to meet. But with time, I gave up on that again. First, because I realized, though she clearly seemed like she didn't have any time for me, she was still seeing her other friends many times (and always has excuses about it). Second, because I grew tired of having the same one-way conversation with her: she talks about her, I listen, that's it. When I talk about my issues, she's on her phone.

I know it seems like that she clearly doesn't give a sh\*t about me in my post. But please keep in mind she assured me many times that she cared an awful lot, that she was patient and kind until now, and told me various times she loves me because she knows I am a very anxious person who always feel like nobody cares about her. So I really don't know how to feel about it.  But, with the way she has been the last year or so, I kinda wanted to cut all contact if she doesn't change. 

The thing is, I feel really bad now because she told me recently she decided to enter in a psych ward for her depression. I feel terrible for her, ***but*** I still am angry at her. I tried messaging her one time, and her answers were only a few words. I gave up trying, and it infuriates me to see how she is spending most of her time being an activist on Twitter, and giving lessons to everyone about social issues, when she's such a bad friend.

c5a5rv	2019-06-25 15:24:35	beigepaintdrying	AITA for not driving my (19F) brother (16NB) to their internship?	"Repost because the original was over the word limit! I’m a pre med student and I am studying to take the mcat next summer. We’re Indian and my parents came to America before I was born. They’re very stubborn and stuck in their ways, and are unhappy that I tend to identify with American customs. If I don’t meet their (sometimes unreasonable) demands, they accuse me of not caring about them and only using them for money (I have a job and pay for a lot of my own things. They insist on the rest). 

I also started studying for the MCAT this past December. Since classes ended in May, I’ve been consistently waking up early in the morning and studying for 3-5 hours before I go to do other things for the day (gym, job, friends, etc). My parents have been DOGGING me since I got out of school saying that I’m not studying enough. To them, “enough” is 10-12 hours a day. I study in my room, but my parents say they don’t believe I’m actually studying unless I sit in front of them. They are carrying on thinking I haven’t studied for the damn test at all when I’m putting a lot of effort into this!

Today, my brother missed the bus to their internship by accident. My dad works from home and has pretty flexible hours—for example, today, the earliest meeting he needs to call into is at 12:30 pm. He left to drive my brother at 9:15 or so, but asked me to drive him first. It’s a half hour drive. He knocked on my bedroom door. I went to open it up. The conversation transpired like so: 
 
Dad: “Are you awake?”

Me: “yes, I’m studying”

Dad: “Can you drive your brother to the internship?”

Me: “do I have to? I’m studying.” (Said knowing his meeting wasn’t until later today)

After I said that, my dad turned on his heel and called me an ungrateful child. I help out my brother all the time! I drive him everywhere and pick him up without even questioning my parents or him 99% of the time. 

Here is my point of view: I never said no! If he really needed me to drive my brother, he could’ve told me I had to or even requested that I take them anyway just because he didn’t want to. I would’ve said yes. I only questioned it this morning when he initially asked me to because I was in the middle of studying. I got a text from my mom soon after saying my dad claimed I wasn’t even studying. Eye roll. I was in the middle of a pretty difficult practice passage. I’m a very hard worker, and I’ve dedicated myself to studying even though it’s a year off. Also, I literally never said no to him! He just walked away mid conversation.

I can kind of see how me saying “do I have to?” could be taken to mean “no” right off the bat. I also understand that me saying that right away may have come off as disrespectful and like I don’t care to help out my family.

I know I’ll be grounded when my mom comes home. I need to know if I should just take my punishment for being an asshole or actually debate them. Thanks for reading!"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5a4nz	2019-06-25 15:22:27		AITA for not unfollowing my Coworker on Instagram?	"Background: I am 26 she is 22 and we've been together about 2+ years. 


The Story:

I work in location A. I was sent to location B to shadow this more experienced co-worker for the day. We got along, she seemed nice enough, we were around the same age, and she went to the college I attended to. That was it. We don't speak personally on social media or whatever, keep it strictly at work about work with the occasional add-on here and there. I drove back home same day to location A  


We had later followed each other on Instagram shortly after (week or so? Don't remember)  


The only ever other real-life interaction I had with her was on a large group business trip in Location C. Again we kept it professional, nothing even close remotely to physical or emotional attractiveness. Oh add on: she's married - even less to be worried about. Again, usually when we (barely) talk it's through our work emails or work Skype and it's 99% always work related.


Fast Forward to today -- we were arguing about something else and this coworker was brought up. I was asked with questions on, ""Why are you following her? I think you're physically attracted towards her."" You know where this goes. She doesn't believe me  when I say I'm not attracted to her and she's on edge from some other things. Does she a right to to ask me this? Do I have the right to deny her request? She brought this issue up 1 year ago but it seemed like she was over it. But here we are. Being her age, their age-group seems to care about social media way too much. I’ve unfollowed my exes for her because that’s reasonable but asking me to unfollow a co-worker seems like I have no control over my own life and opens Pandora’s box for her asking me to do anything that slights her wrong."		1	0

c5a3p5	2019-06-25 15:20:32		AITA for being upset my boyfriend's going on vacation without me?	"I've (30F) been with my boyfriend (33M) for ten years, and we've lived together for 9. We have a 4 year old together, and his teenager from a previous relationship lives with us. We're both stressed but for different reasons - me with the kids, and him with his job. But, we are doing ok in our relationship.

Anyway, my boyfriend inherited his father's timeshare when he passed away. It's at a resort on a lovely tropical island. He's told me for years about how he used to go on vacations to this place annually, and all the things he used to see and do. He always told me that we'd go someday, and it's something we both really looked forward to. Since his father passed, one of the things he wanted to do was spread his dad's ashes on the island per his father's wishes.

We weren't able to go the past few years due to work, finances, lack of babysitters etc. Last year, he decided that 2019 would be the year we would go. We were bummed that we couldn't make it the last few years, and we could both really use a break.

Earlier this year, he'd told me to arrange a babysitter. I was going to ask two of my family members, but decided I'd wait until I saw them. I hadn't talked to them in a while and didn't want to be that asshole that only calls when I need a favor. In March, he reminded me to ask them. I was going to see my family in 2 weeks, and told him I'd ask them then.

A few days (5ish days) before I saw them, he decided he wanted to book the tickets. He told me to ask them that day, and I told him to wait a few days since I'd be seeing them then. He said it would be too late since the ticket prices were increasing. I asked him if he really couldn't wait, he told me he couldn't. I told him whatever, just book yourself a ticket then since I know how much he wants to go. He did.

I asked him on the day I was due to see my family if I could still go if my family agreed to babysit. He said no, the ticket prices had increased and they're too expensive now. Plus he didn't know if I could get a ticket on the same flight since he'd already booked his seat.

One of the things that upsets me is that he says the tickets are too expensive, but after booking the tickets, he's purchased several expensive things that we didn't really need. I would understand if it was something like a refrigerator or car repairs, but he's buying things like tickets to sports games, sports jerseys of his favorite players, a treadmill, takeout a few days a week, etc.

I'm pretty hurt that I can't go. I wouldn't ever want to vacation without him. Every time I've tried telling him that I'm sad I can't go, he shuts me down by bringing up the fact that he's going to spread his dad's ashes while he's there. Obviously I'm not going to argue with him at that point... but I'm still upset.

am I the asshole for being upset with him about this? Is he the asshole for not bringing me along?"	Everyone Sucks	1	0

My husband just told me and the kids that our next holiday will be at his hometown. I really don’t want to go because I hate that place! 

I’ve been there twice. One when we had no kids and the next time after we had two kids. The kids loved there since it was something different and they had kiddy fun. 
My husband enjoys to meet people he used to know and just be in his hometown where he lived when he was very very young. 

I HATED the place. TWICE. Since I had no one there that I knew other than his family people and there was not much to do there! No place to go! For the sake of doing something, my husband would take us all for car rides around the city. Then we would eat out since the food at his home is just meh. 

He has a lot of sisters and yet, they make the most boring and easiest foods. I really didn’t enjoy my stay there. Also his family is very boring. Maybe because they are all a lot older than me and we just can’t connect. I mean I’m nice to them just for the sake of it. But I don’t enjoy their company. Nor their home town. It all sucks. !

It's not complete but I've been anticipating every new chapter. The newest chapter was short and not as detailed as the previous. Normally I don't leave comments except to ask for updates soon but I felt like leaving one just coz I was a fan of this writer and wondered why this chapter was average (it wasnt bad but it wasn't good either). 

I commented that I didn't wanna be negative coz I love their story but the chapter was short and had expected certain characters to interact but didn't. I said I wasn't hating just that this was my honest opinion but I still love their fics and asked for updates soon. They replied mocking me and that I should keep my ""honest"" opinion to myself. 

While I'll admit that my replies weren't mature, I just felt that mocking me was uncalled for so I replied scathingly that they're the type that can't handle any criticism and that I was ""sorry"" that they felt butthurt about my comment. I added that they're a great writer but the chapter wasn't their best.

They replied again mocking me that I'm the type of commenter that can't tell the difference between ""criticism"" and ""constructive criticism"" and that they're ""sorry"" I felt butthurt for being called out on it.

I told them I normally don't comment so I sarcastically said thanks for calling me out. I said that I didn't understand why they felt offended and reacting so badly but ok. I mean I didn't say anything mean or hateful.

They said that they felt ""lucky"" that I chose their story to comment and that if I didn't like it, I should move on. And how they were aware that it wasn't their best but didn't need to hear that it was disappointing but still needed to post it so the story can go on.

I've taken a writing course in Uni before so I know criticism is hard to swallow but why post on a public forum if they can't accept the comments? This forum was for hobby writing so it's not like they're on a timer. If it was that hard, why not take their time? Wouldn't be the first time after all. 

While I wanted to be petty, I decided to stop replying coz it was getting silly.

A year into our marriage my former wife had an affair. I tried to make things work but things really only got worse. After years of counseling, thousands of dollars, and advice from some close friends and family I got a lawyer and asked for a divorce. She didn’t have any problem with the decision. She read through all the papers, signed in a Panera bread and got them notarized at an UPS store. We haven’t have much contact since. In the divorce I gave her a car (the only two cars were in my name and I bought before the marriage) as well as more than half of our property just to get her out of my life.

Recently I have thought about the rings, which kind of escaped my thought during the divorce process. WIBTA if I asked for them back? She had an affair, she wanted the marriage to end, and she received more than half of the assets to begin with. I know I don’t have much of a right here and I know she will probably say no, but I would still like to get them back. WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5a1fg	2019-06-25 15:16:12		WIBTA if I asked my coworker be sent home cause her blowing her nose is so loud?	"Context: I sit right next to a coworker (office setting) whom blows her nose quite often. Usually this is maybe three-four times throughout the course of the day. Our entire floor knows this is because every time she blows her nose, it quite literally reverberates through the entire floor. It truly sounds like a trumpet coming out of her nose; it’s so, damn, loud. I cannot understand how someone blowing their nose can create such a sound. There’s no sounds of muscus or anything, it’s like an air horn. I’m talking I have my headphones in full blast and I still hear it. I go to the bathroom to take a dump and I hear it. If I’m having a conversation with someone on my floor, I literally have to pause until she’s done blowing her nose to resume speaking. One time a newer employee literally asked, “What is that?” out loud to be greeted with an awkward silence since everyone knows what it is.

The problem is right now, she’s sick, and this is now happening almost every 10 minutes. I CANNOT concentrate and it is enraging. Coupled with the fact that she clears her throat as if she’s about to cock back a loogie every time she coughs, this has severely affected the past two days at my job. Also, since I sit right next to her, I am very prone to catching whatever she has and cannot afford to get sick.

I will be upfront in saying that I deal with misophonia, which is a hatred of particular sounds. So even a normal day when this happens over the course of the day, I’ll just internally roll my eyes back in disgust, but I have hit my boiling point.

WIBTA if I asked my boss or HR to ask that she is sent home to work from home until she isn’t sick? Obviously I wouldn’t mention any of my extracurricular hatred towards the sounds, but at the end of the day it is truly distracting and making others privy to getting sick."		1	0

Now because this area is run by Jesus & I'm quite well known I'm basically unemployable here (I've been quietly applying for jobs for about 6 months and not a single interview). 
The choice is obvious- leave this dust bowl & return to the ocean. I've got some great job prospects, friends, and will be much closer to my family.

We've discussed it for months, totally understands the reasons, and knows they can always come home if they are unhappy on the ocean. No problem.
I'm just worried. That I'm being selfish. 
Should forget my career, stay here, and I don't know work at Circle K? That I'm ruining my kid/relationship with my kid? Should I sell my house and move out to a farm for increased safety?

c59w1v	2019-06-25 15:05:31	EverydayEverynight01	WIBTA if I didn't go to some pricey tutoring program my parents forced me to go to?	"So I finished school and my mom is always nagging me how I shouldn't always stay home and sleep in during the summer. I was so sick of her complaining that I agreed to go to some tutoring program as long as it is close enough and doesn't take too much of my time. So my mom has been on the search for one. So she found one program called ""Kumon""

&#x200B;

I've heard of how terrible it is from my classmates. It's a huge waste of your time and all they give is workbooks and a ton of homework. I'm going into grade 10 next year, so I already had enough homework. When my mom got the registration forms she immediately wanted me to sign up for long-term.  This is not what I agreed upon.

&#x200B;

In the Kumon centre we registered for there is a $50 one-time registration fee and a $25 one-time material fee. As well as a $140 monthly fee per subject. We just chose math. 

&#x200B;

My mom and I got into an arguement about this one. She said my grades need to improve and be excellent (on my 1st term report card I got 3 subjects below a 70% and only 2 subject +80%. Most of my marks were below the average. I felt that my marks improved a lot. I got a 68 in science and I worked hard and on the 2nd term I got an 82. My geography I got a 60(can't remember exactly) but that improved to mid 70s. My english is by-far the wrost still maintaining a 68 to a 69%. I'm not bad in english. It's just our teacher is shit. Nobody can understand what he's trying to ask for and overall he's just shit at marking.)  

&#x200B;

You know I just want to get out of this stupid tutoring program. I have to go there for 30min a day. Twice a week and on top of that I they give homework too. I only originally agreed to do this just for the summer. Now I just feel like not even going there at all. It is 0.9km away from my house and the streetcar doesn't even go all the way there for me."

"Hey all, so to give some context, I turned 17 yesterday, I loved what mum and dad did for me and don't expect anything else from them, and even my sister was really amazing coz she took me out to a fancy sushi place, so from my family I couldn't ask more. But I kind of expected more from my friends.

We met up in the morning as we had some school meetings etc and nobody even congratulated me, only one person, and they kept reminding everyone to tell me happy birthday coz they all forgot. I'm not too fond of birthdays myself but it would've been nice to see that they even remembered.

And secondly, normally in my group of friends, when a birthday is coming up we create a chat on what gift we are going to give them. Half the time it ends up being money as we don't know what to get each other, but nobody gave me anything. The best thing I got was that I got my lunch paid for... Mind you it was only €3 but at least that was nice I guess.

I feel kind of bad to know that I've always been there for the others to cheer them up and make sure they have such a nice day and whatever, but nobody apart from one person even remembered.

And I kind of feel like I'm being a prick pretending to have gotten more because I sound selfish but idk, the more I think of it the sadder I get I guess.

Also, another birthday is coming up, the same person that was the only one to congratulate me and stayed reminding the others, he's going to throw a party at one of his uncles villa's, and I don't feel like causing any drama so obviously I'm going to pool in some money for him, but he didn't give me anything...

Basically my partner and I have been together for 6 years and we are very much in love she was there for my depression and she was the first friend I made when I moved to Delaware she's just all around great. So we are both seniors at the same college but a couple months ago  I found out she went to a couple parties which is fine but got a little too drunk at two of them (or so she says) and she had sex with another guy and hooked up with another. I felt so betrayed I love her to death and I don't want to leave her because of the emotional bond we have she knows my family and I know hers we are so good together. But I have refused opportunities to cheat so many times because to me it was easy sober or drunk. But ever since then I feel like maybe I've missed out on so many opportunities involving sexual activities. Now I'm getting kind of curious and it's harder than ever to reject because I just think about those moments she had the opportunity to say no but decided to live a little.

This past weekend, my parents offered to watch the boys so my husband and I could get away for a few days. It was amazing and we really appreciated it, thanked them over and over. When we arrived home, the boys were sleeping all was good and they went to their AirBNB for the night. At 5:30 am my youngest woke up whimpering, so my husband went to check on him. He was soaked in pee, like neck to toes soaked. The diaper was on so tight it couldn’t do its job. Obviously not ideal, no one wants to be soaked in pee, so he cleaned him up and the world kept turning. Later that day we see my parents and I mention to them again that the diaper was too tight and LO woke up in a mess, I didn’t make it a big deal, and had a smile on my face the entire time, even cracked a few jokes. They nodded and we went on our merry way, or so I thought. Later that night, my mom text and said that her and my dad were extremely hurt that I would bring that up to them and that they had bent over backward for my family these past weeks…etc. She even said, “that’s what happens when you have a baby, sometimes the diaper leaks”. I was so livid but I kept my cool, and my parents refused to see us for 2 days. Yes, sometimes the diaper leaks, but there is a huge difference between a leak and a full-on explosion, it was a user error. My parents are still visiting for another 9 days (who’s counting) and now my husband and I feel like we are walking on eggshells, because god forbid I give them some constructive criticism. AITA, should I have just kept my mouth shut and said nothing?

TLDR: I gave my parents some constructive criticism about diaper changes and it blew up in my face."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c59s9q	2019-06-25 14:58:25		AITA for pausing the TV when my wife insists on playing Snapchat at full blast?	"My wife (29F) and I (30M) have a good relationship and have been together for over six years now. We don’t have any kids, just a dog. For the past year or so, my wife has developed a big time addiction to Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook, and while this is all well and good she plays the stories and videos and whatnot pretty much whenever she feels like it and as loud as her phone will go. She follows her old party friends, friends with babies, and favorite bands, so when she fires it up it’s a constant stream of babies crying or laughing, drunk people yelling and screaming, or bands playing concerts and crowds screaming. We’ll be enjoying downtime watching TV and start playing her stuff so loud that I can’t hear the TV, or multiple times we’ve even been laying in bed listening to podcasts and she’ll just fire it up and start playing stuff so loud that I can’t hear the podcast. I’ve tried asking her to just turn it down, but she gets pissy and acts like the only volume on the phone is off or full blast. I’ve explained to her that it annoys me because when she does it I can’t hear the TV/music/podcast and I would be totally fine with it if she would just wait for a commercial break or, even more simply just not playing it at full blast so that I can hear too and she still gets super pissy.

So, I feel like she just really doesn’t care about how much it annoys me and does it anyway. I’ve tried to explain it or ask nicely every way I can, but she still just plays them full blast whenever she feels like. I’ve even told her flat out several times I’m totally fine with her playing the videos anyway but just turning it down to half volume instead of full blast so we can both hear what we want to hear and she acts like I’m being a huge dick. I think it’s common courtesy that you would at least wait for a commercial break. If she starts playing videos and I turn up the TV or radio, I’m being a huge jerk. Either way it’s been driving me insane, so last night we were watching a show that mutually interested us and she started up the ol full blast Snapchat, so I paused the TV and she asked why, and I told her I couldn’t hear the TV over her phone and I wasn’t interested in bickering about it anymore and we would just wait for her to be done. Damn if that didn’t set her off. She told me I was being immature and rude and that I was treating her horribly and basically acted like I had just given her a horrible insult. But, I think that as a committed partner, you should care enough to know it’s rude to start playing super loud videos of drunk people screaming and babies crying at full volume when you know your partner is trying to watch or listen to something else. Especially when your partner is totally cool with you just simply turning it down or if you do have to watch at full volume, wait for a commercial. AITA here and just being too sensitive?"		1	0
c59ry0	2019-06-25 14:57:44	farana97	AITA For getting my handicapped neighbour's car towed?	"Okay, please read the whole thing before judging me. And apologies in advance for any errors, English isn't my first language

About three or so months ago, new neighbours moved in. They looked fine, except they seemed a bit ""spoiled"". For example, when the moving truck came, Mrs. new neighbour was complaining about a parked car because it was near her driveway and may bother their movers while they got their stuff off the truck, so she was saying how she was going to complain about that car and report it as abandoned so it would get towed. Luckily that didn’t happen. 

So anyway, apparently she suffers from some leg injury and she limps a little bit, enough to be considered as handicapped by the traffic laws. So a month after she moved in, I've noticed a street sign that said that the driveway between my house and hers was reserved for her car, and stated the plate number.

Here is the issue, my house is in a very commercial area, and it is hard enough already to find a parking spot, plus her house has a garage big enough to fit easily two cars, and then two more cars can fit on her driveway. We don’t have the same space, so before they moved I always parked in that place.

If that sign wasn’t annoying enough last week when I left my house, I saw her car, with the plates matching the street sign, parked on our side of the driveway, not on her reserved spot, while the spot was free, obviously. When I came back, I saw the car still parked on the same spot, but now on the reserved spot there was another car, I’ve recognized it because I've seen it before on several occasions, it was either her husband, who could have parked on their garage, or a guest, who could have easily parked on their driveway. So I reached the conclusion that she was abusing of this privilege given to her, using that spot as a guest-reserved parking spot.

So I snapped and called a towing truck to report an illegally parked car in a handicapped place, later that day, the car was towed.

AITA for getting her car or her guest's car towed?

Thanks for reading guys, I know this was long and I appreciate your time.

EDIT: I use the word driveway to describe the part on the street where anyone is allowed to park (including her own garage entrance) and when I am referring to ""HER driveway"" I am talking particularly about her garage entrance, where it would be okay for her, her family or her guests to park, but not for anyone else. Also I want to clarify that the sign is issued by the government and it is legit, thats a thing in my country."	Not the A-hole	0	0

A family got on. Two middle aged women, two kids and one old lady. 

The kids sat down first, then the other three went behind me and I didn't pay them any more attention. Then the pair of seats behind me became available a few stops after that. The two middle aged ladies sat down and the elderly woman stood beside me and kept looking at me. 

I did not get up as there were other seats available nearby including the priority seats, and if she needed a seat the two middle aged ladies were right next to her and could give her one. 

A few stops later, the elderly woman walks to the back and sat down.

The problem is that one of my cousins living there I do not trust nor like. He is in his late 20's and is an alcoholic who refuses to get help, he doesn't have a job and lives with my aunt without paying for anything, he is a terrible influence for my other cousin's child by playing violent video games and constantly cursing around the kid(normally don't have a problem with this but the child is 7 and shouldn't be watching mortal kombat and hearing fuck every couple seconds), and he has been known to take other family members' money and belongings to use to pay for booze.

I started out visiting them when I first entered college but as time went on I started going less and less to the point where I only saw them once during my senior year due to not wanting to deal with this cousin.

Right now, we make about the same amount of money and split everything 50/50 - mortgage payment, utilities, etc. and we each add $50 a week as a kind of joint entertainment budget. 

I kind of see where he’s coming from as I did completely forget to transfer money one time last month, which caused our mortgage payment to not go through, resulting in a phone call from the bank. Since then, I’ve just setup an automatic transfer and it’s been good to go.

The main reason I’m hesitant is that about 9 years ago (before we met), he opened up credit cards in his mom and dad’s name without telling them. He didn’t go to jail but he was sued for a few thousand dollars, all of which he’s paid off and he has a credit card from the same company.

We planned to leave after work on a weekday, and I received a task that I ended up having to stay at work until 10pm. We left later than intended, and I helped my friend move their stuff out of their apartment into my car. I didn't know what time we would leave the city (a few days later) and return home, but I knew I wanted to be back before 7pm because I had an early work day the next day. My friend wanted to go to a place far out of the city on the day we were going to leave.

&nbsp;


A day before we were going to leave, I told her I wanted to leave at 5:30pm. They did not respond so I made sure to check in with them to reassure that 5:30 was when we were leaving (which was already a compromise on my part because I wanted to be back by 7 and the ride would take ~3.5 hours.) Short story long, my friend got to our destination to meet up 2.5 hours late, and we then ate dinner with another friends' family. We got onto the road at 9pm. I got annoyed with my friend for not getting there on time and setting us back significantly. They said they had car trouble and that was the reason why. I then got heavily annoyed when they wanted me to go 35 mins out of the way so I could drop my friend off at their apartment.

When I finally got home at 1:30 AM, I had a mini anxiety attack because of all the things I needed to get done this week. I tried expressing this stress earlier as a reason I wanted to be home on-time.

c59nl5	2019-06-25 14:49:00	coldbloodedscaoes123	AITA nephew burns him self on snake tank heater	"First post on here, so apologies for any errors. 

So this happened about an hour ago. My mom invited my aunt, cousin and her two young kids over so that the kids could see my new ball python. In my family I am known for being responsible and I am always the designated baby sitter at all get togethers. 

I recently bought my first snake about a month ago. He's a spider x butter ball python that I named Rameses and I love him to death. I worked three part time jobs and saved for months to buy him. His terrarium/ tank is on a stand in my bedroom. He eats well, sheds well and is all in all, a super gentle noodle.

So as the moms were sitting in the living room talking about shopping, my 7 year old nephew and 3 year old niece are in my room while I am watching them like a hawk. Everything is going okay, my niece is playing with my makeup brushes and my nephew is being a normal unruly kid. He's running around, pulling books off the shelves and screaming as loud as he can.

Little extra information here. My nephew can be super sweet but in general is super hyper and disruptive. My cousin doesn't discipline her kids and they get whatever they want and are never told no. 

Anyway, I'm trying to keep an eye on my niece who is currently stabbing the makeup brushes into my makeup palettes , my nephew is behind me looking into my ball python's tank and complaining about the snake sleeping and not coming out so he can see it. Yes there are only two kids to look after and not the usual 18 (big family as I said before) but I'm a sleep deprived, overworked 19 year old who is trying her best to not fall asleep but still be alert and keep eyes in all corners of the room at once.

When I first let my nephew hold my snake, I warned him not to touch the foil covered under tank heating pad on the bottom of the tank, it gets SERIOUSLY hot and can cause burns if not monitored closely. I was just about to warn him for the tenth time to not mess around with the wires when my niece knocked over a tub of powder all over my desk, floor and her dress. I had my back turned for approximately 0.001 milliseconds to deal with my niece when I hear this high pitched scream. I whip around to see my nephew crying while clutching his hand.

The kid had crawled into the miniscule space between the tank stand and the wall to mess with the outlets, had seen the shiny tinfoil and had decided to touch it. There were four small burn marks on the palm of his hand , but the burns were deep. He cried hysterically for a good half of an hour, in which my mom chewed me out for being so careless and for not warning him (which I did). They ended up leaving to take him to the doctor for his hand and now my mom continues to chew me out whenever she gets a chance. My cousin wasn't upset, she believes it was an accident, but my mom's actions make me feel like shit."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c59n0s	2019-06-25 14:47:51		AITAH for not having good manners and being selfish? Wife seems to think so.	"We’ve been together for years, and have had an ongoing struggle with this. She’s harboring some serious resentment towards me because she believes that I have bad manners and that I’m selfish. While I do admit that there’s areas that I can improve, I don’t feel that I’m a terrible person. I suppose this is all based on her standards of what generosity and selflessness actually is. It’s gotten so bad, that she’s very passive aggressive towards me, and she has become very critical and judgmental towards me. She will frequently correct my manners, and then make snide comments sometimes about it. 

Some examples: I don’t always hold the door open for people behind me, and I’m not the first person to offer help to those in need. I’m not particularly generous about giving/loaning people money. I don’t do many favors for people. 

Am I the only person that’s this way? Are the majority of men in this world more kind and generous than me? If so, I need to really get it together and do more.

So enter British college and I end up joining a friendship group. One girl in this friendship group is friends with two guys, one of them is KNOWN to be really fucking creepy (I won't go into details but yea). See i have this thing where if I know something is a bad idea apparently I have to do it, so I date him.
Surprise surprise, when I'm at his place no matter what I do he won't stop grabbing my boobs.... 
I don't tell anyone for ages (mainly because I didn't think it was a big deal) but when it finally comes out there's a storm. The group gets split where most people are on my side but some end up leaving thr group with him.
It doesn't sound like much but the group was never the same again, I've perminantly scarred friendships that lasted over 6 years and people now refuse to talk to each other due to this event.
Now to the present day. 
My friend met this amazing guy (they're an adorable couple) and she's now good friends with his group (so is one of the other girls that had sided with me), she tries to bring me into the group but there are a couple things I notice IMMEDIATELY.

They're happy and amazing, 
I don't fit in,
If I do try to join ill probably ruin the group forever. 

At this point me and my best friend had already begun to drift apart a bit so I thought that she would be happier in that group without me (as I'm only physically capable of bringing trouble). So I Began to cut off our friendship.
She's really upset and I know I've fucked up but I also know this is the best thing to do? Idk man

"I live in the basement of a house with two other roommates (a couple), and their dog that live on the main floor. When it started getting hotter, I noticed they were leaving our ground floor, front window open through the night to help keep the house cool. 


I requested that we close (at least) the front window at night, because I’m concerned about enabling opportunistic robberies or home invasions. They agreed, but they keep forgetting to close the window at night, and sometimes all day long, even though they say they’re trying their best to keep it closed. 


I admit that the heat isn’t a problem for me because my bedroom is in the basement and stays cool, but I’ve always been a stickler about making sure my doors are locked and windows are closed because it’s the easiest way to safeguard the home. 


They keep leaving the window open. So I asked if we could just keep it closed permanently, because in my opinion, the risk of getting our house broken into far outweighs the risk of being too hot. 


One important note is that we have central AC that they want to postpone using because they don’t want to pay for it. I have no issues paying for my share of the AC if they want to turn it on, but they don’t want to. 


I realize I could throw money at the problem, either by buying a window lock or offering to pay more for the AC to be turned on, but it seems to me they’re being unreasonable, and they think I’m being an asshole."		1	0

The guy from couple 2 has recently made some very hurtful and insulting comments regarding gays and pride month in general. When I questioned him on his comments, he proceeded to compare gays to the worst kind of human being (I can't say exactly what as its not allowed in this sub). This is a level of homophobia I'm just not sure I can be around.

What makes this hit harder for me is that my dad (60) has recently come out as gay over a year ago, and I am in full support of him and his lifestyle. He is the happiest I have ever seen him.

I'm debating getting another hotel for my SO and I, and just to do the vacation separately to them, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach, especially as it leaves my friends from couple 1 high and dry with them all having to pay more for the hotel. After all, couple 1, who I am very close to, have done nothing wrong. My SO and my friend from couple 1 are very good friends and haven't seen each other for over a year, so I would be ruining their time too.

The guy from couple 2 who made the comments was raised by a pastor in a very religious family. I am also religious but very accepting of homosexuality.

Maybe I just need to calm down and not let it bother me. Im taking it very personally because of my dad. I don't usually get involved in any of these discussions because they're not worth my time, but for some reason this one bothered me.

**Where I might be an asshole:**

Now that I am studying abroad my father has decided to invite my half-brother to live in our house. Mind you he does absolutely nothing but leach off his mother, he has no job (never had one), never went to college or done anything with his life. He is the classic example of a perfectly capable guy in his late 20's living with his mom. 

I have realized that is is totally unfair for him to be entitled to a large part of our house's value (as it needs to be split in 5). So I told my mother, who agrees with me because she basically paid the whole thing off. I also don't think of him as a brother, mostly because he used to molest me as a child but I have been to therapy for that and I'm fine. However, I do talk to him only for my dad's sake. 

My other brother thinks I'm a huge asshole and I'm being selfish because our dad loves my half-brother and he wants him to have a good life. Of course, none of my siblings actually like/hang out with him because he has a creepy vibe and never has normal conversations with us. 

I also want him to have a good life, as far away from me and my siblings as possible. He doesn't deserve anything from my dad's will. Sadly, my father adores him and thinks he's an angel. 

I plan on handling this as delicately as I can. So am I the asshole here? 

&#x200B;

TL;DR My dad invited my half-brother to live in our house. He's a lazy creep who has never done anything good in his life and I don't want him to have a part of my dad's will (part of our house) because it would be unfair to my mom. She paid the whole mortgage. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My stepdaughter is about to turn 15. She insists on making a huge deal of her birthday. Everyone has to be nice to her, do whatever she wants, evening they hate the activity, etc. Fine. We celebrate birthdays in our house as that person's day to do what they want. And I personally enjoy birthdays all around.

Here's the problem: Even when it's not her birthday, my stepdaughter is incredibly selfish.  She's also a scorekeeper and always insisting on everything being equal (tracking if her brother gets something she doesn't, not offering to help with things, always expecting us to go out of our way for her and rarely saying thank you while also never ever wanting to do things for others). A lot of this is typical teenage behavior but trust me when I say it is relentless.  On top of this, over the last year, she ignored or forgot her mother's  birthday, her father's, and mine. Like, didn't even ask if she could get anyone a card. When her brother's birthday rolled around, she made him a card at the last minute and that was it. This despite the fact that her younger brother spends his own money to get her birthday presents.

Last year, my mother sent her brother money for his birthday months after hers. My mom is older and had forgotten hers, so of course her reaction was to be mad that she didnt get anything. This year, my mom remembered. 

Now, given all of this, she still acts as if she should be queen on her birthday and everyone should treat her birthday exactly the opposite of how she treats theirs.

I want to treat her as she's treated others. WIBTA?

PS, I might also add she does the same thing at Christmas and gets no one anything at all while expecting everything. This has been pointed out to her many, many times.

EDIT: Just a point of clarification since it has come.up multiple times. I have only been in her life for 3 1/2 years. The birthday issue is just the one that is immediate, but her behavior towards other people has been constant despite all of her parents discussing it with her. This is not simply a matter of teaching her better as nothing we've done on that front has mattered and this behavior is not learned from any of her parents. 

She doesn't treat people well in almost any situation, to the point that her stepmother really has little to say to her and that she has no true friends. I keep hoping she will learn and a blatant demonstration of how she makes others feel (e.g., when she ignores their birthday) is only the latest attempt to illustrate that for her in a way that sinks in."

To help him out I allowed him to move in and get his life together. The problem is he has a dog. I don't hate dogs, but I don't like dogs. Still I agreed to allow him to bring the dog with him, the only rule being it had to be kept outside. He agreed and I thought that would be it. 

He's asked and I do allow him to bring the dog in sometimes and play with him myself sometimes, he is cute. But he has started to keep the dog in the house constantly saying they are playing together. He keeps it in the room. But I noticed the dog stay in overnight frequently.

c5979e	2019-06-25 14:15:54	throawaysuper69420xD	AITA for having been upset on my girlfriend showing her tits to my friend?	"So, this happened over two-three years ago, and I don't give a shit about it anymore. But we were talking and we were wondering what the people of reddit thinks.

&#x200B;

So me, a few friends of ours and my girlfriend went to an event (think comicon- type thing) and my girlfriend found this shirt/type thing  that she wanted, but she had ran out of money so she asked another (male) friend of mine to borrow some money and he said yes.

&#x200B;

She wanted to change the shirt right away, and since it was very hot outside and alot of people were going shirtless and such, it wasn't a big deal for her to do so.

So this is where the thing happened: My male friend said (half jokingly) that since he gave her money, she ""owed"" him to get changed in front of her. She said ""whatever"" and she did it. So she did in a corner with just us, and when she removed the shirt she was wearing my friend was staring at her tits, and the bra she was wearing was basically completely transparent except for some flowers on top of it. I, and everyone else, could see her nipples.

&#x200B;

I honestly not a jealous person at all, at the point that some people would think I don't care about her, but this honestly took me by surprise as everyone pretty much pretended that her boyfriend wasn't even there.

&#x200B;

I got hurt and I acted cold for a few hours after that. I didn't do it on purpose or anything like it, but I didn't try to hide it either.

&#x200B;

After a bit, we talkled about it and nothing happened. She got surprised I was hurt as she didn't think it was a big deal.

She thinks that It wasn't a big deal and that nobody saw anything and that i got hurt over nothing. I think she showed her tits to my friends.

&#x200B;

AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: My friend said that in a completely jokingly way, and just want with it when she said yes, just so you know :)

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: since i wasn't clear about it, it seems, the bra was see-through and you could see the nipples clearly

&#x200B;

EDIT 3: Alot of people told me I should have been upset about my friend. I was, matter of fact, I am no longer friend with him for a almost infinite string of things that happened between him and I.  I just didn't think it mattered that much to point out, and with the first edit all I meant was clarifying the context of the situation.I honestly didn't think he was a creep before writing this but after all of you pointed it  out, my girlfriend and I talked about it and actually, yeah he was pretty creepy considering that it wasn't a thing that he said once, but he kept saying it over and over untill she actually did it, saying things such as ""I bet you don't have the balls to do it"" and shit like that ( i honestly didn't even remember). You guys are right, I shouldn't have been hurt by her, I should have been pissed at HIM."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c596uf	2019-06-25 14:15:02	ryanp1023	AITA for kicking my friends out	"This was about a week ago me and 3 friends had plans to swim at 5pm and then watch the NBA draft at 6pm. Although it was never explicitly said I assumed it was given that we would eat dinner together because of the time we were planning to hang out. One friend shows up around 5:05 and we start to swim so I text the other 2 friends “the front door is unlocked come in when you get here” and I leave my phone inside charging. While we swam me and the friend discussed maybe going to a restaurant that would have the draft on. After about 45 minutes and the 2 other friends still weren’t there so I got out and I checked my phone. I had received a text around 5:15 saying “we are going to eat at a taco place before we come over.” So I text them and say basically that me and the friend who was swimming with me were planning on leaving pretty soon to go eat but because I knew my friends wanted to swim I said we could just watch the draft at my house because I have a TV outside by the pool. I just asked that they get me and my friend some food from that taco place and bring it to my house and we will pay them back. (Backstory the taco place is at most a 5 minute drive from my house.) They say they have already left and aren’t going to get me anything. This made me a little more mad than it should’ve looking back on it but I tell them well the door is locked now and the tacos are their ticket in. About 7-10 minutes later (remember the taco place is 5 minutes from my house) they hop the fence on the side of my yard and walk in like nothing had happened. I got mad and kicked them out for not getting me and the friend in the pool food and I kick them out. 

Looking back I did overreact a bit and it probably wasn’t worth kicking them out but was I justified in being mad and am I the asshole?

Edit: A lot of my anger came from the fact that although they said they had left the place it took them much longer than it should have to get to my house if they had truly already left.  This made me think they hadn’t actually left and were just being lazy and didn’t want to get me the food."	Asshole	0	0

c595qo	2019-06-25 14:12:50	petroyuan	AITA for protecting my mom	"my brother has as much compassion for other human beings as a lion has to her prey.  I dont like him much, and i admit i have a bias.

i live over seas, about 8000 miles from hometown. He lives in PA. She lives in NY, about 20 minutes from him.

mom has advancing dementia

she also (had) plenty of money to take care of her needs.

10 years ago she gave my brother power of attorney. i dont know if its health power of attorney or dourable power of attorney. When she did this it caused significant family friction.

i visited her recently, and she is in very bad condition - she lives alone, she has no friends, she ran an apartment building and year over year her tenants  as of late were wanted criminals (she says she just didnt know how to check their background). Both times resulted in police raid and major damage to her house as the perp was hauled away.

my brother hates my mother. and me. and any other human for that matter. he chops cars and puts them back together, and has had plenty of times in the court system defending himeslf for selling people shiny dangerous junk.

fast forward to 2 weeks ago, he convinced my mother to put all her money into his personal bank account ""for safe keeping"" and in return hed pay all her bills. He would also sheild her money from getting taken by state of NY if she ended up in nursing home.

So thats what they did.

Her assets are 300k in savings, about 100k for a house.

2 days ago i get a call in middle of night (im on other side of planet) and shes crying cause she suddenly realized she might have made a mistake. She informed me what she did.

I confronted my brother - i calmly explained to him that it is highly improper to convert all her money to his own account, regardless if his intent was noble or otherwise.

He got angry and said ""i dont care anymore. I dont care about the money. You keep it up &you will have to deal with her....""

This is totally a lie - he needs money quite badly. He ranted for years over inheritance.

Mom does not have a will, or so she says.

I asked her for copies of legal docs & she has no idea where they are.

I called her lawyer who is not returning my requests for information.

In mean time, mom now claims my brother gave back 200k and kept 100k for himself.

Shes now asking me to take 100k, and im refusing cause she is going to need money for her care.

I think i need to litigate, revoke power of attorney, or at least get power of attorney equally for my brother and i, and get a court action to demand this money be returned to her account.

Legaladvice says contact adult protective services.

I already confronted brother once and told him to put the money back. 66% was returned. I do believe he will make this move again in near future as soon as she is incapacitated.

There is risk my brother could be charged with a crime and my mother could become a ward of the state and inheritance for both myself and my brother could be eliminated.

UPDATE: After seeking legal council, i have decided to contact APS.  Thank you all for your advice."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I was busy on my Reddit and I've seen his name but never went to search for it and then i saw his that name on someone who commented on a post. I went in and saw ons of the posts and i remember him telling me that he posted this so i then knew it was him. I went to his comments and saw he commented on lost of nude girls photos and he got flirty with two of them who commented back on his comment. I felt horrible for invading his privacy but at the same time glad i found it because he is clearly in the wrong too for flirting with other girls. He says that it is my fault that i found it and went to look. Then after i took him on about it he went to go delete his profile because i asked him if he messaged anyone like that and his name was also kinda making it obvious because his name was pm me in the beginning and then something about nudes.

c5906y	2019-06-25 14:01:58	DontwantTBTAH	WIBTA for voicing my frustration at my grandparents inheritance plan?	"My grandparents told me a while ago that they’re planning on splitting their inheritance 50/50 between my mum and uncle (their only children). I don’t want to be left with nothing to remember them by.

&#x200B;

I had a really rough upbringing with my mum after my parents divorced. There was barely ever any food in the house, and I had to be totally self sufficient at 10 years old raising my brothers (one is aspergic) who were 9 and 5. I had to use any lunch money I got to buy food for dinner and skip both lunch and breakfast every day. This burnt me out to the point where I developed severe chronic pain and fatigue from my early teens.

&#x200B;

My mum either never believed this or felt like my condition was a walking blame sign pointing at her and lashed out at me constantly. She’d shout at me for needing her to drive me to hospital appointments, roll her eyes and yell at any panic attacks.

&#x200B;

My stepdad is even worse. He’s the only person I know worse with money than my mum; he tanked them both into debt multiple times, constantly trades in cars at great cost once or twice a year.

&#x200B;

I got thrown out for doing the recycling wrong. My mum flat out said she’d see me homeless before taking me back in but my grandparents took me in immediately.

&#x200B;

They’d always felt like the world’s best grandparents, but once they took me in and I started living with them they started to feel more like parents. They confided in me over time that they really don’t like my stepdad either, and just tolerate him/are pleasantly civil because of my half-sister and my mum. They’re also horrified by my mum’s behaviour, but are conflicted because she’s also their child, which I totally understand.

&#x200B;

I’m finally now in a relatively secure situation away from my grandparents house. I have a caring long term boyfriend who is amazing and looks after me, I have a roof over my head and finances are not perfect but stable. This isn’t about needing the money.

&#x200B;

My mum told me that if she died first, my stepdad and half sister would get everything; me and my brothers would get absolutely nothing. Honestly, she’s so bad with money that any money gained from inheritance would probably be lost within a couple of years like it was when my parents divorced. 

&#x200B;

It frustrates me that I feel like my grandparents are pouring their inheritance into an undeserving money pit. I know that it’s their decision to make, not mine, but it feels like them giving her that 50% share despite knowing everything she’s done to me over the years is them choosing to support her rather than me. 

&#x200B;

When my grandparents die it’ll the saddest days of my life, far worse than if my parents die. I know it’s awful to say, but having just SOMETHING in the will that shows they care about me or want to leave me something sentimental would cushion that blow a bit. Not in “I want your money” way, but in a “we loved you and want to leave you something” way."	Asshole	0	0

Well I was apparently a pretty negligent boyfriend in our relationship and we used to have fights about it.

 I normally didn't have cash to take her out on dates often (college student RIP) but this one time my sister gave me some cash so I immediately decided to take my girlfriend out somewhere on the next Tuesday.

But we had this random fight on Monday (we often did) and she wouldn't text me back the whole day. So I assumed our date on Tuesday was off because of the fight and I just played some video games with my Bois. 

So later on Tuesday evening when she texts me back she just flipped out and went all you never make time for me, never take me out anywhere, you don't love me etc. and then she was like this relationship is at a dead end and she dumped me.

Today is my nephew's convocation ceremony. I woke up at 4 am having an anxiety attack. Here I am 5 hours later sending messages to family members that I will not be making the ceremony which is in an hour from now. I did say that I will come to the house afterwards for the BBQ (although likely won't be eating anything since anxiety hits my stomach hard and don't want to be in the bathroom the entire time there).

Since then I have gotten a bunch of messages back saying anything from ""OK, take care"" to pressure to come anyway and just tough it out. Large crowds trigger my anxiety and I would either be miserable to be around or in a panic the entire time there. It doesn't help that some members of my family are not helpful with mental health issues (I was diagnosed with clinical depression and an anxiety disorder at a young age).

We just moved into a new house and the day we signed the closing papers our girl went into her first heat. To be super clear, we just signed the papers yesterday and none of us have moved into the house yet. Also we are co-owning with a responsible breeder and I'm learning to show her which is why she isn't and won't be spayed any time soon. We have two dogs and our other female is fixed.

Our house is on a small T shaped Street and I was planning to walk the dogs up and down the street to get them familiar with the area and as a way to meet some of our neighbors (I have samoyeds and they're a great conversation starter, I can't walk anywhere without being stopped). I know for a fact our immediate neighbors have two dogs, but I've not met them yet so I have no idea what their sex or status is.

I've read dogs can smell a bitch in heat for up to like 5km so theoretically any unfixed male dogs on our street will be nuts regardless of if she goes on walks or not, but I definitely don't want it to seem like I'm parading her in front of their houses driving them nuts on purpose. We will have an okay sized yard but she's a runner so no off leash time for her until she calms down some.

So, WIBTA if I walked her up and down our street? Thanks in advance.

Edit: Thank you to those of you who have raised valid points of concern and those who have offered helpful advice. To the rest of you I'm sorry me having an unspayed dog triggers you, I assure you I am doing what I can to be as undisruptive as possible to my new neighbors (hence my post here about **WIB**TA) and I am taking every step to responsibly contain and monitor her so we don't get any accidental puppies."

My sister (29F) has her 3 kid's birthdays tattooed underneath her collarbone in roman numerals. She just added the youngest one's birthday yesterday and when she sent a picture in our family group chat, I noticed that the 19 for the day in the birthdate was done as XVIIII (supposed to be XIX). I noticed it right away, as I learned how to do roman numerals in high school, but I don't think any other family member would notice. I texted my brother (17M) and mentioned it to him and told him not to tell anyone, so he's the only other person I know of that knows it's wrong. 

She is up visiting us for two weeks with her kids and I'm worried that her husband will point it out either when she shows him or when she goes home, and I'd rather her be mad at me for pointing it out than be mad at her husband. Her and I have been very close for the past 12 years (didn't get along much before that because of the age gap) and I think I'd rather her hear it from me or our mom. 

I'm sure if she knew she wouldn't care that much, but then again I don't want her to feel dumb for not noticing or regret the tattoo.

The exact location wasn’t set in stone yet (this was about 2mo ago), but Anna said she’d get me the details as soon as they decided. 7-8 girls splitting the bills wouldn’t be bad, right?

Last week, I called Anna to get the details for this weekend because I still hadn’t heard anything. Anna told me the bride’s sister “Tiff” was actually in charge, and that the rest of the bridesmaids couldn’t attend, so it was “a good thing I’m coming or the bride might be disappointed” that so few people are there. Uh-oh. She said Tiff booked an expensive hotel and the cost was $237/night (for 2 nights) and that we were doing a spa day instead of going to the beach like originally planned. I’m an Air Bnb person (and occasionally sleep-in-my-car person ha) so $237/night sounds like a lot! So at that point I had a dilemma, but decided to still attend. I felt guilty about backing out at that point, especially since 4 of the bridesmaids couldn’t go. Anna also sent me a screenshot from Tiff of her document listing out the hotel address, amenities, and price (237).

So I went on the trip, and we had a nice time. I cringed internally when we did an expensive activity, and suggested a few cheaper options, but Tiff had no qualms about treating the bride to every luxury. I was as frugal as possible given the situation, and honestly had a lot of fun with the girls. Tiff told Anna and I to PayPal her our share of the bill after the weekend. The bride wasn't going to pay anything for the room. So that night I sent Tiff the $158 for the room plus more for the meals/transportation for which she’d paid.

Today I got a message from Anna saying she’s so sorry and she made a mistake - Tiff had messaged her that we both sent the wrong amount of money. She forwarded me Tiff’s screenshot of the bill from the hotel for almost $900! So I owe her almost double. Anna is upset too, and we don’t know how Tiff could miscommunicate this. I never would have attended had I known this trip would be this much. I’m pretty low-key, but I know weddings are expensive. Still, this feels like a bit much. So Reddit, WIBTA if I don’t pay Tiff the extra for the hotel? Should I talk to her about her misleading cost details? Or suck it up and pay?

Edit: Thanks, all. I’m getting a lot of different responses, but I’m leaning toward just paying the difference and being more careful about getting a bottom line directly from the person in charge of these things in the future. I might have a right to be upset, but I don’t think it’s worth causing an argument right before the wedding."	Not the A-hole	0	0

She’s my best friend and we are both very much on the same page and thankfully throughout this whole drama she’s had my back and agrees I’ve done nothing wrong. 

Her sister is younger than both her and I, being in her twenties. My in laws invited us to dinner on Sunday and my mother in law had prepared us a wonderful spread which we took part in finishing up preparing. 

My sister in law decided to make the salad, which she had mixed with her hands and fingers together. Usually I have absolutely no problem with hand prepared food as long as hands are washed. My MIL’s kitchen set up is one geared towards entertaining too so we were all helping out at our respective work stations when I noticed her long fake nails and the amount of dark brown crud beneath them. I’ve never noticed her wearing them before but all I could see was black filth caked on the underside. 

She saw me looking and snapped that it was just fake tan, and I kinda laughed it off with her and carried on chopping my carrots to make it less awkward that she’d caught me looking. 

I discretely told my wife later on and she shrugged it off and said she didn’t mind- cool, I had done my part and warned her, and I do agree that we probably put all kinds of crap in our mouths without us knowing anyway. 

When it came time for dinner, my wife took some salad, I loaded up on baked potatoes and steak which I honestly genuinely love. I am not known for eating salad anyhow but my SIL immediately offered me some and I took it to be polite and left it on my plate. 

After dinner was over, she launched into an attack because I hadn’t eaten the salad, and she accused me of thinking she wasn’t clean. I told her I had taken exactly what I wanted to take and I didn’t really want the salad, and my MIL and FIL were both surprised at her reaction and asked her to compose herself. 

The rest of dinner was uneventful if a little quiet.  I feel really awkward about this and maybe think I should have just eaten the goddamn salad to save face but it really turned my stomach to see how black her nails were."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Last month, my wife and I were made aware of a contest going for a free roof replacement. Now, when we bought the house 3 years ago, the inspector gave us 5 years in our current roof, but sounded fairly hesitant to do so (our house was built in the 70's). She decided to enter and this, I decided to enter as well.

In a stroke of luck, we won the nomination along with one other person. Here's where it gets tricky.

The other person who entered is a single mom of 5. She works nights and homeschools her kids. Her roof is leaking and causing damage to the inside of the house.

We, however, have no children. We have a significant amount of debt, but not so much that we wouldn't be able to afford a new roof within a year or so. Our current roof isn't giving us any problems at the moment.

Voting is a rather simple matter. First and last name and an email address. We both posted on social media to garner votes, and I know that at least a dozen people have voted for us. The other person came out of the gate with 98% of the vote and is currently holding steady at 93%.

Since voting is pretty simple, I've had a few people tell me that I should vote with all the email addresses I own, not just the one. One person suggested that I should go on an email creation spree to try to win this. I'm not exactly sure of the moral and ethical nature of this plan. Personally, I'm leaning towards being the asshole here, but I don't know if I'd still be leaning that way if I were up against someone else in less dire straits. I should also note that there's nothing on the website or anything I've been told that explicitly prohibits this.

So, WIBTA if I spread this further on my social media and vote more than once?"	Asshole	0	0

I[F/48] my son, my husband, our 2 dogs and our cat, live in a moderately high income area that has high taxes to have general controlles like a residence that has a garden. Today we had a water leak problem on our apartment and we were controlled by the plumber. As you can see where this is going we kind of have problems when a guest comes in we have a fit in the house so we put the dogs and the cat in my son's room with him until quick guests like the plumber leaves which is mostly a short amount of time. 

I don't live in America and we don't go inside the house with our shoes on we put them to the garden door to make it easier to go out and as a result we don't have many house shoes or slippers. The problem occured when this plumber came he forgot to bring any overshoes (which is the norm when it comes to going inside houses where you have work to do) and asked me for a slipper. I told him that I don't have any spare at the moment(they were in my son's room with the animals) and told him to just come in with his socks on which is also acceptable because inside the house is clean due to no shoe policy. He told me that he couldn't step on dog fur beacuse he was a religious man. I am also a religious person and asked him what was the big deal and he told me he was sorry and did his job 

While he was doing his job I thought that even though we both pray the same(I know this because of the terms he used while talking to me) we might have different ways in how we do it, so I felt that maybe I was rude to him about the sock problem and figured out he was going to pray (through looking at the clock) after his job so I thought giving him a new sock which was sealed  was a good idea. I tried to gift him the sealed sock and told him that we should be understanding of each other religious practices beacuse in the end he stepped on my house that has dog and cat fur.  He told me he couldn't accept the gift after that he turned his back to me and left without saying anything. So was I the asshole for offering our plumber a sealed new pair of socks after he told me he couldn't step on animal fur due to religious reasons.

My mother and my grandparents got together to give me a gift card to a fancy store that sells high quality kitchen appliances. They know I need to buy pots, pans, knives etc, so I thanked them and said it was much needed. I found out later that the gift card is actually valid for the whole shopping mall the store is in. I decided to rather spend the gift card in a electronics store to buy a Nintendo Switch and some new games that I've wanted for a long time, and just buy some low quality kitchen appliances at a cheaper store later.

My mom got really disappointed when she found out, and demands that I return the Switch, and use the money on what it was intended on.
I won't do that, if they want to gift me something, they should accept that I have different priorities than them and be happy they could help give me something I really wanted.

c58anh	2019-06-25 13:06:54	awesomeava1313	AITA for cutting off my friend?	"(On mobile sry)
So my “friend” (who I’ll refer to as F) have been friends for about 5 years. F always made excuses as to why she could never hang out so it was kinda an at school friendship. She’d always say she had to clean her room or she had to take a shower or something dumb like that. 

Over summer one year I got extremely depressed and she and I would always talk bc she offered to talk to me when I was sad. When we FaceTimed though, F always acted like she didn’t care or changed the topic rly quickly to her favorite band or the girl she was obsessing over. 

In the past school year we had a fight (long story) and weren’t as close. During this fight F used the fact that she “helped me” over summer in a way that made me seem like I owned her something which I don’t think I did. F didn’t help me (I wasn’t expecting her to bc she’s not a therapist or anything) or even listen to what I said.  She also got all of her friends involved into it and, because we were in the same friend group, she left me with no friends. Later in the school year we were a bit closer and she said to me “I’m glad I don’t hate you anymore.” Which tbh kinda hurt bc I didn’t know she used to hate me but we’re cool now so it doesn’t matter ig.  

Then my other friend and I got into a fight (we were both mad at other people but took it out on each other but the fight made our friendship stronger and we’re cool now) and my other friend told the group chat with everyone except me in it about the fight. The bully of the friend group kicked me out of the table and I was once again pretty much friendless. 
This time, though, I had my bsf who generously invited me to her table. This new table was heaven. Everyone was super nice and they told each other that they loved them  and everyone was friendly and accepting and super chill. 
After a few days at the new table I was like “why not” and tried to sit at my old table. This prompted the bully to tell me to basically get out because I “made two unforgivable sins.” Yea those were her exact words. 

While at a sleepover I asked to see the convo that went down in the gc. What I found was Someone asking what everyone thought abt me and F replied “cunt bitch whore asshole.”  I was mad at F for a long time and tried to avoid her. 

Toward the very end of the school year when it’s nice out my principal takes the grade out to walk around the building. During these walks S and I were talking and she told me that she tried to unfriend me a few times. Idk why but that was the last straw for me. During the next period I blocked her on all of my Instagram accounts because that’s her only form of contact with me. I didn’t warn her bc she told me that she’s tried to unfriend me numerous times and I thought that it wouldn’t matter, but it makes me wonder AITA for cutting her off cold turkey after 5 years of friendship.

Edit:ok so reading this it sound like the answer is obvious but when I was in that friendship I brushed off all of the red flags. It’s easy for me to ignore all red flags because I always brush it off as something I did (which it true in some cases but not all) to make her angry or unhappy."	Not the A-hole	0	0

As you might be aware, the Cricket World Cup is being held right now in England, and on Sunday India and England play each other. I was lucky enough to have got 4 tickets which i sold on to 3 friends who I’ll be going to the game with. They will be supporting England, and I will be supporting India. 

This is apparently a problem: apparently I should support England as I live there now. And while I certainly feel Englishman am a British citizen, I was born in India (came over when I was six with parents ) and my Indian side is important to me. But frankly that’s not why I support India - I grew up playing the game and my cricketing heroes were Indian legends such as Dravid, Tendulkar and Sehwag. England’s players were decidedly less inspiring. 

Two of my friends who I’m going with think I should support England because I am English (true) and that there could be trouble if two sets of fans sit near each other (false as cricket crowds aren’t segregated like in ~~football~~ soccer. They also said that immigrants should leave their old country behind and cheer on their new country - and I think this may be a valid. Every time India tour England they draw massive crowds from the Indian diaspora so much so it feels like a home game for them.

"So I'm about to meet this wonderful girl on a first date, who was very open about being sick for pretty much the rest of her life. Her lungs used to operate on very low level and she was very lucky to get new ones in a really short period of time, and these work ""better"" - still about as half as much as a healthy one should. I like her very much based on our chatting in the past few days, she is smart, responsible, well aware of her situation and trying everything to make the best she can out of her options, and even beautiful (I'm not bothered by surgery scars at all). Everything would be great, if not for the possibility that her body will reject the new lungs within a year in worst case sceriano, and best case sceriano she won't be able to work more than part time for the rest of her life, and won't be able to have kids. I'm by no means a guy who is going for the money, but I have plans for my future to have our own house with my future wife, and I feel like I already have to give that up if I fall in love with her for the simple fact that I'm not overpaid either (though can't complain) to earn enough. Also I wouldn't be able to adopt a kid she is wants one eventually, nor work myself to death having to feed 3 mouths eventually. To me this seems like a sense of... responsibility towards myself.

So I feel guilty for having all these concerns and possibly eventually using her health as a reason why I'm not diving into a relationship, which is something that is absolutely not her fault. Me being me, from the first minute I tried to look past all that and make her feel like I want to know her, not her condition better, because I like her very much, and I'm genuenely interested in meeting her and possibly falling in love with her. Her ex husband left her because of her condition and I would never have done that, but we are far from the point where we'd have any kind of responsibility or that kind of strong connection towards each other at this point.

I (25f) have a pretty good group of friends from our high-school days. We have all stayed close after high-school and throughout different colleges, and we all see each other fairly regularly.

One of my best friends in this group, I'll call Carrie, moved away around 6 years ago and recently moved back in the last year. She stayed friends with all of us but of course there was some distance that grew over time, especially between Carrie and a few of the other girls. That's just life. People outgrow eachother, and some of the girls in the group were kinda shitty when Carrie had moved anyway. Because of this distance that grew between Carrie and some of the others, that often made me feel like I was in the middle and choosing which people to hang out with. 

A little while ago, Carrie also started seriously dating one of the girls (I'll call her Julie) in our old friend group's exes, Nick. When this happened, Carrie confided in me that she and Nick were in love and dating, I knew Julie was going to be extremely upset. Even though Carrie was not really close to Julie anymore, she told me I could tell Julie if I wanted so that I didn't feel like I was hiding something from Julie.

Okay, so cut to the last two weeks. I recently found out I am pregnant, and my husband and I are over the moon excited. The next day I told Carrie and she was so excited too, and then she told me she had also just found out she was pregnant. I was shocked. She said she wasn't going to tell anyone until the 2nd trimester, but since I was pregnant she wanted me to know too, but she asked me to not tell anyone else.

Well, I went to tell my friend group and Julie about the pregnancy and in the excitement, I accidentally told them about Carrie's pregnancy. I asked them to keep it to themselves but I know they will probably tell people. I called and told Carrie what happened and she was so sad, she cried, and explained she hadn't wanted anyone else to know and now wont text/call me back.

AITA for this? Carrie didn't mind if I told people about her and Nick before, and people are going to know soon enough. I feel like if i hadnt of told the group, they all would have been mad for not telling them when they all found out eventually.

A couple of months ago, an ex, turned friend and I made plans to go on a roadtrip. She ended up cancelling that weekend as she said her father wasn't feeling well. I come to find a couple of weeks ago a picture on social media of her being out with her latest ex's family (the guy after me) on a birthday event that same weekend. That same weekend, her location was turned off (we share our location on iPhone). Seeing that picture, I decided to ask her about that weekend and told her that I saw that picture so I texted her about it, telling her that I saw that picture and asked for an explanation about her being out with him.  Another wrinkle to this is she is closeted, she came out to me.  Since then, it has been 3 weeks and counting since a response. Her bday is coming up too which I want to say happy bday but with this chain of events and seemingly being ghosted, I don't know.

c57wdz	2019-06-25 12:33:48	KingNanoBunny	AITA for using my meal for 2 gift card on me and my mate instead of me and my girlfriend	"For my birthday I got a voucher from work for a meal for two and cinemas. I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to go with me and she said she wanted to hold on to it so that she could go after the baby arrives because the meal offers a bottle of wine and she wanted to get drunk with me.

But we have spent all our money on baby stuff so money is tight and I don't get to go out much. 
When the baby arrives we will need to wait months before we can get a baby sitter.

I decided to just ask my mate (a guy) to use it with me. But now my girlfriend is mad that I messed her around. 

I just don't feel like we would ever get round to using it once the baby comes, we were suppose to use this camping voucher months ago. It was a voucher that she got my for Christmas and she decided to cancel it and get a refund because she said she couldn't do it while she was pregnant. So I didn't even get to use the gift she got me for Christmas. I know it's selfish to think like this but I took her on holiday for Christmas and now she basically got me nothing. 

I don't hate her, I just feel like when she's incharge we just don't get round to it."	Asshole	0	0
c57wag	2019-06-25 12:33:36	Potential_Regular	AITA for wanting my fiancée to retrain into a career when she isn’t sure about what she wants to do	"So I thought I would share this on here to see where I stand on this one. My fiancée and I have been having a few disagreements lately about this issue, we usually say that we will have a think about it then we somehow get back into the topic.

I work as a teacher, spent a lot of my life studying and working hard to get to where I am now, I’ve got a good job and am very happy with it. My partner has no formal qualifications and as such works mainly retail and dead end jobs, all of which she has no real interest in.

As I earn more money, and I have bought my flat before our relationship, I suggested the idea of her going back to school and retraining in a field that she would like to work in. I even printed off some apprenticeship listings for her to look through and see what she wants to do. I’ve tried talking to her about it but she doesn’t seem interested at all.

My partner earns good money but works a lot of hours so is tired a lot. I’ve said to her several times that she can train for 1/2 years and then go for a job in something she actually wants to do, earn more money and work less etc. The problem is that she is terrified of going back into school as she believes she is too stupid and has no self confidence in her ability.

We’ve argued over it, a few times, because she says that I’m pushing her and she doesn’t know what she wants. She doesn’t seem happy with it but I’m trying to show I’m supportive to her and help her out. I have a horrible feeling that I’m being the asshole here even though all I’m trying to achieve is to support her to gain her qualifications and work in something that’s not so dead end.

TL;DR Fiancée doesn’t want to go back to school, I keep on about it, we argue, nothing happens, AITA for keeping on about it"	Asshole	0	0
c57vlw	2019-06-25 12:32:02		aita for not visiting my grandmother	"so i️ live with my (f19) grandmother (f68) and have my whole life. while she was not always my primary care giver (my parents used to live there too), we have always lived together and hung out, and she is my financial support, but have never been super close due to differing values / ideals 

every summer since i️ was a kid my grandmother has gone to a lake cottage she got from her mother. it’s pretty run down, and in the middle of no where, with spotty reception. 

i️ have never enjoyed going down there, and during the summer would stay home with my dad, while my brothers would occasionally go up for long stretches, my dad died two years ago, and she didn’t go down much last summer bc of this. 

but this summer, she has moved down there full time, and has been continually bothering me to visit. the place is an hour and a half away, doesn’t have reliable wifi, and i️ normally work 6-7 days a week. as well, i’m not a good swimmer, and last year my brother almost drowned me, our dogs scratched me multiple times and my cousin called me a bitch. 

i️ hate going down there, period. but my grandmother does a lot for me and loves it down there. she says it’s the only place she’s truly happy. we barely see each other bc i’m in college a state away most of the year, and she really misses me. she keeps buying all these things to do in hopes of enticing me to come down, and encouraging me to bring my friends. 

however, she’s the one who chose to move knowing i’m home during the summer and don’t like it down there, and i️ wouldn’t have nearly as many work opportunities or ability to see my friends if i️ moved down there, and i️ can’t go down when i️ work, as i’d just have to go to sleep by the time i️ got there, and wake up before them to get back the next day

i️ plan on going down for a couple of days over the fourth of july to see her, but my grandfather says it’s not enough. am i️ the asshole? 

tl;dr: live with my grandmother, she moved when i️ came home from college for the summer, wants me to visit, i️ don’t want to."	Asshole	1	0
c57v01	2019-06-25 12:30:40		AITA for potentially letting a kitten die?	"I was driving to work this morning on an 8 lane surface street. It's a big road with a large grass greenway through the middle that often has turn arounds in it. I was in the second lane from the left and there was a medium amount of traffic at the time. The speed limit is 40 MPH.

I saw something ahead in the road and thought it was a dead squirrel. I then saw the tail flailing and the legs moving. It was a tiny kitten. It looked like it had been hit on one or two legs and was struggling. 

I immediately thought ""Oh, no. Poor thing."" and didn't think to go back until about 3 seconds after realizing what it was. At that point I then realized I couldn't get over to turn around for a bit. I figured that someone else would stop, but I looked back and no one else was stopping.

c57uuh	2019-06-25 12:30:17	Maldo1726	AITA For being upset at my sister and ridiculing her admiration towards a pop star?	"For added context,  I am 17 and my sister is 15. We are both really close.

I think I have done anything I could to make sure I stay a good brother.  I even spent months making a photo album for her birthday and drawing highly realistic photos of her friends or just anything she wanted me to draw.
   Now, I honestly know next to nothing about ariana grande but my sister runs her fanpage and has been a pretty huge fan of hers for the past year or so. I am sure ariana grande is a wonderful, kind and amazing role model and wish her the best, but her birthday falls on the same day as mine(tomorrow)  and I am pretty upset by the fact that my sister seems to be completely ignoring me.
   We moved into a new neighborhood last month and I don't have any friends since I just finished school. Parents don't have a solid relationship with us either and they have never really cared about me or given me any gifts or anything. So I guess I placed an unusual amount of burden on my sister by expecting her to spend time with me on my birthday. 
But she is moving to her friend's place for the day and they are going to listen to ariana grande all day or something,  and are even cutting a cake for her.
I took a month to make a life like photo of ariana grande for my sister's fanpage and expected that to be the end of it.
But all this noise about tomorrow being her day and my sister telling me that I should feel blessed about having the same birthday as her made me snap.
I called her selfish and obsessive. She left crying. 

I am really depressed right now and plan on apologising. At honest opinion would help."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c57tgz	2019-06-25 12:26:56	SilverDirt	AITA for stealing a ring from my neice?	"TLDR mum died, my 5 yr old niece (not related to mum) got her ring (not by any will), I stole the ring from my niece.

---

My neice has been in my life about a year and a half, shes 5. (i only met my sister 1.5 years ago we have different mums, our dad picked my mum. Worked out great for him /s (hes in neither of our lives now)) and in meeting me, my sister and my neices met my mum. About 5 months ago now, mum died. 

Basically, my neice spotted a ring of mums and decided she wanted it, (this was 4 months after mum died) and after asking if i could have it instead (had not been given an opportunity to search mums jewellery before this point) and getting told no, i thought she would forget the ring and i could just grab it from wherever she left it.

Neice did not forget the ring.

Its been about a month, im babysitting and neice found the ring, started throwing it around. (I dont expect her to understand the emotional value, shes too young and didnt know mum (nana J to her) long enough to have much)

When she put it down and kind of forgot about it, i nicked it. Shes gone to bed now, hasnt noticed its gone.

(The ring is one mum found in an op shop that inspired her to get the engagement ring she bought with my stepdad, which i have. It shouldnt mean as much, but i feel like its seeing the ring in the position of my neice who doesnt value it for what it is, is whats making me want it as much as i do and not just the emotional connection)

AITA for taking it? Should i suck it up and put it back? I feel bad stealing from my neice, but... I dont know. I dont know if im justified or not. Help?

Edit: was told this is information i should have added so theres this too:

i let my neice look at my mums jewellery with me and told her she could pick a couple things that she likes, she came across that ring before i did and when i asked her if she would trade it for a less emotionally valuable necklace she refused and i couldnt bear to push the issue further at the time. I have since brought it up but shes adamant its hers, and im not going to argue with her about it because emotions and i dont want to accidentally manipulate her by crying.

Edit again: she has forgotten where she got the ring, she thinks its her dads."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c57r4g	2019-06-25 12:21:19	TheBreakUp2013	AITA for Laughing at a Baby CPR Class	"Short but sweet. My spouse and I were expecting and attended a Baby CPR class held at the local hospital for expecting parents.  The instructor began by showing how to locate the proper position to perform CPR compressions.  We were instructed to find the armpit and then measure from the armpit to the middle of the chest. That is the location to perform CPR compressions. Simple enough, right?

Wrong. A person in class immediately raised her hand and asked, ""Sooooooo....do we need to measure from both armpits to the middle, or can we just measure from one?"" This once again proves the old adage that there are no stupid questions, only stupid people who ask questions. The instructor looked at her dumbfounded and I, unable to help myself, let out a single audible chuckle. Nobody else laughed, and I received a few disapproving glares.

c57pdw	2019-06-25 12:17:10		WIBTA if I sent my ex a text over a Snapchat that bothered me?	"My ex and I broke up a few months ago. Shortly after we broke up, she left a Snapchat group that included both, us, and a select group of our close friends. She was upset, and I don't blame her for leaving. A few weeks after I asked if she was going to come back to the group because these are both of our friends in the group, and I just wanted to let her know that she wasn't 'uninvited' or anything silly like that. She said not anytime soon because it just wouldn't feel right to have things go back to 'normal' that soon. I agreed, and told her to take her time and do what she needed to do.

I would like to make note, that it this point in time, we were trying to work things out, and were on *ok* terms. In the present, we are not. She doesn’t want to talk to me anymore, so I left her alone.

This past weekend her friend (we'll call her B) added her back to the group. I was very happy that she was back in the group. Within a few hours my ex sent a Snapchat of her, B, and some other girlfriends dancing at some random bar. Awesome! I was very happy she was enjoying herself.

Another hour or so went by and a Snapchat from B was sent to the group. Ok, cool. I opened it up expecting something similar to the other one. The video that was sent to the group (they were sitting down at a table at his point) was of B filming herself, then pointing the camera at my ex and proceeding to zoom in on my ex's cleavage. My ex then shook her boobs at the zoomed in camera, then the Snapchat ended. I was mortified... Some of my very close guy friends are in this group, so just from that: I'm not sure what to think.

Now, this kind of thing wouldn't bother me under normal circumstances. The thing is is that B sends Snapchats like this to the group on a semi-consistent basis (For example: a Snapchat of B and another girl only wearing their bras and drinking wine). No one really bats an eye, or responds in any way. My ex, while we were dating, made the point to me that she didn't like that ""B was sending these kinds of snaps"" to the group. I agree with her completely. It's awkward to receive those kinds of Snapchats from a girl who I'm not in a relationship with, and in a group setting.

I don't believe my ex is doing this in spite of me. I really want to believe she was just drinking and just having a good time, and B was a bad influence at that particular point in time. Hell, she may not have known what was exactly filmed until she viewed it later. Irdk the whole story here. What I do know is that it really bothers me.

Would I be the asshole for texting her and just simply saying ""hey, glad you're back in the group, but can you please not send Snapchats like that anymore?"", or should I just leave it alone?

Feel free to ask any questions because I know some of this may seem a bit vague, or details left out."		1	0

" My granddaughter was badly burned by an unexploded softball sized blob of molten gunk that landed on her back during a fireworks show put on by a boat club I belonged to. Insurance took care of the medical bills but not the mileage or overnight stays because the clinic was 4 hours away and her appointments were always at 8 AM on Monday mornings. I racked up thousands of dollars in bills over the 1 1/2 year she had to be treated. She still has a round raised scar almost 4"" across on one shoulder blade. I asked to be reimbursed, I am not as wealthy as many of the members, and they said no. The board said it was an accident and couldn't be helped. The president of the board is the one putting on the show. He purchased over $3,000 worth of fireworks directly from a manufacturer in Tennessee. I found out too late that there should have been a perimeter around this size fireworks of 2 football fields. We were all seated less than 1/2 a football field. I was very angry and wrote a hateful letter to the board. My family and I dropped out of the club I had belonged to for over 35 years. Am I being petty?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c57ohz	2019-06-25 12:15:19	MHWN0119	AITA for wanting our mix race child to have a name from my culture?	"So I just got into a huge fight with my husband over the name of our future kid. I do admit that I might have said it in a demanding voice when I told him the names I would like for our kid plus future kids but my attitude didn't come out until he flat out said no. 

We live in his country so he wants our kids to have normal names for this country. He thinks that if our kids have foreign sounding names that they will get teased in school. He said that I don't understand since I didn't go to school here and thinks that it's not fair to inflict ""random"" names on them. (The names are not random by the way. They are totally normal western sounding names. They even fit the phonetics of this country. I put a lot of thought into them. He's just annoyed that they are not the same plain names that everyone has here. Literally every one has the same names.) 

I argued that maybe kids will tease them a bit about their western name but unless our kids are complete losers I'm sure their friends will move on and life will continue. I think he's over reacting. I think that having a different name might be weird for some people when they first meet but I really don't think it will be life ending. But he says that since they will live here that they need names tylical to the country.

But the way that I see it is that our kids will already have his last name. Why can't they have just a little part of me in their names?? 

No matter what he says our kids will never be considered by the people here as 100% like them. People will always treat them like outsiders. So I don't want my kids to grow up feeling ashamed of half of their culture. I want them to take pride in my half of their culture and not want to hide it from people. I feel that if they have the names that I want they can learn to embrace being different and take pride in who they are."	No A-holes here	0	0

Fast forward to yesterday I decided to block her from everything I had her added on due to some mental issues that cause me to lash out sometimes. I didn’t want to lash out at her or do something stupid and ruin any chance we even had of friendship.

c57mu6	2019-06-25 12:11:17	Girl_Not_Named_Sue	AITA if I want nothing to do with my formerly estranged grandma?	"Hi all, I've posted here before and found it very helpful. So I thought I would throw another dilemma at the thread to see if I'm really being a dick.

My parents and I (27F) have been estranged from my grandma on my mom's side for almost 15 years. There is a loooong story and many reasons for this, however basically it can be summed up by saying that my mom was her mother's scapegoat, and my grandma was abusive to her and heavily favored her ""golden child"", my aunt. There was a ton of family drama, and before we went no contact my grandma spent months sending letters saying what terrible people we were, how she wished my mom was never born, how we could go to hell, on and on. Keep in mind I was very young when this all went down, however some of these awful letters were still addressed to me. 

Fast forward to now, the golden child/alcoholic/drug addict aunt has passed away and my grandma has no one else. She's 84 years old, and while she's in good health she is obviously slowing down. My mom had a change of heart and has slowly re-established contact and has built their relationship up again. She says my grandma has changed and would like me to reach out to her.

Now this is awkward for me on many levels. I'm glad that my mom is happy, and is building up a relationship that she desperately wanted all her life, but I don't really want anything to do with my grandma. I don't know her at all at this point, and she doesn't know me. She missed major milestones in my life due to her choices and I feel like I mourned the loss of her years ago. I have my grandma on my dad's side and a grandma-in-law who are both active parts of my life and who I adore. I am definitely not lacking on the grandma front, and I'm happy with what I have. 

My mom has been pushing me more and more to reach out, because me not doing so ""makes her uncomfortable"". But I feel like grandma made her bed, and I'm allowed to not want that toxicity in my life, even though she is now an elderly woman.

I make more money than my fiancee and my parents are also in a position to help me out a little bit if I needed it. My fiancee's 13 year old daughter has a disease that will likely require her to be hospitalized and undergo a few surgeries later in her teenage years. Would I be the asshole if I said I do not want to pay for her medical bills? Sure I make ok money, but that is money I saved for retirement, to one day buy a home, for my future kid's college tuition etc. On the one hand I do not want to deplete my hard earned savings just because I fell in love with someone who has a sick daughter. She is not my kid and I am **not at all** expected to be a parent - she already has two loving and engaged parents even though they are divorced. On the other hand, I am afraid my fiancee and his family will resent me if I do not step up and help. What do you guys think?		1	0

c57j3f	2019-06-25 12:02:23		AITA for just ignoring my ex-girlfriend	"So I (25M) have an ongoing issue with my ex (22F) and it’s basically caused me so much stress over the last two-three years and I just want impartial opinions. Apologies for how long this is but I want you guys to be informed.

Me and her have known each other for a number of years now as we were friends before we got together. She had a reputation for doing people over, but she played it off like she was always the victim and people just didn’t like her so made things up. 

Fast forward to when we get together, it’s really nice, but several things bother me. She was massively private, didn’t tell many people about me, didn’t want me meet her friends, when we saw each other in public separately she’s pretend I didn’t exist and so on. She’s also said quite harsh things to me regarding just me being me and wouldn’t support me emotionally (For example when it was a possibility my mum may of been dying and I got upset, her response was men don’t cry).

We break up a year into the relationship, it kills me at the time. I find out she’s been talking to her ex, we get over it and start dating again. Everything is going really well and the was was possibly the worst two weeks of my life takes place. My friend dies in a car crash, I’m devastated and obviously just need her by my side which is understandable. I text her explaining what’s happened and I get a “oh know that’s really bad”, I then do not hear from her for 24 hours. I push her to explain why she’s ignore me after something like that and she admits she’s been seeing my ex behind my back and they’ve decided to make a go of it. 

All the while she tries again with my ex she will not leave me alone. Messages, calls, and even showing up and asking to meet with me. She then tried to initiate stuff in her car which I refused to do. She ends up breaking up with him, “for me” but then ditches me two weeks later. This was in September of last year. We were in constant contact until two months ago when ghosted me after an argument. Since then I have been on a couple of dates with someone else. 

This brings us to the present where as of last week, she messaged me out of the blue asking to catch up and stuff which I find really odd and when I don’t reply she sends another message the next day. At this point I think she wants something or along those lines. I do not respond because I don’t know what to say. I have no found out that she in fact has a boyfriend which she has kept secret from everyone. So if she has a boyfriend why is she messaging me out of nowhere asking for a catch up?

My friend told her current boyfriend (as they know each-other) who was really chill, and said he’s going to confront her about it. The advice I am looking for is, what do I actually do next?

I haven’t responded to her but I’m at a loss of what my next step is and not only that if I’m being the asshole."		1	0

Unfortunately it was apparent that she wasn't as qualified as she said she was and was struggling to do the most basic of tasks - I offered as much help as I could as team leader - but I ended up doing it myself (which defeated the whole point of hiring someone to help in the first place)

Her not doing things on time and passing on responsibility started to add to my workload - which I admit has caused me to be bitter towards her.  

On a number of occasions I've brought this up with upper management but due to their inaction this is now causing me quite a bit of stress at work and quite honestly I want her gone.

Today she decided that she wanted to take tomorrow off 
(Whenever a temp takes time off it needs to be authorized by either myself or one of the other team managers beforehand and write on a white board we have for our team)

She didn't discuss this with myself and has only decided to write it on the board with no prior approval from anyone.
This is a dismissible offence now I'm not going to go out of my way to speak to her as quite honestly I don't think I have to.

Does this make me TA?

We met on Tinder and everything clicked really well. We would stay up late at night to text each other regardless of how early we had to get up for work, talking about everything there is about each other. Eventually we got together and it’s been amazing.
Fast forward to now. We moved across the country and are living together. She got a part time job at a local grocery store while she’s finishing up her degree and she met this guy working at a Starbucks inside the store. I have friends in the area but she really doesn’t. I encourage her to make friends and get out because I think it’s important to have those types of relationships, everyone needs friends they can hang out with and not just their significant other. It was a male, but it didn’t really bother me until last night. We were cuddling falling asleep and I had to get up at 4 for work and she had to get up at 6. I woke up at 11:05pm and she had rolled back to the other side of the bed and was texting him. I asked what she was doing and she told me they were talking, didn’t lie. I asked what about and she said he was asking what her sign was and what her birthstone is.
I got a little upset because it reminded me of what we used to do when we started dating. It didn’t matter that she had to get up early for work and only started to text him after I went to sleep. She asked if it bothered me and I said “Yes, a little. Just because it’s right now” I told her she didn’t have to stop talking to him altogether, I just explained that it made me a little uncomfortable that she waited til I went to bed to start texting this guy.

Is that wrong? I don’t want to feel like I’m trying to control who she can and can’t see/talk to. But at the same time I can’t help but feel upset at the situation. Am I being paranoid? Controlling? I’d like some insight <3

Update: I voiced my concerns to her. Gave her the situation from my point of view and concluded that she doesn’t have to stop talking to him, but these are my feelings on the subject that I’m trying to sort through. She insists that he has no interest in her and that he has a girlfriend. She told me that she told him they can be friends at work but that’s about it. She concluded that she shouldn’t have responded so late to him and that she doesn’t want me to feel this way and that she’s sorry. I appreciate her honesty, as far as I can tell, and she’s never given me a reason not to trust her. I do however think she’s a little naive about him having interest in her. Him also having a girlfriend doesn’t really negate the possibility of something going on. Not saying that there is, I just disagree with that defense."	No A-holes here	0	0

I generously bought both hers and mine and the pass costed about $120. Before we either even got a chance to go more than for like a hour once she cut me off and now decided she hates me. That whole thing is a long story but her only excuses to stop being friends with me was because i would complain to her alot and because I'm ugly.

So I'm decently good friends with her boyfriend right now who plans to break up with her. Today we were talking about it and I mentioned the pass and he thought it was a good idea. I thinking of asking him to actually do it. So would I be the asshole?
[edit] Sorry I'm writing this super early and there's a lot I forgot to address. One, she's very violent with me and if i were to approach her she'd probably beat me up before doing any proper talking like adults. If I were to actually do this I wouldn't exactly expect to necessarily get the money back but mostly just to make a point to her. I was also considering seeing if the park saved pictures and paying $15 for a replacement for somebody else but if they save pictures I'd get into some issues."	Asshole	0	0
c57ega	2019-06-25 11:50:52	TheRealGordonRamsey_	AITA for being active at night	"So me and my girlfriend live in a basement apartment in a 2 story house in a nice neighborhood. We pay 1200 a month for a 2 bedroom half bath. 1200 is definitely a lot for where we live. That amount could get you a 3 bedroom luxury apartment but we wanted something nice and we don’t have the best credit since were young and this place didn’t require an application or credit check or anything. Just hella expensive for a maybe 35 by 20 foot basement apartment. 

On the top floor the landlords are a mid 30s couple with two toddlers and a baby. More the religious conservative type and we are more of the social stay up late drinking college age type. With that being said we’ve been very aware and respectful of the fact that we are still living with a family. Basically the problem here is that the insulation for the basement is extremely thin and you can hear any amount of noise unless we literally whisper. We work night shift so when we get home and are just drinking having a normal inside voice conversation they can hear it.... and they’ve asked us multiple times to be quieter but we can’t be more quiet unless we literally stay whispering. They always say they have kids and don’t get much sleep and everything which I understand but we work hard and pay this much in rent and everything I think we should be able to have a normal conversation at night.

With that being said they have not been perfect either. Their bedroom and the baby’s bedroom is right above our apartment. The baby wakes up at 3 in the morning like clockwork and has woken up us multiple times but we never complained just bc it never bothered me and I didn’t want to complain bc I’m nice and understanding. And running around and jumping and stomping right above us at 8-11 in the morning most mornings which has also woken us up. We have literally one month left but they’re trying to evict us a half month before the lease ends. I know this sounds more like legal advice but I’m jw even tho we signed a lease knowing we would be staying with a family. We are their first renters so theyve never had ppl stay in their basement before and didn’t know what to really expect themselves. who is the a hole guys."	No A-holes here	0	0

"So we are both still very young (22/23) and still live at home with our parents. At his house, my SO has a very close relationship with his mother where they do everything together and talk about everything. At my house things are different and have been quite rough for a while, a couple years ago my mother has passed away, I had a big fight with my very rude sister who now lives on her own and my dad has a new girlfriend that of course also brings tension. On top of that last January (half a year ago) me and my SO had a big fight with my father and his girlfriend about who is at my house during the weekend. After a long while I managed to make up the fight with my father and his girlfriend and things have been quite good but then my SO just refused to make up with them saying he has had enough with my ""troublesome"" home and why should he when he has everything good and perfect with his own mother who misses him a lot when he is at my house. After a lot of talks, fights and begging he finally came to my house to make it up where during the conversation my father explained that he thinks that once you have a job and make a living on your own that you should make steps towards living on your own and doing everything yourself and become an adult. My SO felt very insulted by this because in his house his mother is always there for him and he can stay there for his whole life if he would like to and felt insulted that because of that he is not an adult. Now he has decided that he had enough and that he never ever want to come to my house anymore and talk to my father anymore and because of that we also actually broke up. But I keep wondering whether I am the asshole for wanting that he puts his ego aside and the fact that his house is different than mine and deal with that and do his best to have a relationship with my father which is still possible, it's not like my father hates him, he just has another opion."

My sister has been engaged about 5 times, two kids by 2 different guys, she’s been married once and she actually just got divorced, so needless to say she moves EXTREMELY fast with big decisions in her life. She’s now engaged to be married again to this guy that she’s been dating for about months. They are getting married in August, and my girlfriend and I already had plans for an important wedding she for sure cannot miss. This entire situation makes me so uncomfortable because he has two kids and I don’t even know their names- shoot, I didn’t even know HIS name until a few weeks ago. She has a habit of this “life is short” mentality that gets her into some bad situations. Our family knows nothing about this guy. Part of me feels like I should be there no matter what to support my sister regardless of whether or not it’s a good or bad decision, but part of me feels horrible for bailing on this important wedding that was planned a year ago. As of right now, I’m going to this last minute wedding alone and my girlfriend is going to her wedding alone.

"My mom was quite well to do so she bought a lot of insurance plans for me and saved up a lot of money for me. I think about 10 my mom left my dad and went to stay with my aunt because of their failing marriage. Ever since then, my dad would only visit me about a month and my mom would complain about how my dad wasn’t paying money or being a more involved parent. (they aren’t officially divorced or separated so there isn’t any child support to be paid) 

Yea well about 12 my mom died of cancer and my aunt has been taking care of me ever since. i honestly had the worst relationship with my father ever since then and i barely saw him for months even. my aunt was a single mom who had her own son to take care of and she was paying for everything. my dad would give about 4k like every 2-3 months. whatever insurance my mom had for me, as it couldn’t be paid up before she died my aunt even cancelled her own insurance so she could pay for mine and my dad rarely paid. during all this time my dad was in a good financial position (idk his job was okay) and honestly at that age your dad buying u phones and games and clothes were the best thing and i never realised he didn’t actually provide for me (this is the later part where my relationship with my dad improved). 

now i’m 18 and my aunt can’t really support me anymore so i had to move back with my dad. our relationship is fine and i’ve been working before i get into university (1.5k in 3 months). i don’t intend to use any of this money and it’s just my savings in case something happens because i don’t think my dad saves money. my dad lost his job and is driving grab and we also rent 2 rooms in our house (he’s fucking renting it below market price because they are his friends but i can’t even be bothered to discuss with him about it) is it unfair for me to expect my father to provide for me through university like pocket money etc and also renovate my room? i’m gonna use my mother’s saving to pay for my university fees. i want to ask him for about 850 to minimal 600 per month. and since i’ve moved back into the house i want to buy new furniture for myself because all the furniture in my room is the same furniture i left when i was 10. i fully expect him to purchase the bigger items like bed and table but smaller things like laundry baskets, clothes hanger i’ll buy myself. i know that this will definitely make money abit more tight for him but honestly i could give less of a fuck because he’s just been so absent from my life majority of the time and it’s now time to pay up, especially if he wants to be in my life. i just don’t think it’s fair for him to be claiming to be my father but only contributing to my life about 15% while my aunt was doing all 85% and literally using her own savings to pay for me."

c56kci	2019-06-25 10:41:03	giving_up_seat	AITA for only selectively giving up my seat to elders on public transport?	"Hi, this is a mental dilemma of mine. Might get slammed for the opinion, so I'm using a different account.

I'm far from an impolite person. With that said, I won't deal with verbal abuse from strangers who are clearly just looking to take out frustrations. In an everyday setting, this applies to angry people on public transport.

I'm a physically healthy 19Y/O girl, meaning I can give up my seat to those in need. Unless I'm literally losing consciousness or something, but that hasn't happened yet. But I refuse to get up for anyone, regardless of their age or state (unless heavily pregnant or severly disabled) if they're quite obviously acting shitty because they believe it's within their rights to do so.

I've encountered these situations on multiple occasions, most recently last week. I was riding on a bus home from class, staring out of the window because the line was packed and you want to avoid making any awkward eye contacts. When I turned my head, that was when I first noticed an older guy standing next to me.

I apologized for not seeing him and offered my seat. But that set him off on a loud tirade about how he'd been standing there for over 5 minutes and that I should've moved instinctively because of his cane. Despite the fact that I didn't even see this person, let alone his cane. Everyone was staring at us. His goal was obviously to humiliate me and come off as superior, because if he just wanted to sit down, he would've gotten my attention earlier and asked. Or literally any other seated person.

So I told him no, I'm not giving my seat up for anyone who acts like a child and insults me. After that he called me a disrespectful brat, which just made me more convinced in my decision. He left to another part of the bus and I could hear him swearing under his breath.

In your opinion, was I the asshole for refusing to give up my seat to this man? Personally, I don't believe his age and the walking aid give him an excuse to lash out at strangers. But I could be looking at the situation in the wrong way.

I'm interested in your judgment, Reddit."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c56iz9	2019-06-25 10:37:20	matshrooms	AITA for uninviting a fried from a trip 2 weeks before we leave?	"Hey guys!

In early 2019 I met this guy and became really good friends with his sister (Becky)

&#x200B;

Her older brother and I stopped sleeping together after my 19th birthday in May and we have had extremely limited contact since but I maintained my friendship with his sister. He moved onto another girl (Booty) .

&#x200B;

After learning I was going to Venice she hinted that she wanted to come with me so I invited her. We would be staying in a top tourist spot free of charge as it's my own property and as my family own a restaurant we could eat there free of charge as well so the trip was very cost efficient.

&#x200B;

Last night I got a message from Becky like ""yo can we talk"" I said sure, and she began bombarding me with messages about how I was harassing and bullying Booty, and how I threatened to ruin Booty's reputation by badmouthing her to Becky, FWB and their family. (I was like, reputation?? really?? we're not in High School)

&#x200B;

Becky kept calling me a liar, a bullshitter, and a psycho, I had a panic attack because it reminded me of some things in my past so I muted her chat and tried to calm down.

&#x200B;

When I calmed down I saw a myriad of messages claiming I was immature and a bad person for allegedly bullying this girl. Some of the messages claimed she wanted to resolve the issue because of the trip to Italy, to me it felt like I was just a cheap trip to a top tourist destination with accommodation and food free of charge.

&#x200B;

I decided to unplug from the internet and sleep it off.

Another friend messaged me this morning distraught, worried about me, but later confessed to Becky lying about seeing ""proof"" I bullied the girl and it was Becky just believing a rumor. Becky also said she was worried about going on holiday and me finding a random guy to have a one night stand with and leaving her there. This really hurt me to hear because I haven't had a one night stand in a good year and TMI but I haven't even had sex in a month!

&#x200B;

I felt extremely disrespected and sent Becky message saying I was disgusted by her behavior, she was no longer welcome into my home, she can find accommodation and pay for her own experience.

&#x200B;

The other friend messaged me saying I should have just taken the blame and lied, basically saying I bullied the other girl, just to save the friendship.

&#x200B;

Venice in mid July is extremely expensive and with two weeks notice she may not have a place to stay, or if she does it'll be expensive.

c56iqv	2019-06-25 10:36:46	bluebullbruce	AITA for wanting to immigrate and leaving my son from a previous relationship behind at his request?	"Background and context: I'm South African and things have been going downhill slowly but surely in the country for the last 20 or so years. It's reached a point where we have no option, but to emigrate to Aus for both safety as well as career reasons. I don't have many prospects here with the skill set I have, but will have more career options if we go to Aus.

The concern is that I have a son (11) from a previous relationship and he has made it clear that he is not willing to move with us (myself, my wife and his brother who is 3) as he wants to stay with his Mom. I get that as I wouldn't have left my Mom at that age either. We have wanted to leave the country for a long time but I had put it off because of my son and because he was so young I didn't want to leave him behind at such a young age. But we can't put it off any longer because I am reaching the point where my age could become a roadblock.

Moving to Aus will afford me an opportunity to earn more money and provide a better future for my family. Once my son is older and a little more independent he would be welcome to come over and stay with us no questions asked. He is 11 now and understands that I am not abandoning him, (we have discussed this at length) but of course there were tears and him saying that he will miss us and his little bro, and I can't help but feel like a piece of shit for leaving him. I love him and we have a good relationship as he sees us once a week and stays over with us as well as staying with us every other weekend. I pay for his school, medical care and I pay his mother a monthly allowance and I will continue to do so. We will obviously come over to visit as soon as we can afford it and our new jobs allow us time off of course and he will also come over to Aus to visit us so we will be seeing him.

I have spoken to my own parents and other family members and friends and they all agree that it's the best move, albeit hard because of the situation with my oldest, but I can't help but feel super guilty about all of this.

When my dad was three(ish?) and my aunt was a baby, their dad took off. They have never known him. My grandmother recently passed away and in all the time I knew her she never told me one thing about him.

i was recently talking to my dad about my curiosity about this man. He told me that my stepmom had found him online a few years back and that he is gay.

He is a stubborn guy and says that it won't change his life at all and that ”ive made it this far so what's the point?” 

i asked my dad if it would bother him if I reached out, he told me to go for it. I'm not exactly sure what it is I am looking for.

Tl;dr: I hired my friend to watch my dog for 12 days. He got tired of it after 6 days. I had to spend my long awaited vacation looking for a dogsitter and stressing the f- out. I reacted harshly, but question is, was it too harsh or justified?

So, little backstory. My fiance and I had a rough year. I lost my dear grandmother in February, and both of our jobs demand a lot of responsibility and hard work. We booked a vacation to Spain earlier this year, and we were planning on spending 12 relaxing days there.

We hired our friend as a dogsitter (DS) for our dog. DS’s always wanted a dog, but wants to experience day-to-day life with a dog before taking on such a big responsibility, and we were happy to let him watch our pet. We made written agreement on DS’s pay, with very detailed instructions on how to take care of him. We promised to repay any damages he makes, as he is extremely energetic. We gave DS enough dog food to last the 12 days with some extra as well.

After 6 amazing days with my fiance, DS sent me a message saying he’s getting tired of watching the dog. DS says he’s too energetic, and has chewed on a pillow. We reminded to play with him enough, which is also mentioned in the care instructions. I also reminded DS that I’ll pay for the pillow and for any future damages. Unfortunately, DS didn’t relent, and requested I find a new dogsitter. Nobody else was available, and I reminded him that we made an agreement, on paper, and reminded everything will be paid for. The following days  DS spent asking me to come home earlier.

I avoid confrontation, so I should’ve said something earlier, I know. But unfortunately, DS’s messages made me stress. A lot. My jaw hurts from grinding my teeth together at night, not that I’ve actually been sleeping much. My blood pressure is through the roof. I’m more stressed and angry than I was before the vacation.

As I was picking up the dog, he kept complaining about how hard it had been for him. I said to him: ”I already had hired a dogsitter. You. I’m furious that I had to spend my vacation being stressed about the responsibility I had given you. I did everything I could to help you.” I should’ve probably stopped, but I kept going on about the stress and anger he caused me. This is where I think I went too far if I did.

I know my reaction was fueled by stress, but was I too harsh? He and some of our common friends say I was out of line. I’m still angry, so I just need closure here. 

So, reddit: Am I the asshole for snapping at my friend?

i don’t have any romantic feelings for her (anymore) because i recently found out that she has been in a relationship for 4 years. I respect her relationship and don’t want to cause any problems in their relationship. 

To my knowledge, my school is going to hold a prom this year, and I’ve always wanted to go to one. i’ve been to dances as a stag before and let’s just say it wasnt a good experience being alone at an event like that. My plan is to just ask her if she wants to go with me to the prom as friends, because of the scenario i had explained earlier. Would i be the asshole if i did so?

edit: the guy she is seeing is in another area so he can’t go to this specific prom with her."	Asshole	0	0

c55owy	2019-06-25 09:20:56	Chemenky	AITA for getting annoyed at my neighbour about parking	"Parking man...I don't know how parking works in other parts of the world, but I live in the UK.

Me and my other half bought our first house recently (yay!)
It's all going great and most of our neighbours are lovely, sweet people that have been nothing but kind to us.

So, the first incident happened on our moving day. We were moving all our stuff in to our new house, we rented a van and all. Helping was: myself and my other half, her parents, my Dad and a family friend. My Mum was late due to work and this will come in to play later.

I spoke to a few of our neighbours during the day and a lot of people say us lugging sofas in to the house, it was pretty clear we were moving. After we had finished lugging all our stuff in, my Mum arrived and parked down the road. I would like to say now that it is a public street, no private or permit parking at all.

She was parked for probably about 45 minutes before we headed to get some lunch, and when we got to my Mum's car she had a note on it.
It said: ""There is enough room to park one car outside one house, You parked outside two! Well done. And you weren't even visiting me!""
That was it, no house number, no name, nothing. We brushed it off, and went to enjoy a nice family lunch together.

A couple weeks later, my Grandparents came to see the house, my Grandad has little mobility to he parked on the street where he can. I have no control over where they park, and its a public street so who cares. Had a lovely time all well and good and I walked my Grandad to the car to make sure he didn't fall over.

Later that evening I had a card through the letter box, I figured it was a family friend sending a happy new home card, but I was mistaken. 

It read (it's long sorry..): ""Dear new neighbours, welcome to the street. I don't think you realise the limited parking on this side of the road. Your visitors certainly don't! Now you might think I am being a dick, but I want to explain my 4 year old son died in my house in october and now my anxiety is through the roof! I would like to park outside my house and not around the corner over the street or outside yours! Please be more considerate, some people need space to deal with how shit life is. Thanks.""

Again, no house number, no name nothing...I had a feeling who it was though.

A few days later I went outside and saw the man I thought it was, and had a very nice conversation with him - he did not mention anything. So now either my thoughts on who it was were wrong, or hes two faced.

I spoke to my neighbours, didn't mention anything to them about the notes because I don't want to start drama, and he told me that the man I spoke to earlier that day had lost is son in their house and it was all very sad. so it was that dude, or his wife? no idea.

now  feel on edge whenever I park, or when I have guest because I don't want drama. I now park on the other side of the road and walk, it's no skin off my teeth, but I am not about to tell my guest where they can and can't park, its not my responsibility.

c55mei	2019-06-25 09:14:33		AITA for reporting my “best friend” at work for being a terrible worker?	"So background, there’s a girl I work with that I’m “best friends” with. We’ve become super close in and out of work. The more I get to know her, the more I realize she can be a really terrible person. I’ve been struggling with the friendship because I genuinely enjoy her company, but morally I feel wrong being friends with her. I’ve been trying to distance myself from her but it’s really hard when we work side by side so much.

We work at a facility that makes medical supplies. She has lied in the past on fmla to get time off she shouldn’t have, last weekend she made up results on her testing because she didn’t feel like actually doing it (five
minutes of work when she already did literally nothing all day, plus this is a felony technically), she takes excessively long breaks when she can get away with it, if she has training to do (say something that takes 20 minutes) she’ll disappear for an hour and a half, she doesn’t put in her share of work, never does her share of overtime but takes advantage of any benefit she can, etc. 

She decided to get butt implants a few months ago so she was out of work for 4 weeks after taking a week of vacation before that. She comes back from work and sees that her FMLA was denied because it was an elective surgery. Our supervisor, whom I assume doesn’t know what the surgery was for due to legal reasons, worked it out that she kept her paid time off, had to take no vacation, and only got one attendance point.  She should’ve been fired for this, or at the very least had it not paid, but somehow she works it out to stay. Needless to say, pretty much everyone in our department who knows is pissed off at how unfair this is.

I wanted to make a complaint to our management about her, because she seriously shouldn’t work there. I feel bad though since we’re friends and I feel it’s snakey of me to do so I didn’t.

So here’s the reason why this puts me in asshole territory if I decide to make a complaint now (less than a week later). This came up after I decided I wouldn't say anything yet. There’s a position posted that I really need so this fall I can keep working and go to school due to the schedule. She knows how much I want this job, which happens to be seniority based. She signed it after I did (she’s also in school, that’s another story). I don’t think it’s necessarily bad of her to sign it knowing I wanted it, but I’m pissed off that she would get it even though I put in so much more work than her and actually care about my job. Plus, she should’ve been fired, if not at least on corrective action. We’re the only two who want it, so she’ll get it since she’s been there longer. I feel like my feelings now, which are admittedly giving me selfish reasons for turning her in other than it being the “right thing to do,” makes me an asshole if I actually go through with it now."

c55lip	2019-06-25 09:12:14	SoulOfTheDammed1	AITA: Telling my cousin what her mother was saying behind her back?	"So:

One of my aunties has a habit of insulting people behind their backs. 

The aunty had been insulting her daughter for a
some time which pissed me off.

It was not until I found out that my aunty was insulting me that I took the situation personally.

So in response I asked if my cousin wanted to know what her mother was saying behind her back she said ""Yes"".

I told her the truth but followed it up by stating that no one else held that opinion in the family.

This upset my mother stating that ""what I did made me an asshole"". 

Because of this I have apologised to my cousin while asking if she held a grudge against me.

The cousin has no grudge against me and stated she does not require an apology from me.

So is my mother correct in stating that I am an asshole? Or is she wrong to take offence to this situation?"	Asshole	0	0
c55lg6	2019-06-25 09:12:03		AITA For not telling my best friend about his mother’s late affair	"So, I was at a party recently where a girl who was a friend of mine was there we all got a bit drunk and started confessing random things. It’s all pretty normal until this girl called X confessed that her parents broke up when she was little because of her dads affair. We didn’t press her but she wanted to unload the weight, eventually she confessed that her dad had been sleeping with my best friends mum. 

Now, this guy has been my best friend for 7 years at first I didn’t believe it but the girl was sure. Next day she messaged me saying I can’t tell anyone what she said and she was sorry for saying it and especially not to tell my best friend. For reference the affair was 12 years ago, so its long gone. I feel I shouldn’t tell him, it’s not my business to know let alone break it to him, that should be his parents job. I do not know if his dad knows, but he has never mentioned them fighting to me. Furthermore, I don’t know if he knows and I don’t want to open up old wounds. On the contrary, my other friend who was there that night feels we should tell him. His argument is that he has a right to know about it and to know the truth. 

I know it’s keeping secrets, but his parents are happily married, he’s at university studying hard and for a girlfriend. I see no need to drag up ghosts of the past to haunt his present. 

TLDR; Friends mum had affair long time ago, I don’t think I should tell him as it’s in the past and I don’t want to drag it up. Friend disagrees with me and says he has right to know the truth."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c55jsa	2019-06-25 09:07:37	improbablytheahole	WIBTA for cancelling a wedding photographer 2 days before our wedding?	"We have a wedding in a few days and our photographer situation is in peril. At first we thought it was covered because a friend (#1) of a family member said they could do it. Well, 4 days ago they provided us with a proposed invoice of $2400. That was more than we were looking to spend, we have a tight budget to maintain.

Anyways, the family member managed to talk them down to $400 but that doesn't include any editing, just raw pictures. I feel like that is unacceptable and I don't want to be a choosing beggar and demand more for that price. Another friend of a family member is willing to give us a rate of $250 for full service. This individual (#2) has a really good portfolio and does some high quality work. The first photographer primarily does Instagram work and doesn't appear to have ever had a shoot for a wedding, though their pictures do look really nice.

Tomorrow I'm supposed to meet with photographer #2 and sign a contract to get the work done. There was nothing signed or official with photographer #1, just a verbal green light given 4 days ago when the price came down. Now that we have found photographer #2, I want to cancel photographer #1 but my fiancée says that is wrong. I feel bad but I feel like they are priced out of the market, even though I understand wedding pictures can get seriously expensive. I don't feel that we are choosing beggars because we aren't asking #1 to do more work for the same price, we simply shopped around and found somebody else.

I should add that #1 is going to be at the wedding no matter what because they are a friend of the family member, and may potentially help out with other things. I feel like this is going to get awkward if we cancel on them, not to mention potential damage to the relationship of the family member that knows them.

So Reddit, WIBTA for cancelling with photographer #1 and signing a contract with photographer #2?

EDIT: I do want to clarify that $400 is within our budget, $2400 is not. Also we did not haggle them down to $400, the family member did. I also want to be clear that we were trying to work with #1 at least a month in advance, we didn't hear anything back until 4 days ago. I'm not sure if it was a miscommunication or what, but that's why we're looking to cancel, dropping a last second invoice that's a bit out of our budget."	Asshole	0	0

c55hx4	2019-06-25 09:02:58	Silfurgames	AITA for wanting my friend to be more active in discussions?	"Awkward title because I am not sure how to word this. But to catch you up to speed, she lives in Australia, and I in the United States.

Context (this will become important): Friend is a trans FTM asexual. This is important, I promise, lol. He is in relationship with what most would consider an ordinary guy. He has much higher drive than friend does, and they recently started discussing the idea of opening up the relationship because it's taking a toll on him that he doesn't enjoy sex at all. Friend is having a lot of work troubles at the moment. Generally speaking, his life is not fantastic, and he's a pretty depressive person at times. I have known this person for 6 years and over time the discussions went from almost daily essays to the occasional meme montage. We originally met on a writer's website, so we often wrote stories to share with one another, even co-wrote some stuff and did some roleplay (no, not the kinky kind you are thinking of, lol; just one person writes a chunk of the story, and the next person writes more of it, in whatever direction they want). This went on for a year or more.

We stopped talking for a while. I reconnected to him and he told me how much he missed just the general friend stuff we talked about. Like how we both enjoy Pokemon and other video games.

But...he says all this... but doesn't seem to put forth any effort? Like, he'll ghost me for days to a week at a time, send me a ton of memes, and any attempt at actual conversation from my end is usually met with another meme or just an acknowledging ""lol."" I attempted to confront him a couple times, just to get vague responses until I got upset and started threatening to just not talk anymore if he can't be bothered to answer me. This got tearful apologies, essays about how hard their life is for them right now and how they don't have the energy.

Am I really the asshole for expecting... Idk... maybe an occasional actual conversation? Instead of just memes? Occasionally, maybe once a month, there WILL be a big conversation that reminds me of old times. That's why I stick around.

Then the rest of the time comes where I am ghosted and it hurts. Expressing that hurt makes me feel guilty because he goes on about how hard his life is. I don't doubt his life is hard.... Just somehow I still manage to have coherent conversations with people? If he comes to me with problems (like when he was upset over idea of opening up the relationship with his SO) I was there. I put so much energy into making it sound like I care because I DO and I want my words to reflect that.

I feel like the constant disappointment of barely getting acknowledged hurts way more than holding onto this, but I also feel like I could be the asshole for cutting them out of my life over something they truly can't help....

EDIT: reading this again and am like Oh God, I sound like crazy stalker person. No, I don't message him 82 times a day and then get mad when he doesn't answer. It's more like a once a week thing I'll kinda poke and see if he wants to talk, or if he sends me a bunch of stuff, mention something to test the waters, and then leave it at that if he doesn't seem interested."

c55gfm	2019-06-25 08:59:22	Phoenix2132	AITA for wanting to ignore my mother's advice on moving out?	"So the background: I am a recent college graduate who is currently living at home for the summer just until I find a job to start my career (I currently have a job, but am looking for something else worth having a degree for). My mother is an accountant and raised my younger sister and I as a single parent. She is extremely conservative and in many ways we are polar opposites, but I love the woman and am thankful for everything she has done for us.

While I've been job hunting, I have started to apply for jobs in various places around the country. I'm from a small, southern town and want to move to a city for a few years while I'm young. This morning I got a phone call from one of the companies I had applied to with them basically saying they'd like to begin the interview process. I got very excited, and as soon as I got off the phone with them I called my mother to tell her about this exciting opportunity. Her response was ""Why are you accepting these unreasonable interviews for these jobs across the country?"", basically saying it was financially irresponsible and that it was a stupid idea. I've really made an effort over the last year to try to keep her in the know about my professional and personal life, but hearing this from her was a major buzzkill. After that was said, I just wanted to get off of the phone with her and go about my day.

My sister told me today she's had similar issues with choosing colleges and our mom trying to influence that decision. We agreed that we appreciate what our mom is trying to do, but is close-minded about other opportunities because she gets hung up on money. To her experiences are irrelevant, only playing things as safe as possible even if that means passing on unique life experiences.

I say all of that to get to the potential asshole situation. Tonight after I got home from work I tried to cordially let my mother know how what she said on the phone today made me feel, and that I would appreciate in the future if she'd try to be more supportive about opportunities I choose to share with her. This turned into a 40 minute monologue from her about how I never listen to her advice when she's only trying to help me, that she doesn't think that I have the common sense to understand what it means to live on my own and be able to budget money, and that she feels like she failed as a parent because I don't take enough initiative to do things around the house and couldn't maintain one on my own (even though I've done all of these things for the last four years).

Am I just being a young, fresh out of college asshole about wanting to get out of the house regardless of what she says or is she being an asshole about the way she's handled her side of all of this? This really is becoming a problem for me and I don't want this to affect mine and my mother's relationship once I am out of the house. I'll try to answer any other questions you guys might have about what's going on."	No A-holes here	0	0
c55g3t	2019-06-25 08:58:24	CarA-hole	AITA For getting out of the car after being told i shouldn't drive in a certain way?	"Hi.

I'd like to ask about how much of an asshole i was today.

&#x200B;

Today, while on a way from a little shopping trip, i was once again reminded by my grandfather to not drive behind a truck at a regular safe distance. In his view, i cannot drive behind a truck with less than 200 meters (218 Yards) between my car and the truck. His reasoning is that a brick can be stuck between the rear double tires and catapult itself into the windscreen.

This piece of information is delievered to me each time we drive. Every time, without error for six years. (kinda impressive, actually)

He will say this when a car starts braking\* in front of you, or when you need to focus on driving - instead he starts talking how unsafe my driving is. Today i reached my boiling point.

&#x200B;

I stopped the car in a middle of a road, Told my grandfather that he should drive himself home, got out and walked.

After around four minutes, i walked back to an dead silent car and drove away.

&#x200B;

Here are the A-holish things that happened during my fit. I stopped in a middle of a somewhat frequent road. I didnt put the hazard lights on. (I did stop in a middle of a clear straight road, so the car was visible, but still A-holish thing to do, i agree) I was the only driver in the car. And, the worst thing - The car was full. My grandfather, my grandmother AND her visiting family. The last part is what cements me being the A-hole in my view, the visiting family did not ask for this and i wouldnt be surprised if i ruined their vacation.

&#x200B;

But i just can't.

Every time i do anything, i get some kind of critique. I borrow his tools, i suddenly reshuffled his entire workshop and lost each piece of his tools. I study, get a degree, its worthless and i shouldnt have bothered. I have a problem, he doesnt care - But his issues are problems of the entire family. I can write on and on about his views and opinions, but that is not the focus.

&#x200B;

When i got home, i cried, because i just cant do this anymore. (I should add that i had just passed my final study exams, and i havent done anything to relieve the stress of those exams, which probably contributed to me acting out)

&#x200B;

I understand I am a huge Asshole when it comes to the visiting family, and if anyone has any pointers on how i can apologize to them, i would be very grateful.

&#x200B;

For some background - I'm 24 years old, and I've been driving for 6 years now. Grandfather does the same comments when my mother drives. He used to drive in the past (He is 74), but only on small motorbikes, and tractors. I do sometimes get angry, so maybe i have anger issues, but i am not sure - Most i do is yell, never struck out, or damaged anything (If the critiques of my grandfather are anything to go by, i have serious anger issues and am horribly careless)

If i forgot anything, i'll respond to any further questions.

Yesterday was a stressful day for both of us. One of those days where you get off work and it’s just constant chores until you drop. I was in charge of grocery shopping, minor errands and dinner. She was in charge of deep cleaning the bathroom. 

At one point during the cooking of dinner, she asks to switch for a sec so that I can do part of the drain cleaning that she doesn’t want to do. I oblige. I tell her where I am in the process of dinner and proceed to help her out.

As I come back, she tells me that I forgot to make the rice. I tell her I’m following the directions step by step and that part comes later. She tells me that I’m wrong. I tell her that no, I am, in fact, right. She tells me I just didn’t read the directions. I say yes I did. She starts exclaiming “where’s the rice cooker? where’s the rice cooker?” and I get flustered and walk out to change the trash. 

I come back, look over the directions and point out to her a picture that clearly shows the rice being cooked later in the process, proving I’m right. I tell her she didn’t read the instructions and that it was rude of her to say those things to me. She says I’m rude for being snarky and telling her she didn’t read the instructions.

We don’t talk the rest of the night. Sleeping in the same bed but it feels like there’s miles between us. It’s 12:30 AM and I haven’t wished her a happy birthday yet. She gets up and leaves to the other room, saying she can’t sleep in the bed.

c558vj	2019-06-25 08:38:50	tinynidas	AITA for refusing to stop kissing my girlfriend in shared spaces in my home	" So: I´ve (32F) been living with my roommates (28F, 28F) for close to six years now. We've been very close and have moved houses earlier, to be able to continue to live together. We've even called each other family.

Last year I got a new girlfriend (28F). Me and my roommates have known her and her previous girlfriend for years, and we've all been pretty close. Part of the problem is that my GF left her ex for me, which of course changed the whole dynamic in the group.

After that my roommates told me that they didn't want us to show that we are a couple in any of the shared spaces in our home. They said that they were very uncomfortable with almost any displays of affection between us. They had two different arguments for this: one was emotional (it made them uncomfortable) and the other ideologic (they don´t want there to be a difference in how people are treated in a group setting, and by partners hugging/kissing they are excluding the rest of the group).

To be clear: we're talking about holding hands, hugging, quick kisses. Nothing inappropriate or in any way sexual in nature. My roommates wanted it to stop. As I said, we've lived together for a long time and have all had dates/partners but this was never an issue before.

At first i thought that this was due to them having a hard time accepting that my GF and her ex changing their relationship and had various feelings of guilt and empathy for GFs ex. So I agreed that me and my GF would stop the displays of affection and we did so for almost 6 months. Then I wanted to revisit the issue and my roommates got very upset with me when I told them this was not a longtime solution for me.

They said that they would not be OK with it now or ever, and I said that I couldn't accept these terms. In the course of these conversations they told me that they were thinking about telling guests in the house to not hug/kiss, and that one of them has even told friends who she was visiting at their home to stop showing they are a couple. This is totally unacceptable to me, both to treat guests like that and to treat hosts that bad when you are the guest.

The roommates both feel that they are completely in their right to ban physical touch and that I am being egoistic for not respecting that. They feel that their actions are not only acceptable but what most people would have done (since my GF was with our friend before). I feel that this is not the case and that they are acting weird and are being really shitty friends to me and my GF. But I feel like I’ve fallen through the looking glass and really cant tell what’s reasonable anymore.

A girl that has been a part of my life for many years in a variety of ways reached out to me last night after about 2 years of little to no contact. It took me until the afternoon to respond, but as soon as I did, we hit it off and kept talking well into the night. At the end of the night out of curiosity, I threw her name in the search engine to check out her Twitter and Facebook pages (I do not have any active personal accounts), but stumbled across something surprising. 

Just with her name alone, some of the top image results that came up across the top of the search results were extremely scandalous pictures and what appear to be leaked nudes. 

I’ve known her for over a decade and generally care about her well being the same way you would any long time friend regardless of any previous romantic past, good or bad. She wants me to text her again in the morning. 

Help me fellow Redditors, you are my only hope. WIBTA by even bringing it up in conversation? My thoughts are, being that it was so easily stumbled upon, she has to know. But if she doesn’t, I think it’s something she’d LIKELY want to take action on to have taken off the internet.

c556bo	2019-06-25 08:31:46		AITA for being upset with my boyfriend for not letting me meet his sick/potentially dying mother?	"I'll try to keep this short. Boyfriend and I have been together for about 4 years, minus last year when we broke up for a few months and then got back together.

My boyfriend and I overall have an amazing relationship but he is quite a bit older than me, and grew up in the generation where men dont have feelings, or talk about them, or expose their vulnerable side. My biggest frustration with him is that he is a pretty bad communicator (although to give him credit, we have been working on this and he is getting better slowly but surely) and is the type to keep his problems bottled up, and deal with them on his own instead of telling me about them. 

His mom lives a couple states over, and my BF rarely sees her, maybe once a year, or every other year. Money is very tight, so it's not really financially feasible for him to visit more often, plus it's extremely hard for him and I to get time off work, and we've never been able to find a time that works best for both of our schedules and our jobs to be able to take the time off together so I could meet her. It's a massive headache and very frustrating!

So she just recently had surgery, and last Wednesday my boyfriend found out she had a pretty serious infection and it's not looking good. Tonight, around 1am, he just texted me and told me he last minute booked a ticket to go out to see her on Wednesday at the hospital and that he would be gone for a week. I'm freaking out because if her infection is that serious, this might be my last chance to ever meet her, so I asked him if I could go with him and he said no. He said that he wasnt worried and he knew she'd be okay, and that he wanted this trip to be just about him and his mom which...I get that, but at the same time I am so hurt and angry and I think hes being incredibly selfish by denying me this opportunity to meet his mom, especially if this could be my only chance. I feel like he's denying me this huge part of his life, and he wont let me be supportive of him during a very difficult time in his life and I dont know what to do. I'm probably TA and being super selfish, so I'll accept whatever judgement you guys give me, but reddit, AITA?"		1	0

c554i1	2019-06-25 08:26:40	Pasta-sauces	WIBTA if I continued hanging out with my friend's ex?	"

  My friend and I are really close. We knew each other since secondary school and we confide with each other if we're feeling down or having a problem. I don't really have much friends but she does have a lot of friends.

  Lately, my friend had broken up with her boyfriend, who happens to be my friend. It was a four months relationship but I don't think that matters. Her boyfriend had the same interest as me. As in, we like the same video games, our sense of humour is the same, and our music taste is the same. Both of us are good friends. I continued hanging out with him  but I don't tell my friend about that or described how he is to them. Her ex-boyfriend and I are strictly platonic.

  I'm not sure if I should continue hanging out with him because my friend is still angry with him and finds him petty. On the other hand, I feel like its acceptable for me to hang out with him because it's my friendship with him and it doesn't concern her.

EDIT: I told my friend about this and I haven't got a response yet. But if she were to disapprove of my friendship with him, would I be the asshole if I continued?"	Asshole	0	0

"I (m36) was upset at my friend's (f37) child (m8) today when he reacted in frustration and anger towards my friend for trying to feed him while he was trying to play. My friend and I have been friends for a long time but drifted apart due to her moving away after she got married. Today is the first time I met her child and so I gave him a toy gift. He liked the gift and was consumed by it, to the point of when being hand fed a snack by my friend the child acted frustrated and angry and said loudly ""No."" I instantly reacted by loudly saying ""hey you can treat your mom like that"" with a frown on my face. I feel like I might have over stepped my bounds. My friend acted quiet and gave a sheepish ""yea"" in response to me. I'm reaching out here because I'm not good at reading people.

c5542l	2019-06-25 08:25:30		AITA for calling out and dumping my previous FWB?	"We had been hooking up and talking for a while. It was awesome, she was fun and smart and hot and fun to talk to and we shared a lot of the same values and whatnot

She started getting cold out of nowhere and I tried to bring it up, but she'd act like everything was fine. We've literally talked about how annoying it is when people are bad communicators, so I just figured something shitty was going on but I guess there wasn't. I asked her if she could just tell me what was wrong and say if she doesn't want to talk at the moment so I could stop worrying about what was potentially wrong or if I said something wrong 

No response for two days, so I got kinda annoyed considering she did a total 180 and it was starting to really drive me insane. All it took was a few words, that's it. Didn't even need an explanation! Just say if we're cool or not and just say that for whatever personal reason, you don't want to talk. It's that simple. I can't read people's minds. And we were doing really fuckin well as far as I could tell. She's married and open so maybe she was too close for comfort for her husband? Fuck if I know, I have no idea and likely never will 

So I sent a second message basically expressing my frustration and asking what the hell was up 

So she said ""What the fuck dude, I just don't want to talk, fuck off."" 

Really? I'm the dick? For some reason I can't imagine, some people seem to think that I'm in fact the asshole but I literally can't see the logic of someone I'm close to doing a complete personality change and then telling me to fuck off when I got annoyed when she refused to use words?

I was also actually the asshole when I responded by telling her to actually fuck off herself and that I'm done and seriously disappointed in how she handled that. So yes, I could've handled that better for sure. But was it really so unjustified? Can you see why I'd immediately lose all respect and interest and get a tad bit angry due to her... sort of being a lie? 

I told her I'm blocking her and that she knows how to contact me if she stops being a dick so it's not like I just ghosted her. I just blocked her number because I didn't even want to hear it anymore

So. Asshole? Yea or nay"		1	0
c553ae	2019-06-25 08:23:16	jaanthemfnymph	AITA For Ignoring Sad Posts that an Acquaintance Makes on her Snapchat Story?	"I (17F) know a girl from my school (17F) that is an acquaintance of mine. We have a mutual friend and I have hung out with her and that friend a couple times during lunch. Let's call this acquaintance Lily. 

Alright so basically I follow Lily on snapchat, and she is the kind of person to post about everything. Often these posts are sad. She will post black and white videos with sad songs playing in the background, pictures of her crying, pictures with captions like, ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" or ""Why does no one want to be friends with me"", or ""it sucks to have a dad that doesn't care about me."" 

It's really depressing to see posts like that, and a couple times I did message her privately. In one she said that no one eats with her at lunch so I offered and said that I am always down, and that she could just text me when she wanted to. She said okay and she never asked me. Because I dont know her well, and also because I feel like anything I said would help, I dont really ever message her about what she posts on her story. I feel like an asshole sometimes because  I feel as if I need to help her out, or show her I care. But I feel like it wouldn't really actually matter to her that much. Idk, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Well she got an amazing new job. One people build careers off of, compared to our job which is just retail. But, he first days at the new job were on days she was scheduled here. She called out 3 times & it was mentioned to her by someone she could get fired. Hearing this got her upset. Saying she’s one of the best that hey (she isn’t wrong), how they used her, etc. I was getting irritated here. She was getting great hours compared to most. I tend to get responsibilities that aren’t really mine thrown on me. The place isn’t ran well. She mentioned going to corporate about it, saying it’s not her fault, and they shouldn’t have scheduled her that way. But she only told her lead, who doesn’t make the schedule. Our HR does. She never told anyone else she had a new job. She also doesn’t understand that it’s a business, and no matter how amazing you are, they can’t risk it. I said that I know it’s hard but she needed to get out of this job. She said she can’t afford it. I eventually said I wasn’t sure what else to say. She ignored me.

I found out she thought I was upset with her and messaged her earlier today. I asked if she had work here, remembered she was at her other job, and said whoops and to have a good day. Noon came and I sent a text. I wasn’t upset with her, but she was stressed and I didn’t want to bother her. I didn’t think she was upset with me. She responded, said it was okay, but needed someone to talk to since she’s started working everyday. (She has a boyfriend) and that her future depends on the right decisions. She said working at our job was important bc she needed the money and she didn’t ‘expect me to understand that’ but I’ve had 2 jobs before. I have payments I have to make too. She said she knows I don’t like it here and want her to quit, but it upset her I was discouraging from working here. I know how poor they treat employees and I felt like she deserved better.

But today she said she wanted me there for her when it mattered. While I was giving her space she said it was a time that mattered and had no one there with her through it, but she was already used to that. (Again, boyfriend) That she just needed someone but it’s fine now. This upset me, and I told her it was unfair to treat me like this and to guilt trip me. She said she will never expect me to understand, and that if I felt like I was being guilt tripped or if I felt like she was hurting me then to consider it not my problem anymore. It’s been 4 hours since. AITA?

TL;DR: friend was upset with me for ‘not being there for her’, originally tried to be there but what I said made her upset. She ended up guilt tripping me. I said it was unfair to treat me that way. She blew me off."	Not the A-hole	1	0

c54yia	2019-06-25 08:10:17	throwaway_asshole___	AITA for refusing to get my dad out of debt	"Hi Reddit,

&#x200B;

I am torn here like really torn. So my parents split when I was 5 as my mom left my father as he had a very severe gambling addiction. He was never really around and I only have memories of him and my mom arguing about his gambling.  He left our lives completely and I have not heard a whisper from him till around 6 months ago (I am 26 now) when he reached out somehow through some old contacts that still kept in touch with my mom. Until this point I just assumed he was dead or locked up or something.

&#x200B;

We do the whole lets get to know each other thing again. He says sorry and introduces me to his new family (wife and 2 boys in their teens). I didn't have much to say to him and pretty much treated him as a stranger. But I did get quickly aquianted with his sons as we share the same interests (video games and baseball). We've added each other on steam and play games from time to time now. So fast forward to last week, he asks me for a loan quite a big one too. He asks me for **$3,000.**

*(Just a little bit about myself I am a software engineer and although i'm not balling out I didn't have to worry about college fees as my grandparents made some huge sacrifices to pay for it. Now I make enough to payback my mom and my grandad whilst saving a little bit each month).*

I have the money. I can give it to him and not worry about being paid back for a while. But something about me tells me this is very wrong. I have told him that I can't help him as it would:

1. Crush my mom
2. You are an addict and this would be me enabling you
3. I don't really know who you are
4. My grandad  would hate me for life if he found out I did this

So he is doing the whole, I need to pay for rent, I need to pay for school fees and guilt tripping me with his sons saying I am denying them happiness. etc.. etc..

&#x200B;

This really has been keeping me up at night lately as his sons are getting close to college and they are pretty smart kids. He is really putting the pressure on lately and gave me a call saying rent and bills were due and he can't pay it and he is saying that he shouldn't need to beg to his oldest son. I feel like a total jerk and can't sleep so I am writing this. Reddit please help.

&#x200B;

**Update**: Wow didn't expect so many responses.

Got some sleep and woke up feeling like an idiot for even cosidering it. The beatdown I would get from my grandad if he found out is reason enough.

I decided to give him a call later and say something along the lines of ""Sorry I can't help you as it would crush mom and grandad and I don't want to do anything to hurt them. But I would love to keep trying to rebuild our relationship""

I have enjoyed the times I have spent with my half-brothers and I enjoy being an older brother to them. I grew up an only child and never got to experience anything like this and I really treasure the bond that we have built. I am coaching my youngest brother through some coding courses and want to be there for him if he is to pursue this as a career later in life. Therfore that last thing I would want is for my dad to think I want to cut ties with him and his family and I want to express this to him.

&#x200B;

**Update 2:** Called him, told him I can't because I don't have that kind of money. He seemed very upset and I couldn't handle it and just hung up. He is sending me some really depressing and desperate messages that are quite hard to read. Not too sure what to do from here. This sucks."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c54ulu	2019-06-25 07:59:51	throwaway0958227	AITA for going home with a different girl at prom	"So I went to prom with a female friend named A. She is great, and I could tell she was excited to go. We didn’t clearly make plans afterwards, but I was under the impression that we could go do our own thing afterwards. Well at the dance, I met this other girl,  B, who I became interested. I didn’t forget about A, and still focused on her most of the night. However, as the dance was winding down, I decided to ask B if she would like to come home with me afterwards. Because I drove A, I asked some of my mutual friends if she could just hang out with them afterwards. B and I really hit it off and we are now dating. 

My friends, however, thought I was TA for this. Apparently A was pretty upset that I would walk out with someone else. One friend said that even if we didn’t have concrete plans afterwards, it is bad form to a) not at least drive her home/ her next destination and b) go home with another girl afterwards. 

I think this is BS. If she was my girlfriend I would not have done that. However, as a friend, she should be supportive of me trying to find love. Also, it’s not like we had plans afterwards. 

Edit: I explained the situation to A before I left.

Usually I just let the dogs out for a while and then close them back in if I have the time, send him a text letting him know they got out again. Came home for lunch today and saw that his door was open, dogs both poking their heads out at me, and smelled something gross and musty, figured the dogs got into the garbage in his house or something, keep walking down to my entrance, and squiiish. Stepped in a giant pile of dog shit. Right at my front door. In my new Vans Berle Pros that I saved up and bought myself. They were $120. I loved them. I'll include the screenshots of our exchange post-stepping in dog poopies:

[https://imgur.com/a/qWI61g0](https://imgur.com/a/qWI61g0)

I'll add that he has zero grounds to evict me and is simply threatening me to try and get his own way. And the dryer thing, he payed a guy to come unclog the dust trap in the dryer. A year ago. Thats the only thing thats ever costed him money in the 3 years that I've lived here and he still brings it up like he thinks I should pay him.

(I realize I could have handled it better myself but considering all, I think I showed restraint. lol)

he gets home at 7, i'm still at work til 8. he texts me saying the shoes aren't ruined and he won't be replacing them. I get home to find out that he literally just took them outside and sprayed them with a hose (as if to say here, fuck you, theyre clean), shit still waffled into the sole and up the side, smelling like wet dog shit. They will never set foot in my home or my car or even my work again, making them worthless to me. He didn't even clean it fully off the floor, just picked it up and didnt bother to wipe the remainder off the tile. I'm absolutely disgusted and frustrated beyond belief. Bugs crawling around in my entrance way enjoying the poop my landlord was nice enough to leave behind. Shoes I saved to buy myself caked with wet dog shit. I'm honestly considering looking into some form of legal recourse because fuck this whole situation so much. Soo am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

Edit: I feel like I should note that the shoes are suede with ""waffle control"" soles which is little cylinders of sole with no material between them, so cleaning it would require literally picking the poo out of each pocket individually. and they're deep."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c54tnq	2019-06-25 07:57:13	92SALVO	WIBTA If I talked to my boss about her flirtatious behaviour.	"Apologies, long one. TLDR at the bottom. 

EDIT- Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to respond with your advice. I feel much better for just writing it down, the helpful advice and new perspectives is an added bonus in my opinion. I think I'm going to let things be and just try to get her to talk to me if she needs to. I'm mainly just worried about her, I think that's why it's been playing on my mind so much.




How the fuck do I even begin here? 

I guess a bit of back story. 
Previously, the owner of the business ran our site.
Things were incredibly difficult, staff to staff communication was awful and relationships just completely broke down. 
Things changed when we opened up other branches and the initial owner/manager of this site, moved on to run another. 

That's when someone else took over, they had worked with us for a while anyway and often worked as a mediator between staff and management. 


This is when things got so much easier and we all enjoyed coming into work again. Communication was at it's best and everyone felt like they had a voice. This is why this predicament is so stressful. 

I work in a relatively small business, which means everyone works very closely. It's in actuality, a family environment.
I have a close relationship with my boss and we get along very well, for the most part, I feel like I can talk to her about anything. 

Apart from this. 


We've recently hired a new member of staff. And I'll be completely honest, he is a very attractive man. And has come into a work place of only women. We all had a good giggle about how handsome he was at the beginning and it was all completely harmless. Or so I thought.

My boss and him have become VERY close, VERY quickly. He's only been with us for a month and is still in training. 

She's often finding excuses to be around him. She spends atleast an hour with him after his shift chatting about all sorts of random crap.
 She messages him outside of work all the time and puts lots of winky faces and kisses at the end of them. 


He was late for his shift the other morning and was pretty much told ""Not to worry about it"". 


We had a work event at the weekend and she spent the whole night messaging this new member of staff. Being very careful to hide her phone from view. 


She's often saying racey things around him. Especially in reguards to a company trip we have coming up. 
For example; 

What happens on the trip, stays on the trip. 

All my inhibitions go out the window when I drink. 

There is more, but I can't think of them off the top of my head. This would all be relatively innocent enough if they weren't both married.

It's making me and my fellow colleagues uncomfortable and I'm pretty sure I'm going to bail out of the trip. Following suit of someone already. 

I think in honesty, she's embarrassing herself and I desperately want to talk to her about it. Because i hate not feeling like I'm being honest with her. 

But is it even my place? Could I do it as a friend? 
I'm struggling to come to a conclusion in my head where this wouldn't go down like a sack of potatoes. 


So, reddit, I'm asking for your help.  WIBTA if I talked to her?

But, today, I was talking about a similar situation with a friend, and I think she was axtually being too harsh on her partner. She and a friend were talking about how this partner almost ruined her life, when I really don't know what he could have done better. I didn't know how to say it and now I'm so pissed at myself, her and the friend. I feel like she is putting her partner down. I don't think he is perfect and he certainly has some mistakes, but I think they went on the wrong path talking about him... I'm trying not to give much details, because it's a very sensitive topic. I don't know. I need a second perspective.		1	0
c54ozo	2019-06-25 07:44:22	son-of-god-	AITA for cutting off a friend	"For context I'm 19 years old and have 3 brothers younger than me. My parents are refugees who lived through war, my mother suffers from a dozen mental health related issues(which have gotten worse by time) caused by the war and my father works the around 12 hours to make ends meet. So I'm basically the older sister who's raising the younger ones. 

Since I'm on a gap year I work during the day, and at night I'm busy with homework, activities and preparing the kids for school the next day. My best friend constantly wants to hang out and text/talk the whole day, I've explained to her multiple times that I don't have the time and means to go out every week and that I can't be on my phone all the time but she doesn't seem to get it. Recently she got really upset at me  and said I don't have a life when she invited me to travel with her and I declined the offer. I had dealt with enough bullshit that day and decided to block her and not reply to her calls and basically cut off communication with her. Am I wrong for doing that?

Note: I have no grudge against my parents because they didn't choose to be in this situation and they are doing their best but they're sometimes where I have to step in because because the way they go about things isn't exactly good. I also love taking care and my siblings and would give my life for them

c54fwg	2019-06-25 07:20:19		WIBTA(24f) for making my husband(23m) move back in with his parents?	"Please refrain from making me feel stupid for my decisions, nothing I can do now but learn from it. 

I met my husband through online gaming 2 years ago, we live in different countries. I thought it would be a good idea for him to take my dog, and I moved back in with my dad to make my transition of moving countries easier.
So, even though my husband works full time, every cent he makes goes to his loans, so he lived with his parents. His mom did not want my dog and me in her house since it was crowded, so I decided to start renting an apartment out there for him. He got a roommate,  and I have been paying for my husbands full share of the rent for exactly a year now (my Visa has been pushed back it has taken MUCH longer than expected). But about 2 months in, his roommate started seeing a girl and she immediately was sleeping there literally every night and was there all day... she didnt pay a cent, and his roommate was still only paying for half the rent. Obviously, this made me upset and it caused a huge strain in our relationship. He pretty much did nothing about it, his only solution to the problem (after one confrontation) was suggesting he moves out.... which would mean me paying the lease off and paying for even more rent for him to live alone, and I was not down. I ended up confronting his roommate myself, he said he would cover for her share of utilities.. and this past 2 months she has been at her own apartment more, and i have dropped it. So since it has been pretty peaceful lately, I agreed that my husband should sign one more year lease.

He signed the lease this evening... and only just now remembered to tell me that his both his sisters moved out of his moms, and she offered for his to live with her.. he literally just thought nothing of it, and rejected his mom right away and didnt even think to ask for my opinion on it. This happened yesterday, so it's not like he was hiding it forever, but still. He is asleep right now and I was too angry to really talk to him about it properly, but I already know why he declined them.... he feels like his parents do too much for him, and he always looked down on his older siblings for living with them when they have their own families and are in their 30s. Now she has 2 empty rooms and 5 less people in the house.
We could have saved enough money in a year to buy me a decent car, or put a down payment on a house, or even pay off his loans twice as fast. I also wouldnt have to deal with his roommates.  

I'm really thinking of forcing him to move back in, but then I remember that I'm the one who told him to move out in the first place, and how important it was to him to never move back. He has also been taking amazing care of my dog, and I just want to be living with them both already. But I have been sleeping in my dads living room for a year so I can pay his rent, and he obviously wouldnt do the same for me. So I'm really not sure.."	Not the A-hole	1	0

c54de5	2019-06-25 07:13:57	AnonBCReasonslol	AITA for needing my girlfriend to get a job?	"Background: I've been working since I was a 18 (now 20) and mainly saving money to travel the world. I live in the UK.
My girlfriend is 22 and has never had a job and has no savings, she also lives in the states.

After I visited her and payed for her to come here, I was running low on savings (spent around £3000 worth total) and told her she needs to get a job, things have been a bit rocky recently so my trust in her is low.

So I suggested applying for x jobs a day (originally 3) while im asleep as it'll show me that I can trust her word, building up trust again.

I ask her if she applied like she said she would, she said she did and if I wanted I could see the confirm emails. Woo, let's see em!! :D.... she scrambled to do all 3(she later told me), lying to my face saying she deleted them at the time

After this we fight a lot about trust and if i cant trust her to even apply to jobs to help this relationship, how can i trust her anywhere else? 

Ok she says she'll do 6 the next day, next day rolls around, she manages 1 in the 6-8 hours I was asleep. She then yells and screams that she's trying and that's good enough and that I shouldn't bring it up! She'll do em!

So I say alright, I wait a week, in this week in casual conversation I try to steer closer to hinting at the fact I want to see the jobs applied to.

After nothing, I confront her the next day. I say ""Did you even apply to any jobs?"" She says ""Yeah 1"". After a few days she gets an interview from 1 of the places she applied to ages ago, she gets a trial shift and gets the job! Great! But it turns out its a ""we'll call you when we need you and theres not even paperwork saying you work here"" kinda job. 

I insist she keeps reapplying because she likely won't be getting called in a lot. She argues that she finally has a job and I should shut up. I go alright, just apply to some.

2 weeks pass and no calls in. So i tell her look you have to apply to 1 job a day, youve got no income. She said fine she would. I wake up, still no job apps.

She said she'd do 2 today and 1 extra for (some other makeup) so 3 total.

I said okay cool, you know where my trust is right now, so please do 3 before I wake up. You have 7 hours. (I wake up at 6:30am every day)

Time rolls around, she sent me 1, 30 minutes before I woke up. I ask where the others are, she says she's midway through the second. 

I just lose my shit at her at that point, she posted a few animal gifs in her discord server and asked me about a cute outfit at 4am too, so she wasn't that busy either.

Then when I just start feeling so fed up after 15 mins of arguing she says I shoukd shut up as I have no idea whats going on in her life. I ask her and she says her grandparents dog died. And her grandma's sister (that shes told me shes never met) is back in hospital after falling.

c548aa	2019-06-25 07:01:44	JusaRandoThrowaway	AITA for getting upset about my boss changing my schedule?	"On mobile, so sorry for any formatting issues.

So for backround, I have been at this job for 5 years, only got full-time a year and some months ago. For those other 4 years I was part-time and a part-time student also. I have switched from third shift to second and back to third when I got full-time. For those years of part-time, I mainly did Friday and Saturday with a day or two wherever, since I didn't want all my work days to be 16+ hour days. I am/was the yes man for any unexpected shifts, last minute cancellations, no call no shows, that stuff. Done 16+ hour days for no call no shows on top of my regular shift, I've been steadfast and reliable during all these years. When I got full-time, the ""manager"", who did the scheduling asked me what days I wanted and I decided for 5 days straight with 2 days off, then it repeats. Been like that for over a year with some occasional calls to work an extra day.

Now to the meat of it. My manager went on maternity leave and had to hand off the scheduling to my boss. My boss since then has switched my times, an hour early or later than normal, and is trying to get me on a different schedule than what I've been doing for the past year and to work weekends. Like 3 days working, day off, 2 days working, day off repeat, along with working extra days. I love my days off, who doesn't? But those two days are my recharge/mental health days, they get me through the week. I'm an introvert and I work around people, so those days are a damn near necessity. If those two days don't happen I get drained and depressed. And since it's overnight, I kinda need  a day and a half to get anything done since places close down when I'm usually awake, so them being consecutive is key. Everybody is working for the weekend right? 

I've paid my pound of flesh and then some, I think I deserve to keep my schedule and my weekends. Am I the asshole for thinking that?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c546en	2019-06-25 06:57:02	epic-style	AITA for not wanting to get married?	"I (30M) and my girlfriend (27F) have been dating for about four years and she’s absolutely perfect. When comparing her to all of my past relationships, I can truly see that she is someone I may want to spend the rest of my life with. Last week we were out hiking when she decided to propose to me. Now, just to add, I’ve made it clear to her that I don’t believe in marriage and do not want to have kids. It’s not that I’m afraid of commitment, but I don’t see the point of having the government involved in our relationship and making a big deal out of it to friends and family. That, and I don’t want any consequences for us splitting apart. 

So, when she proposed to me, I naturally declined, but I insisted that I really did love her and saw a future with her. We live together and do everything together already. She somehow got mad at me for that, saying that if I truly did then I wouldn’t have any problems with marriage and that I should stop being paranoid. She’s been being really cold to me as of late and has been saying that I emotionally hurt her, but it’s just that I really don’t want to be married. I still plan on being with her for as long as humanly possible, and that’s that."	No A-holes here	0	0

One of my good friends, who I see often but isn't one of my closest, recently just 2 weeks ago broke up with his girlfriend. It was a mutual decision according to him, as they just want different things. They were together for 3 and 1/4 years before they broke up. The two of them were supposed to go on holiday to Greece together in a few weeks but I don't think he will attend now. (Girls family paying for it, loads of her family are going anyway he was just going to tag along). I was speaking to her a few days ago, and she invited me along to the holiday. She also made it pretty clear that she was into me, and so I think I'd be getting into a relationship with her pretty quickly.

We can’t get a replacement key because it requires handing in all six keys for a new set and one roommate is gone for the remainder of the lease. 

So here’s the problem I’m facing. He often leaves the apartment now and turns the lock so the door is propped and stays open. The hallway outside isn’t particularly busy with people walking through, but keep in mind the building houses mostly college kids and foreign exchange students. I don’t like the idea that someone could walk in and steal whatever they please. Even though there are four other roommates and one of us are usually here, I’m sure if nobody was here he’d still leave the door open. I’ve also told him that I don’t like him leaving the door like that.

As I’m writing this, the door is propped open with the lock and it’s only my sleeping roommate and me here. I’m about to go to sleep so my question is: WIBTA if I start closing the door and locking him out?

Edit: The key cannot be duplicated. I don’t know what to call it but it’s similar to a hotel keycard."	Not enough info	0	0
c540l6	2019-06-25 06:43:06	MsFaolin	WIBTA if I told my friend with end stage kidney disease caused by untreated type 1 diabetes that I won't see her unless she makes some effort to help herself?	"So I have been friends with Sam for about 7 years now. She's known she is type 1 diabetic since she was 10. To be fair her parents never helped her with it or taught her to be healthy. She is obese and she does not eat a healthy diet. She has an eating disorder where she just never stops eating and it's usually junk food or something sweet.

In the years I've known her she has been on and off of insulin and has never ever ever exercised regularly. She eats whatever she wants when she wants and ignores Dr's instructions. She stops taking insulin claiming she can't afford it even though you can get it for free at a hospital near to where she lives.

She has two collies and never plays with them, walks them, picks up poop and sometimes doesn't make sure they have water and food. Basically since she got them both they've been everyone else's problem. I used to live there but after I moved out I came once a week to take her dogs for a walk with mine. She never said thank you.

She lives with her sister and his partner and another family member. Her mom died because of diabetes 7 years ago just after we met. Her mom also did not take care of herself and just got worse and worse until she was bed ridden and incontinent so everyone else had to care for her. The night her mom died, I went with them to the hospital when they called her and her sister to come say goodbye.

Last year, after she dated a really horrible guy and ran her business into the ground and we had some other stupid fights, I decided to distance myself from her. I'm not prepared to sit around and watch her  health slowly decline. I dated a guy who also did not try to help himself and died as a result, even though I literally put my whole life at risk to save him. I won't do it again. 

So this month she goes to hospital and she sent me a message letting me know. Turns out she has 6% kidney function and is now on dialysis. I don't think she will make it 5 years unless she does something about getting healthy. I don't think she'll ever be on the transplant list, especially if she leaves things as they are. Everyone in her life has been begging her to do something about it for a lot longer than I've been around.

So on Wednesday I'm planning to go over there to see her cause she asked me to. I'm going because I feel like we should at least have a conversation. But, I still don't want to be around to watch her get sicker and sicker cause she won't take care of herself. WIBTA if I told her I won't be around unless she makes an effort?

I'm stuck because what if she dies soon? Then I'll feel so bad that I did not spend time with her. At the same time, it's taken me so many years to get my mental health right and being around her might just hurt me all over again. 

She's just been so selfish with this stuff (and lots of other things) that it's hard for me to even muster sympathy at the moment. I also don't want to be an asshole because I can't be sympathetic."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So a year ago i (22M) started to work in the firm i did my internship. It's a small company with 2 bosses and 3 technical employees 4 with me. 3-4 months after i started, we changed the office to another building and now i have to share a very big table with this other employee (25F). First it was okay but it got worse by day. Talking loudly on her phone and not caring about warnings, swearing etc. was the first signs that started me down the tunnel of madness. I still tried to be respectful and even shared the occasional conversation since we are in a small office. But everything got worse with stupid comments. While i was talking with another colleague about sports, telling me thing like 'you are already slim why'd you need to do sports?' etc. and generally stupid comments all over. I started to call these out after some of them even became offensive. Saying things like 'Wow this is a new level of stupidity i didn't even consider possible.'. 

I really like the job but hate the person and there are no other places in the office that i can work. Am I the asshole for calling these out as much as she comments or does things like these?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

He, George, and I were friends, until he and George had a falling out. When Andy and I broke up, we remained friends, but he moved away. I then moved in with George and his gf. Andy left his broken car with me when he moved. I thought I'd sell it to a junk yard for him and give him the money since it was his car, but George wanted to see if he could fix it up because he likes working on cars. I texted Andy, ""George wanted to know if you'd be OK with him working on the car and trying to fix it up."" Andy said, ""Yeah he can work on the car. Maybe he'd enjoy having it. It's mechanically pretty interesting. That might be a better solution than to sell it to a junk yard."" So we towed the car to our house.  I never saw this as Andy or I GIVING George the car for free with no strings attached. I guess I can see why George thought that, but this remains disputed. 

After a few weeks, George started talking a lot of shit about Andy to me. It was hurtful. I asked George so many times to please stop doing that, but he wouldn't. He'd often call Andy incompetent, a loser, a child, etc. George also got really mean and critical to me. He says he doesn't know why he got that way, but he admits that he got mean to me after moving in together.  George decided he didn't want the car as a project care anymore, and he wanted to sell it.  We got in a fight after George's gf told me he was planning on giving 0 money to Andy. He wanted to give me half, and I could ""give it to Andy if \[I\] wanted to, but Andy's a deadbeat, and \[George\] wasn't going to give him anything."" I thought this was unfair since it was legally Andy's car still, and George did NO work on it besides changing a battery.  After more fighting, I finally agreed to compromise by letting George's gf have some money, and then Andy would get at LEAST half.  (George was in a lot of debt to his gf)

George later got mad at me for not letting him trade the car for a new car for himself. I said he could trade it if he bought the car from Andy first by paying him a few hundred.  He laughed and said, ""Why would I do that?"" I thought trading it would be selfish because it would be fucking over everyone except George. I told him this, and we got in a terrible fight where he was very mean.  I finally said FUCK IT and told him (with Andy's permission) I'd have a friend tow it out of our driveway so we could be done with it. George then threatened to drive the car into a lake first, since he was mad I wouldn't let him have it.  He was so mean in a fight about it that I wanted to move out.  He maintains that I was being an Indian giver, but I think that it was selfish of him to shit talk my ex and be mean to me for months, and then try to get money from my ex's car w/o even working on it.

TL;DR- My ex gave his car to me. Friend wanted it. I said OK, but then he was a huge dick to my ex and me. He wanted to give ex $0 when selling it.  I say unfair and it's mine; he says I'm ""Indian giving"""		1	0

c53xfz	2019-06-25 06:35:43	frosted_flaeks	AITA For Letting My Mom Deal With Her Pain?	"For some backstory, me (m16) and my mother's (42) relationship isn't really complicated, I just do not like her. She's an alcoholic smoker and all my life she told me she's going to stop. My life has been filled with disappointment after disappointment. I don't listen to her anymore and don't want a relationship with her. 

Moving to what just happened:
We were having dinner and she doesn't eat much in general. As I'm sure a lot of you know, overeating when you aren't eating that amount normally is not in your best interest. She does exactly that. She gets another plate, saying that she's, ""starving."" I tell her she's going to throw it back up. Lo and behold, that's what happens. 

Mind you she's recently gotten her hip replaced so she spends a lot of time sitting down, (unless she needs something I or my sister can't get her)

The problem I'm having is that she just got up at 12 in the morning, to get another full plate of food. I know she will not finish it. I let her eat her few bites of what is now a wasted meal and go to my own room. 5 minutes later I hear her calling for help. I usually don't rush to her aid anymore since she's abused that power and the longer I wait she eventually reveals what she needs. She needed her recliner to be up. I can hear that shes hurting but the way I see it, she got up herself, she can sit herself back down. 

So, AITA here?

c53v6o	2019-06-25 06:30:24	Napkin_lul	AITA for getting upset with a girl for ignoring me?	"So I[23m] met this girl[19f] online on a game about a month ago. Literally the day we met she started saying really affectionate things like ""i wish you could hold me right now"" and stuff. Little crazy considering we didn't even know what the other looked like at the time, but I'm honestly a sucker for crazy. I've talked to a fair share of girls in real life, but until this girl, I haven't had feelings for anyone since my ex a couple years ago. She was a little crazy too lol (still not completely over her tbh).

At one point she tried to shit test me by saying ""don't flirt with other girls I know you've been doing it"" when I absolutely didn't. I called her out on her shit and she apologized. She told me how she gets jealous and insecure a lot and needs to work on it. Yeah, red flags galore, but like I said, I like em crazy so I was crazy enough to keep things going.

Anyway, fast forward to the past week or few days. We hypothetically talk about things like cuddling and showering together and stuff. Call each other babe, my love, sexy, etc. But we've also mentioned that we should probably take things slower and that we aren't anything serious yet.

She's randomly pulled the ""do you even care about me"" card a couple times and says ""i miss you"" pretty often. She's also talked about how happy I makes her and stuff like that.

Recently, I've been getting annoyed because she'll straight up disappear in the middle of a text conversation for whatever reason. I thought she was just in the middle of doing something in the game or whatever, but she also does it on discord. Doesn't respond for an entire day, if at all, even though she's ""on discord 24/7"".

Normally this doesn't bother me, but I just think it's hypocritical as fuck when she says she misses me because we haven't talked in a while or something, yet completely tosses me aside when she doesn't need me. I straight up told her but that conversation never ended because, again, she just disappeared in the middle. I called her out again today and her excuse was that she was doing an in game quest... I told her it sucks when she pretends to care about me and gets mad at me for similar things when a quest is more important to her than me.

Conversation basically ended with her saying we're just friends but she acts hella ""couple-y"" because she likes me. idk about you guys but ""just friends"" don't say things like ""I wish you were here to hug me"" or super sexual things like asking me about masturbation... We might not be bf and gf or anything serious like that but I feel like we're more than friends and I at least deserve to not be ignored like a toy she doesn't wanna play with at the moment.

All things considered, I've only known her a month. No big deal if she's not into me, I'll move on. But I just wanna know who was in the wrong (or if both of us were). Sure I was a dumbass for falling for and sticking with a crazy chick, but AITA for thinking it was more than it was?"	Asshole	0	0

c53sqv	2019-06-25 06:24:23		AITA for talking to my mom less after I heard her say I sounded crazy crazy?	"I got a head injury earlier in the year while in college, which has made the past semester miserable. I had a hard time making friends, so I would call my mom somewhat often (maybe once a week). One day, after a conversation, she thought the phone had gone off but it didn’t, and she said to one of her friends that I “was sounding crazy, but she guess I needed someone to listen to me.” This crushed me and I sent her a text confronting her. She immediately called me and apologized, saying that she didn’t get a lot of sleep and that caused her to act out. I told her it wasn’t an excuse and ended up hanging up. She sent me another text and sent me my favorite popcorn. This is not typical of my mom, who is stubborn and struggles to admit that she is wrong (I can’t really hold this against her because I am like this sometimes). 

Ever since this happened, I don’t call her much anymore and I wait for her to reach out. I can tell that this hurts her, but I have a hard time forgiving her for saying what she did. The thing is, my mom has done a lot for me in life and has seemed to be very supportive up until this point. After the injury, she got on a flight to come visit me because she knew I was struggling.  It feels stupid and almost bratty to not call my mom over one thing. 

Tl;dr: my mostly supportive mom said a hurtful comment and I haven’t talked to her as much since."		1	0

"So me and my fiance (known henceforth as ""Katie"") have been together for a grand total of about 7 1/2 years, engaged for about a year, in that time I've known her ex (known henceforth as ""Bob"", not real name for both obviously) for like 8 years. Now, he's an ok dude but is sort of a ""failure to launch"" kind of person, lives at home with parents, no job, etc. Well his living situation isn't the greatest as his mom has really bad bipolar disorder and even though he is trying to get a job rips him verbally (and maybe physically) on the daily. Katie wants us to try and help him out and have him live with us (plenty of space) for about 7 months to a year to get him on his feet outside of a toxic environment. I was a bit conflicted but after thinking about it I said he could on one condition. He needs to have a stable job to help pay bills before I'll let him move in. This upset her because she is positive that it's because of where he lives that he can't get a job, and he has a bit of savings to bring to the table but I am adament about my position. Does this make me an asshole given the surrounding circumstances?

Edit because I think it might come up: No, there is zero worries about any sort of infidelity because he's an ex, they broke up years before we even met and there is nothing romantic going on there, he is like a little brother to her."	No A-holes here	0	0
c53rht	2019-06-25 06:21:17	RSBennett	AITA for telling our upstairs neighbour she has to pay for us to get our toilet fixed?	"Hi all. Got a fresh one for you. My wife says I’m the asshole in this one but I don’t feel like I am. 

In December we got our first mortgage and got a nice flat/apartment. It does need a bit of work doing to it to modernise it which we’re doing as we can afford to. 

The upstairs neighbour (we’ll call her Sheila) is this (I think) detestable old woman who does nothing but complain, stick her nose in people’s business, and spout off racist rubbish. For example the we live in the middle of an area that’s a pretty good mix of white British and Muslim immigrants from various countries. A house next to our flat block recently had the guttering redone and Sheila has decided it’s been done incorrectly and she’ll tell anyone who stands still long enough about how “the Asians” do shoddy work. This sort of thing infuriates me so I have very little time for Sheila. 

So her latest thing to complain about is our toilet. She reckons it’s way too loud and we should get it fixed immediately regardless of what our planned order of home improvements is. Neither me or my wife think it’s inappropriately loud and already realise if it wasn’t the toilet it would be something else but my wife has said we’ll move it up the list and get to it sooner. 

On a separate conversation Sheila cornered me when I was getting some stuff from my car, and of course she starts on about the toilet. I told her it doesn’t bother us and no other neighbours have mentioned anything so if it’s such an issue, she can pay for us to get it sorted, otherwise we’ll get to it when we get to it. Obviously Sheila wasn’t happy about this. 

So I haven’t seen Sheila since but my wife has, and my wife thinks I’m an asshole from it. She has the same opinions I do, but wouldn’t voice them for the sake of a quiet life. Now I get that I could have handled Sheila a lot more delicately but I don’t think I was an asshole with it. 

What’s the verdict guys?

Addition: I’d also like to throw in that I saw the guy doing the guttering for the neighbours. It was the stereo type of the British builder, he was fat with his arse hanging out and white. Asians do shoddy work my arse!"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c53r82	2019-06-25 06:20:39		AITA for ending friendship with girl I’ve loved for years after she lead me on	"So I’ve been friends with I’ll call her Sarah for around 7 years now, we’re both 25. I’ve been in love with her for about the past 5 years now, she knows this and nothing has really happened as she said she wanted to stay friends cause dating could ruin our friendship if it failed. I was okay with that. 

Around last March I was at her apartment and randomly she started cuddling me and things lead to making out. Next day she said forget that happened as she was high on her klonopin medication. Even after I still loved her, but I didn’t let it get me down and focused on my schooling. 

Recently I graduated college and moved back home where she also lives. She lost her job and hasn’t been able to find another one for about a month and a half, and she’s been severely depressed and is getting help. She started to text me very flirty, and calling me on FaceTime everyday. Invited me over and came onto me, we stayed up making out and first time we had sex together was an amazing night. I stayed the night and the next few nights. She said she loved me and wanted to go on some dates. I was the happiest I’ve been in years hearing that. 

Next day she texted me she wanted to remain just friends. This completely surprised and upset me, and she apologized profusely for leading me on but that she did not like me in that way, and suddenly started talking about going on a date that night with some tinder match. 

We hung out a few weeks later and when we hung out I did say she looked beautiful in her outfit (I shouldn’t have said that). And later she said I made her feel uncomfortable with my “flirting. And how I just can’t get over that we slept together.” Wasn’t my intention at all. 

I eventually texted her a long paragraph about her leading me on multiple times and disregarding how I felt. She got very angry and said she’s having the toughest time in her life and needed me there to support her, as she said sorry multiple times for leading me on but that she was lonely. 

Am I the asshole for ending this? I love this girl to death but being only friends with her makes me unhappy, especially when she talks about other guys."	Everyone Sucks	1	0

On my way, I bought a particular set of fruits we both like. Being the first time I used the road, I didn't realize the journey would be that long. (1:30 hrs by air) I was hungry so I ate the fruit BUT bought a wine she liked instead. 

On the phone a couple days ago, I mistakenly told her about the fruit. It wasn't a scarce commodity 

She got angry and said ""I was selfish"" that ""she's known me as a selfish person all the while (8 months) and that I've been trying to cover up my selfishness with little givings.""

That hurt! I felt betrayed as I have never opened up to anyone that much before.  I told her we should talk the next day, to which she responded ""OK! ""

I texted her the next day that I was taking some time off to reflect upon the relationship. She called to ask ""how much time?""

I had to think rationally and decided my options. 

1.  Wait for her to apologize and give her a last warning (It has happened before!). 

2. Break up because I cant deal with the effect of verbal abuse during a fight. This could affect the self esteem of myself and future kids if I decided to settle with her. (My dad was abusive, I know the cost). 

Instead of apologizing she said:

- She was only aired her opinion.

- That being in a relationship means telling each other the truth no matter how much it hurts. 

- She sensed I needed her to apologize. This was strike 3 so I jumped in. Twas like I was forcing words from her mouth. 

After asking for her opinion about our relationship:

- She said she""MAY"" get back to me. That she needed some time-off. 

I sensed a power-play... And said ""let's just be friends!""

AITA for this? 

TLDR: I bought some fruits me and her (now ex) likes. Ate it cause the journey was long (12hrs). Mistakenly told her few days back. She called me selfish and said I've been pretending not to look selfish for the past 8months. I got mad and took time off. Gave her 3 chances to apologize (she blew it!). Broke up gently!"

I will start with a little background.  I have a friend that I have been close with since freshman year of high school (I recently graduated).  We have gone on vacations together, I basically lived at his house over the summer, I consider(ed) him a brother. However, during my senior year I broke up with my long time gf in october.  Later in february, my “friend” confessed to her that he had loved her for a while and broke up with his girlfriend at the time because he had feelings for my ex.  I learned this from my ex gf because she told him the feeling was not reciprocated and he was too scared to tell me.  Later in may he wanted to take her to prom “just as friends” and that consisted of a very expensive dinner and other things, I won’t bore with details but you get the gist.  

This brings me to today’s events.  My friend and ex girlfriend decided to hang out and take pictures, I knew about it but didn’t really care.  He then proceeds to make an instagram post comprised of 4 pictures of my ex. Also posts pictures on his finsta and insta story.  After talking to my friends about it they agreed that it seemed like a post a boyfriend would make about his girlfriend. 

Here’s where the situation becomes a little more nuanced.  My friend knows that I still have feelings for my ex and that I was considering talking to her about possibly getting back together soon. I’ve talked to him about this repeatedly and we’ve discussed ways I could go about it. 

He got really mad and defensive when it got brought up in our group chat and our friend group is very divided on who exactly is being an asshole.

c53hex	2019-06-25 05:57:01	unrely13	WIBTA for upsetting my today's ex?	"Hello wise redditors.

&#x200B;

A year ago, I used to have a girlfriend for around 5 months. We met online in an MMORPG, met with each other a lot and had a lot of fun together. We had a really great time. I loved her more than anything and I still do. 

&#x200B;

However, at some point during that, I fell into ""a pit"" in my life. I am in my mid 20's, finished a decent ID study degree and lived in my own apartment. But I got shorther on money after losing my job. Later, my uncle died and he was really important to me. Almost like a father. I was sinking deeper into the hole i dug myself, played more and more games and had some random bursts of emotional imbalance. I snapped on people, but not because of addiction, but because I had problems to admit my mistakes. 

&#x200B;

At some point, my ex's friends were making fun of me by disliking my videos on youtube and it basically hurt my pride, I snapped on to them and a bit on my ex as well. 

&#x200B;

She was sad about it, we talked it out, multiple times. We met with each other and everything seemed to be okay. Here and there, I was out of money and in my pride i rejected her to give me any money. We were living around 400 km away from each other, so I had to commute for a rather long time. After my uncle died, and my money ran out, I moved in to my parents house again. And shit just got even worse.

&#x200B;

At some point, my ex and I talked (only via chat, from here on we never talked in person/phone again, except for one thing later..), we got back to the topic about bursting out, because she clearly had something in her mind that she didnt want to say. She admitted that she is scared of me, that I would burst out like this again and wants some distance. I was understanding, sad and devasted, but I wanted to give her the chance. 

&#x200B;

Immediately, this was a wake up call, that everything is wrong with me. Within three days I got a job i applied to earlier. A well paid job nearby that I am still working in. Immediately I decided to go and meet my doctor in order to start a therapy, to get rid of my issues. 

&#x200B;

Still devasted of the relationship-pause, I wrote her a week after. I wanted to know, if there is ever a chance again. All she said was ""i dont know"". I told her about the positive things that happend within the week, that I am starting a therapy and got a job. But she didn't seem to care. To be honest, I ended up asking the same question ""do you still love me?"" and ""will we get back together?"" a couple of times. But then she started to insult me, call me a manbaby and many other things that I would rather not mention here.

&#x200B;

 After that, she blocked me on all platforms, I had no chance of contacting her. Now I have the fear that I will never find someone I love as much as her, even tho it has been a year since the breakup almost now. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So.. WIBTA back then, for giving her a reason to break up? Or WIBTA for contacting her even?"	Asshole	0	0

Starting to get to know BFBF better, gave him some dating advice from a female pov. All his friends, sans my bf, went to far colleges, he was lonely. We hung out every two weeks-ish. Bf said he didn't love BFBF n I hanging out often, but if I wanted to hang out with him, bf wouldn't stop me, despite his weariness. I introduce BFBF to some of my friends and we hang as a group. One night, we had my grandma's house to ourselves and finished 1.5 bottles of Smirnoff that BFBF brought. My 1st time being drunk, nobody else's, BFBF and F1 are borderline alcoholics. Next morning, jokingly said smthn like ""Damn, I was so drunk. I probably would've kissed BFBF."" 

Next weekend only ppl there are BFBF, F1, and I. BFBF got ***8*** bottles this time. End up drunk on his kitchen floor. BFBF and F1 make out, then BFBF says, ""OP, I'm gonna kiss you."" I look at him in disbelief and he does, and I kissed him back. Pull back in shock and open my phone. BFBF ends up eating out F1, me like 3ft away. I was so uncomfortable, but didn't want to be the person who ruins the fun for everyone else, so ignore them. BFBF puts F1 to bed and kisses my neck, leaves hickies, and puts his hand down my sweatpants, asks to eat me out. I told him no, I'm dating Bf, his best friend, who I love. He agrees before trying again, adding, ""I ate out F1 and I was so good at it, please OP."" I said no again. He tried 3x. I ended up kissing him more to get him to shut up, but that’s all. 

The next morning I feel TERRIBLE. I love bf so much and I cheated. I drive over, tell him I kissed BFBF. He is understandably PISSED. “Two years down the drain. I told you! You should've listened, we'd be happy and in love. Should've texted me to save yourself gas."" Cried a lot, told him I was so sorry and it never would've happened sober. He told me to leave. 

Talking to my best friend, I realize BFBF took advantage of me, got me drunk, wore me down. Turns out BFBF was telling BOTH bf and I that ""We could do better,” trying to get us to break up. BFBF then lies to F1 who tells me the story. Bf sets the record straight, apologizes for comment he did actually make. F1 who goes nuts. ""I can't believe you would forgive him after what he said about me. I thought I meant more to you than that. It's nice to see your true colors, where your real loyalties are.""

F1 wants me to apologize, isn't interested in discussion, telling ppl we haven't spoken to in years, ones she claimed not to like, her side. She and BFBF are dating now. I was going to move in with F1 when my family moves across the country. Bf feels awful, best friend kissing of your gf messes with your trust. We’re individually working through stress this has caused before working on our relationship again.

c53g3f	2019-06-25 05:53:51	ordinaryadultingnoob	AITA for wanting to keep my pets' rehoming fees despite my mother's claim that she should keep them since she bought them (but never cared for them)?	"Hi all, so two years ago my mom bought my younger sister (then only 10 y.o) a dog (for simplicity sake, let’s call it DOG #1) on a whim. This marked the beginning of a dyfunctional parent-child dynamic and caused a lot of tension among the 3 of us. Anyways, dog #1 shed a lot and mom couldn’t deal. Dog #1 was given to a local church member a month later. 

Mom bought DOG #2 for me and my sister. The non-shedding type. Sister didn’t like that it was biting her (it was in its teething phase) and decided that she didn’t like it and started yearning for a white dog. I eventually grew attached to dog #2 and took care of it and assumed full responsibility. When I got my first job, I paid for vet bills and pet expenses. 

Mom bought DOG #3 for sister from her friend. Sister liked her but still wanted a white dog. Once again I took care of this dog and gave it love. 

Mom bought DOG #4 for sister months later, this time, a small white chihuahua mix. Drove everyone crazy and even I couldn’t handle it. I begged them to either help train/clean up its messes or to rehome it as I was getting incredibly worn out. Mom was unable to convince sister to show some gd responsibility. After 5 gruelsome months I said fuck this, talked some sense into my sister and we found a nice home for it. I asked for a rehoming fee of $200. I think I split the money with my sister. 

Over the next year and a half, however, my mental health was starting to decline. I started contemplating giving away my own 2 dogs since I was a full time college student and had a lot on my plate. I began to question if I could ever be the dog owner they needed. It wasn’t until today that I finally decided that enough was enough - I couldn’t be selfish and had to rehome my dogs so that someone else could give them the attention they needed. Someone more financially stable, emotionally present, less worn out. 

I put up an ad and already got several interested buyers (I asked for a rehoming fee for $300 each). I then told mom this. Minutes later she came into my room telling me, “Since I technically bought the dogs, couldn’t you give me at least $200?”

She reasoned that she had bought my dogs with her money; therefore, I should give all that money to her. “I’ve never asked anything else of you. You’ve lived with me rent free. By law, that money should be mine because I bought them for your sister.”

To which I responded, “Yes, you bought them. But my sister didn’t want to take care of them so I assumed responsibility. They became mine at that point.”

Mind you, up until this point, both she and my sister have referred to my dogs as, well, my dogs. And now that I’m getting money for rehoming them, suddenly they’re not mine anymore? I paid for their food and doggy care. Took care of them bc I wanted to. And they have repeatedly acknowledged me as the sole owner and have never said anything so absurd until now."

c53g2u	2019-06-25 05:53:47	vacaythrowaway13579	AITA for hooking up on a family vacation	"Throwaway since some of my cousins and my boss know my main account.

So, bit of brief background. My Grandmother died a while back, and she loved Hawaii. She also left her 4 daughters (my mom and 3 aunts) a substantial amount of money, and they all decided it'd be nice for us all to go to Hawaii as a family, something we were never able to do when she was alive. So, the 4 sisters booked rooms for themselves and their respective kids, and left it to us kids to decide what we'd do as a family for the week we'd be there. Some of us wanted to go to a fancy luau one night, others wanted to go swim with Dolphins another day, and my input (that was surprisingly well taken considering i'd at best consider most of my extended family to be a bunch of chickens) was shark cage diving. We had all also agreed that there'd be at least one day where we had nothing booked, and could do whatever, a *""Free""* Day.

Well, the shark cage diving was a few days ago and things went great, everyone had a blast, and on this particular outing there was a girl there on her own, Anna, that I took a liking to (redheads tend to do that to me). At first it was just casual conversation, trying to explain that my family isn't certifiable, just *quirky*, and we hit it off. Turned out she was here alone from Canada, was only on her 2nd day on the island, and was excited to have made a friend on the trip. When we got back to land we exchanged numbers and began texting each-other pretty often over the next few days.

Up comes the previously mentioned *""Free""* Day, and it also happened to be Anna's last day there, so we decide to go walk down to the beach and spend some time together. We didn't last on the beach long, and we go back to her room for some fun. Before we know it, it's dinner time, so we go to the restaurant at my hotel to eat and refuel. After that, we go back up to my room to continue our previous activities and she ends up staying the night in my room. The next morning we had an early breakfast (both still on mainland times and whatnot), and I kiss her goodbye as she had to get back to her room to pack up and get ready for her flight.

What I didn't realize at the time was that 1st, some of my younger cousins had seen us at the beach, though thought nothing of it, 2nd, my older cousin (never really gotten along) had seen us at the restaurant bar and had gone to get his mother to ""come and yell at me"", but we had left before they got back down there, and 3rd, that same aunt (not being one to get up early) had apparently seen Anna leaving the next morning when she came down to clean out the breakfast buffet. Now she's upset at me for ""sullying this family vacation with my debauchery"" and is staying in her room in protest, and a few of my other cousins are apparently in agreement with her (though she's the only one staying in her room).

This is getting long, so i'll answer some inevitable questions in comments, but that's it, AITA?

Edit: Just to add a few points

* No one in the family is overly religious, so that's not a reason
* Due to me not being able to get time off initially and having to book my room later, i'm not even on the same floor as the rest of them, so it's not like they heard us (though if i'm being blunt, the people in the adjacent rooms likely did)

UPDATE: So, after posting this last night I had texted some of my other cousins, asking their opinions on the matter, and it was discovered that apparently the Cousin who saw us (who we'll just call Z now) had, unbeknownst to me, apparently ""saw Anna first and called dibs"" (then made 0 effort to talk to her/get to know her). Ya, so those of you who said he was jealous were on the ball there.

As for my Aunt's reaction, she didn't go on the shark cage diving outing, so what she heard from ""her precious little angel"" was that ""I was stealing his one chance at happiness"". When the truth came out she just scoffed at us and walked away, no apology or anything. Honestly, that particular side of the family has had that air of entitlement, and this will go down as yet another story in what could easily be a series of books on all the shit they've pulled over the years.

Thankfully as an adult (I do find it funny that some people thought we were underage) I can choose to cut them out of my life, which at this point seems like the best because I have no intention to stop talking with Anna, and will be up in Vancouver next month for work, we'll have to see how things go from there..."

c53fky	2019-06-25 05:52:29	poolside_band_aid	AITA for making my dad eat over a tray in my car?	"I'm a 33m, and my 65m dad was visiting for the weekend to see me, my wife, and my infant daughter.

My dad is visiting from across the country, and he has visited us in this exact location twice already. He shows a cursory interest in his grandchild and immediately goes into his normal mode of trying to impress us with how badly he has been wronged over the last year by people like the TSA, his older brothers, and his apartment neighbors who always ""hassle"" him for leaving his dog's poop in the parking lot. Needless to say, I'm in full adversarial mode.

On the second to last day of the visit, he requests to go for a drive around the area (which he has requested both previous trips as well). I say sure, because this is a perfect way to isolate him from my wife and give her a break for a couple hours. We are about to head out the door, and I see my dad bringing a large plastic bag, and I ask what's going on. He says he wants to eat in the car while I drive us around. This is when all hell breaks loose.

I don't have a super nice car, but I like what we have, and it's the ""main"" car for our family and I like to keep it clean.

I look in the bag, and the food is left over KFC chicken and biscuits. I immediately think grease, crumbs, eating with hands, licking fingers, woof.

Since we are not in any rush, and have no destination, I suggest we just eat at home. That way, we can enjoy our food and then head out for the drive. My dad is confused and asks why he can't just eat in the car while I drive him around, and I say that it would only take 10 minutes to eat here, finish up, and then just go for our drive. He digs in his heels, almost yelling, and says ""I want to eat while we drive. It's my thing, and I like it, so there.""

I'm in a weird spot because as a 33m I can obviously just say ok well this isn't going to happen. But I know this will lead to an awful afternoon around the house (and not relieve my wife like the original intention). So, I say ok let's go, but I bring a small cookie sheet from our kitchen (not a full cookie sheet, one of those smaller ones you would use for nachos or something). I said I think this would help him eat in the car because it would act as a tray/support/catch/etc. He loses his mind and asks me why it's such a big deal to eat in the car, especially considering my car isn't even that clean anyway (I would say my car is 6/10 clean, which is about as good as you can get with a kid).

I now know my course of action and tell him he will eat on the tray, or we won't go for the drive. He submits under severe protest, and then every couple minutes during the 2 hour drive makes sure to point to the tray and show me how many crumbs aren't there, and then for the rest of his stay, anytime we ate any food, he ""joked"" that we can't do this in the car.

c53erp	2019-06-25 05:50:34	CaptainBlackhill	AITA for not dog sitting for my mom?	"So my wife and I have 3 dogs and 2 cats. My mom has 2 dogs that we occasionally dog sit for a few days every few months or so when her and my stepdad go out of town. We don't mind because her dogs get along fine with the cats, but not really the other dogs, so we have a system worked out. I should add that all of the dogs are weenie dogs, so not big dogs at all. 

My mother-in-law asked if we would dog sit her pit bull (big boy that is still very much in the puppy phase and going thru training) for 2 months while she's out of state helping my sister-in-law with her kids. She asked us months ago and we agreed. 

Fast forward to maybe a month or so ago, my mom asked if we would keep her 2 dogs for a few days in July. I told her no since we had already agreed quite a while back that we were keeping my mother-in-law's dog. I know our limit because 5 small dogs (when we dog sit) and 2 cats is a lot, but add in a bigger hyperactive dog and it would be too much. 

Apparently this was unacceptable to my mom. She helped my wife and I a lot when we got married in March, so she immediately started guilt-tripping me by bringing up every single detail she did for our wedding. I'm extremely grateful for everything she did. Now I'm frustrated because my mom has a history of guilt-tripping me into doing things I really can't manage (she should be a travel agent with all of the guilt trips she's booked for me). 

She asked me again the other day and proceeded to throw another hissy fit when I told her no. If my mother-in-law's dog was smaller and already trained, I believe we could make it work. That's not the case since he is so hyperactive and needs to be worked with on his training fairly regularly. 

I tend to overthink things, so I'm just wondering AITA for not dog sitting for my mom?

Also, I think she's withholding my share of my grandmother's inheritance in hopes that I will change my mind and keep her dogs. Just speculation between my wife and I, but she's been making every excuse in the book and it wouldn't be the first time she's done something like this."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c53e93	2019-06-25 05:49:17		AITA for telling my husband to grow up for his views on money?	"My husband is very good with money. They say the average American only has less than 1,000 dollars in savings. My husband has accumulated almost 40,000 dollars and he is only 21. He lived with his parents besides a short 2 month rent which was 450/month when we first started dating. His parents often cooked and he never ate out and had much of social life before which allowed him to save so much money. When we started dating, he was extremely frugal - never wanting to eat out or even buy me a cheap soup. However, he joined the Army last year and we got married - a lot changed. He started collecting BAH during basic training & AIT, I never received any of this but I trusted in his ability to save money. When he finally moved to his duty station, he is now receiving BAH, food allowance, and his base pa He gets 1300/month BAH and we usually only pay 1000/month for rent, power, and internet. We usually only eat 3 times a week at most and sometimes I pay because I feel bad for not making dinner. I work 80 hours a month per his request. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today, he complained that he was not making any money. At first, I tried to explain that this month was my birthday and he also bought a car so that is probably why he didn't make much money this month.  But then he said we eat out too much and that was why we aren't making money. We only eat out on the weekend and never for breakfast, so maybe 4x a week. At this point I got kind of pissed off and I said some kind of nasty things, telling him that 1) he needs to grow up because we are on our own now, he didn't pay rent at his parents house and never payed for meals since his mom only cooked them and 2) to get over his self because most American's don't have anywhere near the amount he has in savings. I sure as hell don't, I have around 4,000 total and I'm happy with that. Maybe I could have worded this differently but I was angry because he seemed to be blaming me for him not making any money  this month. I also pay for groceries to cooking him dinner a lot of the time. Am I the asshole reedit? Maybe in how I worded things, but was my intent good?"		1	0

c53dad	2019-06-25 05:46:56	hoochcrazyfrg	AITA for not eating a gross dinner that my girlfriend worked hard on?	"My girlfriend made dinner tonight and it did not go well. She decided to make chicken parmesan for some reason I'll never understand. Neither one of us would ever choose that on a menu. Second, she bought chicken thighs, not breasts. Third, she's Irish and has zero cooking skills and that's not a dish for beginners. When she was making the sauce I said ""so you decided to make your lactose intolerant boyfriend a dish with a shitload of cheese and heavy cream?"" I ate one bite, she ate two bites, then she went to bed feeling like a failure.

Edit: my lactose intolerance isn't as severe as some other people, but it's enough to plan my life around. I usually get super gassy and/or diarrhea all night.

For everyone who is asking why I let her cook the whole meal and said something at the end, she did most of the cooking while I was at work and I got home when it was almost done.

For everyone who says I should have been nicer about it, you're probably right. Sarcasm and ridicule is the language my parents spoke at home so it takes a considerable amount of effort and intention to override those instincts. I did make an effort to be supportive when I saw how dejected she was but it was too late by then."	Asshole	0	0

c53bvv	2019-06-25 05:43:23	Sketch_Smith	AITA for telling my friend this info?	"So I was very good friends with someone who was in a relationship. We'll call him Jim and his ex girlfriend Greta.

Jim is an incredibly nice kid, a funny and talented guy hroigh and through. Hes kind of short and baby faced, but that's not the point yet.

My other friend (we'll call her Janet) gave me a tip that Greta was going to break up with Jim.

Greta's reasoning was that Jim isn't someone that can make her feel safe, and that Jim isn't capable of that considering he's shorter and a pacifist.

I promise Janet that I wouldn't let him know ahead of time and I would wait for Greta to tell him.

3 weeks later, Jim and I were talking and he me tione their breakup, and the reasons he claimed she gave him, were completely made up, and ways to make Jim feel better. Only they made him feel worse because he's not an idiot and knows her reason we're obviously made up.

So I told him the real reason, and he felt much better after getting closure. He's a really nice guy, hut he hates when people treat him like he's not an adult, and that people lie to him to avoid hurting his feelings.

A few days later I get a text from both Greta and Janet, telling me that I had no right to tell him and that I broke a promise. My assumption was that Greta told Jim the truth in the first place, but apparently I was wrong. 

A thing to keep in mind is that Jim never confronted Greta/Janet, and that they heard it from a kid named Manny, who Jim also vented to.

But Greta has lost a lot of friends when she complained about me telling Jim (everyone loves Jim, so there's no going against Jim because he's never acted malicious to anyone we know.)

Greta even turned on Janet, who told me the info, and now both of them refer to me as ""the snitch"" while still hating each other.

What I found out later was that Greta actually lied to both of us, and she was actually cheating on Jim, then broke up with him before she got caught, eventually ""informing"" Jim that she and her new boyfriend are a thing.

c53blt	2019-06-25 05:42:43	throwaway126886	AITA for not giving rides to the gym?	" Currently, I go to the gym at around 5 am with two other friends. One of them lives close by and the other does not. The one who does not live close by just drives to the gym on her own. For the past month of June I’ve been going to the gym with that Female, let’s call her Janet. And then recently I’ve also started carpooling with the person that lives close by, let’s call him Reese. 

I go to the gym early in the morning just so that I have access to the equipment that I want to use, however, the gym itself does have limited equipment(it's planet fitness so its basically only cardio machines & most people are trying to work out before work). Now going with 2 other people is somewhat challenging as we do the same workouts so not only do we motivate each other, but also we take quite a bit of time to work out (also because there are other people in the gym and I feel like an asshole if I'm hogging a machine or weights for more than 10 min). 

There are two other people in my community that know that I give Reese a ride to the gym and keep asking to workout with me as well (hence a ride to the gym). I don’t mind giving them a ride anywhere else, it’s just that I don’t want to give them a ride to the gym because the whole point of me going to the gym so early is so that I can get a good workout in with the equipment I want to use and 2 more people would be kind of annoying because that would be 5 people in total that I’m working out with. I told them “sorry the queue is full” and then they got mad and called me a dick and told others I was also being a dick. I told them that they are just using me for free rides to the gym, to which they also got angry.  

Additionally, someone scraped my car in the parking lot so now my parents are a bit wary of how I drive, specifically how many people I drive since they think I am the one who is being distracted into bad driving habits (IDK why they reached that conclusion it’s just how they think). Honestly, I don’t really know who to ask so imma ask you guys, AITA?

&#x200B;

Additionally, I am willing to drive one of them to the gym IF someone else dropped out because then it won't be so many people working out at the same time."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We got close to adopting a dog, even bought a couple things, but that fell through. I also almost adopted a ferret, but R2’s Dad convinced her it was a bad pet. (I don’t agree) But S and I were still searching. 

This evening I came home and R2 informed me that she no longer wanted an animal in the house. The cat was still here as R1 is on her honeymoon, but as R1 is away, she has been peeing on everything. And she had been reading the lease. She said that there was somewhere she could move to, but I feel really uncomfortable kicking her out to get a dog. And we would also have to find someone to move into that room.

I was then told I no longer have a plus one. Mind you, this wedding was thanksgiving weekend, I lived out of state and I was already planning on bringing my girlfriend home. The reasoning was due to space at the wedding and the limited amount of time we were together. Which makes zero sense because a friend of mine received a plus one for his girlfriend and they were dating the same amount of time. He also wasn’t even standing in the wedding. I did speak to him and try and explain, but he would not budge. So I decided not to go and just spent my holiday with my girlfriend, friends and family. Which was an amazing time!

Let's jump right in. My sister and I (both 25) are both young moms. She has 3 and I have 1. 
She's my favorite sibling but I do not like her kids. And love spending time with her when it's *just* her.

Her kids (6, 3, 10) just do whatever they want to.
 Run in my house. Jump off of furniture. Scream, yell, cry, break things, fight. 
And yes I understand that these are things that children do but it's a parent's job to correct that behavior. 
I've told her multiple times that she's welcome to allow that in her house, but they arent allowed to do that here. I'll say things a few times but feel like I'm being an asshole so I just stop talking. 
But it's at the point where even my son (5) hates when they come over. I have a ""no eating and walking"" rule and they just disregard it. Because she'll say ""well you have hardwood floors now."" 
Riding in the car with them is even worse. They scream the entire time, fight in the car, unbuckle themselves etc. When we are in public, they're unruly as hell. Yall get it by now.

So my friend Amy is also the friend of the SO’s little sister. Sis and Amy had a huge falling out and now I’m the bad guy somehow because I still talk to her. That’s not the whole story though,  I don’t like how MIL handled this. Enough to seriously take a step back from her. 

So sis and Amy’s fight, I don’t want to get into. Mean things were said, they were all assholes. No doubt there. Now I don’t think this fight crossed any lines, it’s just 2 20ish girls having fight. I don’t take sides and I’m not involved. 

Now, I’m still friends with Amy. I love that girl. She has helped me with so much.  Mental health things, cancer things, having good timing to talk me down from a panic attack. I’ve done the same for her. 

Lil sis and MIL thing that I am “disrespecting the family” for talking to Amy still. I’m waiting for the eventual hell storm that will happen in a few weeks when she visits next and they found out, but that’s another story. 

In response to this fight, after the fight MIL decided to call Amy to her office for a “chat” that lil sis didn’t even know about. 

Now this woman works in a doctors office. Not exactly a low key meeting place. She spends nearly an hour telling Amy how horrible she is, including spewing lies about things I supposedly said and SO supposedly said, adding to the drama. I am LIVID. She made Amy cry. In front of her and kept going.  MIL claimed I called MIL and lil sis in a panic about some lie that Amy supposedly told and started drama... This 100% did not happen. 

Now, I get going mama bear when your kid is hurt? But trapping someone 30 years younger than you that looked up to you is too far in my books. And this is a woman who prides herself on her conflict resolution skills and honesty. 

I planned to stay out of this and I’m trying to. I am firm in my beliefs that people should be friends with whomever they want. Especially over a fight that’s not mine and a friendship that has been established for a while. 

Because of this whole yelling office thing, I’m ready to talk to MIL as much as needed for family obligations, no more. I can not believe she did that and thinks it was okay. To give you context, we chat about 1x a week on the phone socially and go do activities together when she’s in town. 

I want to talk to her directly but I’m trying to let my SO work out how he’s going to talk to his mother. He 100% gets to do that first. He is still figuring out what to say and i respect that. He also supports my friendship with Amy because he’s seen us together and knows how important she is to me. 

So, Reddit. WIBTA if I cut out my MIL from my life (mostly)? Or is there something in here I’m missing. 

I do not want to talk to her before my SO gets a chance, so not that.

Edit:  I’ll add it in since it seems relevant now. AMY was upset lil sis was threatening going off some strong mental health meds and asking her to call in to work multiple times a week because she was lonely. And Amy said no.

I don’t know how things are worded because yes, they are young people and I know how those fights can go, but that was the intent and the actions that started this drama fest."	Not the A-hole	0	0

It was a very last minute decision and I didnt even think to invite my mom because she is working and has a hard time taking off of work.

c52vlu	2019-06-25 05:04:52	TrueLStar	AITA for cooking salmon at 11pm?	"I'm living at home with my parents because of an illness that is making my life difficult. Currently working on getting another job and moving out.

So every night my mother sits in the living room and watches a TV show. She gets very territorial of the living room and kitchen at this time, stating that no one is allowed in there while she is because, ""it's her house"". She has yelled at me for getting water or a snack before during this time.

Well last night I was sick so I slept in until like 3pm today to get over it. Unfortunately this screwed up my eating schedule. I hadn't eaten much today and got hungry at about 11pm. My mother was watching her show and I started cooking quietly. She yelled and argued with me the entire 20 minutes I was in there. 

She also yelled at me when I put the leftover salmon in the fridge. I told her sorry that I ended up cooking this late but she needs to learn that she cannot control every aspect of my life. I need to be allowed to get food and water especially whenever I need it. I also told her she needs to respect my space in my room because she doesnt knock and often questions me for being undressed in there. She states she can do what she wants because, ""it's her house"".

c52ui1	2019-06-25 05:02:32	HopingToGoToCarnegie	AITA for choosing to spend my free time with my friends over my girlfriend?	"Some background, I’m 17 and my girlfriend is also 17., we’ve been dating for about 8 months now. Things have not been the best. Her family is Christian and is quite overbearing so she chose to keep our relationship private to her parents. So most of the time, we can only spend time together at school and a little after, but we text quite a bit. But unfortunately, we don’t have too much to talk about because she has been sheltered a lot and spends most of her time watching Christian vlogs and aesthetic videos. While I, on the other hand, don't care much about religion, love playing games and watch many things that she just flat out refuses to see. 

But now summer has started and we aren’t able to spend much time in person. In addition, I have ACT and SAT subject tests to study for and college summer classes to attend. So I spend a lot of time studying. But after studying I choose to play games with my friends I have known for years and talk to them over discord because I find it so much more enjoyable and relaxing than spending time talking about some random stuff with my girlfriend or constantly reply to her messages (I do reply but just slower than she wants I guess).

Today she said I was neglecting her and that I shouldn’t be making time for my friends over her. So AITA for choosing to spend time with my friends and play games with them because it’s a lot more enjoyable for me and helps relieve me of stress or was she right to say that I should be making more time for her instead of my friends. Sorry about the formatting or grammar, I’m on the phone and quite tired.

Edit: Thank you all who replied and you guys are right that we aren’t well suited each other. I just msged her and hope to talk to her about our relationship.

Edit2: I’ve honestly been feeling a disconnect for a while now but chose not to really take action. I can see why I’m an asshole for not ending this. Thank you guys."	Asshole	0	0

c52tz9	2019-06-25 05:01:23	altaaaasgjtdnikoppp	AITA for being mad for not getting a raise and the general injustice towards teens where I work?	"(US)

I'm a 17 year old male that works at a counter service restaurant, in this restaurant most people should be able to work almost all positions. I've worked here for two summers then started working year round about a year ago. I get paid min wage by the hour, but anyone over 18 have a larger starting salary. (8.00) 

I've learned how to do almost everything in the restaurant, to the point where I know how to do alot more stuff then alot of the adults. I often get longer shifts then alot of the adults (it's to note the more experienced you are the longer and more shifts you get) and I'm usually one of the last ones to leave before the managers (we work in teams of 4-6 per shift) at close. There is people in the restaurant who get paid more then me with less experience just becouse of age. Which is the case with almost all the teens where I work. 

I went to one of the managers who I'm friends with, also the head of HR, and asked him about the possibility of a raise. He said would talk to the owner. I get a text the next day I was denied with little detail.

The few people who knew  I asked seem to think it's not a big deal, knowing all the details I've put in this post so far. One of my closer friends think I shouldn't be upset at all. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

At first I did not mind going, but this year, I've decided I've had enough. I do not have the choice to make my own decision of quitting, my parents are.

I've lost interest in my math class in school because of all the courses that I've taken in Kumon. Most of the subjects we learn about in school, I have already learned at Kumon. I feel like it is too much work. I have work at school, but I also have extra work from the tutor. From my experience, the work that I have been given is too misunderstanding.

I have tried to talk to my parents about leaving the program. My dad agrees with what I said, but my mother disagrees. She believes I should stay for 5 more years. My high school work with pile up upon Kumon. She believes I will be smarter and I should go beyond. She wants me to be smarter than my current grade level, which is great, but I cannot handle the work. 

It upsets me that I cannot leave, and it upsets my mother that I do not want to continue.

I am 20 years old. I tell my aunt about my recent trip to Hong Kong with my sugar daddy, and ask her to keep this between her and I. I assured her I was safe and I had been dating this man at least 7 months prior before any international date. She said she would honor this confidentiality 

After I visit her. She asks to hangout and calls me numerous times. I ignore because I feel bad for not picking up the previous time

Fast forward a month later, she tells her sister, my mom and my grandma. She said she’s just concerned over my safety. 

I get that she’s concerned over my safety, but really? My parents have disowned me, I haven’t talked to them in 8 months (she knows this), they don’t support me, I’m not a minor, and she specifically broke her promise with me.

I was initially mad that she turned around and dished all my business..... she never did this to me, and I had put my trust in her. 

Then I kind of reflected....AITA for putting this on her? I think maybe it’s a lot to put on someone. She might feel guilty if something were to happen to me, is she had known what I was up to the entire time."		1	0
c52q4z	2019-06-25 04:52:17		AITA for loudly telling my classmate to shut up in front of our teacher and the whole class	"Me and three classmates were doing a work presentation in uni to our class. The presentation went fine, but the teacher in question is a veeeery talkative one - not a flaw, the man is pretty smart and fun and his classes are one of the best I have. So we did our presentation and he was there talking about the subject with us and the class, making questions and pointing out some stuff, etcetera. This went for about maybe 3 to 5 minutes, idk. Me and my group were there standing while he was talking, because this is the behaviour my teachers in general demand when it comes to presentations, they say we need to keep our positions in front of the class when the subject is being talked about so we can answer questions and stuff like that (but you can sit if you need to obviously).  

So this guy in my group was apparently tired of being there and started making ironic comments when the teacher was talking. He was laughing, saying ""yeah whatever"", ""I know that"", ""yeah you don't need to tell me"" and other things. Of course he wasn't saying this loudly but it was clear that the teacher could hear it and our classmates heared it too clearly. It was driving me nuts, he could put our evaluation in risk for being uneducated and mistreating the teacher. So I waited until the teacher stopped talking, turned to the stupid guy in my group and said:

""Could you please shut your mouth? You're being TOO inconvenient and arrogant with your comments."" He turned red and said nothing. So I turned to the teacher and said I was sorry in the name of the group and that we didn't agree with our classmate behavior etcetera. The teacher said to the stupid guy that he could go home because his evaluation was ended. We continued our presentation without him, it was really shameful but we ended up with a really good evaluation. I heard that the stupid guy got a bad evaluation and that he could lose the discounts he has because of it (because he needs to have high grades to keep them). He has no money to pay for uni without those discounts and could leave it because of what happened. 

So, word in class is that if I didn't speak in the name of the group about that guy behaviour to the teacher, he would have spread the negative points between all the group and that guy could have a higher grade and keep his discounts. So people are basically saying that what I did was basically being selfish and wanting to show my superiority, but I have discounts to keep as well! I was just trying to save my skin and couldn't imagine that the consequences would be so negative for that guy. I'm feeling hella guilt and need opinions. AITA here?

c52our	2019-06-25 04:49:21	throwmeanyways	AITA for telling my ex I'd give him a chance then changing my mind	"So for backstory me and my ex were together for like a few weeks a few years ago but since then we had an on again off again flirtationship. About a year ago we discussed the prospect of trying things again but I said no because it would have to be long distance for a few years and I wasn't sure about that. A few months later(january) out of the blue decided I would give him a chance, however we both decided that at that moment a relationship would be too soon and decided to date during the summer(starting in may) while I was home. In my mind this arrangement was more of a casual ""I wanna go on some dates with you during the summer and see how this goes"" but to him I think it was more of a ""we're definitely gonna try a relationship during the summer"". So time goes on and long story short I catch feeling for another guy(lets call him NG) that I liked in the past and never expected to get in contact with and we end up having sex unexpectedly. Before us having sex there was no established romance between me and NG but I did make efforts to hang out with him because I liked him. I felt bad about my ex so I decided to tell him about me having sex with the NG(a few days after we had sex) to see how he felt seeing as that would kinda endanger the summer thing. Needless to say he wasn't happy and hates me now.

&#x200B;

My ex said he was upset that I propositioned him to date in the summer while I liked another guy. He said it was unfair to have another guy in the picture but I thought he already knew about NG because he acknowledged posts I made on social media about liking him(my ex said he thought i was joking but i think he was confusing NG for another guy i didn't like)and when I made the agreement the NG wasn't in my life or an option because I had no contact with him. Another thing that made my ex upset was that when he asked me if I regretted having sex with the other guy and if I was willing to do it again I truthfully said I didn't regret it and would do it again. There was more but this is top 2

&#x200B;

The problem here reddit is that all the friends I asked about this situation (about 5) said my ex was overreacting but NG thinks my ex is justified. I regret that I didn't discuss how serious our arrangement was and the prospect of other people because I never expected to start stuff with another guy and feel guilty that I didn't tell my ex about NG when we were starting to get closer. However, all my friends say that because me and my ex were not together, hes not justified in being mad about me getting with another guy. Should I have been completely loyal to my ex in light of our arrangement? Despite me meaning to give things a chance in the summer was it wrong for me to end up messing with another guy? I def think I could've done things better but now i'm confused lol

Using this throwaway because I'm too lazy to make another. I have been going to this gym for around 2 years, and by now most of the people there know me well. When I work out, I need to look at the mirror (not for vanity reasons, but because I have trouble with form and have scoliosis so I need to check if my form is right and my back is straight) and now I find it almost impossible to not look at the mirror while working out. Anyways, I was doing bicep curls using a cable machine, and this girl around the same age as me comes over with dumbbells and starts doing squats right in front of me facing the other direction  (with plenty of empty spaces elsewhere) and essentially blocking my view of the mirror. I'm just like whatever, I try to look past her to see if I can see myself in the mirror and manage to pull off a set before she turns around. She starts screaming at me and calling me a creep and that she noticed me staring at her in the mirror. A lot of people were watching so I tried to defend myself and explain the situation, plus I go to the gym to workout not stare at girls, and thankfully one of the trainers there who knew me well saw the whole thing and knew about my thing with mirrors and backed me up when I explained what happened. The girl didn't clearly believe me and said something along the lines of ""whatever creep"" and walked off. This pissed me off because well being called a creep and a pervert in front of a lot of people was really embarrassing, so I decided to get some payback. I went over to the hip abductor machine and started doing a set there, making sure I was staring at her the whole time. She saw me and I maintained eye contact and did two more sets while doing the same thing. She eventually left looking uncomfortable but I'm still kinda wondering, AITA here?"	Asshole	0	0

Anyway he gets off work and i call him right away to ask if hes getting them for me and he said ""i dont think so man, what happened to the dude who usually gets them for you, im exhausted i need some sleep im not going anywhere else tonight"" 

I was pretty pissed, he can sleep in cause he has the day off tommorow, and he knows the dude who usually gets me pods quit because my mom found out he bought them for me and yelled at him. 

So i ask him why and say thats a shitty excuse and he says ""the real reason is cause your phsyco fucking mom is gonna skin my black ass if she finds out i bought you that shit, and on top of that you arent very trustworthy and you ratted your last guy out, im not buying you anything bro, quit or find a new boot but im not gonna do it"" 

I was fucking pissed, first he has the audacity to talk shit about my mom, then he tries to tell me what to do with my life, and tells me to quit. I texted our groupchat calling him out for this amd everyone thought i was joking. I explained myself and they all said ""if anything your getting kicked out of the friend group, stop acting like an entitled prick"", one of them even said ""this is why i dont hang out with white dudes bruh"".

Our job as students was to disperse and find another group with our number. The point of this was to kind of break up clique-y groups and talk with new people. 

I was okay with this. Students started breaking up into groups, and I was having trouble finding a group. Eventually I was one of the last students left as a number 2. 

I walked up to another student who also was a number 2. At this point, all of the other students were pretty much grouped up. I told him I was a number 2 and smiled and sat down, ready to work together and get the assignment done. Instead of sitting down, he turned his back and proceeded to walk around the class and ask if there were any other number 2’s available, acting as if I was invisible. It was the most awkward interaction in the world. Other students told him I was there. 

He reluctantly started walking back towards me, deciding he wanted to work with me because there were no other options. I shook my head no, stood up and left the room. I went outside in the hallway and did the assignment completely by myself. I didn’t find another group to work with and I let him fend for himself. I don’t know how he got the assignment done or if he was forced to work with the wrong group. 

I feel bad because the teacher had wanted us to work together and I kinda missed the point of the assignment sitting in the hallway doing it by myself.

I physically turned in my resume and application to the cashier and called two days later to see if they were looking at applications yet. The call went to the manager and he said he just got off vacation and would soon look into it. I am totally fine with this and proceeded to wait 5 days until I called again. 

The second time was this afternoon when I called them again. They then took me to the manager again where I asked him if he got to the resumes yet. He then gets in a stern tone and proceeds to tell me that he is constantly moving and doesn’t have time to talk to someone who is “probably sitting down” as the call went on, and in the two times I called I could’ve physically went to the store to ask my questions. He goes on to say that in future interviews to psychically go to the company to ask a question.

All of this may be true, but he doesn’t realize why that is easier said than done. I am 16 but don’t have a driver’s license yet and my parents and brother are at work 8-6 so they can’t take me.

I apologized for being an inconvenience and said that whatever he said was not what I was implying. Another thing to keep in mind, I had an open interview at another company 2 hours later. I ended up acing the interview, but for a while after the call, it hurt.

My friend (lets call her B ) messaged me and asked if I wanted to hangout in the upcoming week (we originally became friends during our sophomore year of high school. She was 15 at the time, I was 16, now 21). Ever since she left 3 years ago we hang out every year when she comes back into to town to see family.   I messaged her back and we set up a time to meet. I told my girlfriend about this the day i got the message from B and she starts flipping out saying stuff like ""That's so weird"" Why is she hitting you up when you are in a relationship?"" ect.

&#x200B;

I honestly didn't see a problem with it because me and my friend B had never been romantically involved with each other in the slightest at any point in time and I was telling my girlfriend she had nothing to worry about and that it wasn't a big deal and generally trying to reassure her that she had nothing to worry about. She was irritated at this point and told me to be home before 9pm(usually the time her shift ends), no problem.

&#x200B;

So the next day my girlfriend goes to work and I go hangout with B. We do what we normally do. Walk around the mall, go window shopping ect then at the end we decide to get something to eat (its 8:30 at this point). So I drop her off at her parents then head back home around 8:40ish.

I got home around 9:05 and I guess my girlfriend got off work early or something but she was PISSED that I came home after the time she told me to be back by.

So I go out with this girl. We matched on tinder, and I knew of her from college, though we have only spoken once at a party. We meet at a bar, drink, talk, flirt a little, play some pool. As the date progresses, I get less interested with her in a romantic context, but I'm not sure. I end the night and get an Uber home.

The next week I do nothing. I'm not sure what I want to do next, so I idle. Eventually, I decide I just want to be friends, since she was fun to talk to. I tell her this, and she is not receptive AT ALL. 

First, she responds by saying she's feels ghosted, and ""not to be a crazy bitch"" but generally feels like shit about it, to which I say I did not mean to do so, I just wasn't sure what I wanted and needed to think. I said I didn't think she was crazy, her POV made sense, but that's not what I was doing.

To this she says I have demonstrated that I do not care for her as a person, and that I used the ""date"" as a cover to have someone to play pool with and drink. I respond that that isn't at all what I was feeling, that I simply had to think about what I wanted and that I had concluded I had changed my mind from my initial intent.

My problem lies in the fact that she sends SO MANY. Up to seven in the span of a few hours.

I guess it also kinda bothers me because everything I say to her I think of myself. And I try not to parrot love quotes at her.

"So we’ve had betta fish for the last 2 years because at one point we weren’t able to have a dog or cat but really wanted a pet. I’ve never liked fish but my dad suggested so I went along. I only wanted one but my dad insisted on 2. One would be his and one would be mine. After like 3 months mine got some type of eye fungus and died. I was starting to get tired of the fish so didn’t want another one but my dad instantly went and got another one. 
We now have a puppy that takes up a lot of time and attention and tbh the fish aren’t getting the attention they deserve. My dad is supposed to be the one who wanted the fish but he rarely ever cares for them and the dog so I have to end up doing everything. I’ve gotten really bored of the fish and really don’t want them anymore. So far we’ve had like 2-3 different fish die and I always tell him to stop buying more but he never listens. 
Today I was cleaning one of the betta’s tanks and genuinely innocently forgot to add the water conditioner into the water resulting in the fish dying. My dad is mad and I know he’ll want t go get another one right away. Is it bad for me to be sort of relieved the fish died and angry that my dad keeps buying more fish that he won’t care for?"		1	0

c52cl4	2019-06-25 04:21:11	Somethinunameit	Aita for choosing my dog over my sister?	"Two weeks ago,  I adopted a bait dog rescue.  (A bait dog is a dog used to train fighting dogs.) My new dog is not named Nat,  She is food aggressive and with the help of our other dog, she is getting better. 

On father's day, my brother and sister brought their dogs to my parents house where we had a bit of a scuffle resulting in Nat getting into a fight with my brother's dog.  

Week 2, Sunday,  my sister, her husband, and their dog, Fay, joined My boyfriend, our above mentioned dogs Nat and Alex, and myself all met at my parents house with their dogs Copper and [not important to the story]. Nat got a little out of hand with begging, causing Fay to assert her dom. Boyfriend and I broke it up before anyone got hurt, and scolded Nat, expecting Sister or brother in law to scold Fay. However,  Sister insisted that Fay was just ""showing Nat who is the top dog. "" this irritated me; after that point, Nat couldn't get with in 3 feet of Fay with out them growling at each other,  resulting in Nat being scolded and Fay getting apologetics. 

Time passed. Dad and boyfriend went to the garage, Brother in law started work on the computer, leaving mom, Sister and I with the dogs. Sister began passing out treats. I,  nervous about my food aggressive dog,  sit next to Nat to make sure I can pull her from a fight, however, after Sister was done,  she sets the bag treats ON THE FLOOR NEXT TO Nat and Copper.  Copper investigated the bag,  Nat got defensive and a fight breaks loose. I bear hug Nat and try to pull her to the ground,  but wasn't strong enough. The result was Sister screaming ""Leave it, "" before letting out a terrifying wail. When I looked up, Brither in law and mom were gotten in between Copper and Nat and I finally had the leverage to pull Nat to the ground and pinned her as she calmed. Sister was screaming bloody murder as she walked past us, saying ""get out,  get Nat the f- out of here!"" I waited since I was surrounded by the other dogs. Brother in law corralled the dogs for me and,  with his serial killer face,  told me to get Nat out of the house. I picked her up and carried her out to the truck and left her in the bed. 

The results of the fight were a small scrape on Nat's nose,  a small scrape under Copper's eye,  and several puncture wounds on Sister's hand.  She had gone to urgent care and nothing was severe. 

This morning,  however, when I arrived at work,  where my dad is my boss,  the first thing he said to me was ""you need to get rid of that dog."" I was heart broken to hear him say that. Boyfriend and I had talked about what to do with Nat,  but both of us think she will be put down if she goes back to the shelter,  and both of us love her,  despite not having her for so long.  Sister has tried to console me,  by showing me the not as serious as it first appeared wounds and tried to tell me that I'm not mature enough to deal with a dog aggressive dog. However, I disagree.  Boyfriend and I are already looking into dog agression rehab trainers, and we know not to keep f-ing treats on the damn floor. 

So, am I the asshole for keeping my dog despite the fact that she bit my sister? And am I the asshole for believing my sister caused her own injuries?

Edit since it keeps coming up in the comments: Every time I have brought her over to my parents house it has been to socialize her with the family dogs since we do a lot together.  Every time I come over,  I remind everyone she is food aggressive.  I do have a muzzle for her and it was off during the attack.  I don't blame my sister for starting the fight,  just her actions.

A little later on I noticed the girl had her phone out and when I walked over (from behind) I saw her screen was recording my kid, she stopped recording and put it away when I asked my daughter how she's going and what she was drawing - instantly I felt weird. I felt like she was violating my child's privacy by recording her.

I couldn't let it go and asked her into another room a little later on after consulting some friends for advice. I made her delete everything, there were about 8 or 9 images and videos of my child on a strangers phone.

When we got home I politely asked lead/open questions to my child, she revealed that this girl had followed her to the toilet. I know I should have kept close to her and am kicking myself for not being with her the whole time. I've learnt my lesson, but AITA for making the girl delete the content?

I still have an odd feeling about this person, the fact she took my kid to the bathroom freaks me the fuck out.

I realise that it is 2019 and times are changing with regard to photos and videos etc being so easy to take and share, I'm not sure if my concerns are valid given the time we live in and acted more out of fear and protection of my girls privacy as a non consented child.

Relevent info: This past week my stepdaughter and her friend went to Disneyland with stepdaughters mother and husband for 8th grade promotion gift, we also got her tickets to Petcon (yes, it is what you think it is) since both girls have Instagram pages for their beloved dogs. We cleared the petcon tickets with her mother in the middle of May just to be sure it wasn't conflicting with their Disney trip, we were told that it was perfect timing and that her and her husband with have a date day to enjoy Disney alone doing what they wanted instead of what the kids wanted.



While at Petcon (Saturday) the hubs asked if I would be ok with going to Universal Studios on Sunday, I have a funky growth on my foot that is very very painful if I'm on my feet & not wearing a pair of uggs, I told him I'll be fine, I have painkillers! But ask her mom if it is ok before you bring it up to kiddo cause this is their vacation. He asked but also invited them to go with us, we all get along so it isn't something that would be out of character. At first it was no big deal cause they were just driving home on Sunday we told her we'd of course pay for kiddo & kiddo friend since this was our idea. Then all of a sudden 2 hrs later it became an issue, she has to to x y z on Monday, she can't afford kiddos friend (we had at this point bought all 4 tickets) she has expensive stuff that can't be left in the car etc... 




According to her, we ruined her whole vacation, we made her cry at Disneyland (ya know the day she was spending it alone with her husband? We brought the kids back sooner so they could go to Disney at night with them) we make things so difficult for her, we never think of her feelings and she is always the low man on the totem pole, etc... 




Also as a side note: since all day Saturday was ""our day"" we had planned to take them to Midevil  Times for dinner but her mom said they'd rather come back and go to Disney with them. Come to find out from kiddo, her mom never asked if they wanted to go.

c52a9u	2019-06-25 04:15:59	ThunderThunt	AITA for Enforcing a Petty Rule?	"  

To be clear, I am not asking for advice. This situation is an in progress thing and I recognize that but have it under control. 

So backstory. I(24F) live at home. I am in college and work currently. About a year after we moved into this smaller house, I and my younger sister (currently 14) began sharing a room. A situation we both hate but put up with. As to why we share a room, well, sister was in middle school and made friends that invited her to hang out (genuine yay). One of said friends was having a birthday party and as with all events, our mom told her she needed to be on her best behavior in the weeks approaching the party and she would decide. Having been in that position, I can tell you that ""best behavior"" entitles doing your chores and homework. Usually if you pepper in some chill time with mom, she decides that you deserve the fun. 

Sister did none of that. She dropped the ball on chores, citing homework as the reason when she had none. In the end, mom said she couldn't go and Sister pouted. Day of party, she's still pouting. Mom and stepdad go to work, I'm left in charge and decided I'd leave her alone because missing out sucks. I decided to do her chores that day.Around lunch, I went to check on her and she wasn't in her room. She wasn't in the house at all. I panicked, threw on my shoes, told me brother (16 at the time) to lock the doors and I walked around the neighborhood looking for her. I also called my mom who called stepdad. 

I did not call police because of rooming situation (younger sibs all shared the room which is somewhat of a no with boys/girls but was never meant to be permanent and w/ runaways, they tend to open an investigation). Well stepdad found her, she claimed to be at the end of a street I walked on but I walked that path. She wasn't there. The resulting solution was that she and I would be roommates so that if she pulled another stunt like that, we could just call the police. 

Which brings us to now. Sister and I have clashed but that's expected. I recognize that the problem lies with both of us and am trying to change that on my end. 

The issue is a light I keep in the window. Its between our beds and is less disruptive than the ceiling fan light. I've gone in the room at night, in pitch dark and stumbled to the light to avoid waking sister up only to find out that its been unplugged for her to charge her phone. So I made the rule that it is not to be unplugged. Ever. And this is my current hill to die on. She unplugged it today to charge a tablet she wasn't using when our room has multiple plugs. I raised the issue in front of our mom who didn't understand the big deal then went to the room and moved the tablet to a different plug and plugged the light back in. Sister made a face when I broached it and then made the same face when I informed her I had moved her tablet to a different plug. 

So, reddit, AITA for letting this light be my hill to die on and enforcing the rule or is this me just being petty?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My parents, being the alternative medicine proponents they are (No seriously my dad wants to get me into acupuncture because he believes it will make me a calmer and better person), called me down to watch.

Me, being against alternative medicine, started trying to refute it by referencing a study on acupuncture vs simulated acupuncture, and the results were similar.

But they tried to shut me down and make me just listen.

Well I tried to refute (with my limited NPC knowledge, I'm dumb) the claims they were making, and my parents laughed at me and accused me of being naysayers and similar to flat earthers.

I'm offended. The alternative medicine movement is more similar to flat earthing than western medicine is. Seriously, what the fuck.

I then tried to say that I don't have to get acupuncture, I'm almost a legal adult and their trying to push their views on me like I'm 12, but my mom was like ""Oh my God OP quit with your fallacious and twisted logic!"" (Again, I'm stupid) I'm just offended they'd make fun of me like this.

Like it's somehow okay for them to impose their views on me, but when I (rightfully) try to shake it off, oh then it's not okay. Hypocrites.

So my boyfriend had a very, and I mean VERY extensive taste in music, so he flees from listening to some German metal to to rap in a second. He’s actually gotten me into a lot of things I never thought I’d listen to. That said, we like most of the same stuff, but obviously there are songs he doesn’t really like that I do.   
Then there are two songs that he specifically dislikes for some reason. Not my place to question why (although I’ve asked and he’s answered that he just doesn’t like them) so I don’t fight him about it.   
    
We sometimes like to just play music while we’re hanging out doing nothing to help us chill out a little and and of course every now and then, those songs play. I can see he’s not enjoying it, but he never says anything so I just let them play.   
  
That’s still just backstory. Here’s where it sort of becomes AITA.   
There are obviously songs that he likes that I don’t and when they come on, I’ll often ask him to skip and he does.   
Yesterday, we played three songs that we always play in order and then the rest of his songs started playing. After a while, one of the songs I don’t really like started to play so I asked if he could skip it. He turned off the music completely and told me to play mine. I asked what was wrong and he didn’t really blow up per se, but he seemed annoyed when he said that “it’s one thing to play songs you know I explicitly dislike, and it would be fine if I could listen to my songs, but I can’t. I don’t like that I have to sit there and listen to these songs because you feel some kind of way if I say something, yet you always tell me to skip songs I like.”   
I hadn’t really thought about that. I mean, yes, I know he dislikes the songs, but he lets me play them, so I didn’t feel bad, but when I think of how I feel when I ask him to skip, I can sort of see.   
  
I asked a couple friends and they said there was nothing wrong, so now I’m asking you.

c5280y	2019-06-25 04:11:00	Someallenguy	WIBTA for telling the neighbor's contractor not to use my contractor's portapotty?	"I'm getting some work done in my front and backyard and my contractor has a portapotty on our property. My neighbor is getting some work done in his basement and my Ring cam always catches him crossing my yard to use the portapotty. I know he's coming from the neighbor because I was coming back from work one day and saw him walk back into the neighbor's basement. 

&#x200B;

My contractor's guys know he's using the portapotty because they've shared pleasantries and when they're around, he goes around all of their materials. But, the neighbor's guy works on the weekends and when he does, he opts to go over the materials (rocks and paver base)  instead of around like he does during the week. I haven't been able to talk to the guy as of yet because it'd be creepy to say 'hey I just saw you come take a leak in my yard' and he's a really fast pee'er and after activating the live stream he's always walking back to the neighbor's property.

&#x200B;

For context, I'm a senior in Australia (different schooling systems) and I take design as one of my 4 subjects. Recently we had an exam and we got our results back individually the other day. I got a 12 out of 15 score, which I already thought was unfair because he didn't say I missed anything, just it was perfect, but I didn't get a perfect score. The top amount for marks was 4-5 points and I got 4 points for each of the 3 categories and when prompt he said nothing and sent me away.

&#x200B;

Anyway, yesterday I was chilling in class and my friend who also takes design asked me what score I got on the exam. Rather proudly I told him I got a 12 out of 15 and that means I got a B+ (not a bad score as I'm usually a B+ - B- kinda gal) and he looked at me confused. He explained that one of his friends (we'll call him Sam) got the same score but he's getting an A-.

&#x200B;

I remained cool and cracked jokes like ""wow he's a fucking sexist"" kind of thing. However, I am furious. I'm waiting for the report cards to be sent out and once they are I'm going to check my grade and ask Sam about his (we're all very open about our grade's and Sam is a relatively close friend of mine who won't mind) and if the grade doesn't match would I be in the wrong to try and get him fired?

&#x200B;

I was called after Sam and the teachers already have an idea as to what score goes with what grade. This wasn't an ""honest"" mistake.

I would also like another teacher to look at my exam papers because they were well set out and the fact I didn't get the highest rating despite being told nothing negative was unbelievable to me.

c526ff	2019-06-25 04:07:21	DiamondMillerrr	WIBTA if I date my ex's brother?	"Very long story short, I was married to ""Robert"" for almost a decade. We got married very young, I was 21, and I just wasn't ready for marriage. I hadn't seen the world, was working a dead end job, zero life or relationship experience outside of him, just a small town girl who fell into the ""get married young"" life script.

In the time that we were together, I went to college which he paid for with his money from his job (trucking). He spent about $20K on my 3 years of school. I got my associates and passed the NCLEX and started as an RN. With the money from my job, I gave him $30K a few years later that he could use as the down payment for his own commercial truck. I gave him a little bit more than he gave me because I was only working part-time while I was in school and he was paying most of the bills. Other than that, we've kept our finances separate and paid for things 50/50.

Like an absolute freaking idiot and terrible person, I had an affair with a supervisor. It's one of my biggest regrets. I'm not gonna blame it on anything, it was my fault and it breaks my heart to know I broke such a good man. Robert was devastated when he found out and to this day, it's been two years since our divorce, he's still a different person than he was before.

I've stayed close with his parents and siblings because we've known each other for 15+ years and have always gotten along. Robert is still friendly with my brother and parents as well but we don't talk to each other. 

Robert's brother, Chris, and I have always been really friendly. He lived outside of our hometown for the past few years but moved back recently and has always been great to me. I think because he didn't live here when the divorce went down, he doesn't hold it against me at all. He's told me that he somewhat understands where I was coming from because Robert can be emotionally distant but overall he's been honest to say that I shouldn't have done what I did. I agree with him.

Chris & I have a lot in common and have been hanging out a lot recently. He said to me point blank: ""listen, my family will be mad if you and I get involved but I'm willing to take the heat if you're willing to take this thing serious"" and I honestly am. He's a really great guy, but the problem is I don't want to hurt Robert anymore than I have. He's dating again and seems happier, but I'm still not sure. Would I be the asshole if I dated Chris? He and Robert aren't that close btw due to age &personality difference."	Asshole	0	0

He's been a great help, cleaning up the backyard, doing chores, even plays with our son while I cook dinner and clean. He's practically a live-in Uncle. He also has motivated my hubby to work out and diet, and since I am the one who cooks most meals (99%), I'm basically following too. Even though I hate the food.

It was a big change to bring him on the lease, and our landlady was gracious enough to sign him on. Unrelated to his moving in, our landlady has also agreed to fund a new gate for the backyard after ours collapsed. It's a good $200, and to me that's huge. Also, again, I hate the diet, but I'm too lazy to cook 2 meals.

Anyway, today, I come home and he's brought home a new dog. Cute baby, 6mo, she will be around 30lb full grown. He'd mentioned wanting a companion a few times, and I piped in with my wanting to wait until current projects - yard, gate, and next month's rent - to bring another change to the household and lease. He's gonna pay the deposit for her, but technically it should have been done before getting her, and he didn't officially ask me or our landlady about it. Just picked her up, bought her her collar and some stuff, and I came home to ""come here, Puppy!""

I have not expressed any emotion yet, because I don't want to stir up any conflict, but I am very upset that he didn't ask, and didn't wait. Am I the asshole for feeling angry at him for moving at such a fast rate? I don't like change, and there's a LOT of it going on, and I'm anxious.

c524rv	2019-06-25 04:03:42	CassiopeiaFoon	AITA with the way I correct people on my gender identity?	"So, I'm a transman, and pre-op. Because of this I give people a little leeway with my pronouns. If they've never met me and I'm not going to see them often, I don't bother, but if it's a group I'm going to see often, I tend to correct people.

&#x200B;

Saturday I had a craft meet at my place, it was an open invite to a local community, with the only stipulation being that you had to private message me for info, and so that I could know you a bit before you come. Every person coming was reminded politely of my pronouns (IE: Hey, just so you know, I am trans and prefer he/him pronouns). Most people coming I already knew, and they're used to how I identify. A few new people had some problems, but most quickly corrected themselves, to which I said ""Hey, no problem, it happens"". But once in a while someone would say the wrong pronoun, and not figure it out, so I'd just say ""He"" when they said ""She"" and they'd change their sentence and go on their way, or pause and apologize. I don't think I said it impolitely, I remained passive and didn't scream over them, nor did I make a big deal of it. However, I'm stuck wondering if this is something I should do, or if there's another way to do it. Should I be taking them aside at the end of the night, or letting it slide? These people expressed they want to keep coming back, and pursue a friendship, so I kinda feel like if were going to be seeing each other often, I have the right to be comfortable with my pronouns around them?

I never want to be ""that violent trans guy"". I try to be passive about myself, and forgive misgendering. However I'm unsure about how some cisgender people feel about being corrected, is it rude of me? None of them were transphobic and insisted I was a girl, it was nothing like that. But they did forget, mostly due to the fact that I'm preop, and have a high voice.

I mostly just want to have the best relationship with people that I can, so I essentially want to know if the way I go about it is assholish, and if there's a better way out there to do it.

EDIT TO CLARIFY: Sorry, I realize after some comments I misworded some things. I did not jump in with ""HE"" every time someone said SHE. I waited for them to be comfortable, express wanting to come back, acknowledge my identity, and attempt to use ""he"" consistently. THEN when they slipped I'd wait for a pause and go ""oh, he"" and they'd correct themselves and move on. I was not looking for an apology or anything of the sort, but they were genuinely trying and I thought it'd be helpful."	No A-holes here	0	0

I currently have the iPhone 6 and it works *okay*. Like, it always resets itself and for some reason I can't FaceTime. I asked my parents if I could upgrade for my birthday, they said let's wait till your report card comes. My report card came today. I had a 4.00 GPA, so excitedly asked my parents if I was going to get a new phone. Their reply? 'We expect A's from you, you shouldn't be treated for it.' I got disappointed because my brother (14, almost 15) got AirPods the week prior and a completely new, expensive desktop. I asked my parents why he got that stuff. ""He got all A's"" was their reply. Of course I ask why he gets what he wants if he gets good grades and they said its because he's older than me and high school is harder.

I guess my parents had fair points, it's just that I don't know why they don't want me to have a new phone. It's somewhat frustrating because it isn't a money issue as far as I know, I get good grades, honor roll and do my chores. I'll put away the dishes without being asked, vacuum the house and simple stuff like that. In all fairness, I'm can be annoying at times and I try not to be, but I don't think I'm ever that terrible. I went to my room upset and crying, so my parents lectured me and said I was being a 'brat' and acting like a spoiled kid. Am I in the wrong here?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Not sure if it makes me any less of a spoiled brat, but I was asking for the 6s to be able to FaceTime.

EDIT: I was the asshole WAYY more than anything. My parents surprised me with an XR for my birthday and turns out, they were trying to keep it secret."	Asshole	0	0
