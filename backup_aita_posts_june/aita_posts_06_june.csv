bxq5tm	2019-06-07 03:59:19	newbie_lurker	AITA for trying to make friends with an angry dog?	On my runs over the past week or two I kept encountering a woman with a baby in a carrier struggling to walk two dogs, one of whom would inevitably flip out at me and start barking as I jogged past.  One of the dogs looked like my neighbor‚Äôs dog, and it seemed like the kind of crazy thing someone would only do if they were getting paid and needed the money, so I felt bad for her.  This led me to think, maybe there is something I could do to make this situation no longer so much of an issue‚Äîand the next thing I know, I am asking her if it is all right to say hi to her dog, despite the fact that it is barking madly at me.  I guess I imagined that it would simply sniff me and calm down, but instead it just bit me right on the knee and continued barking.  She said it had never bit anyone as I backed away and when I asked her whose dog it was, she said it was hers, which shocked me even more‚Äîshe wasn‚Äôt a struggling dog-walker at all, just a new mom making a really stupid choice, repeatedly.  Although, my own decision-making was pretty questionable as well in retrospect... so who was more in the wrong here?	Asshole	0	0
bxq5fg	2019-06-07 03:58:09		AITA for not giving back a friend their cards against humanity game?	So I used to live in a house with some roommates that ended up being the house all our friends hung out at. It got to the point where people kept leaving shit over at the house and I got sick of it so I made a rule.  ‚ÄòIf you leave something at the house for more than a month it is now property of the house.‚Äô  Well as you can probably guess someone left cards against humanity at the house....FOR A YEAR!  We played that shit all the time and I just got used to having it around. So a year goes by and when he eventually asked for it back I simply said, ‚Äòno you cannot.‚Äô  He didn‚Äôt overly protest or anything but he did seem surprised that I wouldn‚Äôt give it back. It‚Äôs been many years since this happened but I‚Äôve always thought he‚Äôs been bitter about it ever since.  So...AITA??		1	0
bxq4yn	2019-06-07 03:56:31	Sirjoshd109	AITA For jokingly bribing someone to smash another person's cell phone?	"I have a neighbor who uses the app tiktok. I don't care about the app just the fact that it involves singing and that she uses it outside at 12:00 am and wakes everyone up. Me and many others have tried to ask her nicely not to do this but still she persists with responses like ""I can't sleep"" so earlier today I nudged her roommates arm and the conversation went like this:


Me: Wanna make 20 bucks?


RM: Sure, what's the catch?


Me: Break tiktok girl's phone, if it refuses to turn on i'll give you the money.


RM: *Laughs* Hell yeah, tiktok girl you in trouble now!

bxq3iw	2019-06-07 03:52:08	mynicknameiskitty	AITA? Am I being superficial or looking out for my future?	My ex and I officially broke up about 2 weeks ago and I feel guilty for feeling relieved and in peace about it. I love him with all my heart but he was emotionally weighing on me. He required so much affection and verbal confirmation that he was the love of my life. To the day I still believe he is but i think he needs self growth. I tried for a long time to help him with it but I realized it‚Äôs not something I can fix. Only he can. We are both in our early 20s he‚Äôs two years older than me. He holds so much potential and is the smartest man I know. He could do anything he put his mind to but that‚Äôs the problem. He hasn‚Äôt and hesitates in his future. I want someone who wants to grow now. Who wants to make something of them self‚Äôs now. I don‚Äôt feel like waiting until he figures himself out. I work a lot and go to school and have a mortgage and bills to pay and other responsibilities to attend vs him living in a household with his mother and paying at most the light bill. I see my other friends with great jobs at his age traveling and living life with their significant others. I want that. I can give that to my own self but I always feel afraid and hold back bc I don‚Äôt want to destroy his ego as a man. I can afford trips for the both of us and other things but i don‚Äôt want to make him upset. It‚Äôs happened before and he just ends up feeling like shit and I have to be the one to make him feel better about it. I didn‚Äôt mind making him feel batter about it but it‚Äôs gotten repetitive and i feel like he‚Äôs not doing anything about it to fix that. I love him but I feel like I deserve more.

bxpzx7	2019-06-07 03:40:45	yorik_J	AITA if I don't want to spot my friend for his computer charger?	"A little background, my friend grew up with a verbally and emotionally abusive father. He was kicked out of his house at 18. He got involved with some crime but luckily he met the right people at the right time and does media and mural contracting for money. It's not a guarantee for cash.

A few months ago he called me asking for $450 to pay for his car being towed. I was a bit hesitant and lectured him agrily but a mutual friend and I helped pay it. 

A month ago he called asking for money for gas and I gave him $50, feeling a bit regretful about my previous attitude. 

Last week he asked me for a place to stay and would pay $400 for a month of rent. When I accepted, he told me he couldn't actually pay me until 3 weeks later.

Two days ago he asked me to help pay for his gas again because he lost his wallet. 

Just now, he called me again to help pay for his computer charger which he needs for his work. 

AITA for yelling at him and saying no? I feel like he's taking advantage of my kindness yet I empathize with his hardships. I've talked to him seriously and jokingly about his behavior but every day there seems to be another case where he needs money from me."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxpyv5	2019-06-07 03:37:36		AITA for swearing at my dad because he asked me to turn the volume on the TV down?	"I was watching game 5 of the Stanley cup finals and I often watch sports in the living room TV since I've got no cable in my room. Anyways, my sister decides to go off to bed at around 10:30 PM and it's still the 3rd period so I put the volume down a bit to not wake her up. 

My dad comes home around five minutes later from work and gets dressed, warms up some food etc. He eventually comes into the living room to relax. By this point, the game comes to a conclusion so I put the volume down a bit but not fully since I wanna listen to player interviews. Keep in mind the volume is already at a very low level and can barely be heard.

My dad abruptly tells me to put the volume down because his head hurts, in a pretty demanding voice but the volume was low enough so I decided to ignore him. Immediately he raises his voice and tells me to put the volume down or else to which I proceed by raising my own voice and dropping an F bomb in the process. 

He gets up and attempts to yank the remote from my hands but I manage to hold on. He gets up and starts yelling at me for swearing and disrespecting him and I retaliate by telling him to go fuck himself pretty loudly. I eventually walk back to my room with adrenaline pumping through my body, I listen to some music to calm myself down.

I'm pretty sure he's called the police and is waiting for them to come resolve whatever this even is lol."		1	0
bxpyiz	2019-06-07 03:36:38		AITA for reporting my sister's boyfriend to the DEA?	"So someone i know has been dating some guy named Carlos who i've never really liked. I never really liked this guy i feel like he treated her like shit but my sister was so madly in love with him. I've seen her bruised and I'm 99% sure he did it but she denied it. She would grope her in public and say really obscene things so i didn't like him for the way he treated women. More importantly this guy was a drug dealer, he mostly just did weed and opioids but did crack a few times or so I've heard. Ive only seen him smoke/deal weed. He was pretty open about it too talking about smoking weed on social media and weed is not legal in my state. I'm sick of this guys shit, him clogging the toilet at my house, him smoking weed in my neighborhood and him doing drugs too. I made an anonymous tip to the DEA about him and apparently they actually were suspicious of this guy so they raided his house. Honestly idk the details but i know shortly afterwards he got arrested and deported because he was here illegally. His family and friends also got deported too who were at his house. 

She has been fucking pissed she blamed me for the whole ordeal, i told her that it wasn't me nobody knows for certain that its me but nonetheless she says I'm an asshole for reporting him and that i should've considered him and his family' immigration statuses before reporting them. She said i ruined his future and his family's futures by reporting him. I told her i don't care because he shouldn't have been dealing drugs nor should his family have been here illegally to begin with. She eventually was convinced that it wasn't me. I thought this guy might be an illegal cuz he never got a drivers license or a lot of other documentation for some activities she wanted to do with him but i didn't know for certainty and this never really came across my mind as a result."		1	0
bxpxku	2019-06-07 03:33:32	tminus1051	AITA for being furious at my wife not checking on a potential fire	"We live in a small 2bdrm apartment. Our 2 yr old daughters bedroom is at the end with our living room on the other end. 

We put her to sleep and I was in the bathroom (next to her bedroom). I come out 10mins later and immediately smell smoke. The air is thick with it. 
I yell hey do you smell smoke? 
My wife is in the kitchen doing some homework with her headphones in. She gets up right away Bc her phone goes off. 

I yell with more urgency ‚ÄúHELLO DO YOU SEE SMOKE.‚Äù She immediately gets defensive and says ‚ÄúI had my headphones in and I didn‚Äôt hear you. My phone just rang so I went to get it‚Äù

She has this pattern of behavior with her where she has zero accountability for anything but that‚Äôs really not the point here. I only bring it up Bc it has gotten to a point where literally nothing is her fault. We argue and whenever I ask please tell me the last time something was your fault and she usually goes off saying something like I‚Äôm done w this or I lm not repeating myself or etc to deflect. 

Anyway, again I repeat ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying do you see smoke in her room?!? CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK‚Äù Now to be upfront, I am panicking a bit here and definitely was yelling. It was not civil or nice the way I said it. 

I have issues w my contacts and sometimes things look foggy so I needed confirmation. I smelled smoke and saw it but also having my wife there to confirm would have made a huge difference if we were gonna move our daughter out of the room (and give up the precious sleep we expected). 

She tells me to stop yelling at her and that it wasn‚Äôt her fault for not hearing me. Now I‚Äôm incredibly agitated and yell at her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about what your talking about like at all. Please just go check to see if there‚Äôs smoke‚Äù again, full disclosure, I yelled this at her. 
There‚Äôs smoke near my daughters room And I‚Äôm asking for help. 

She looks at me and says well what do you want me to do about it. Puts her earphones back in and continues her homework. 

I‚Äôm pretty shocked at the lack of care. It turned out to be nothing - smoke from a neighbor burning the dinner but her room was filled with obvious haze that anyone could see. I took her out and let her sleep in our bed. Wife meantime hasn‚Äôt gotten up once from her spot. 

I considered if the smoke was from her( maybe she burned something) but there was no smell or smoke in the kitchen just all in or daughters room. 

I am furious w her right now and seriously contemplating leaving her. 
She‚Äôs always had a lack of accountability but in a potential emergency situation, for her to act like that?! 


AITA here?

Every day at my lunch table, my friend and her boyfriend get really touchy. They grab, kiss, and do pretty much whatever is allowed (and what is sometimes not allowed) at a High School. They‚Äôll even like, bite each other‚Äôs hands when it‚Äôs balled into a fist, or just each other‚Äôs wrists. 

Honestly, I don‚Äôt really know much about healthy couples like these (my parents used to, and still do fight a lot), so is this just what normal couples do?

I have this thing where I really really hate being touched by just about everyone, I‚Äôm just really personal space conscious, and I guess it sort of extends to seeing other people touching each other as well. It gives me goosebumps, and makes my stomach churn, to the point where I‚Äôve lost my appetite.

Am I being immature by feeling uncomfortable about this? I get that I‚Äôm kind of considered a ‚Äúyoung adult‚Äù, but still, it just makes me extremely uncomfortable.

In a few weeks I'm going to be moving in with my fiancee in a new city (where she lives currently), and I'm in the process of looking for a new job in that city. My fiancee had asked for my resume so she could send it to a co-worker whose husband works in a related field there. Since then she's also sent the resume to two other people she knows other than the one she had originally asked about. I told her I was upset that she had sent this to other people without my knowing about it, but I know she's just trying to help me get employed. Am I being an asshole control freak here for wanting control over where my resume gets sent, since she is just trying to help, or do I have a legitimate gripe?

bxpooc	2019-06-07 03:07:26	doctorwhofan-	AITA for not wanting gifts for my wedding	"My partner and I are getting married in January and have been running into some difficulties with our mothers. They both have very traditional views on weddings in general while my partner and I really don‚Äôt care about tradition and want to have a good time ( we also haven‚Äôt really followed many traditions - we live together and have for years).

We both feel that our mothers have been somewhat overbearing in the wedding planning process. For example, they got a wedding planner without consulting us and essentially chose the location. It is important to mention here that they are not contributing financially ( they have offered, but we want to fund our wedding independently). 

The most recent issue we have run into is that they‚Äôre very insistent that we create a wedding registry for both the bridal shower and wedding itself. We don‚Äôt want gifts for a few reasons:

1. A lot of our friends are students, and we don‚Äôt want them to pay for gifts on top of paying to come to our destination wedding.

2. We don‚Äôt want any of the traditional wedding gifts (kitchenware etc...) as we already live together and have everything we need. We don‚Äôt have more space for any other items. 

In an attempt to reach a compromise, we created a gift registry with mostly experiences (e.g. a cooking class, paint night) and have asked that this be shared with family only, no friends. 

We just told one of the mothers ( my partners) and she got angry, saying that she only asked one thing and we can‚Äôt even do that the way she asked. She wants everyone at the shower to bring a physical gift that I can open at an ‚Äúunwrapping‚Äù. I asked for letters instead, with any advice or well wishes, but this was not received well. We are made out to be very ungrateful- who doesn‚Äôt want free gifts???

AITA for not going along with what our moms want? Agreeing would be so much easier for keeping the peace, but I absolutely do not want my friends spending any more money on this event.

TLDR: My mother and my partner‚Äôs mother are very upset that we do not want physical gifts for our wedding and think we should make the registry even though we do not want the gifts and do not want to burden our friends."	Not the A-hole	0	0

" There was a tragic overdose in a small group of people I sometimes hang out with. I'm decently close with some of them, but mostly I'm busy trying to rebuild my life after all of my issues, so don't see them as often anymore. 
 A couple of weeks ago, the best friend of one of our group overdosed in a tragic way that ruined a lot of peoples' lives (children, ailing mother). Needless to say, the best friend is devastated, but they still use. Sometimes they will get clean for a little bit, but they always go back to using. 
 I am offering kind words at the moment, but I'm not sure if I should say: ""please use this as strength for your own sobriety."" 
 Is that disrespectful to the deceased? Is it insensitive to the feelings of the best friend? WIBTA?

Update: I sent the text, and it was heartfelt and honest, and they said there was already that feeling there, and they planned to act on it. They were very thankful. Thank you, reddit.

Update 2: I have plans with this person to meet on Saturday. I will introduce/discuss treatment options and help where I can. I don't have a lot of funds, but there has to be something out there if one wants it bad enough. Its heartbreaking to read about how many people are affected by this.

Update 3: I was stood up. No returns to calls or texts. I can't get involved in this. I have too much going on in my life to dedicate a lot of time to this crusade. I tried to block out some time for this person, to focus on them and be there as a friend in support and strength, but they left me hanging. I hope everyone turns out okay. I feel let down, disappointed that my efforts led to status quo. Perhaps I could have contributed to their success moving forward. I will pray for them, but I cannot risk more heartbreak.

bxpm5x	2019-06-07 03:00:26		AITA for telling off this parent?	"I'm a psych/med tech at a long term juvenile psych hospital. We had a new admit lately to the unit I was working in at this time, and this kid had parents. The population I work is almost exclusively in social services custody, but this is a case where social services had administrative custody but the mother had residential custody (until the admit).

We were doing a care planning meeting with this mom. The mom has had 4 babies removed from her care at birth as well as the teenager we are working with partially removed. She went on a shpeel about how she misses them but doesn't see them, and mentioned how the courts have ordered social services to remove any new children, she's pregnant, and planning to disappear to keep her child. 

We're a facility that's mandated to work with and apart of social services. That's going to be reported regardless of my input, and the reporting procedure is usually not to tell her. She was really getting to irritate me, and I told her off. 

I told her how we're going to report her to social services, and pretty thoroughly told her the truth about her shittiness. I told her apart of getting her life in order was needing to use contraception. Contraception is free of cost here, easy to access, not really an excuse for her not to use it, but her excuse is contraception is murder. 

I end up leaving the room out of frustration with this idiot, and later the physician who was in the room pulled me aside. She told me how that was inappropriate, how since I'm a male I have no right to comment on a womans body, how I'm cruel, an asshole, how the contraception conversation isn't my job (even though I'm qualified for it), etc. I told the physician to fuck off. She reported me to my supervisor, who just briefly scolded me & sent me home for the day. 

In my position, I feel like I'm perfectly warranted in all of it, including the contraception conversation. I feel like everybody is being sensitive toward the wrong people. 

Also, just to note...

‚Ä¢ I think it was probably not the best way to go about it, but I don't think it was crazily inappropriate compared to the inappropriateness of putting children through unnecessary suffering. 

‚Ä¢ The comment from the physician about how it's not my job as a man to comment on birth control is ridiculous. I'm qualified in that area. A large part of my certification is pharmacology, I worked in a jail as a psych/med tech for a long time where 30% of my job was contraceptives counseling to female inmates.

In this hospital, the unit I've most frequently worked in is the youth sex offenders unit. It's still well within my scope of practice (also something I have to do frequently) to counsel female patients on contraception, recommend best contraceptive options to the physician, and give whatever is ordered by the physician. 

‚Ä¢ That physician is radically feminist, hates men, and has been disciplined for targeting & undermining male coworkers."		1	0

I tried my hardest to get there and I did everything I could but I couldn't make enough money for the plane ticket (I'm 23 by the way if that is relevant here, I also just graduated so I'm really broke). I tried to ask work for an advance on my paycheck, I tried to take out a loan at a bank and one of those check cashing places, I sold my ps4 to Gamestop, I even sold the tickets to my graduation ceremony at a discount to people with bigger families than mine but at the end I ended up being about $150 short of the price of the plane ticket. I also didn't walk the stage because my ceremony was on Thursday of that week and I was running around trying to get any amount of money I could. Nobody in my family wanted/was able to loan me the money.   


 I feel like shit and some of my family (with the exception of my mom) have started taking shots at me and saying it was really disrespectful of me to not be there as I was her only Grandkid. They've also started insinuating that maybe my grandma didn't mean as much to me as they thought if I couldn't even take the time to be there. It feels like a knife in my gut whenever I talk to them because I would have killed someone to be there but...I'm just broke and nobody could/wanted to help me get out there...

bxpikz	2019-06-07 02:49:51	adatlorxy	AITA for dipping out on my friend's lease midway?	"Info: 

I (27F) had a falling out with my boyfriend. Had to move out ASAP. My friend of 10 yrs (24F), ""Holly,"" offered to help. I was short on cash, but she landed a *great* job. She assured me all would be fine.

Upon moving I learned she lived in a sublet. Second, that subleasing was not even allowed in the complex. Third, she had no deposit money or arrangements to lease. She'd never even signed a lease before. Thankfully her salary afforded, with my contribution, the deposit.

We agreed she should sign solo. Due to my low income, felony and eviction, we thought it would be lower risk. She made far more than the rent requirement and was approved.

I knew Holly was hospitalized for mental illness a few times, but not to what extent. She said it was bipolar and psychosis and was on 6 different meds.

First week she came home asking if I smell blood. ""I'm 'free bleeding' at work this cycle,"" she said. The whole front/back of her dress was matted with dry blood. She didn't care or seem to notice. Mind this was a high profile analytics job, a contractor with Century Link. Almost six figures.

Erratic behaviors included practicing violin for 5+ hours (she doesn't know how to play), frivolous spending. Rotten food everywhere. Oversharing with guests. New soulmate each month. New religion every week. Defecating with BR door open multiple times a day, right outside my door. I asked her to stop 30 times, never did.

She lost her job in 6 weeks. I urged her to file for unemployment ASAP. Nope. She went to her boyfriend's for 2 weeks.

Now she asks me to sign the lease, I decline. Didn't feel right as she was unemployed/not looking for jobs. Her parents paid the next 2 mos of rent.

This was a bad place. Bus commute took 2 hrs (30 min drive). No busses on weekends, food desert, no laundry. Just a t.v. and a chair in the apt. In 4 months we never vacuumed.

I took the first opportunity to leave. The location was great and $200 cheaper. In the end her parents broke the lease for her. I don't regret my decision, but I lost a lot of friends over this. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxpgyr	2019-06-07 02:45:23	Sylverpsyche	AITA for telling my mom the reason I‚Äôm in therapy is partially because of her?	"Some background (sparknotes version) my mom is lesbian and we lived with her first girlfriend for 11 years. During that time, my mom‚Äôs GF was verbally and physically abusive to me. My mom knew about the treatment and did nothing to stop the behavior. Additionally, she‚Äôs an alcoholic. 

On to the real story. For the reason above, I have a strained relationship with my mom that I keep at a distance and can only handle her in doses. I call her or she calls me once every couple of weeks to check in and see how each other are doing. She called me the other day and I told her that I was scheduled to see a therapist. My intent wasn‚Äôt to make her feel bad, it was purely to just let her know what was going on. She proceeds to ask me if I‚Äôm going because of her. I said yes but it wasn‚Äôt all about her. She started to cry which then made me feel bad, but in all of this it isn‚Äôt about her. It‚Äôs about me dealing with the issues and the angst I feel inside. She proceeded to cry and say she did the best she could and feels bad for putting me through everything. I didn‚Äôt really know what to say and simply told her that I needed this to me about me and not her and she continued talking about ‚Äúme me me‚Äù. So I ended up cutting her off and telling her I‚Äôd talk to her later. Lay it on me, AITA here?"	No A-holes here	0	0

&#x200B;

Monica and I have been friends since 8th grade. We've always been close, but always had that competitive friendship too. She would constantly compare hobbies with me, skill levels with me, grades, pay, etc. Out of college, I opened several successful businesses which I still run and manage to this day. She's always wanted to start her own business too but always jumped from project to project, never really sticking to one.

&#x200B;

Then, my business partner and I announced our new venture-- clothing. Monica saw this and told me she wanted to start her own clothing line too. I told her she had my full support and that I'd always be there for her if she needed advice.

&#x200B;

Last week, she asked if our brands could collaborate in July. I told her that I wanted them to establish themselves first and that we could talk about it once they were more established. She never replied and hasn't talked to me since. We normally talk every day.

bxpblv	2019-06-07 02:29:45	scaredoftheirlove	AITA for following my [42M] wife [27F] around for an evening?	"  

The title sounds extreme but here are the details. My wife and I have been together for 5 years. I love her so much that it pains me to write this. The thing is, I was the sole earner for a while and I was happy to provide (I am a software developer at a local startup that has tripled in employees and gone exponential in revenue). We're not having kids, so my wife got bored of being home and doing nothing. So she got a job at a law firm as a paralegal. 

Enter this attorney, who I'll call Brandon. My wife started to bring him up quite a bit. You know when your wife starts talking about something, drops it, and then brings it up again a few minutes or hours later like there was no gap? My wife does that with stories about him. I searched through her Facebook friends list one day for ""Brandon"" and saw that they had connected. Okay... Then my wife starts going to work happy hours and I'm seeing pictures of the guy on her timeline. In most of the pictures she is positioned next to him, holding a drink. Okay...

I have gained considerable weight since joining the startup. There is free food provided to us nearly every day. My wife has maintained a really low weight and looks as beautiful as she did at 22. Brandon is more like how I used to be weight wise. However, I believe I make more money than he does.

So here it goes... I take off work on Friday, as my team is nearing the end of our project. I wait for my wife to leave the firm and I see her walking out with Brandon. They get in my wife's car, purchased on my dime, and I follow them for a bit. They go to a local dive bar and it turns out all of her coworkers are there - I see them entering. I wait for hours and everyone eventually leaves. My wife leaves last with Brandon and she takes him home. I don't see any physical contact as he exits the vehicle to go inside his apartment building.

At this point, I'm sick. I'm gutted. I wait at home for my wife and confront her about Brandon. She went insane basically, threatening to end the marriage because I stalked her. She told me she is always the DD for happy hour because she doesn't drink much (which is true), but she didn't address my greater concerns. AITA?

So here‚Äôs the deal: my husband planned a three week vacation for the two of us in Switzerland. Meanwhile, my sweet pup of thirteen years is really beginning to show her age. I am very concerned about leaving her for three weeks at this point. I did previously tell my husband that I would not be able to leave the country if she began to show signs of health problems. Not everything we have booked is 100% refundable so we would definitely lose some money.  I have set an appointment with her veterinarian to do a full work up of her health and get a better feel for what‚Äôs going on. I'm worried that we won't be there for our dog when she needs us the most. He's concerned about the lost money and the loss of our quality time together.

" Backstory- my mother 72, she was 30 when she lost her hearing in her right ear and 3 years ago she lost hearing in her left. She had two Cochlear implants, implanted into her head but she didn't regain very much hearing back.

 I'm an optimist and a very out-of-the-box thinker and pretty resourceful. When she went deaf, I used my tablet to voice to text anything I had to say to her. I turned the captioning on the TVs and been a Middleman with her phone calls. For example: you call her I answer the phone you tell me what to say I write it down on my tablet she reads it and then she speaks in the phone. I did the Middleman phone calls until she got to TTY phone a closed captioning phone. Thank God!

 here's the problem: there are so many resources that she could be using to better her situation, yet she refuses to use any of them. 

For example- a cell phone! There's text messaging.

ASL- American Sign Language I know the basics and there's free classes. 

Audiology therapy

Not that I'm religious but this always comes to mind God helps those who help themselves

So I told her tonight I am done listening to the pity party the displaced anger and aggression towards me but I do not want to hear a single thing about her deafness Cochlear implants or anything to do with that situation. Unless it's to better herself!"	No A-holes here	0	0

bxp3kd	2019-06-07 02:06:14	adjectived	AITA Don't want to be given a tour of roommates garden every few weeks	"My (26M) roommate (25F) has a small purely potted garden on the side of our house (mostly vegetables and a few flower pots). I don't care very much about plants but appreciate and try to respect that she cares about them and that it makes her happy watching them grow and taking care of them.

&#x200B;

The only problem is that every few weeks she wants to take me on a little tour of the plants and show them off. Now I know that this really isn't that big of a deal or an inconvenience, and I've let her show me the plants and tried to be attentive and interested before, but I really just don't care very much and find it quite boring. I'd be fine checking in on the plants every month or two, but I really don't need to see them every week. I've been a little vocal about this and I don't think in that rude of a  way, just expressing that I'm not too crazy about plants particularly not half grown non fruiting vegetable plants. But she just keeps asking me to come and look at the garden.

&#x200B;

Recently we were both outside of the house and she asked me again to come and take a look at her plants because they're right around the other side of the house. Maybe this caught me in a bad mood or I felt I had been asked a few too many times but I snapped at her saying something along the lines of ""Sure \[roommate\], but once again I'm not interested at all, and you're doing this for 100% selfish reasons."" So the snapping is definitely a bit assholey, but I still feel like I'm relatively in the right. She knows I don't want to see her plants and is asking me just because she enjoys showing to people and it makes her feel good, I know she's not the asshole in any way but I don't think I should feel compelled to go look at the garden and that she should understand this and not ask me so often.

&#x200B;

So I know that it would definitely be a nicer move to just humor her and go look at the plants, but I'm not sure if I should actually be compelled to or if its inherently an asshole move to not want to go look at them and be a little irritated that she constantly asks me to.

&#x200B;

Edit: We are quite close, she's my other roommate's girlfriend. I feel like we would not be friends if we just encountered each other randomly out in the world but we've grown quite close since we've lived together for two years. We are incredibly different people and butt heads fairly frequently but always resolve the things at some point. This isn't causing any major rift between us but just curious what internet people thought of this."	Asshole	0	0

&#x200B;

OK. So this is gonna be pretty long, but I used to party quite a lot and get very drunk. There was one time I wore fishnets, a skirt and tshirt and this was really cool for me since I'm a big girl and never really went out in anything other than jeans before then.

During one party I was pretty wasted and as a joke I stripped the label off a vodka bottle and stuck it on my boobs and we all laughed (stupid joke I know). Then this guy (I'll call him Dave) came over and stuck another sticker onto my other boob. I laughed cause everyone else was, but his hand lingered a little too long. I let it go to enjoy the rest of my night and assumed he just thought it was fun too. Dave was pretty nerdy, seemed nice enough, went to my school but he left and we didn't really speak. 

Later in the party I was near passed out alone in the living room when Dave came in and sat with me. We spoke a little and I got a bit uncomfortable with the conversation so I got up to dance to the music. When I looked back at him he was pointing his phone in my direction and he said ""That's nice."" I felt so weird, I didn't know if he filmed me, but it seemed that way. I don't know if I'm just paranoid. I sat back down and he got closer to me, I didn't know what to feel since no one had ever hit on me or even taken an interest in me, but I didn't want anything to do with that. Just then my male friend came in, and just then I was out of there and trying to find my female friends. I told them I felt ill and we all left.

A while after the party, I told my friends what happened, and they told me it was sexual harassment. I thought... Oh. But at the same time I don't know if he was just flirting and I took it the wrong way? Like he might have thought I was into him. Anyway, I did feel kind of violated so I told the guy who had the party what happened. He says it's okay and Dave won't be invited again. All good.

Like a month later, I go to another party at that guys house, and Dave is there. I really didn't know what to do, and people came up to me asking about what Dave did to me. Dave seemed to know what I'd told people and I felt really horrible and uncomfortable so me and my friends left.

Then a year later, my friend and Dave both text me and ask me if it's okay if Dave goes to a party I'm going to. I tell the host he can do what he wants, and when the party came around Dave was there. I felt kind of betrayed, but I enjoyed the party anyway.

I've been thinking a lot. And I've been wondering if I was right to even tell anyone what Dave did. I feel like I kind of embarrassed myself and him, since if he was making a pass at me he was making a pass at a bigger girl. I don't know how to feel or what to think.

Anyway... after that long story, am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

tl;dr Some guy flirted with me, I thought it was sexual harassment, told people and now feel like I've embarrassed the both of us."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I am a laid back person twelve times out of ten, but the one thing i hate more than anything is trash. I hate trash so much. And E just leaves his food trash all over my bedroom, until it starts to stink. He never takes it out. I‚Äôve brought it up to him repeatedly and he makes no effort to amend the situation.

Looking back, I think she was implying that I cancel my plans. This was on Saturday.

Fast-forward to now (Thursday) and I have plans to babysit Friday night.

Yes my place does have a driveway so I can still park if someone is parked out front but I have to walk through the grass to get to my driveway and then back out. It would be more convenient to walk out to the street get in my car and pull off.	Asshole	0	0
bxov6u	2019-06-07 01:41:53	Fuckyou62	AITA for hating my German friend?	"A friend of mine is in town from Germany and is driving me fucking crazy. The dilemma is I cannot tell if this is cultural or not. Let me start, we lived together in college and she had been in the US for a few years at the point. She has now been in Germany for 5 years and is in the US to visit and asked to stay with me. The behavior I'm about to list was not present when we lived together previously but I can't tell if 5 years in Germany caused her to pick these things up.

First, we've seen a few movies together and she is always texting or talking on the phone in the theater. She doesn't seem to understand that this isn't okay. She also keeps asking to come to my place of work to 'hang out for a bit'. I've told her no as I like to stay professional with my colleagues but she keeps asking.

She also keeps trying to interact with my bf and I when we are naked/showering/ using the toilet etc. Just yesterday I was in a towel in my bedroom and my bf was in his boxers on the bed. She barged in the room unannounced and tried to join in on our conversation. She wakes up earlier than me and she will come into my bedroom, get into my bed and put her face very close to mine to tell me she is leaving. It's creepy as fuck.

Lastly, she won't lock the doors on our house when she leaves even though I gave her keys and asked her to always lock up.

Sorry, one more- I have a cat and she is always pushing him off of stuff. He is elderly so I've asked her to be careful with him but today she pushed him off of our couch by pulling him by his tail.

My dilemma is that she seems so ignorant to the thing she is doing and gets very upset when I asked her to do something or not do something. She says I'm controlling her and that she doesn't understand. She has a degree in behavioral analysis and she is a smart girl. I've gotten so angry that I've yelled at her, told her not to touch my cat anymore, and that if she doesn't lock up she can't stay in my home for the rest of her visit. I feel like I might be a bad friend but then I see her do something and am unsure.

Edit: I should clarify about the cat. She is pushing him off of the couch or away from her stuff because she doesn't like cats I think. I feel I made it sound like she was pushing him just for fun. I mean, she is still too mean to him but I wanted to clarify."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I got pissed off so I threw the ball at him and told him to grab it, he gets hit in the chest and begins yelling at me again, I ignore him and go inside my house for water. About 5 minutes later I come outside and nobody is there.

I start lookng for the ball and can't find it, I look in my backyard and see the ball floating in the water, I try to grab something to get it, but it's too far away from me. Friends come outside with snacks and watch me try to get it while laughing, in the end I walked back to my house to which the friend who threw it in says ""Hey you threw the ball at me, you deserved it"".

bxomyt	2019-06-07 01:17:24	sirlagzzalot	WIBTA If I cut off my best friend of 5 years?	"My best friend and I are both 19 year old males. We have been friends all throughout high school. We are part of a small friend group of about 5 people. He and I have a remarkably good chemistry as friends. We have the same thought process, same interests, same sense of humor. Nearly every time we‚Äôve hung out together, either in groups or one on one, I‚Äôve laughed so hard I‚Äôve cried. 

Starting around October of 2018, I broke up with my high school girlfriend and started dating my current girlfriend whom I met at college. This was the first time he didn‚Äôt support a decision I‚Äôve made. I understand that he‚Äôs entitled to his own opinion, but it was so unlike him to go against one of his favorite people. We eventually got past this, but we‚Äôve not been on consistently good terms since then.

The past few months it‚Äôs been an endless cycle of me getting blown off and not invited to things. He will blatantly lie to me an excuse why he can‚Äôt hang out when I can clearly see what he‚Äôs up to when I check his Snapchat stories. Almost always he‚Äôs with his new friends. This new friend group he oddly keeps separated from the rest of us. When we all want the original group to hang out, getting him to come is like pulling teeth. He barely even answers.

Not only that, he barely even checks in on me anymore. I used to see him like twice a week, and I understand life gets busy but he rarely texts me.Just a couple times a month, and It‚Äôs usually a quote of something stupid. I lost a very close family friend to cancer in January, followed by a few months of struggling with depression. I would send him texts and snaps openly talking about missing being around him, that I‚Äôm depressed and need to spend time with him to get some joyful familiarity back in my life. He would either say something stupid like ‚Äúsame‚Äù or send back a picture of a random object with no caption. (note: I very rarely show affection, especially to male friends).

Nearly every time I call him out on his bullshit and try to get him to give me a reason and it always starts an argument. We will get in an argument through our group chat and it usually results in me leaving for a few days before being added back. I reached a last straw the other day when he rudely shot down my idea for an adventure for all of us.

I am to the point now where I know nothing will be the same with him, though it‚Äôs a huge loss, I‚Äôm ready to just give up and cut him out. I am not wasting my time on someone who makes me feel worthless. I am not telling him what he‚Äôs done wrong, as I‚Äôve told him countless times and have not gotten one sincere apology. I have since removed him off all social media and I am going to un-include myself if my friends hang out and he‚Äôs there.

bxomt8	2019-06-07 01:16:55	Howcanichangehermind	AITA For wanting to cut my best friend out of my life for stealing my baby name?	"
To start things off, I'm not pregnant. Nor am I anywhere near close to being pregnant. However, my best friend is pregnant and I couldn't be more happy for her. As best friends do, we started discussing baby names. She asked me if I had any baby names picked out for my future children and I told her my mother had suggested a name years ago for my future daughter that I absolutely fell in love with. It's super unique and it's a name that originates from the country she was born in. My mother is no longer alive, so this is something I really wanted to do in the future so my potential daughter could have a connection to her grandmother. 
A few days ago, I saw on facebook that my best friend posted a picture of those 3D sonograms and in the post she revealed the name that she had picked for her daughter. It was the name I told her that I had picked out for my future daughter. I am absolutely devastated she would do this to me. She knows what that name meant to me and she decided to use it anyway. She says it's just a name and since she's pregnant before me she gets to use whatever name she wants. I told her she's being heartless and asked her how she can do this to someone she sees as a sister. She is not going to change her mind about this, so I want to end all communication with her since I can't even imagine calling her daughter by the name I wanted for mine. Am I the asshole for doing this?

*Just some more information: This isn't an American/English name, it's a Middle Eastern one. She isn't Middle Eastern.

Edit 2: Wow, I just finished work and I honestly didn't think this post would blow up this much. Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment, regardless of your opinion on this post. My friend hasn't reached out to me since the last time we spoke, but I'm honestly over it all and don't want to continue our friendship. If there is an update to the situation, I'll be sure to post about it.

bxolfb	2019-06-07 01:13:07	_Butter_Milk_	AITA for completely re-writing all of my group mate's work in our group project?	"So for one of my finals I'm doing a 3 person presentation. I'll call my group mates Cass and Rob.

&#x200B;

I was originally supposed to do the bulk of the project, but I was feeling really stressed out and Rob offered to take over for me. Cass and I made a 5 page document with information, and Rob had to copy it onto a final presentation with some other things as well.

Rob got it done, and Cass and I looked over it today in one of our other classes. (The project is due tomorrow by the way) He only used about 2 pages worth of the info we gave him, and left out everything else. His transitions made no sense, and it was riddled with grammar and punctuation mistakes.

Cass and I flipped. He had over a week to do it, yet barely made a full presentation. On top of this, he was the only one that could edit it. We went to our teacher and asked what we could do (Without Rob), and he went into the program and made me the owner of the presentation.

Now I'm spending my day basically redoing the entire thing. We haven't communicated with Rob, and don't have a good way to let him know about this until tomorrow (When we turn it in). Cass is sure that this is deserved, as we gave him a week and he produced nowhere near an A worthy project. We both felt that turning it in the way it was would result in us failing the final.

I'm glad I'm fixing it, but I also feel guilty about the whole situation.  I feel like I could have avoided it if I just stuck with what we'd originally planned (Though we doubt he would have contributed much information), or if I'd checked in on his work more.  I especially feel bad that we can't really tell him until tomorrow. I keep thinking, what if he thought it was really good work, or is really sad that we did this? I really want to avoid hurting his feelings, and I can't decide weather or not I think we went about this the right way.

I (31m) started seeing a girl (28f) that I've known for years (friend of a friend kind of thing) about 7 months ago. 

In my mind, it was **WAY** too early to be talking about kids but I guess the biological clock was ticking pretty loudly.

My Situation

* 45k EBT
* Degree
* Just finished 2nd, more applicable, Degree
* 65k in Student Loan debt


Her Situation
 
* 33k EBT
* No Degree
* Same grocery store job for 9 years with no plans of advancement 
* No Debt

Here is a paraphrase of the conversation that happened one week ago.

>Her -  ""Yes or No"" on kids.

>Me - ""As of right now, financially, no. In the future? Maybe. It will depend on our finances. My standard for having kids is, each parent should be able to solely support raising a child separately. Right now that isn't possible and I don't know when or if it will be.""

>Her - ""I'm gonna want kids regardless. I need a yes from you so I don't waste my time if you decide we can't afford it later.""

>Me - ""I'm not going to have kids without both of us being financially stable. I'm not going to put my potential future child through that. I'm sorry I can't give you a straight ""Yes"" after 7 months but right now, with how little you care about your own financial situation and future, you are a financial liability to my potential future child and they deserve better. I want to give them better.""

>Her - ""My parents weren't prepared when they had me and they made it work!""

>Me - ""Both your parents had degrees and could only move up in the world financially. Compare yourself now to them then? You're almost 29 and have no idea what you want to do. You've also put no effort into figuring that out.""

The rest of the conversation was more of the same just reworded.
I eventually just needed to end it and hang up. 

I'm not all that torn up about it considering how I started a new job this Monday making double what I was making previously. I think I lucked out in the long run. 

My situation as of now:

* 85k EBT
* 2 Degrees
* 65K Student Loan Debt

At which point wife, turned off speaker, got up and went into another room to talk to her.

After the call I casually said, ""What a strange way to start a conversation.""

My wife got a little defensive saying things like, ""Oh that's just her."" ""Why does it bother you?"" ""It's weird you think it's weird."" etc.

I mentioned that she would probably think it's weird if one of my friends called me and asked if I was banging her in a casual start of the conversation sort of way. My friends wouldn't do that because those are not things my friends would say.

 What happens is she starts telling me or is in the middle of telling me and either dog jumps on me and tussle a bit or maybe I'm also trying to reheat my dinner since I get home after her and the kids have eaten. 

My deal is I talk on the phone for a living so I'm easily able to do more than one thing at a time. If I break eye contact for a moment it doesn't mean I'm not listening. She says it makes her feel dumb and after the I don't know how many times we've had this convo am I the asshole?

One of my friends, We'll call her Alex, invited me to a chat with this person called Elon. She told me to come and chat, and I just decided 'why not?' It wouldn't hurt to meet someone new.

It turns out Alex told them my school and general area, the dumbass, without my permission. I guess she thought it was no big deal, but that pissed me off. Whatever, let's still talk to them.

We somehow get on the topic of politics, which is never a good idea, and it turns out Evan is a full authoritarian communist. Uh, okay, lol, probably a joke, I guess.  So we get on chatting, and Evan really wants me to join a call so he can ""hear my voice."" Sure, why not? What's the worst that could happen.

Turns out they're trans. Okay, whatever, I don't care. We talk for a while longer. Then, they keep on calling me the n-word. Okay? Me and Alex aren't black, but i'm guessing they were, so It's not that big an issue.

Then they say, ""we're all white here, right?"" That's a little... yeah. They continued to call us the n-word throughout the conversation, while trying to get me to talk about tentacle hentai. Eh, no thanks.

Then, finally, they leave. Alex rants to me about Evan and how much she hates him. I was very frustrated because, why would you invite me to chat with someone you hate?

She then told me about how this person encouraged others to cut, and how he also told a toddler to ""kill themselves."" She then told me that Evan thought Hitler was hot. What?

I was so fucking angry at her for getting me wrapped into this. I didn't care if she ranted to me, but why would you have me talk to them? First thing I did was block Evan, because I don't play with that shit, and then I stopped talking to Alex. She texted me a few times before going silent.

I told her about 3 months ago that we would be in town and the dates. She told me she wasn‚Äôt sure if she would be in town due to a prior engagement. Then a few days ago, I received a text saying she would be in town but that her daughter has a birthday party to go to in the afternoon, so we could meet beforehand for lunch or after for dinner.

It was a horrible financial hit and everything went to shit. They are not much better off now then they were then. Kids are still school aged to teen age.

Pretty much since I turned 18 and have had a bit of my own money they have taken from me. A hundred here, a hundred there. I would often not see it back. I know i soundstupid but I always felt bad and guilty and just gave it to them.

Now I have kids of my own. They owe me around 700 currently (prob more from past unpayed debts but this 700 has all been loaned witbi. The last year). 700 may not seem like much but I am in no way well off so it's a lot to me.

Well my mom will tell me she went here and there, they are going to this place and that. It gets to me. First of all I never get an invite. Second of all.... Ummm you are spending money to do all these fun things but you owe me money?

It pisses me off. My mom has issues and is a bit off mentally so I do feel bad but I also resent my entire family and siblings. Why do they get to go fun places I would like to go, and I don't even get invited, and don't get my money?!? I know it's my own stupidity for loaning money to them time and time again but man it irks my soul.

"I \[18M\] recently graduated high school (6 months back NOT USA) and my parents \[44M\] and \[41F\] got a divorce immediately after. My mother is from Europe and has decided to go back to her home country to start a new life after she became pregnant with her second child (not by my father and she wants to raise the child alone), and she has offered me to join her. I've always wanted to live in Europe as i never really liked the country where i grew up and I am 100 percent certain i want to move, i am ecstatic about moving and what the future beholds for me and things are already in motion. However my dad is a bit of a social recluse and i'm really the only person who he physically sees on a regular basis, he is adamant that he doesn't want to go out and see other people because apparently he thinks i am ""enough social interaction"" for him and he has ""fulfilled his biological need of reproduction so why should he start seeing new people?"". I honestly don't care weather he has another kid or not i just don't want him to be lonely when i leave. Considering the fact that i am an only child i don't want to leave him without a family or a support network if anything goes wrong, or leave him without care when he gets old, or take away regularly seeing any future grandchildren, or  have him think i chose my mother over him. I am leaving for me not for my mother. I don't want to say he is holding me back but he is and i would feel horrible if me leaving causes him to mentally deteriorate.  I have told him that i am leaving with my mother and the reasons for my hesitation he was upset that i was both leaving and felt this way. He said something along the lines of ""Oh fine you're absolved from any responsibility of looking after me when i'm old! ill just go to a home!""

Some important things to note down

\- I was likely going to move to Europe regardless of whether my parents got divorced or not

\- My mother and i leave in a month

\- I have told my dad and he is upset i want to leave

\- I already have received a residence permit of the country i will be living in

bxod70	2019-06-07 00:49:43		AITA for telling my ex friend what she should change about herself	"Well a friendship I really cared about came to an end. It was certainly a messy end, but mutual. We said our goodbyes, mine definitely nicer than hers.

Well there were some things I held off on saying while we were friends. It was a little harsh and probably out of place and bad timing, but true, and meant with good intentions.

Essentially I said she could be an amazing friend, but she needs to stop with the lying, talking behind people's back, all of the sob stories (which may or may not be true), stop flirting to get her way etc. I think somewhere deep inside she's good, but right now she's a selfish toxic person.

Yeah I should've just let it go, but I wanted her to look herself in the mirror and change."	Asshole	1	0
bxocwn	2019-06-07 00:48:53	throwaway998897	AITA? Yelled at my AirBnb host, possibly made her cry	"Sorry for the weird title, this is a situation I never thought I‚Äôd be in. 

I‚Äôm working away from home over the summer, and decided to book an AirBnb. For $60 a day (not cheap at all!(at least for a broke college student)) I am living with a woman in her 60‚Äôs.

When I first got to the house I noticed this woman, let‚Äôs call her Rory, was very talkative. To the point that she couldn‚Äôt take hints when I wanted conversations to end, and would end up talking for hours. She‚Äôs single and in her 60‚Äôs so I convinced myself that this was ok.

It didn‚Äôt end. Now everyday after work if she sees me it becomes a 2 hour conversation in which she has criticized my work, criticized my plans with friends, called me lonely, told me I‚Äôm too skinny etc. I try to end the conversation politely but then she ends up just yelling stuff throughout the house.

To cope, I‚Äôve been getting home from work early (before she gets home), and basically hiding in my room. I‚Äôm a pretty solitary person, so this is what‚Äôs comfortable for me. I prefer alone time especially after being surrounded by people for 8 hours. I also go on walks and bike rides which have kept me healthy and sane!

Today was one of the worst days. As I left my room to use the bathroom she heard, called out to me and asked if my WiFi was working. She asked this as I was sitting to take care of business, so I just yelled back that I was using the restroom.

When she heard the bathroom door open and my room door close, she stood outside my room (door closed) and asked if I‚Äôve just been getting home and sleeping after work. It may just sound like curiosity,  but based on past actions I know that she was asking to either criticize me or try to fix me. I just called out ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not, don‚Äôt worry about it‚Äù, maybe a little rudely but nothing overtly disrespectful.

5 minutes later she‚Äôs sniffling outside my room (door still closed) asking if I‚Äôm mad at her, citing that I haven‚Äôt talked to her as much recently. I just said (through the closed door, which to me means please don‚Äôt disturb)  that I prefer to have alone time and chill out without talking to too many people. I feel like I‚Äôm in a parallel universe because when I describe this to people they‚Äôre like oh she‚Äôs just old and she‚Äôs doing this because she‚Äôs lonely, but I don‚Äôt think that her actions are excusable because of age and I am paying a lot to be here and honestly HATE coming home from work. I want to be able to have alone time and me time but what the fuck. So AITA?

Edit: she lives in the room across the hall, so it‚Äôs a shared space"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxocnh	2019-06-07 00:48:10	lackinglace	AITA for thinking $50 is too much?	"Okay, so let's roll this one out. I met my wife about 5 years ago when we were both college students. We hung out at our dorm at first, and then gradually started meeting for dinner. 

After about a month of meeting for dinner like every weekend, we were talking to some colleagues and I basically was just confident enough that our dinners had equivocated to dating. So I say something along the lines of ""Yeah, we've been dating for about a month."" 

Here's where it gets interesting. She interjects and says ""Uhh, no. Those weren't dates. You never spent over $50. It isn't a date if it's under $50."" WHAT?! Guys and gals, when did this become a thing? I had no idea there was some rule, unbeknownst to me, that it didn't qualify as a date if it was under $50. Then, she calls me an asshole for explaining to her that $50 was literally a days worth of pay for me, the poor minimum wage job wielding collegiate. She acted as if I didn't think she was worth $50 dates. 

So my question to you is AITA for thinking the $50 date rule is pretty steep (especially at that time when money was so scarce), or is she the asshole for the way she reacted when she heard me claim that we were dating?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxocn1	2019-06-07 00:48:09		WIBTA for being a friend to my sister‚Äôs cheating ex?	"So my older sister recently broke up with her boyfriend of several years because he cheated on her (again). He‚Äôs a pretty nice guy but is a compulsive cheater. He also recently moved across the country just after they broke up  (perfect timing). I was sort of friends with him when they were dating. 
When they first broke up he texted me just to talk about the situation, and how awful he felt. I said I was sorry that he felt so miserable but tried to mostly emphasize how awful what he did to my sister was and just give him some advice on how to move on. I wasn‚Äôt sure if my sister would like the idea of us texting, so I faded the convo out quickly. 
Just now he texted me again saying he ‚Äújust needed a friend to talk to‚Äù... I do feel kind of bad for him because he just got broken up with (for good reason) and is now half way across the country with no friends. I like to always be someone who‚Äôs there to listen, and to be understanding of everyone‚Äôs circumstances and feelings (regardless of who they are or what they may have done), but I also don‚Äôt want to betray my sister. He also texted my sister‚Äôs roommate a few weeks ago (it‚Äôs a long story, basically he needed a key to the apartment) and she basically told him to fuck off because he cheated on her friend (my sister). He told me about this when it happened and it got me thinking that maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be talking to him at all. I‚Äôve kept our convos to an absolute minimum but I don‚Äôt want to ignore him or be rude...

And we can overhear what she says to her mother and some of the things really bother my SO and make her feel as if she is ‚Äúa guest in her own home‚Äù and that she has to watch what she says in her own house. I think she is just letting it get to her and should ignore it as I do. But she is telling me I can put a stop to all of this by just putting my foot down. But I don‚Äôt feel like I can. Her mother is entitled to uninterrupted phone conversations within reason with our daughter. And I can‚Äôt just sit there and coach my daughter on what she should and should not say.

Has great chats with everyone else so I think right, she doesn't like me, sometimes it be like that. I think maybe for whatever reason she may not like me I'll try talk to her (happening over weeks) but to no avail. Again, fine by me, I go on with my life and think hey maybe she just ain't chatty. I want to point out that I still remain friendly. later, I share that meme where it's text messages like anxiety: what if you're not good enough and Scandinavian clown: Hy√∂nk. Lame meme but she decides to be sarcastic about how funny it is while tagging my other coworker (ik it's sarcastic bc her friend even replied that she's a cunt). Despite this, I think whatever I'll let it slide. I remain friendly. Now here is where I'll admit I messed up. I get this nutty idea that I'll try break the ice by being silly since in my experience, reserved people tend to be much looser if you be a bit more silly around them. But I fucked up here, I sent her the Guacamole Nigga Penis meme and got blocked. I realise this so I don't hold it against her, and believe it or not I still remain friendly at work despite it being a bit awkward. I want to point out that by being friendly I mean I'm kind like call me a nice guy but I'll hold the door open for her n shit. And I talk to her nicely. 2 months go by, same stuff from her, she unblocks me and here's how the conversation went down:

Her: hey OP i thought i‚Äôd unblock you.

Me: Hey friend, yea I never meant to bother you with anything I said, I hope we can be friends now üôÉ I guess it was rly dumb

H: Maybe

M: What's stopping ya? I feel like you've been a teeeny bit apprehensive towards me in particular since day one of you being at <place>, Im not hating but if it's cool to ask, is there actually something about me that bothers you or am I just imagining that? Like idk I see you have all these great chats with Nathan and everyone but me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm genuinely just curious so please don't be offended

H: because you ask out every girl at dominos

M: Alright

Right now I feel upset but I decide I don't want to make drama out of it, so I decided to be accepting and just deal with the fact she sees things differently from me. Hence, I say alright, I don't object because after all I did ask for her opinion and go to bed. The next morning I wake up and she said Don't be offended. I read this mockingly bc it's the second last thing I told her. At this point I had enough, and said:

Really, you're going to be sassy. You know what keep me blocked I've always shown you kindness and friendship and everyone else can manage to be nice to me, so idk if you've been cheated on by like a fuckboy or something in the past but you're really throwing me into a box which isn't fair because if you actually got to know me I'm a pretty friendly person and asking 2 girls out in 6 months doesn't change that"	TL;DR	0	0

bxocel	2019-06-07 00:47:25	AboveTableAccount	AITA for Saying I go to a Prestigious University?	"So I recently I lost an internship due to natural disaster. So I created a post on a sub-reddit that I won't link to although you can still find it if you wish, to ask how this might affect my future career if I don't have an internship the Summer before Senior year.  I intend to give all the necessary details here as unbiased as I can be so as that you don't need to go to the post to prevent any kind of downvoting attack on either side. I decided to lay out the circumstances of how I lost my internship and then dropped a list of all my qualifications to see if they were still enough to get a good career out of college despite my lack of an internship. I mentioned that I went to a prestigious university which is true I'd argue it's very close to if not a household name, though due to the size and proximity to a populated area I prefer not to say which one, I prefer to remain as anonymous as possible within reason. I noted some qualifications and I got a comment warning me not to say that I was highly skilled at anything that I wasn't confident I could be grilled on by someone working in it for 30 or more years. I agreed as I hadn't meant to phrase it like that in the first place.

Another poster replied that I was being condescending by claiming to be skilled in certain areas, that I went to a prestigious university, that I had interviewed successfully with a large tech company, and that I had a half 3.50 GPA. They then stated that they believed these were false and I was purposely trying to use the reddit to brag and that I was being egotistical. They also claimed that I shouldn't say I was ""smart"" which at no point did I say and to be honest I've never considered myself particularly smart. I've worked and studied hard for a long time to develop my talents.

Here's where some bias creep in because I do not know who I'm arguing with so I can't say anything about their background and I am paraphrasing and may be misunderstanding what they were saying.From my background I spent 3 years of high school working to pay for community college courses in engineering because I knew I wanted to go to a particular prestigious school to study CS and engineering.  I got into the prestigious school and worked really hard getting scholarships to cover it all although in retrospect they provided easily enough financial aid to cover it. I also had a lot of trouble writing a resume my first 2 years of college because it felt like bragging and it took my roomates' help to convince me that I had the right to mention what I learned in projects and attest to my own skill levels with certain technologies and disciplines. Coming from a poor rural area it's one of the things I'm proud of though personally I have no issues with community or state colleges, and at one point attended one of each. I can't help but feel maybe they are right and I'm bragging too much and am not being humble enough.

Fast forward a few years and I found out where he lives and what he had been doing. He had a brand new wife and child, and God knows what the wife knows about him. He was probably torturing them too. 

Fast forward another few years and I hear about his death. Rejoice! The world is a better place! I went to the funeral and apparently he was decent to the family, because everybody there had only positive things to say about him. 

At the end of the service. after most people had gone, a few of the closest to him (my grandmother, his wife and other child whom I never met) were still there and I came up and spray painted ‚Äúabuser‚Äù on his casket before they dropped it down. I should mention none of them knew who I was because I had never met any of them. 

As they were shocked, I laughed and hurried away (they‚Äôre all over weight so I didn‚Äôt even have to run).

The book in question is hundreds of pages long, covers the topic in extreme detail, and includes hundreds of exercises which I also wrote up solutions to for a separate solutions manual. I should mention, as I think it's important, this is not ""undergraduate probability"" many here will be familiar with, which is generally quite trivial. This is formal probability theory which is extremely technical, and so writing a textbook with hundreds of accompanying exercises was draining to say the least. I dedicated it to my wife (now ex-wife) as she had encouraged me to continue even though I kept slacking and putting it off. Don't think I'd have finished it without her encouragement. We've since divorced and are not on good terms.

 
It's now used in many courses globally and I've received an immense amount of feedback from both instructors and students. I have written an updated edition to address the feedback I've compiled over the years.

My wife (current wife) insists I remove the dedication to my ex-wife and include her instead. I don't think this is appropriate. Even though I am on bad terms with her now, I genuinely believe she's the only reason I ended up completing it, and want to keep the dedication as a 'thank you.' When I refused, my wife went ballistic at me and it has been the source of never ending arguments since.

Am I really the asshole here?

I love dying my hair, but have only done it about 5 times. Today, I was dying my hair blue, and my sister asked if she could have some. I told her yes, as long as she helped my dye my hair.

We just got back from a family vacation a couple hours ago. My sister told me to get everything set up, and she would be in in a second. I did warn her it was timed once you set it up. I got it set up, and it took about 2 minutes, about as long as she sorts laundry, which she says she was doing. 

I tell her to come in and help me, and she was petting our rabbits, hadn't started sorting her clothes. She told me to get started. 

I did, and after about 5 minutes, I went to check in on her, she was still petting our bunnies. To get to her, I had to take off my gloves, and put them on the counter. They ended up staining our counter a light blue. She told me it was my fault, and I had to clean it up, while she was on her phone. I asked her if she could help me, and she scrubbed for 30 second, then said it was my mess, and refused to help. She kept yelling at me, and saying I was an asshole for staining our counters.  She also dyed nearly my entire head blue after my mom told her to help me make it even, and I have short hair, so I look like a smurf, as she got it all over my face as well, on purpose. 

So Reddit, AITA?

Edit: my mom is now saying she will flay me alive if she sees blue anywhere, and it's on the door, and it won't come off. I know it's a joke, but my sister won't like the blue on our door.

Edit 2: got the hair dye out from everywhere, and my hair dye looks decent, mind you a little high. So can you guys tell me if I was the asshole? But thank you to everyone who gave me tips for the mess, it worked wonders.

bxo60e	2019-06-07 00:28:55		AITA for asking my uncle to pay me more in his restaurant since the math checks out to about $5 an hour?	"So, I‚Äôm working at my uncle‚Äôs restaurant over the summer and am getting paid under the table since I‚Äôm family. I work open to close. My hours are 3-9 Tuesday - Thursday, 3-10 Friday, 1-10 Saturday, and 1-9 Sunday. I also typically show up an hour early and leave 30-45 minutes after close. So if you add those numbers to the hours above, it comes out to be 50 hours a week, give or take depending if actually show up exactly an hour early or stay exactly 30-45 minutes later. 

He‚Äôs letting me stay in his apartment while there because it‚Äôs 3 hours from home and also pays for takeout food almost every night, since he has grown up eating his restaurant‚Äôs food and wants something different. 

He pays me $250 a week, which is where the $5 an hour comes in. Previously, I worked during spring break from college for a week and he gave me $500, so double of what I currently make, and spring break was my learning week which means I wasn‚Äôt doing as much as I am now. 

I know on a pure numbers basis, I should say something and be fine. But my parents told me to say something because they were mad, and they also don‚Äôt have a good relationship with my uncle because of some major drama that happened in the past. I don‚Äôt care about the drama. Family is family and unless someone killed someone else, anything can be forgiven. So they‚Äôre wanting me to fix it both out of numbers but backed with anger towards him. 

Anyways, I said something to him and it just feels wrong. I made sure to word it to show that I wasn‚Äôt upset with what he was paying me, but to point out that it is below minimum wage. My intention was to come work to learn how to run a restaurant, the money was just an added benefit, but it would still be nice to save for college and get a classic car. But I don‚Äôt know, I feel like an asshole for asking my uncle for more money even though he is giving me a place to stay and showing me the ropes of running a business. 

TLDR: Uncle pays me less than minimum wage and was urged to point that out but feel bad for doing that because he‚Äôs doing so much for me"	Not the A-hole	1	0

(click baity, sorry)	"So, I about six months ago I moved on from my old company where I was for 12 years (I only bring that up as it establishes my relationships).  That said, I still remain close a handful of folks and am still on our old group chat (five of seven still work there).  Over the past couple weeks, I've received multiple side chirps from different people saying that (names changed) Carlos and Sandy have become exceptionally close.  Carlos is in the group chat and married while Sandy is someone we all worked with and is very attractive (she just got out of a long term relationship).  By close, I'm told that they've been caught texting/skyping each other and also were seen by the VP (his boss) leaving a work event together (could be a coincidence but...).  They were also caught standing close in an empty stairwell but nothing physical can be proven.

bxo2r4	2019-06-07 00:19:20	OGkureator	WIBTA for asking my coworker/partner if I can take over?	"Bit of backstory: I work as an intern for an engineering firm and it‚Äôs pretty intensive. They‚Äôve got us working on actual projects the company presents to clients. Presently myself and one other intern are working on a structural system with an initial prototype due tomorrow. This requires a full CAD model in addition to structural and vibrational analyses plus a presentation explaining our design. I‚Äôm fairly proficient in the CAD software we use while the other intern is still learning, however I offered to do the analyses, partially to challenge myself and partially to allow the other intern to get some experience with the software. Unfortunately after I finished my 4 odd hours of calculations, I looked over to realize this guy has been sitting there struggling to CAD a single part out of our 20-something part assembly. In addition, at a quick glance I can see 3 mistakes that will need to be changed later. In addition, we‚Äôre trying to finish this tonight since he won‚Äôt be able to be there tomorrow.

So my question WIBTA if I asked (nicely) if I can take over the CAD while he works on the presentation? I totally understand that you‚Äôve gotta be bad at something before you can be good at something, but I‚Äôm getting worried about this deadline. Right now I feel like my options are:

1) take over the CAD while he does the presentation. Ideally get everything finished tonight so tomorrow I‚Äôm not scrambling to finish before we present. But potentially sending the message that I don‚Äôt trust his work (which admittedly I currently don‚Äôt, but that‚Äôs not the message I want to send to someone who‚Äôs learning)

2) just leave him be and work on the presentation. This will likely mean that I need to come in early tomorrow to finish/redo/fix what‚Äôs he‚Äôs done to get it ready. Gonna be honest I don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôd enjoy that

3) leave the presentation for now and sit down to help him. I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôd be able to finish tonight, but I could guarantee that the work that does get done would be correct, allowing me to just build off it tomorrow morning. And then I could probably finish the presentation when I get home tonight

Obviously I‚Äôd like to be able to do option 1, but is that a dick move?

Also I am aware that there needs to be a discussion probably both with him and our boss about general level of qualification to be working on important jobs. That will probably happen in the near future, but for now I‚Äôm just asking within the scope of this particular project"	No A-holes here	0	0

bxo0cq	2019-06-07 00:12:32	DontTrustABro	AITA for making a Call Out Post	"SO I know the world, especially the good ol' U-S-of-A, has been obsessed with making Call Out Posts; posts made with the intention of informing the world of one's (past) wrong doings in order to prevent them from moving forward in their success, especially if their success or actions have harmed others in the process.  Now, while I find it highly annoying when people call out those who once did wrong YEARS ago, and have apologized and dont what they can to make up for that they did... I don't think all Call Out Posts are bad.  If something recent, like within the last few months or last few years, happened, I think it is good to let the public know.

&#x200B;

Someone I once worked with is not a great person.  He is not the worst person ever.  But he has hurt so many people; harassment, lying, manipulation, etc. He has hurt me, some of his other friends, his other coworkers, and other people I have not personally met, but know of.  He is currently trying to move in with a new business partner (who is not aware of past situations due to this person being good at his facade) in order to launch a new game he created (he's an artist, making games, music, etc).  While I would be lying if i said there isn't a part of me that is upset with how he has affected my life, it genuinely grinds my gears to think of the possibility of someone so spoiled and cruel possibly getting successful off of the suffering of others. I also want to make this post to warn any future partners of what they're getting into.

&#x200B;

So... would I be the asshole if I made a call out post?

&#x200B;

**So the majority said I am the asshole, which I can see where they are coming from.  But taking a step back a few hours later, talking to a few more buds over some video games and food, and thinking about everything that was said I can say I will not be making a call out post.  I may contact the future partners should more harassment ensue from him towards me or his other past friends. Overall it is just inviting more drama.  I have calmed down from a very in the moment idea suggested to me. I do not think that I am the only asshole here but obviously no on eknows the whole story or has seen wht I seen.**"	Asshole	0	0

bxnyci	2019-06-07 00:07:31	onlyamatteroft1me	AITA for wanting my boyfriend to see Hamilton with me?	"The title, but let me explain. I'm a young widow. My husband passed at the age of 32 and it was sudden and terrible but I don't want to get into that now.

When I finally started dating again I wasn't really dating, just trying to meet guys on Tinder to make the lonely nights pass. As it happens I actually met a great guy who I'm with to this day, almost 2 years later.

When we first met each other I was drinking a lot and didn't care about how I came across to people. I would play music from Hamilton a lot, and it's because that was our musical. He was Alexander Hamilton and I was his Eliza. I know I told my boyfriend this and I know he probably held me while I sang these songs and cried.

But now I'm better, our relationship is great and I'm looking forward to the future, something I never expected. Yet one of my greatest hopes has been to see Hamilton onstage. My late husband and I always wanted to see it together -- he said once ""It doesn't matter what we have to sell or do to see it, we'll see it.""

Obviously that never happened. But I still desperately want to see it. And my boyfriend does not.

He doesn't like to listen to the songs. He hates Lin Manuel-Miranda. He rolls his eyes whenever I wear one of my Hamilton shirts.

I understand he's tying this to my late husband but when I see it (and make no mistake, I WILL see it) I want to see it with my boyfriend. Not as a replacement for my husband, but because he's the love in my life and it's important to me and I want to experience that WITH HIM.

I know he'll go if I ask but I think he'll hate it the whole time. So if I want him to go, AITA? Should I just go alone?"	Not enough info	0	0

bxnu9f	2019-06-06 23:55:53	imsohungryman	AITA for wanting to keep my family at a distance?	"TLDR at the end. Mobile user, bad formatting.

Ok so my parents raised myself and my 2 siblings in the most loving household. We were very poor, and my dad had cancer for most of my childhood, so they did everything in their power to ensure their kids were happy.

However, almost everyone in my family has anxiety that they refuse to get treated; and as the ""most-informed"" on mental health, all of them lean on me for support during ""hardship"". E.g. dad had a check up a few years ago. Dr wanted to do further testing to make sure cancer hadn't come back. Results took 2 weeks to come back. For 2 entire weeks, my family acted like the cancer had come back and were so upset the entire time that it literally exhausted me so much and - by the end, it triggered a 3 month long depression. 

Another example: my brother committed petty theft when he was 18. My mum was so full of grief that she completely shut everyone else out and only called me everyday to talk about her feelings. Dad was so uptight for a few months that he'd randomly call me at work and LOSE HIS SHIT at me for random things that I had no control over. It happened so often that once I had a literal breakdown at work and ended up quitting out of embarrassment. 

My sister and her husband have 3 beautiful kids, but neither of them work. So alot of the time, my parents and I end up buying their necessities. My sister never ever appreciates it, and will always say that I never help her. E.g. I had to cancel on baby sitting a few days ago because I had to finish an assignment, and she called me unreliable and selfish. She also has previously called me a bad aunty and told me about her friend who's sister is paying for the education of her nieces and nephews, and that I'm a bad aunty in comparison (honestly this really broke my heart because I love her kids like they're my own). 

I also want mention here that I'm bipolar, and every single time something goes slightly wrong in the family, they ALL lean on me for emotional support. Once things seem better and more clear, they all just leave me to deal with the emotional distress and go on living their lives. 

When I nope out of situations, they guilt me so much that it's almost as bad as what I would be if I had gotten involved with the ordeal in the first place.

My sister is currently undergoing some testing for migraines. She is now convinced she has a brain tumour, even though there is nothing to indicate she does, and is now leaning on me more than ever. I'm emotionally exhausted and I have real life stressors like uni. My parents have also been convinced that something is seriously wrong, so the whole family has been calling me to talk about what would happen if it is a brain tumour.

So, AITA if I just stop answering their calls and avoid them until my sister gets her results back? 

TLDR: family overreacts to everything, leans on me for emotional support, then toss me to the side when things end up being ok."	No A-holes here	0	0

bxns7b	2019-06-06 23:50:10	zozorawr	AITA for not caring about something as much as my OH does?	"My partner and i live in an area which has permit parking. There are alot of student houses here which have several cars per house so it's quite a busy street. I drive a 17year old car, cheap and cheerful ,my partner drives a much nicer newer car, it's his pride and joy. He works shifts and can never get parked in front of out house and it drives him crazy, especially when he has to carry tools to and from his car daily!

He wasn't feeling well at work so I packed up my daughter into the car and drove to his work to drop off some medicine etc (at 9pm he's working nights) when I got back my parking space had gone in front of our house so I had to park quite a way down the street. Here's where I cocked up. I text him jokingly saying i won the contest for who had to park furthest from the house. He immediately went mental, told me to go knocking on doors to find the owner of the car and tell them to move (no legal standing at all as its a free for all) and then started looking at houses to rent with driveways as this was apparently the last straw. He found a few and asked me to send messages asking if they accepted dogs. I said we would look at it another time as it was late! He got really grumpy (texting me from work) saying i might as well message them now so if they say no we can look elsewhere. I told him to message then since he's the one who had a problem. 
I then sent a message trying to calmly explain I wasn't in the right headspace to sit and draft an email even if it was seemingly simple to him.
Here is the text I sent :

Just so you know it was the anniversary of my mum dying yesterday so I have been struggling this week and trying not to make a big thing about it as there's no point,nothing you can do to help I just need to get through it. So I can't deal with that right now I'm sorry. Can we just chill on it for a bit, I don't have the energy to sit and try concentrate and write anything at the minute, it's something we can look at together at some point definitely. I love you but I can't do it right now. Car parking is literally the furthest thing on my mind if someone steals my Car the insurance will pay out it's not the end of the world

bxnpvi	2019-06-06 23:44:07	Lovat69	AITA for taking a shower?	"Hey, I need some perspective. I'm a man with a three bedroom two bath apartment in NYC. I rent out two of the rooms so I have two roommates.

&#x200B;

You can only get into the back bathroom through the back bedrooms. I am in one and the other is a woman that is a little older than I am. Usually she is a very sweet person but she has some odd boundaries and can be a little controlling. She is also a VERY light sleeper. The walls are thin and when one of us is taking a shower the other person can hear it. Usually I let her have the bathroom first and she wakes up about ten or so and showers, and I use it after. I have found lately though that if I don't shower when I wake up that sometimes I don't shower. So yesterday having something I wanted to get done I took a shower at about 9:30. It felt great and I intended to do the same thing today.

&#x200B;

When I woke up I found a note slid under the bathroom door asking me to use the other bathroom so she could sleep in. I don't really trust the timing of this since it was  day after one of the only times I've been in the bathroom before her. Also I knew that even opening the door would wake her up after brushing my teeth at 1 am since that was when I was headed to bed. Even though did it by the kitchen sink (our other roommate was in the other bathroom) the fact that I opened and closed the door twice to get my toothpaste and brush and return it hard her complaining. (not to me but I could hear her through the walls). I waited until 9:30 again but as soon as I started the water running she asked through the wall if I had seen her note. I said yes but since just opening the door wakes her up to I didn't really see what the difference was. She says yes it does but that if I don't take a shower she'd be able to get back to sleep. She has said often that she can't take naps and that it's hard for her to get back to sleep after having been woken up. (the reason she gives for not wanting me to shower in the first place). She finishes by saying to PLEASE let her get some sleep. Despite the please though it feels more like a demand than a request so I get into the shower anyway.

&#x200B;

She starts shouting, ""that's so rude, what's wrong with the other bathroom, what's wrong with the other bathroom"". As well as banging on the wall or something. I finished anyway and shaved. All the drama made me pretty worked up so I went for a bike ride and didn't come back until lunch. 

&#x200B;

So what's wrong with the other bathroom? Nothing but I have to gather everything and wear a bathrobe when in my bathroom I can just walk right in. I have been living in this apartment for 15 years and I prefer to use this bathroom. Every time I have had a woman roommate in that back room she asks if the back bathroom can be just for her. I know women want this and I understand that but she is the only person who has tried to say when I can and can't use the bathroom after I say we have to share. It feels like she's trying to wean me off that bathroom."	Not the A-hole	0	0

She and I have 2 kids together: we were young and made kids. Our oldest is in college and our youngest is 16 and lives with me. I‚Äôve had sole custody for over a decade, we haven‚Äôt been together for almost 15 years.

She‚Äôs a total trash crackhead now. Probably has a lot to do with why as we got older I knew the relationship needed to end. She‚Äôs talented at art and can market her stuff internationally, but a total train wreck of the day to day stuff. Owes me almost $60k in support. Just an asshole person.

Long string of petty theft convictions landed her a 5 mo county sentence. As her release date for close she reaches out to our oldest and it‚Äôs decided that they are going to pick her up from jail. I canceled that shit real fast. Our oldest is in honors college and has a job and a car and through it all, is happy. No way I was putting them at the employee of the toxic mother. 

I volunteered to do it and wouldn‚Äôt take NO for an answer. I know still I had the right reasons, plus I figured at least after 5 mos she was probably sober. 

It was a 10pm pickup and I was trying to get a handle on where she was and what her options were. She was sober. I bought her a real coffee and a pack of cigarettes of which she couldn‚Äôt because she didn‚Äôt have an ID. 

That night I let her crash on my couch, with the explicit instructions that she was up at 7 with a plan. She had a plan for that afternoon so I took her and paid for a state issued ID that morning, because that‚Äôs sort of required to build up your life from nothing. Afterwards I drop her off at some yee haw trap house and I‚Äôve done my best.

The thing is, I lost a lot in that transaction. A girlfriend, family, family friends. No one seems to understand how important it is to me as a dad that my kids‚Äô mom is at least alive and surviving. Nothings changed, she still sucks, but for my kids I know I tried to give her an advantage. People even insinuated that I traded her sexual favors for the help, and trust me when I say we all have wondered if she‚Äôd gotten that bad. I didnt but once someone thinks that you‚Äôd do that you‚Äôre kind of hurt but also relieved they let you know what they think of you. 

I guess this is more of a rant, but thinking back on what that 20 hr sequence meant a year later, I‚Äôm pretty pissed and astonished. I promise that‚Äôs the entire summation of the story. Help me unpack this please and thank you."	Not the A-hole	0	0

The job led to another country.  Mom gradually lost her sanity as she blamed me for forcing dad to go away from her. Over the years there he got diabetic & I was the reason, her words were ""You gave him diabetes"". More accusations, I had sent my dad away in an attempt to kill her, born to kill them both, born to them as a punishment for the sins of their previous life, born to ruin the name of the family, etc.

In 10th grade, mom had severe mental health issues which got drastic as she had a surgery. Her issues had turned to be difficult for me to handle alone since no one else knew & I was too young to understand it all, got wounded due to the same.

In the last of 3 years, (10th - 12th grade) mom caught me talking to strangers on omegle, they took away my laptop. As a kid I was not allowed to leave home & just study. Laptop, internet was provided for studies only. Dad talked to me about 5 minutes a day for 5 years, didn't care to ask about my day. Only talk I got was to understand her pain or how her problems have occurred due to him leaving because of me. I have no idea what makes her think like I am the cause of everything.

bxnnd4	2019-06-06 23:36:50		AITA for letting my dog munch on someone's overgrown grass?	"This evening, I (20s F) took my beagle out for a walk. At the end of our street there is a unkempt house. The house has trash throughout the lawn, the grass is about two feet tall, and the whole place is truly in shambles. I'm not actually sure if anyone lives there. My beagle likes to eat grass, usually in our own backyard but we didn't go back there today. She started munching on the overgrown grass and I got a notification on my phone and looked away for a minute. 

A child, roughly four, came up and reprimanded me. Conversation goes as follows:

Child: You really shouldn't let your dog eat those flowers 
Me: Oh, she's just eating grass, it's okay.
Child: It's not your grass.
Me: I don't think they mind, it's overgrown anyways.
Child: No, it's not. 
Me: Okay.

I was sincerely in shock that a young child approached a stranger and an unknown dog to reprimand an adult. I really didn't know what else to say so I just went back to my phone. She eventually left (in another direction so I know this was not her house) and I moved my dog along.

I've seriously never thought that my dog eating grass would bother anyone. She eats a minuscule amount. It wouldn't bother me if someone else's dog was munching on my home's front lawn. So, AITA for letting my beagle eat a little overgrown grass?"		1	0
bxnmyj	2019-06-06 23:35:45		AITA the family dog keeps getting into chocolate and eating it.	"Sorry in advance if this is hard to read I‚Äôm on moblilw and suck at grammar. 

My (16f) black lab dog (6m) who is roughly 120 pounds (he‚Äôs a big boy naturally and is also on diet) keeps getting into chocolate. I‚Äôm not talking a little bit of chocolate I mean he‚Äôs eaten whole pans of brownies. It‚Äôs a very seriously problem in my eyes as I‚Äôm honestly shocked he hasn‚Äôt died yet.  We also have two cats who live in the common areas and I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them to eat it either. I have a cat but she stays in my room and I don‚Äôt leave chocolate out in my room. 

The reason why I‚Äôm making this post is that our dog got into an almost full jar of off brand nutella. He seems ok but he has awful diarrhea. We talked about this and my parents lectured my sister (13f) about it as it was her nutella. Then it kinda blew over. I pulled my mom aside to talk to her in private because I didn‚Äôt want my sister to get angry as I knew it was a total accident on her end (she still could have been careful but she‚Äôll get defensive if I talk to her about it).  My mom basically said I understand that it‚Äôs not good but it was an accident so just drop it. I get that it‚Äôs an accident but these accidents happen frequently, as in pretty much once a month.  I didn‚Äôt want to drop it because not only is this already a terrible habit we‚Äôre getting a puppy soon and I want to have precautions put in place before we get the puppy. My mom got really defensive even though I kept say that WE as a family need to work on this. Myself included (although I don‚Äôt leave chocolate out). She blew up and said well a lot of your pets would be dead without me. Which is true, I struggle with anxiety and depression so she helped me take care of them but I never thought that they were being neglected. If they were I would rehome them as I just want what‚Äôs best for them. Sorry for rambling but I think I might be TA because my family loves animals and just want what‚Äôs best for them so maybe I was overreacting? I don‚Äôt want to drop this if I‚Äôm not though.

TLDR: The family dog keeps getting into chocolate and everyone just calls it an accident. I told my mom that we should put more precautions up and she got defense and it ended in a screaming match."	Everyone Sucks	1	0

My fianc√© and I are going through a tough time at the moment with me finding inappropriate messages and photos on his phone - and not for the first time. 
I have multiple medical conditions for which I am heavily medicated with pain meds (morphine etc). This is due to damage from a fall I had two years ago. My fianc√© and I still have  a reasonably good sex life and when we do have sex it‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs also really painful for me during and afterwards due to arthritis and other conditions. My fianc√© (will call him Tom to stop having to type fianc√©!) feels bad for me afterwards and has told me that it‚Äôs off putting for him. 
He‚Äôs just come upstairs (I came to bed two hours before him intending to have an early night but have been Redditing instead) and we‚Äôve been having cuddles. He then tells me that we won‚Äôt be having sex as he has masturbated downstairs already (he‚Äôs a one-hit wonder when it comes to sex in a 24 hour period!). 
Am I the arsehole for feeling upset that I didn‚Äôt get penis first-refusal first? He said he enjoys masturbating as I wont be in pain afterwards - I absolutely have no pain with him doing this and I think it‚Äôs a healthy part of a relationship. But for me I think I should be offered sex before he entertains himself solo and I‚Äôm upset that he‚Äôs used my physical disabilities as his reason why."	Asshole	0	0

bxnjpu	2019-06-06 23:26:56	relatedtoadummy	AITA for telling my brother to divorce his wife?	"My brother is 25. We both inherited 150k from our grandfather when he was 20. His goal has always been to retire at 45 with two million. He got married at 22, and now has two kids under two at 25. When he was 23  he had around 500k in investments/savings. Since then he‚Äôs donated a large proton (near 320k), quit his job as a Jr Programmer, left 100k for his kids and a small portion for which just Incase something happens. Now he has 10k CC debt, student loans for going back to school for wanting his MBA, and works in a call center while doing his masters. This all started when he had a mental health issue. He has aniexty/depression which I believe fueled this. His wife states he wouldn‚Äôt start to get help until after his kids were born, I told him to quit his job go back to programming, leave his wife and start stacking his money again. He told me it‚Äôs not an option, the medical coverage covers his treatment and treatment is helping him repress not wanting to harm himself. I told him he needs to just man up and get over it or he‚Äôll be broke.  AITA?


Edit: I can see how I may been insensitive to his situation. I just can‚Äôt stay shy and watch him waste his life away. Everything our parents worked for and grand parents. I‚Äôm not the only one disappointed in the family, just the only one to say something. Obviously I care about my brothers I just want to help.

bxnj81	2019-06-06 23:25:37	Hardlyclerkinguy	AITA for writing up a lazy employee?	"Im the store manager in a convenience store. Lately, we've been having trouble keeping employees. Just a combination of bad timings of people going back to school or finding a new job. In short, we've been very short staffed.

I opened Monday morning, and was supposed to be out at 5. Unfortunately our closer no called no showed, and rather than call in anyone else I just finished the shift, meaning I worked from 6am to 10pm on my own.

Tuesday, I opened again at 6am, and my relief at 4 called in to quit at 330. I didn't have it in me to so another shift like that, so I called my weekend closer. He doesn't want to at first since he only works weekends, but I tell him that I just did an 18 hour shift the day before and don't want to do it again.

He agreed to do it, and came in around 430 to relieve me. All good so far! I go home and get a great night's sleep for once.

So i come in the next morning, and the store looks like ass. Nothin on the shelves is recovered (pulled forward and front faced) the break room trash wasn't taken out, and the floors weren't mopped.

I checked the cameras, and all he did was ring people up and play on his phone. When 10 o'clock hit all he did was count down drawers, take the front half's trash out and leave. Usually after close you stay for a half hour to mop, do a little stock and front face. He did none of that. Just counted down and left.

So, I wrote him up, basically for being lazy. When he came in he was pretty mad, and told me to never even think about asking him for a favor again. So far it's already bitten me in the ass as I had to do another 18 hour shift when he didn't answer his phone when I called to ask.

I told my husband about this, and he actually agreed with him! He said that him even showing up on a day off was a kindness, and I punished him for it.

My rebuttal is, yes, I asked you to do me a favor but that favor was to come in and do your job, not fart around and go home in a couple hours with pay.

bxnh77	2019-06-06 23:19:49		AITA For Worrying About My Siblings?	"Disclaimer: My parents are NOT abusing me or my siblings, and they never have. This is the first time I've been worried about my siblings. I'm lucky to have good, reasonable parents, even if they make stupid decisions sometimes.

I'm not even sure if this is the right subreddit to post this to, so if you have suggestions for where I should post this, please let me know.

For context, I'm 14, my sis is 12, and my brother is 6. My sister likes to sleepover at her friends and our grandma's house, so whenever there is an opportunity to for her to do so she'll always take it.

My sister has been gone for about 5-6 days now, staying the night at other people's houses, and it looks like she is going to stay the night at someone else's house again tonight.

Me and her don't have the best relationship, so I've enjoyed her being out of the house, but I feel like this has gone too far. My parents are just letting her do whatever she wants, and I think there's a potential for her to get hurt.

As for my brother, I'm not exactly sure where he is. When I asked my mom, she told me he was with the new neighbors, in their car. I started to feel kind of sick. 

These new neighbors haven't even been living here for three days, we know nothing about them. I don't know how long my brother has been away for (mom just told me he's been gone for less than an hour) or long until he comes back. I don't know where these neighbors are taking him. Hell, I don't even know there names.

I'm kinda protective of my brother, since he's so young, so maybe I'm overreacting. I'm pretty sure the neighbors have kids, so maybe that's why my mom thought it was okay. I don't know if this is normal for others but it's not that normal to me. If you need info I'll give you whatever you need.

"My brother got invited to play on a 13u baseball team, the team needs an assistant coach and having played ball through college the guy running the team asked for help, I told him maybe and decided to talk to my brother about it. He jumped immediately loving the idea. I told him that if i coach there is absolutely no way he plays middle infield and he hung up after a little pause. 

Now i dont know every kid on his team but what i do know is that my brother is pretty good and i believe he probably has the skill to play shortstop or 2nd. My only reason for denying him that is because of favoritism, I dont want to be accused of it and i dont want him to be talked about by teammates. Everyone knew a guy who played because of his last name, I even remember talking smack about kids who had parents coach who i believed shouldnt be playing. The league is pretty serious but at that age baseball should just be about fun, i want him to earn his position and with me there itll seem like it was given to him. 

I tried to explain this to my gf after telling her about it, shes still insist im a jerk... AITA?

In 2017, my wife and I got married. We had planned a small wedding at a hall. My wife‚Äôs family is huge in scale to mine and my friends. As space ran out, I was not able to invite many people that should have been there. There was simply no space or chairs and many guests ended up standing the whole time and I felt really bad.

One of my best friends was invited but it slipped my mind to invite his parents, I hadn‚Äôt seen them in years and by the time that everything was about to be finalized, I realized my mistake.

He told me, ‚ÄúHey IvyTowerz, my parents and really upset that you didn‚Äôt invite them to your wedding. They still got you a gift though‚Äù

They gave me a check written for $200. It had been stashed away in a drawer for about two years as I had forgotten to cash it and to be honest, I felt really bad about the circumstances. Over the years, I have tried to get in contact with them various times but with no results, Facebook contact and trying to swing by their house as they live a few streets down from my parents.

Fast forward to a few weeks past, my wife and I have been having financial problems and we live paycheck to paycheck where our total income is split 33/33/33 to rent, bills and personal spending. We had a surprise over draft in our account and my wife was bringing up the check we had in the drawer and that we should use it now. 

I told her that considering what‚Äôs happened since the wedding, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable cashing that check and I doubt we would be able to. It would feel like essentially taking money straight from them and that too much time has passed and we‚Äôre not on good terms with the parents of my friend anymore.

My mum is treating it like a matter of life and death and the first and last things I hear from her in a day are always about jobs now. I have been home for 2 weeks and have applied for more than 20 jobs I like with no response yet, she's started randomly going into places and trying to arrange things on my behalf without asking first, I am trying to take responsibility for myself and do everything on my own rather than relying on my family (I haven't asked for money in more than a year, make my own dinner and do my own laundry etc) so it's not like I am a sponge in the house. 

Either way, she told me that she'd arranged an interview at a local restaurant and gave me the times, I have worked in catering before and have been looking for other opportunities so said I didn't want to go the interview and I would prefer to handle it on my own and that she should stop worrying about me so much.

She seemed very hurt when I said this and there has been a very obvious tension in the house since, am I being short sighted or bratty for not being grateful or am I right that I should be able to take control of this and not have to go to the interview and potentially accept the job.

P.s I fully appreciate how much she cares about me to do this but it feels suffocating at times."		1	0

bxnfg3	2019-06-06 23:15:01		AITA for not wanting to visit Gma with Breast Cancer?	"Throwaway just in case I get bombarded with messages. I (18F) recently found out my grandmother has Stage 1 Breast Cancer. She‚Äôs incredibly upset about this, along with the rest of my family. She has a procedure to get her cancerous tumor removed in a few weeks, after meeting with the surgeon today. I still live with only my dad at the time, and have already seen how upset he is. I‚Äôm also upset, however from what I know (or at least think I know) is that breast cancer isn‚Äôt very dangerous if it‚Äôs caught in stage one. I could be very wrong about this, but it‚Äôs left me feeling a lot less worried than it seems I should be. 

The other issue, which happens to be the main reason I don‚Äôt want to visit, is my depression. This may be incredibly selfish, and I‚Äôm willing to let people of reddit tell me that. I‚Äôve struggled with depressed all through my teenage years, and the slightest thing like seeing my grandma upset will trigger an episode of some sort. I‚Äôm already in a depressive episode after seeing how upset my father has been. It would likely make it even worse. Mind you, I‚Äôve been getting my life together lately, and I‚Äôm finally going to go to college this fall after dropping out of high school a year ago to get my GED for the same reasons. My mental health has drastically improved, but this type of stuff may totally throw me off track. 

We‚Äôve never been super close like how I was with my grandma on my mother‚Äôs side who passed from lung cancer (I mean, she did smoke, it was bound to happen unlike this grandmother). This makes it harder, as I‚Äôve never felt completely invited and comfortable around my dad‚Äôs side of the family. They do a lot for me involving money, but emotionally I‚Äôve never felt like they were really there for me, besides my dad of course. 

All in all, I‚Äôll probably go see her this weekend in order to keep peace and not be a total asshole, but just not wanting to go at all makes me feel awful. So, reddit, AITA?"		1	0

Recently, 2 of her friends (who were married to each other) had a freak accident happen where the husband crashed his car, was hospitalized, and they pulled the plug on him. The wife took it hard (understandably) and yesterday my gf went to her place to help out with the chaos happening.

The 2 friends had a son together, I believe he's 4ish? 5ish? I got a text today from my gf saying she wants us as a couple to be there for the mom and kid, and my gf and her friend want me to be a role model towards the kid.

I hate kids. I really do. I told my gf when we first started dating that I don't really like kids and don't plan on having any.  And I don't have a problem with the mom, but I barely know her. My gf doesn't hang out with them much because they live almost an hour away. Besides all that, I'll be the first to admit I am NOT role model material. My mom sucked and my dad wasn't really around much to be a role model.

I told my gf that the best I could do right now is say I'd think about it. But that's totally to buy my ass some time to tell her no. Because I don't need that responsibility on my plate. I'm literally going to propose to my gf tomorrow so we have to plan on the wedding, I'm in the process of starting a new job (today was day 3) which is stressful work and I'm not sure it's a good fit for me, which is adding to my financial stress because I don't know if I'll stay with the new job or not.

So WIBTA if I told my gf no?

TL;DR: My girlfriend and her friend want me to be a role model to a kid I barely know and don't like."	No A-holes here	0	0

bxnccc	2019-06-06 23:07:03	palemoonliiight	WIBTA if I refuse to ever see my stepsister again?	"Hi all. About a year and a half ago, I was away from home at university staying in residency on campus. For the purpose of this post, details aren't necessary, so I'm going to cut to the chase. My house back in my hometown, where my parents still lived, was destroyed by a fire that my stepsister purposely started. No one was in the home at the time except for our pets, one of which died in the fire and the other which had to be resuscitated. We lost just about everything, the damage was irreparable, and my parents had to relocate. My stepsister was charged with arson and sentenced to serve time in prison.

So. Yeah.

How could I be TA here, right? Well, to provide a bit of context, my stepsister (late 20's btw) is mentally unwell and had been for several years before this whole thing happened. She tried to seek help but for one reason or another, it clearly was not effective. I don't know if she received any clinical diagnoses, but she was mentally ill to the degree that she wasn't completely in touch with reality. She began lying excessively and her mood swings grew more and more extreme, among multiple other worrying behaviours. I don't know what prompted her to light our house on fire, but she was definitely unhinged before it happened, so there is that. The thing is though, she was trying to get better.

One more thing - I don't know what her motive was, but I am pretty certain that this was a spiteful, hateful act. I think that some sort of beef went down between her and my parents. I don't ask about it. I'm sure you can understand why.  Lastly, they did check if she was mentally stable enough to stand trial, and they found that she was.

Even worse, my stepmother still keeps pictures of her up at home. A few relatives and family friends have said that they ""hope she gets the help she needs."" But I don't have any sympathy or empathy for her. As a person with mental illness myself\*, I don't care if she gets well, and I really never want to see her ever again. She is dead to me.

I'm not sure if my family will even want to see her themselves, but in the case that they do, I plan to refuse to have anything to do with her and will not ever be involved in anything she is apart of. AITA if I stand my ground on this? Should I make an effort to forgive her? Or am I entitled to feel this way about all of this?

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the feedback so far! I'm already learning of new perspectives to consider. But just to make a few things clear that I can already see are common themes of concern in the comments:

* I want all my of family members to make this decision for themselves. I don't think anyone would be wrong to accept my stepsister back into their lives. I'm only asking if I am TA for not wanting to do so myself.
* \* - I do not think my mental struggles are comparable to hers *at all*. I only mentioned my own mental illness experience to illustrate that I understand the *importance of treatment*, **NOT** that I understand *what she is going through*. **I don't want her to stay sick either**. I just don't actively hope for her to get better.
* If it matters, I'm 20F."	Not the A-hole	0	0

It‚Äôs effectively cheating I think but it‚Äôs an online test so I immediately think it might as well be an open book test so I‚Äôve agreed to help him time to time. My friend has been stressing over the last month for this exam and asked me if I‚Äôd promise to help him which I tried to do. My schedule has been busy lately since starting summer classes and I‚Äôm currently going through my own personal problems so I‚Äôm seeing my friend less but I‚Äôve tried to make time for him to help him specifically with this test and twice he flaked on me. He‚Äôs also going through some personal issues I can relate to (I‚Äôd rather not share too many details sorry) and I‚Äôve thought for a while that he might need professional help but he hasn‚Äôt sought it out despite the times I‚Äôve brought it up to him. Yesterday he asked me if I could help him and I had some time after class so I told him to come over so we could get it done and maybe catch up. He doesn‚Äôt show and the next day I get a bunch of messages asking for help. I let him know that I wasn‚Äôt able to today and he essentially blew up at me and wants to completely throw away our friendship. We‚Äôve had fights like this before I‚Äôm not proud to say I‚Äôve said things I regretted in the past but the reasoning for him being mad at me is that he feels that I never help him and that I‚Äôm a shitty friend.

TL;DR : I help my friend time to time on his online class exams. I tried to make time to help him and he never showed. The final day he could take his exam he asked for help I told him I couldn‚Äôt and he thinks I‚Äôm an asshole.

She moved to California and then came back home yesterday. On Facebook she told me she got me a shirt and I was really excited. I told her I was her boyfriend's size, and he is a really big and tall guy just like me.

She comes all the way from California to Georgia and everything is fine. She gets really excited and says she got something for me. The first thing she hands me is an empty cardboard box of cookies from a Mexican store. She said she ate the cookies but thought I would like the clown character on the box? She thought that me, being an artist I would appreciate the artwork? It was okay, but I could easily go down to the Spanish store and pick out a box like that.

So she finally gives me the shirt. Okay, two gifts. I say thanks.

The next day I try it on and it doesn't fit. I tell her and say she can give it back to her boyfriend. But she says it doesn't fit him. But like, I told her I was his size beforehand. And she gets really pissy and starts yelling at me and saying how I have bad vibes and I'm toxic. And then she finally says that she got it from Goodwill.

I then later text her asking her why she would give me these shitty presents from Cali. She hasn't responded yet. I just feel really hurt and like she doesn't care about me. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I graduated high school last year and am in college now. As I was in the music program in high school, I still have friends who are in their last year of high school this year.

Characters (fake names obviously) Me as me
Kate as ‚Äúthe girl I‚Äôm interested in‚Äù
Justine as friend my age
Olivia as her sister
Others nameless

Kate is in her last year of high school. She‚Äôs in the same class as Olivia, who so happens to be Justine‚Äôs sister, a girl whom I‚Äôve been very close with since kindergarten and she‚Äôs also in college. 

Kate has always been ‚Äúpopular‚Äù in her class but, as we all do, realized high school drama isn‚Äôt important and started growing up. Olivia and other girls aren‚Äôt quite there yet and interpret Kate as acting like a complete bitch. Her maturity impressed me a lot and, feeling like we have complicity, we started seeing each other lately. Since I‚Äôve been friends with Justine for so long, I‚Äôve also been close with Olivia. 

Olivia has expressed her displeasement with Kate and has said some nasty things about her behind her back (I was supposed to keep those secret.) Other girls in the class were also there the night Olivia talked smacked and added in some more. I felt very uncomfortable and, as I really like Kate, I felt like I needed to tell her about it. So I did.

Kate and I laughed about it that night and carried on with our date. 

Everything was fine until Kate confronted Olivia and the other girls about it. Now, Olivia is super pissed at me and told me I was an asshole for ‚Äúsnitching just to get laid‚Äù. Even Justine came forward and told me I was being an asshole, ‚Äúespecially after 12 years of friendship‚Äù and that ‚Äúshe couldn‚Äôt believe I could betray their trust like that‚Äù.

bxn9fz	2019-06-06 22:59:22	XirallicBolts	AITA for wanting the money from selling my wife's car?	"The situation is over and resolved already, but a work discussion brought it back into my mind.  I've heard both that I am the asshole (being justified) and not the asshole (being selfish) from friends and family.  

For finances, it's pretty straightforward.  Separate bank accounts. She (29/F) works part-time and pays for her cell phone, food, fuel, and student loans.   I (29/M) work fulltime/overtime out of state and pay for all utilities, registrations, insurances, etc.  

For her birthday, I paid off the outstanding balance on her car (~$4,500) as a gift. Several months later, I decided I needed a bigger car and purchased a crossover.  I gave her my old car which, compared to her Prius, was newer / bigger / better equipped / lower mileage / better overall condition.  At that time, her Prius was worth $3,000 and the car I gave her $6,500.  

We sold the Prius for $2,500 and the discussion of where to deposit the check came up.  She felt she was entitled to it, as it was her car we sold.  I felt I was entitled, as I gave her a more valuable vehicle in exchange for selling her car.   During this time, we were also planning the wedding/honeymoon which I was also paying 100% for. 


I can see her side -- I make more than she does, so she deserves a nice bonus.  But at the same time, I essentially just gave away my car with no compensation, since she intended to use the money towards hair/nails/etc, while I was intending to use the money towards the wedding and paying off the mortgage.


It's been amicably resolved now, but I'm curious how most people would feel about the situation."	No A-holes here	0	0

bxn7eu	2019-06-06 22:54:06	KabobsterLobster	AITA for blaming my mother for my social anxiety?	"My mother has some kind of anxiety disorder (or other mental disorder, hard to tell) that she has refused to get any kind of help for. It has made being in my family difficult. She is judgemental, ignores my feelings, and overall is very strict and doesn't allow me to have much freedom.   


For example, I am not allowed to drive anywhere in a friend's car. I am not allowed to ride my bike alone, even though we live in a very safe area with little traffic. I am barely allowed to spend time with friends at all, or at least I wasn't when I was a bit younger. People realized I could never go anywhere and either assumed I was trying not to be their friend or got sick of asking. I don't even bother maintaining friendships, partly because I am anxious around people, partly because I just don't know how, partly because I know that it will be a strictly in-school or at church relationship, and there simply isn't a point in trying.   


I have terribly low self esteem and social anxiety, and I struggle to get a job because of it. I see a psychologist who blames my parents (my father enables her poor behavior) but I wonder if he would believe differently if he had her side of the story.   


My mother screams at me most days, gets upset when my grades are too low, and is unpleasant. I lie to her about grades and how I spend time, and I don't know how much of this is normal for an 18 year old. Then, 5 minutes after a massive argument, she acts like everything is fine and asks me to clean up the kitchen or something, but once my dad gets home it's back to blaming me for everything. I can't stand the yelling anymore but have nowhere to go, not even for a few hours to get away from it for a bit. Of course I yell back because I have my own opinions and I'm old enough to make some decisions (like where I want to go to college, whether I want to randomly walk into businesses asking for jobs, which hasn't worked in the past). I can't even leave the room to have some space for a few minutes or get away from a situation I don't feel safe or in control in.  


Am I the asshole here for blaming my mother for my issues? I can't even tell at this point. I talk to people at school, or try to at least, but it's been a while since I've had a meaningful friendship, and this is really impacting my life in a negative way (constantly anxious, anxiety attacks, can't find a job or make friendships)."

bxn6vy	2019-06-06 22:52:44		AITA for blowing off someone's bucks	"So 16 years ago I dated someone who was frankly a bit of a prick. She was a tom boy, loud, rude and mean to me. She also had a messed up past. In a year we hadnt engaged in any 'together' activity... so I dumpped her.  I'm sure she told friends I was pushy and made her do things. At parties she would boast about how many guys she dated and how much sex she got when I know she couldn't even kiss someone without crying. Was so weird.

About a month later I started dating a friend of a friend of hers as rebound who turned out to be the one. 15 years, two kids, a house and being semi successful a weddings come up. 

The mutual friend is now getting married. I've been invited to the grooms bucks. My wife hasn't been invited to the hens... 

I'm about to decline the bucks and pretty much say no thanks to then as people because they are dog people with two huge dogs living in a tiny tiny apartment in the city. Their dogs wouldn't hurt a fly kinda people. Doesn't help they are cross breed pit bulls. 

I so incredibly positive all the time and say yes to everyone and all friendships but now I feel like a complete asshole about to cut them outta our lives basically because they aren't adults or know how to let anything go. I know if I stop talking to them them my wife's gonna also ask why and I'm gonna say look, they just aren't nice people. They are nice in a sense they are civil but they are terrible in that they don't treat us like friends more like people they have to entertain on the side. My wife was friends with the woman for 10 years before this. 

Maybe it was my fault for not enough degrees of separation and it's something we have to live with. That said my best friend from high school turned into a bit of a dick and now lives in a share house with uni students and a family of 4 with 2 dogs and routinely cheats on his with with teenagers. I cut ties with him after about 3-4 years of this behaviour. Choose your friends right. I just feel like a dick for blowing off the guys bucks, he has 5 people going to it and I don't Wana spend our time investing a relationship into them if they just keep us at arms length when it suits them.

&#x200B;

So, I ran for Treasurer and Parliamentarian. So did my friend who I run a ""business"" with (We sell candy. I do the selling, he does the buying so my parents don't find out. Important later.) I eventually ended up losing, and my friend won, but tied with someone else. They had another election between just the two of them. We posted the google forum voting link on the Discord (Both of them.) We did not say it shouldn't be transferred out of the discord, but it was implied. Someone who did last year got a slap on the hand. Everyone knew the story (including my friend), so we all thought no one would do it. 

&#x200B;

At the beginning of the year, a bunch of Freshman showed up to the weekly meetings on Fridays (technically we meet everyday but official meetings are Fridays.) After a couple competitions, they stopped showing up. The Constitution of the Club states that they would have to have 50% weekly attendance to vote, which they barely did. We all completely forgot they even showed up. Apparently not my friend.

&#x200B;

My friend decided to send the link to all of the freshman the link and tell them to vote for him. Potential bribery with candy involved, nothing confirmed about that though. I went to the robotics room during lunch, and the new president told me that my friend had a surprisingly high amount of votes, and the people voting names' didn't look familiar. I immediately knew what he had done, and started rattling off some of the names I thought to be there. He nodded at almost all of them. So, I'm mad because this could have happened for the first election (the one I lost in), but we have no way of telling because that one was done by a script. I was suspicious, so I contacted most of the freshmen. (8 out of 9 contacted.) I have heard back from 5, and all 5 said they were sent the link.

&#x200B;

I sent the screenshots of this to the President, who said it was too late to do anything. I insisted that we should do something, because  we both thought it didn't feel right. He said he would contact the other board members. Minutes later, I'm getting Discord messages from my other friend, telling me he didn't like the first friend's methods of getting people to vote for him. (Keep in mind he has no idea what was happening between me and the president.) All three of us feel it wasn't right, and the President said he was going to reveal a detail to me after the 2nd election finishes (2:30pm tomorrow.) He also said it would piss me off.

&#x200B;

I am concerned I am going to lose a friend and a business partner, and I really don't want that to happen.

We have exhibits that meet different ages. Some are large and open for little ones to run. Others are text-based and more artistic or conceptual. A lot in between.  
I was working in a text-based conceptual exhibit. It's cramped, full of people, and full of glass display cases. My job is to explain and tell the stories behind the pieces, while keeping troublemakers in check.  
  
Today, a child around 8 years old is running full speed through the crowds of people. He is essentially doing laps. I ask him to use his walking feet and he just keeps on running. He nearly takes out a toddler as he rounds a corner.  
I find the adult he's with and very politely ask for her help in making sure he stops running. I say he could hurt another guest, trip and fall into glass, tip over a stroller with an infant in it, etc. I let the adult know there's an outdoor play area super close to the exhibit where he can burn off some steam.  
She quips me with ""Well he has a disability so I'll *try my best*."" as she proceeds to do absolutely nothing. While I'm walking toward my walkie to ask for help, the kid tries to pickpocket my phone from my back pocket. Again, I let the adult know, who insulted me for not respecting disabled children and left the exhibit.  
 
I went to my next shift cleaning an area with coworkers. I'm lamenting about the situation, telling the story just as I did and venting to people who might understand where I'm coming from. I was stressed and sad.

 My mom has also not worked in retail and is generally the customer who will always return an item to get a discount (I‚Äôm talking a couple of dollars nothing major). I hate shopping with her because she always has to try to bend the rules and get shit for no reason. 
I told her another store can do it right now (another one of my friends works there and I asked if they were open and they were). However, they charge $14 and we charge $7.

bxn4l1	2019-06-06 22:46:28	sasasasasasansa	AITA For Having Drunken Sex With My Male Best Friend Before Moving Away?	"A few months ago, I got out of a long-term relationship that was pretty dramatic. It made me think about how I was living my life and spending my time, so I decided two things: 

**1) I would move away for the summer and spend time investing in my interests and self-care.** 

**2) I would not date anyone seriously.** 

My two closest friends (male and female) have been in the loop about all of this. My male best friend (let's call him Kevin), has been particularly supportive and seemingly on the same page about my decisions. He bore witness to the terrible end of my relationship. He has literally seen me end two flings in the past three months because both guys wanted something more serious despite being told upfront, in both instances, that I did not want anything serious.  

So there's no possible way he didn't know what I was/was not looking for. 

About a week ago, we were at my going away party (at my house) and got pretty wine drunk. I asked him if it would be crazy (whilst wine drunk) if we made out, as long as it didn't ruin our friendship. He said it wouldn't and could just be for fun. We ended up having sex, which again, I prefaced with: MAYBE WE SHOULD NOT DO THIS IF IT WILL RUIN OUR FRIENDSHIP.

He said it wouldn't. 

We even talked the next morning and agreed we were both fine and on the same page. Cut to the night before I left. He asked if we could talk and asked why I had wanted to sleep with him. I said that I didn't have a good answer, but felt he was a good person and a good friend I felt I could trust. 

Then, he told me that when we first met, he had a massive crush on me (two years ago about), and asked if I thought we should date. 

I was floored. I told him pretty much what I told those other guys - that I did not want to start anything, felt I was not ready for a relationship, and that I needed to work on myself more before getting involved with anyone. I told him I didn't know and didn't know what to say. He seemed fine when I left, but now finding out that he's upset and that yes, our friendship is essentially ruined. 

I feel like I'm not the asshole because I was completely transparent with my intentions. I never led him on or made him think this was something serious. I also feel like he's kind of the asshole for not telling me that he had any kind of feelings for me before we slept together."	No A-holes here	0	0

My family and I flew back earlier than them, and we told them ahead of time they were not going to pick them up and to call an Uber. They have never used Uber, but are going to be flying back with my sister in law. They made some comments about not wanting to do it. 

My mother in law does not have a smart phone. My father in law was a computer hardware engineer and it's a smart guy. I'm confident he can figure it out. My sister in law lives in another country, and has never used Uber, but is somewhat tech savvy. 

We are going to a beer festival that day and do not want to drive to pick them up Saturday night at 9pm because of that. We have been wanting to go to this festival for 3 years, but have missed it every time due to something coming up. We live about 30 minutes from the airport, and there is a 10-12$ toll both ways.

They are incredibly supportive people, and they are both retired. They also watch my kid for free one day a week every week.  Money isn't really an issue for them, but I think the Uber is about $40 if there is no surge charge. I'm fine with paying for that, but I think they are more nervous about using technology than anything else. My parents have taken an Uber to and from the airport, although I have picked them up and dropped them off before. 

We have thought about sending an Uber or cab, but I think that will be difficult. We just found out they have not even downloaded the app and the flight is in two days. They claimed they are close to going over the data on their plan, and the wifi at the hotels has been poor.

bxn3ij	2019-06-06 22:43:39	elCapitan310	WIBTA for firing a contractor for calling me sexist?	"**TL;DR:**  

Employee \[F\] told me I'm not paying her enough because other employee \[M\] is making more than her. I believe I am justified in the pay discrepancy due to the specialization of each person's field. AITA?

&#x200B;

**Post:**

I started a company 8 months ago (we are both male undergraduates). I did tech and finances, he did the product design and client acquisition. 

&#x200B;

I have a friend who majors in finance (G), and I approached her about three months ago to work as a contractor specifically to help us with our finances ($1000 per month, she works about 10hrs per week).

I was also approached by another finance major to do similar work, but I decided to go with G because I knew her.

&#x200B;

Last month, I hired a grad student friend (B) for product optimization. His work is complex and highly specialized. We agreed to about $2000 per month and he works about 10 hours a week as well. TBH, he is giving me a pretty hefty discount for the work he is doing: A general contractor quoted me $4000/month. 

&#x200B;

They both bring in similar amounts of direct profit (though B brings more in long-term profit).

&#x200B;

Yesterday, G found out that B was making about twice as much as her (I don't know how), and demanded she be paid the same amount. I told her I would be happy to give her a raise, but it wouldn't be double. She then called me sexist and said that I only pay B as much as I do because he is a man.

&#x200B;

I was very taken aback by this for two reasons:

1. B's work can only really be done by B. His specialization is what makes him so valuable which was why I was willing to pay him so much. G's work on the other-hand, though valuable to the company, isn't nearly as specialized, which G knows.
2. The concept that I was making decisions in a sexist manner threw me. She seemed very happy with her contract when I presented it to her, and it seems fair because the other finance major offered his services for $750 a month. The only way I came to my decision for each of their salaries was their relative market worth.

&#x200B;

Anyways, she told me she wouldn't do any more work unless she was paid $2000 a month. I told her I would be willing to pay her $1250/month, but if that was unacceptable, I'd pay out the remainder of the month and release her from her contractual obligations. She called me an asshole, told me that I was being sexist, and would report me to the dean.

&#x200B;

I haven't made a formal decision so third party input would be helpful: 

&#x200B;

1. AITA? Could I have handled the conversation better?
2. Am I being sexist? I really don't think I am, but we all have implicit biases.
3. What should I do? (Should I fire her, double her paycheck, or try and compromise?)
4. Are there any potential professional or legal repercussions for firing her?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxn314	2019-06-06 22:42:20		AITA for getting mad at my father-in-law's disrespectful joke?	"Last weekend my wife and I went to my father-in-law's house for dinner. We was all joking around and having a good time, when my father-in-law jokingly called my wife a bitch. I was furious. I told him he might be her dad, and it might be a joke, but I am not going to let another man call my wife out a bitch.

My wife got mad at me, and refused to leave me. She told me that I overreacted. My father-in-law even called and apologized to me, and said he respects the way I stood up for his daughter. Even after her father's apology, my wife still has me in the doghouse. She claims she doesn't need a man to stick up for her.

It's just the principle of the fact, I expect people to respect my wife. She is my other half, she is my wife, any insult to her is an insult to me. That's just the way I feel about things, you can call me old-fashioned if you want to."		1	0

We have a single car driveway so our only option to not get in each other‚Äôs way is to park on the street with one person in the driveway. There is no street parking rules where I live if that means anything. So getting to the story about 10 months ago I had a talk with my neighbor about where I had started to park my car. I park about half and half on both properties (more on mine and behind a tree on hers) because if I move up an inch further I am blocking someone‚Äôs driveway on the other side of the street ( I am already slightly in their way)  and I rather not block them or have them hit my car trying to get out! My neighbor understood and just said ‚Äúat least I don‚Äôt have an ugly car‚Äù and we carried on. Fast forward to today... she threatened to call the cops on me or have her ex cop friend deal with it for her. She said that I am almost in her driveway! I am literally about 10  or more feet from her driveway, but she is an old woman so I didn‚Äôt fight with her and I moved my car so now I am blocking these poor people from backing out of their driveway. She told me that she didn‚Äôt want to look at my car anymore even though it completely contradicts everything she told me 10 months ago. She said she couldn‚Äôt see it and that she has no windows facing it in rooms that she uses.   She wanted me to park my car in front of my boyfriends car even though it would block emergency vehicles from passing due to another car on the road on the other side of the street. I don‚Äôt know what to do here. I rather not have any interactions with cops for personal reasons. So the question is WIBTA if I kept parking where I was or should I just get over it and move my car?

bxn1cf	2019-06-06 22:37:59	nanapple	AITA for not staying at the hospital until my friends surgery was finished?	" This was a few months ago, but my friend keeps bringing this up. It was a weekend and I and two other friends were messing with 120 rubber ducks(I had bought them in bulk because they were really cheap). Let's call these friends R and J. We were talking about how stupid I was to buy a bunch of rubber ducks, and then I showed them a cool trick. I took the squeaker out of a rubber duck and blew air through it, causing a prolonged squeak. Quickly, they followed suit. However, J took the squeaker, shoved it in his mouth and tried to say something through it, he said hello which sounded like a high pitched, ""Hewwo"" and we all laughed at it. It was only until he tried it again and accidentally inhaled it. This caused him to squeak whenever he would breath, R recorded it. Of course, we ended up at the ER that night(R did not go with us, it was me, my mom, and J) where we learned that he'd have to have it removed by a scope(so no incisions would be made).

 While we were in the ER, he asked if we could stay with him all night since his mother couldn't stay with him because she had to look after another family member(His mother showed up only for times that paperwork needed to be signed, but for the most part, verbal consent was given over the phone). We had agreed, and he asked us to promise, which we did. So we stayed all night in the ER(There were no rooms for us to stay in.) with only blankets in tow. Since the ER room only had 2 hard chairs besides the bed for the patient, let's just say it was a rough night, we couldn't sleep an ounce. By 8 am, we had learned that he would be having it removed soon and that was around the time his mom came to watch him. 

 My mother(she stayed with me that night) and I both agreed that we should head home. Despite us staying the whole night, J wanted us to stay until after the surgery(once again there wasn't going to be any incisions, they were just sending down a scope into his lung to retrieve the squeaker). However, we really couldn't stay any longer, my mother and I were both exhausted from the lack of sleep. So we left, despite what J wanted.

 J often brings up how we didn't hold true to our promise of staying by his side through the surgery, so I have to ask, AITA?

TL DR: Friend got a squeaker in his bronchial tube, we stayed all night because we promised him we would, but the exhaustion caught up with us after no sleep, so we went home before his surgery even though he wanted us to wait till after."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxn058	2019-06-06 22:34:57	uce_kefe	AITA if I didn't go to my friends wedding even though he's invited me? But hasn't formally invited me.	"Abit of back story, one of my close friends from high school is of Polynesian heritage. Won't say which island specifically (his soon to be wife is on reddit constantly and it might give it away). And in their culture, weddings are big, and I mean BIG and IMPORTANT! I know cause I'm also of Polynesian descent.

He's getting married this month, on the 15th which is next week. He's messaged me personally and has invited me, I'm also on the rsvp list.

So whats the problem you may ask?

Problem is, I haven't received a proper invitation to the wedding? Like where the location is, what time it starts, can I bring a plus 1 etc... All our other mates have received theirs 2 months prior, but not me. I've told him about it but mostly got the seen or no reply. Our mates have informed me about all the details of the wedding and tell me to just come, but some Polynesian weddings don't work like that, no invitation, no getting in. I don't want to cause scene if I show up without a proper invite.

I understand it's his wedding and he's probably busy organizing things for the big day. But it would be nice to actually know if I'm invited. We've known each other since the age of 14, never negative to each other, no beef, just close friends.

&#x200B;

So AITA if I don't go?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just to clarify and add, if it may seem that I'm overthinking or stressing about this, it's because I work most weekends and need to put in leave on the day of the wedding. Also, AGAIN! If you read it properly, I have reached out to him but no reply on his end.

No the invite didn't get lost or anything because they personally delivered the invites months ago."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"First, there was no overt drama or disrespect from her friend, I just genuinely dislike her and end up retreating to the bedroom whenever she's over. I've tried to be friendly and have conversation with her (despite not sharing any interests) and she laughs like I just told a hilarious joke when I'm just trying to have normal conversation. My wife laughs in response, drowning out what I was trying to say. Recently she was over for dinner and she and my wife decided what to cook, but I ended up doing 90% of the work because they didn't plan out the meal and were too distracted to do the cooking. I feel my wife plays off of her and treats me like an inferior when she's around.

Should I tell my wife she's not welcome at our house? I don't plan to forbid the friendship, I just don't want her around.

She moved to better her career 4 years ago. She didn‚Äôt pay rent for the first couple of months as she was building her clientele and only making a little bit enough to cover other bills. Which was fine. I was able to afford it even before she moved in. And she stayed home to cook and clean often. She had to travel once a week every month for work and needed rides to and from the airport. Sometimes she traveled 2 separate weeks in a month. Well I told her I would do that for her when I could but only for the first 2 years of her living here as I was so often driving her back and forth from the airport multiple times. Sometimes as early as 5/6 in the morning and midnights to pick her up on my work days and on my days off. We live 30 min away from the airport which leaves me traveling an hour or more with traffic. And instead of paying for my gas she‚Äôll pay me with food. Well after 4 years of it I‚Äôm kinda sick of having to pick her up I just want to go to sleep or chill at home. Now she has a long distance boyfriend and comes to visit her now every few months. She asked me if I could take her and him to the airport and I didn‚Äôt say no but she got mad that I didn‚Äôt say yes.

bxmwy4	2019-06-06 22:26:22	armrestt	WIBTA if I said something that could ruin my friend‚Äôs relationship?	"First post here, on mobile so sorry for any formatting problems. 

TL;DR: My friend talks about how she wants to marry a black man and have black babies. She recently started going out with someone, he is of colour. WIBTA if i told him what she‚Äôs said.

Hey guys!! This is a situation I‚Äôve been struggling with, and I wanted to consult an outside point of view before doing anything. 

I‚Äôve known this girl (17f), we‚Äôll call her T, since year seven. We are now in year eleven. For years she has made comments about how much she wants to marry a black man, she wants to have little black babies, she wants to shock her conservative parents by having a black husband, etc. 

She recently started talking about a guy (17m) she is seeing. I think they‚Äôve been on one or two dates, and talking online a lot. I haven‚Äôt really looked into him much, it‚Äôs her business and I‚Äôm happy for her but don‚Äôt (didn‚Äôt?) want to be involved. My other friend was talking to me, and mentioned he was black/of colour, and that T has been talking about this fact a lot. I talked about it with the other friend and we feel like she is fetishising (is that too strong of a word?) him to an extent, and honestly I‚Äôm worried for him. From the little I‚Äôve heard he sounds like a nice guy who genuinely likes her.

The other part of this that makes me uncertain if I should talk to him is that this is her first relationship. She has low self confidence, constantly talks about how no man could ever love her, and gets angry/judgemental when her friends get in relationships (I‚Äôm assuming jealousy but I am not certain, there could be other things going on I do not know about). So this relationship is a big deal and I don‚Äôt want to hurt her in any way. But I‚Äôm really uncomfortable with the way she talks about him, and other men of colour. She kinda groups them all together? I am really really sorry if I have been in any way racist during this, please let me know. 

So would I be the asshole if i reached out to him and let him know what she has been saying, when it could potentially ruin the first relationship she‚Äôs ever had. 

Thank you so much in advance.

EDIT: I was definitely being the asshole, i‚Äôm so glad i asked you guys before saying anything. Thank you to everyone who posted, and showed me that i was being kinda ridiculous. And definitely overthinking. I‚Äôll talk to her about him (not about this) and try to get to know them and show my support!! I should‚Äôve been happy for her, maybe I was jealous? I‚Äôm not sure. Anyway, thank you!!"	Asshole	0	0

bxmwtz	2019-06-06 22:26:05	Newparents2019	AITA for not letting my mom see her grandchild until she sees therapist due to her actions?	"Throwaway account used. Written by my wife and I. 

We had our first child early this year and created basic rules such as no kissing on the lips, no posting pictures in social media(baby can‚Äôt consent), no screen time(science says bad before 2 years old), etc. 

About 3 months ago my mom kissed my daughter close to her lips and I reminded her not to kiss her on the lips. Instantly she kissed her on the lips.  We were disgusted because 1. She was chewing gum and 2. A kiss on the lips can be very harmful and deadly to a not fully vaccinated newborn and much safer to just simply kiss them on their foreheads. We resolved this issue after about 3-4 weeks as we needed an apology and for her to meet with a psychologist as she needs to respect our wishes as parents. 

about a month ago, we went to dinner at a busy restaurant with my brother and mom. My mom was feeding our newborn when some of her acquaintances who none of had seen in ten years stopped by. While I was talking to the husband. I turn my head and all of a sudden the wife is holding my baby and my wife and I look at each other in horror. Obviously we couldn‚Äôt cause a scene because this essential stranger is holding our child. I started making moves to get her back. We told my mother has irresponsible that was, the most dangerous part of holding a newborn is the passing off and someone sitting handing a baby to someone standing is dangerous especially with waiters and waitresses walking around. Plus She didn‚Äôt even ask to hold her nor were ready. This is a baby not a toy. 

We were so angered by this and told her, her response was ohh I‚Äôm paying for your meal get over yourselves. I then talked to my father and told him and her that she could not hold our baby for 30 days in public aka restaurants, but could still see her and the like. She refused to see the baby at all. On Mother‚Äôs Day It was about 2 weeks later (my wife‚Äôs first) and everything seemed to be getting better even though we haven‚Äôt seen each other since the incident on her request. 

The 1st thing she did upon sitting down was request to hold the baby in yet another busy restaurant. I reminded her that she can‚Äôt because she still hasn‚Äôt even acknowledged how what she did was irresponsible. She then told us that if she can‚Äôt hold the baby right then and there we should leave and if we leave we are no longer members of the family etc. We promptly left as we discussed this in advance that we need to stand our ground.  (Privilege warning). She then revoked our membership to their country club, canceled my family credit card, threatened to cancel my phone, removed us from the family group chat, among other more minor items. 

We then told her she cannot see her grandchild until she sees a therapist. I really want to maintain a relationship. My mom doesn‚Äôt talk to any member of her family due to issues and this I can‚Äôt talk to that whole side. She still has not seen a therapist and apparently they have been calling everywhere to get her an appointment. Are We the Assholes?

"I live in a development of town houses, so it‚Äôs a lor of people close together, and a lot of them have dogs. This is a problem for me cause my dog doesn‚Äôt like other dogs. (We got her when she was a year old and she‚Äôs always been that way.) So walking her at certain times is a pain. Either she barks at other dogs and tries to run away. Today while walking her a lab mix zoomed in out of seemingly no where and started circling my dog and I. I saw a girl chasing it around. I yelled and told her she should keep the dog on a leash. I don‚Äôt care if your dog is ‚Äúwell behaved‚Äù. You never know what will happen. The other dog kept getting right up in my dog‚Äôs face and I got scared. My dog just kinda froze and cowered, I was afraid it would have gotten ugly. The girl and dog just kept circling around. The girl said nothing, which I find a bit rude. She seemed like she was 12, old enough to say something. After about a minute I said ‚ÄúReally???‚Äù cause I was sick of it. It scared the shit out of me and my dog. 

Afterwards I felt bad cause maybe the dog got out, but I like I said I hate it when people don‚Äôt have their dogs on a leash. We‚Äôre too close together. I do keep my dog on a leash cause she doesn‚Äôt always listen so to let her out means taking a walk on a leash. 

TL;DR: my dog hates other dogs, so I yelled at a girl defensively for not having her dog on a leash cause it kept circling us."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

My dad joined the military and they had my next sibling on my moms 18th birthday. My brother is 28, the other kids range in age from 10-27. I grew up taking care of my siblings, my mom and dad expected me to basically help raise their younger kids. Because of this I have no interest in having kids myself. My 23 year old sister pretty much took over my role and still lives at home. 

My mom is 46 she homeschools the 10,12,14, and 17 year olds. She has never worked although she doesn‚Äôt do chores or clean the kids chores cover that. Her and my dad bought a fixer upper he planned on fixing up when he retires in a few years, they plan on turning into an organic farm.

However now that‚Äôs all up in the air as my mom just announced this weekend she is pregnant again. She thought she was suffering from pre menopause..nope she‚Äôs pregnant. Thing is she also admitted she had not been taking her BC for the last year and had hoped to have one more child.

bxmtyj	2019-06-06 22:18:40	Tangosoid	AITA for being a picky eater?	"So first context is needed. I'm currently a student who begins uni in 2 years. I've lived almost my entire life with my mom and my brother. I've always been picky with food ever since I was little. 

A year ago my mom got a new boyfriend and pretty quickly he moved into the house. He's a big fan of food and likes to experiment with it. He cooks for us about three times a week because his job means he spends a lot of time at home anyways.

So here's where I come in. I'm a picky eater. It's not something I willingly choose to be, and I always at least try food before coming to a desision of weather I like it. The problem for me mainly is sauces, which I often dislike for their flavour (not all of them, but so far I dislike more then I like out of what I have tried). So my moms bf is very keen on sauces and likes to include them in a load of his cooking. So me naturally being me I try his foods but after a couple of bites I almost always dislike it.

I wanna clarify that I hate that I'm picky with foods. It's not a choice I made it's just always been this way. I always try to be polite as possible and have confronted my mom and her bf about it several times but they always take great offence to it as if I choose to dislike the food they make. Every time I don't enjoy it they always look at me with disgust and tell me that it's good, acting as if there's something wrong with me. At this point I feel like there is but idk anymore.

It's been like this ever since I was little, and I've always been seen as an asshole by my mom for it. I've even said I would be willing to prepare my own food to help not waste anything but they don't take me seriously (or at least thats what it seems like) so I've given up trying. At this point I'm scared to take down the food I don't like because I always feel like I'm gonna get lashed out on by my mom. 

Anyways AITA? At this point idk if there's just something wrong with me or not.

tl:dr = I have always been a picky eater and despite my proposals to cook for myself im always looked down upon as if I'm an asshole."	No A-holes here	0	0

Now, about an hour (I got home at 4:15PM so it was at about 5:30... extremely dark outside) after I got home I heard a loud and aggressive knock on the door; I know all of my neighbours well and they do come and knock if something is weird, for instance if I've accidentally locked my dog out (who won't wander, she just sits in the yard) they'll knock and call out for us. This knock was POUNDING on the door. I didn't answer it and they left pretty quickly without saying a word.

&#x200B;

We've had really sketchy people knock on our door so I'm overly cautious.

&#x200B;

This morning I went to take a bag of rubbish out and the front wooden door was unlocked. That's fine, as long as the screen door is locked... the screen door was WIDE FUCKING OPEN! I slept next to a completely unlocked door! I've been hearing noises in the attic for weeks, I genuinely think there's a person living in our attic and now fucking this? I'm bout to call the police to search my house I'm that upset about it."	Asshole	0	0

" I make decent money before child support, but after child support I don't make much. Well my ex texts me and asks me if I could give her money so she won't get evicted. Because of my kids normally I most likely would, except the timing is horrible for me. I made a mistake and have to face the consequences for it, Tuesday I have court for it. She asked me for basically all the money I have saved to pay for my court fines. If I have the money for my court fines, I can do weekend jail and keep my job which provides them insurance and continue to stay current with child support. If I give her said money, I can't pay my fines and disqualifies me for weekend jail and lose my job. That would in turn make them lose insurance and most likely a few months of no child support do to being in jail and looking for a new job. 
     She told me that if I don't help her they would be homeless. I told her that I would be more than happy and willing to take my kids for the summer while she figured things out. She refused and told me that she would just figure it out like always. I feel like my option of doing weekend jail instead of giving her money is more logical."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bxmnzg	2019-06-06 22:04:01	thr0wm3away999	AITA for not hiring my friend at my job?	"I suck at telling stories so hopefully this makes sense. A little back story: I‚Äôve been friends with Amy (not her real name) for about 20 years. We weren‚Äôt always close but became really close about 7 years ago. I‚Äôve always tried to be a good friend to her. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm a pushover and try to avoid conflict as much as possible.  

So we went to nursing school together and graduated together. It‚Äôs  always been my dream to work in long term care with the geriatric population. Amy however only wants to work in a hospital and would always look down on nurses who worked in long term care. She would always tell me she hated how nursing homes smelled bad and nurses belonged in hospitals. 

Well, I started working in long term care as a nurse manager and did the hiring of the nursing staff. Amy at this point has applied at various hospitals and none will give her a job. She finally caved in and gets a job in a nursing home but gets fired after 2 months for med errors and falsifying documentation. 

After she got fired she called me and asked me for a job. I told her we weren‚Äôt hiring at the time (which was true) and that i think it would be better if she applied elsewhere where the pay would be more. I even offered to help apply for jobs. 

Since then my friend has not talked to me or will not respond back to my texts. I be heard from mutualfriends it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt hire her at my workplace. 

I didn‚Äôt want to hire her because I know she‚Äôs usually really negative and always complaining about nursing homes. And I just don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve been wise to hire a childhood friend at my place of work because I didn‚Äôt want other coworkers to think I would be playing favoritism to her.

bxmmef	2019-06-06 22:00:35		WIBTA if I take revenge on my loud neighbour?	"So, here is the situation:
I live in a 1-bedroom apartment in a rather old house and recently the water pipes were replaced by newer ones. For this, a hole with about 5cm diameter was drilled through my floor so that I have now direct contact to my downstairs neighbours. While I tried to fill the hole with newspaper and put a blanket over it, I can still hear my neighbour speaking. He speaks very loudly on the phone every.single.night. 
I have a job for which I have to get up early, so I go early to bed. 

I already knocked on his door once and asked him to be a bit more quiet after 11pm. He agreed, but now, 3 days later, the same is happening. 

Since I know this guy also doesn't have a job and gets up late, I plan to take on revenge such as being loud on my own when I get ready for work in the morning.

Normally I would support the idea that the freedom of one person ends where other's rights are abriged and say that I am definitely NTA.
However, no one of us is responsible for the fact that there is a (temporary) hole in my floor.

He opens his home to them to take in all sorts of animals in need, even if it means his quality of life suffers.

He does a good job of taking care of them, even to his own financial detriment.. and it's a lot. Because he takes in older and ill animals. The vet bills are huge. He has had to go into credit card debt for them at times. But the worst part about it is watching the heart break every time one of these animals passes. 

Now, I'm not a heartless bastard, I know how hard it is to lose a beloved pet. But he had to put down another pet yesterday and... It makes 11 in 11 months that he has lost due to their deteriorating medical conditions. And I'm at the point where I dont know what to say or do to help console him when another one does, to the point where I am kind of giving him space each time he announces that another animal is nearing the end. I feel like a horrible person, but... I literally don't know what to say or do anymore, especially because I know it will be another animal in another month that he loses.

"This happened about 2 weeks ago, about 4 friends and I were hanging out and 2 of the friends had about $30 worth of weed in a jar and they were both really high and they forgot to grab the weed when we all left, I saw it and grabbed it, I don't know what I was thinking, or what I wanted to do with it. At this moment I didn't know who's weed it was because the first time I saw it was on the ground and I didn't hear any of them say it was theirs so I brought one of my friends aside and asked who's it was and he told me and said they stole it from someone and I don't know why but I asked him if they'd care if I took it and he said no so really stupidly I decided to keep it without thinking. Fast forward 20 minutes and they're looking for it and I felt really bad and I didn't know what to do because I knew I wasn't gonna take it but I can't just give it back to them at that point because they'd already been looking for it for 5 minutes so I went off pretending to look for it and pretended to find it and give it back to them. A couple days later one of my friends who wasn't there says the friend I told that I was gonna take the weed told the friend who owned the weed that I tried to steal it and the friend told a bunch of other people. The friend who owned the weed doesn't know that I know he found out because no one was supposed to tell me he knew so I can't talk to him about it without him getting mad at anyone else for telling me.

Background: my husband is the youngest of the kids. His older siblings are very successful in their careers. So is my husband, but we are in our early 30's. His siblings are quite a bit older - into their 40's. They have had much more time to develop their careers and grow their families. I would consider them to be in a much better position to take a lavish family vacation - from both a financial standpoint AND an age-of-their-kids standpoint. Our children are considerably younger, one of whom is a baby. 

The destination decisions that his siblings have made - without consulting either of us - are all ideas that are completely incongruent with the boundaries my husband and I verbally shared with his siblings. My husband and I said in no uncertain terms that we (our micro-family of this entire family, if you will) are not ready to invest in a trip to Disney World. Our children are not at the ages where we feel the considerably steep investment would be worthwhile, and we have multiple other obligations that require our funds.

So they are doing that this fall without us, evidently. Okay. Husband and I are both a little hurt, but not enough to live on Ramen Noodles for a year to afford a trip we don't want to go on yet.

Well. Now his siblings and parents talking about an ADDITIONAL family vacation (where is this endless fountain of money, and how can I get some???) to Hawaii in March 2020. My husband and I have already booked our anniversary trip for February 2020. We cannot possibly do both. We have small children. I shudder at the thought of being stuck in an aluminum tube with a restless one-year old for 2 lengthy legs of travel each way. I shudder at the thought of spending the majority of my family vacation trying to get my baby to stop putting sand in his mouth, and trying to either arrange naptimes or survive without naptime. Regardless, I'm now feeling some pressuring undertones from his siblings about how my husband and I need to agree to invest in this weeklong Hawaiian vacation with our small children, and how maybe we can alter our already-booked anniversary trip so that we can afford to do both.

Look. I WANT to go to Disney World - in a few years. I WANT to go to Hawaii - when our kids are older and don't require 100% supervision for safety at all times, so we can relax and enjoy. This assumption that we can all afford this lavishness is astounding to me. Its making my husband feel less than, and the full-court press i'm sensing from them is making me angry and resentful.

bxmekl	2019-06-06 21:41:25	Sthm008	AITA for wanting my parents out of my life asap?	"I am 18 years old and about to finish highschool. Ever since I was a kid there was shit going on in this house.

So mom was (and still is) a perfectionist and dad had alcohol problems. For like 3-4 years they would always fight about my dad's problem so bad that everytime I hear a fight there is this feeling inside me I can't explain, but it drives me crazy. I used to be put between this fights a lot. There was a point when they were about to get a divorce and dad went to his parents. Mom woke me up at 2 or 3 AM(around 10y old) to go to talk to him. Eventually my dad got over this.

I was close to finishing middle school. I was doing shit. Mom went crazy. Things didn't go so easy for me during that time. I was always put through moral stories and stuff about how I am useless and how I won't do anything in life. When I saw my results I started crying from happines. It was one of the best days in my life. When I got home instead of celebrating I started crying again. All my mom had to say was ""Congrats. But you could've done better"". I was accepted at the best highschool in the town in the top 50. After all I've been through and what she told me over and over again she wasn't happy with my acomplishment.

That was the point in my life when I realised that everything I've done so far was never enough and I'm not talking only about school. This happened with everything. I don't think I've ever heard her say ""Congrats"" and felt like it was from her heart more than 5 times. Since highschool I started to hate her in some way for this. Now all we do is fight over every little stupid thing I do and she overreacts to it(I'm not crazy about this... everyone is aware that she overreacts to everything). The last time I told her ""I love you"" was more than 3 years ago. The last time I hugged her was like 2 years ago except for her birthday. Everytime she asks me why I don't tell her that anymore I skip the topic somehow. I even wanted to join a military school just to be closer to leaving them.

I always felt better anywhere else except with my parents. I am grateful that she took take of my material needs. I always had good food on my plate, clothes, etc. But she never took care of my emotional needs. I always feel like she doesn't even care. She almost never asked me how am I feeling or if there is something I want to talk about. She never said sorry after any of her random moments of overreacting until I left the house to stay in the damn garden or with my grandma until she chills out and than wait 2 or 3 days just so she speaks to me again. When we got the point of talking about this it was when I was full of it and I started crying and screaming in front of her and letting everything out.

Now my father's problem with alcohol might be back and I can't stand them fighting again when I am 3 weeks from my last exams. He even asked ME for money several times."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxmduo	2019-06-06 21:39:37	justneededaburner	"AITA For Not Wanting my BIL to move in with us to ""Fix His Life""?"	"For context, my wife (24F) and I (26M) have been married for just shy of 5 years. We moved out of state (400 miles away) in 2015 for work as our home area offered next to nothing. We moved to where we are now because I got a job at the company i still work for. Since we moved, we have shifted from barely living paycheck-to-paycheck to now we live comfortably and have a savings account, but I would say we are just doing decent.

Her father is currently living with her aunt and her brother (26). Her aunt lost her job like 2 years ago and hasn't worked since (I think she's on disability, but idk). Her brother quit his job in August of last year, for unknown reasons and hasn't worked since. Recently (\~a month ago), her dad lost his job, and now there is no income in the household. When that happened, there was talk of both her dad and brother coming to live with us. It has now changed to just her brother moving in.

I am not happy about this for multiple reasons. First, he has shown no initiative to take care of or fix his situation since high school. He did move out of his dad's house at one point to live with his girlfriend, but she left him and he moved back in shortly after. He also has not had a driver‚Äôs license for years because he got in a few crashes with no insurance and got his license taken away. His grandma pushed him to get it reinstated but before he paid all his fees (thus still had a suspended license) he got a speeding ticket and his license situation was made worse. And then like previously stated, he left his last job even though he was moving up in the company and seemed to enjoy it at times, and neither my wife nor I know why he left. But I don't think he has tried to find a new job since.

When my wife told me they talked about him moving in I told her how I felt and why. And I've mentioned before that I hesitate to provide support to him because he hasn't even tried to improve things.

I'm also hesitant to have him move in because we've been going through difficult times in our marriage for the past year and hqve been working on it.  We both struggle with communicating as well as we should and I feel like it'll only get worse if we have someone else living with us.  Plus our house is pretty small so it'll basically be like having no alone time for as long as he is here.  And since my wife is saying he can get a part time job at the retail store she works at, I feel like it'll end up being a long time at best until he moves out.

He's a good guy and I've been friends with him for a long time, but I also have always felt like he doesn't care or try. He's incredibly smart but I have yet to see him apply himself.I do like spending time with him, but there's also a limit to that. He used to stay at our apartment for a couple nights a week when we stilled lived nearby, and that got old pretty quick. I'm just worried that I'm going to start hating to come home. Not to mention it makes me worry about my relationship with my wife."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So basically, i've been with this girl for 1.5 years. And I really do love her, but there is a small problem. Lately, she's been lying about Tiny things. It all started when i told her some private stuff, (my mom got a sudden psychose, didnt want to let ANYONE know because we are a Well known family in the community), a couple of hours later, she told me she told her mom, I was dissapointed because I made her promise me to not Tell anyone. She then went on to explain that she did it cuz her mom knows alot about mental health. I was still dissapointed, but she meant in a good way. I told her that, and then she said ""okay no I told my sister"". At that Point I got really angry but I decided I wasn't in the mood for all that bs because my mother was in the hospital and couldn't really deal with adding that to my pile of personal issues. And lately, i've caught her lying about Tiny things, i would ask her standard questions like ""what did you do today"" and she would explain what she did, for instance she told me ""i went to th√© gym, did some homework and cleaned my room""  and then minutes later i hear her mom Yell that she should get out of bed, bc ""she hasn't don't anything today"" . I confronted her about this and she laughed it off like it was a joke. 

She gets really Mad when i Bring it up and says stuff like ""I'm really not in the mood for this"" and at that Point I don't want to Hurt her because I still love her

I know the latter one is really small, but I've got really bad trust issues (she was the one who helped me
 somewhat overcome them) and now, whenever she says something I don't know if I should believe it. I just don't really trust her anymore  and I need your guys advice"	No A-holes here	0	0

He's always busy, really flaky, and often doesn't respond to snapchats/texts

&#x200B;

We decided to do a game night with all our brothers and a few mutual friends, used to be ‚Äúthe move‚Äù when we were closer

&#x200B;

I started a group chat, found a day that worked

My brother offered to host/provide snacks, etc.

I spent all day at work trying to get people to commit either way, and still get out on time

&#x200B;

At 4-5 friend sends out a text saying we should do it at his place after work at 8 and we should all bring dinner because he‚Äôll be stopping to eat.

Offended by the wording/change in place and time (because I was the one who worked to set the plans up)  I chose not to respond as I knew I‚Äôd start a fight.

bro and I figure out how to approach it all, and finally settled on sending out a text that a bunch of us were already en route to my brothers, we weren't waiting to start, and everyone's still invited.

Some time goes by and he starts bitching that we changed times and didn't include anyone in decision making, etc.

Finally it comes out that my friend couldn‚Äôt receive any group texts so his brothers had to relay them which he never mentioned

&#x200B;

I wait a week then I start another group chat on snapchat so everyone could receive messages.

&#x200B;

I start to plan/try to get everyone‚Äôs input on the situation, saying ‚Äúwe should all try to communicate better this time around, myself included.‚Äù

he lays into me about how **only I** need to be a better communicator and I‚Äôm a huge asshole, etc.


It culminated in me telling him I was done. I didn‚Äôt explain, but I meant done with him forever.

I tapped out because I was tired of plans falling through and getting in stupid arguments over nothing. 14 years of this shit and it‚Äôs only gotten worse. Everyone said it was a part of growing up but we're damn near grown and it‚Äôs still a problem  
  
3+ months go by. I never received any text or anything. Proved my theory that if I stopped talking to him we wouldn‚Äôt talk. Whatever, I was done anyway.

Then he snapped me at midnight one night: ‚Äúyo dude"" Me: ‚Äúwat‚Äù Friend: ""what do you mean wat?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond  
  
A mutual friend mentioned that he‚Äôs complaining he reached out to me and I didn‚Äôt answer.

my friends/family think I over-reacted to an argument, I think I under-reacted for 8 lonely years since high school and then exploded all at once.

Everyone says I‚Äôm throwing away a friendship but I don‚Äôt see it that way. I‚Äôm the guy that‚Äôs always free to hang in case you have nothing better to do, that‚Äôs barely friendship.

But I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot because we *were* friends for over half our lives. 14 years is a long time.

TLDR, My best friend's bf caused drama, so I uninvited him. She wants him to come to the party. I can handle him going, I just think he doesn't deserve to go. 

I'm having a party on Saturday. Most of the guests have a problem with this one girl, (lets call Katie) that I‚Äôm friends with. I didn't invite her for that reason. Me and Katie talked and she said its fine she doesn't go.

All was fine until my best friend and her bf (let's call Jack) decided to go to Katie's house. While they were over, Jack mentioned the party. Katie said she wasn't going because she doesn't get along with the other  guests. Jack told her she should go anyway and she agreed. (wasn't right on her part.) So Jack invited Katie and her boyfriend to the party group chat, without asking me.

So in the chat I said,

"" Sorry this is too short of notice I won't have enough food.""

Jack then said "" Then get more food, duh.""

( everyone is bringing one thing so it's easier on me, he isn't bringing anything)

I said "" I didn't want to embarrass anyone, but this isn't going to work, katie we already talked about this, please leave the chat.""

After, Jack said, ""Why don't you all grow up and stop acting like 6 year olds, Just eat some cake and get over it.""

Jack has no idea why the other guests don't like her because he didn't go to highschool with us and hasn't met them. years ago Katie's family and a couple others guests families got in a fight and it was ugly. They haven't talked since.

I said in the chat,

""Jack you don't know what happened, they got over it by parting ways.""

He said

It doesn't matter, they should still come , I am older than you and have seen real problems before, this is just petty drama, stop being babies.""

I said he can't assume that because he doesn't even know them. After, Katie and her bf left the chat and I apologized to everyone.

Jack said ""stop apologizing you are being mad annoying all of you need to get over this already.""

I texted Jack privately saying that wasn't right, he shouldn't have said to "" buy more food"" when he wasn't bringing any, invite people to my house without asking or made those comments. He said he has ""freedom of speech"" so he will say what he wants. That he is older and knows more, so we should listen to him. (I live alone, and have a job, he lives with his mom, does not drive, doesn't go to school or have a job) I decided to uninvite him. He tried to guilt me by saying my best friend would be devastated without him there.

Sorry for the late response. I tried to call a wild life rescue  but they all would of had to kill the groundhog because of some law in PA. BUT when I got home around 10pm the groundhog was gone! This morning walking up to my car to go to work this woman was sitting outside and I asked her about the groundhog and she said one of the neighbors tried to give it water but it ran off.

"Last Friday we had our final game for the #1 division title against another local high school in my area. One of the players on the other team, we‚Äôll call him John, is a very close childhood friend of mine, and parents passed away a few months ago from a car crash, and as his friend who has tried the hardest to be there for him, I know how soul-crushing it has been for him since then. However, despite the horrific incident, he continued in school and still stayed to play on his school‚Äôs basketball team because 1) he‚Äôs one of, if not THE best player on their team so they really needed him and 2) his dad was an avid fan of his and always enjoyed watching his son play. John knew how much it would mean to his dad to watch him play his heart out and just so badly wanted to win the division title. (It‚Äôs probably important to note here that my high school won the last 2 years in a row and we were really pumped to try and make this a 3-peat kinda thing, but A‚Äôs high school has never won the division title before so they were also playing really hard, ESP A.)
Now I didn‚Äôt exactly purposely play like absolute shit just to make us lose‚Ä¶ but I knew I wasn‚Äôt playing to the best of my abilities and was extra soft on defence, esp when it came to defending John cause I genuinely really wanted to see the guy play well and win. I honestly just thought that my school has had it‚Äôs glory in winning the last 2 years.. it didn‚Äôt seem like a big deal to me to let john‚Äôs team win the title. John‚Äôs one of the most genuine guys I know and I love him to death so I realllly wanted this for him cause I knew how much it‚Äôd mean to him. At the end, John's team had beat us 86-71 and he was ECSTATIC about it (he played his heart out) and I was genuinely SO happy for him, I really did at the moment feel like I had done such a good thing and seeing him being that happy for the first time in months was SO worth it. 
However, boy did i get an earful from my teammates afterwards in the lockeroom... Everyone basically told me I had let the entire team down and was a total asshole for purposely playing like shit like that (everyone knew about John's situation and knew how close of friends we are) I didn't admit that i played shit purposely (and to be fair i didn't actually play shit, but I went easy on defence) i tried to rationalize saying that they ""deserved to win anyway since we've already won 2 in a row. But then one of the younger guys fired back with how this was so selfish of me to think cause since I'm one of the oldest person on the team, I got to experience what it was like winning but I deprived my younger teammates of getting their first winning experience. My whole team is basically mad at me and won't talk to me and I'm really starting to feel like absolute shit for my actions. But I am just extremely conflicted because on the other hand, I'm still super happy for John and it felt so good seeing him happy like that. so AITA ?"	Asshole	0	0

I recently got some disposable income and I decided to fill the gaps in my collection, I'm about 60 short and I figured I could try getting them cheap second hand. I find this guy that sells them at a flea market, he has an online classifieds ad, more for advertising his stall than selling them. I emailed him and buy about 15

We start talking details and he asks me how I would like them delivered, he offers me the choice between the post office and a private company that does counter to counter deliveries. I hate this company; I have been burned by them before. I don't tell the guy this, I just pick post office, its known to be shitty but I personally have never had any major issues

The guy agrees, he also says he is getting in new stock and am I willing to wait for them to come in, I wait another week and buy another 10 or so, I also go through the list, realize there are some I missed and order more. Our emails are really informal. It‚Äôs like we are two comic book nerds talking rather then it being a business transaction. I was hoping to be a returning customer.

He sends me an email confirming my order about 25 books for about 200 USD, says the shipping is going to be more because of the extra weight but he will cover it. The next day get an email, he has send them with the private company I don‚Äôt like. Note that this delivery method is much more expensive and has a much better track record then the post office, my issue is not with the service but with the local branch of this company in my area.

I sort of explode on him. He emails back apologizing saying he was doing me a favor, he was ...in a way. He paid double for the 'better' delivery out of his own pocket, he could not have known about my history with this service. I send him a less angry email back about how he changed the delivery method without talking to me first and about how this is not what we agreed on. 

10min later I email him back saying it‚Äôs fine. I get an email saying he has intercepted the package and wants my banking details to refund me. I still want the books so I email him saying that I'm willing to repay shipping if he re-sends them. He says no and sends a very formal message about how the delivery is cancelled. I try to explain to him that if he cancels and refunds we are both out of the shipping cost, he does not make a sale and I don't get my books and we both just wasted each other‚Äôs time, it‚Äôs a lose-lose. I tell him to think about it till the end of the week and If he still doesn‚Äôt want to sell to me I‚Äôll send him my banking details. I get the same formal message copy pasted back. I asked If he got my previous email, I get ""thank you for your message‚Äù and the same formal email again."	Asshole	0	0

My grandpa was recently diagnosed with cancer. Because of this, as well as our family growing apart in general, my cousin and I got together and decided the family should take a trip to my grandpa's home town, a trip that we use to take every summer but as we have all gotten older, most of us have not been in over ten years.  Eleven people in total are going, 3 of which are my younger half siblings, the oldest 13. We all came together yesterday to get plans nailed down, and we all agreed on an Airbnb. When dividing out by eleven people, each person's part was about 95 dollar. 
Everyone except my mother and her husband where okay with this. My mother got upset because we were counting the children, and said it was not fair for her to pay five hundred dollars when everyone else was only paying 95, and that we should not include the kids because they would not be getting a bed to themselves. My cousin didn't want to argue so she just moved on to something else. 
Later after everyone had left, I stayed to help my cousin clean up, and she mentioned that she didn't thing it was right for my mother to bring 3 kids and not have to pay for them. I agreed with her, and after we talked it over for a bit, we decided that we could compromise and have them only pay for one child. 
Today my mother called me and said she wanted to make sure we were not upset about not wanting to pay for the kids. I explained to her that we talked and thought it would be fair for her to pay for one of them. She got super silent, and I could tell she was pissed off. I explained to her that most of us are not getting a bed to ourselves and that it was more than likely that the kids would pile in the bed with me. I asked her if that meant I shouldn't have to pay because I wasn't getting a bed to myself. She never answered and said she had to go and hung up on me. 
So, am I the asshole for wanting my mother to pay for at least one of the children that are going to be staying in the Airbnb?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Now we‚Äôre older and she wants to get along, but I‚Äôm not interested in being friends. Currently, she‚Äôs 24 (almost 25) and I‚Äôm nearly 22. I‚Äôm home for the summer after college graduation, but I‚Äôve got a temp job lined up in August and a plan after that. She just has been at our house for 7 months. Not doing dishes or helping out around the house. She does work a teeny bit but not much.

We got into a fight today. I went downstairs, she was singing at the top of her lungs. I yelled for her to close the door. She laughed. This is a common argument. She was two feet away. I got very annoyed, went up and called her selfish. She called me lazy and refused to let me back downstairs, holding the door open, until she was done explaining to me why she was not selfish. I told her she never did anything for me and I should stop doing things for her. She yelled at me for ‚Äòkeeping track‚Äô (but could only recall one instance of doing me any favors). I yelled that she shouldn‚Äôt even still be at home, and this got her more mad, calling me more names, nearly pushing me down the stairs. I tried to go downstairs again and she let me, but this time started to lock the door (aka lock me downstairs). I got super pissed. Ended up calling our mom who was headed home, who doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with two adult children fighting (who would). Older sister then tells my mom she almost killed herself over the fight. So now of course the whole things my fault.

I just...I get it. The whole goddamn situation is ridiculous. I‚Äôm just tired of her taking advantage of shit. I‚Äôve done her dishes, some of her chores, and cleaned up trash she‚Äôs left around the house. She never helps with dinners or yard work.

bxm3pt	2019-06-06 21:15:31		AITA for wanting to play an online game with my friend?	"In terms of the game, all you have to know is it has a ranking system, teamwork and is strategy based.


This happened very recently, and I decided to make this post because I think there's a good chance I am not seeing straight and I need another persons perspective.

Long time ago my friend invited me to play a game with me, I joined and he made a discord server in the hopes we could both go professional one day.

Eventually he realised I couldn't keep up and the team idea was scrapped. The server was repurposed, I made a bot for the server and we had a pretty good time still.

The trouble starts now, I had moved and my aussie internet is complete garbage here. I can only really play the game when noone else is on the internet (limiting when I can play) as well as I lose 10% of games from it anyway.

I was already bad before but I actually went down a rank around this same time. I would still ask my friend if he wanted a game and even though he could say no (and I told him that). Repeatedly we would play together and lose since I could not fight such high ranking players. Losing clearly annoyed him, and others have pointed out how he gets annoyed by it to easily.

From his perspective I am deliberately trying to lose, I am actually trying my best but he's just so much better than me. It doesn't help that I sometimes pick the more fun strategies over the most efficient. I will always argue its a game and I want to have fun, but he will argue isn't winning fun?

During these matches he will sometimes mute his mic and clearly get mad. End the game complaining about what I did wrong and play solo.

This brings us to the recent event, where on a game both of us picked a fun strategy over a more efficient one. After the game he uses his privileges on the server to make it so I can't hear him. Talks shit about me. (I have external confirmation of what he said)

I bring this up with him, denies it then he blames me for not doing a role I was trying my best to do and gets up me for the fun strategy. Says he should have listened to a friend who says don't play with people who deliberately try to lose.

My partner is a pretty no nonsense guy and will always agree with me/back me up.

She never changed her mind or listens to reason, and complains that we ""gang up"" on her with our corrections. This happens every time we have a family dinner or special event.

My parents casually take my money pretty often, anywhere between a few dollars to a few hundred, or even thousands. It's not because they need the money because they don't make enough or are poor (they're actually fairly well off), but more out of convenience, to avoid going to the ATM, as they don't usually carry cash. Most of my family live in the US (were in Canada), so when relatives give me money for my birthday or Christmas, it's usually in US dollars, which my parents often just throw into their US account. I have alot of relatives who give me upwards of $1000 for my birthday, and parents often take this. 

Now you might be thinking, ""why are you letting your parents do this to you"". I honestly haven't had the heart to tell them no, because they support me fully, and I almost feel like I owe them. They're paying fully for my university tuition and rent, as well as most of my living expenses. They even pay for a lot of my personal expenses, including vacations, or any other large purchases, even if I don't ask them. If my mom sees me buying something online, or if I'm about to go out and buy a new bike or something, I'll often hear the phrase ""oh, just take the mastercard."" On one hand, it feels kinda shitty for my parents to be taking large sums of money from me, especially since I've never really felt independent with my finances. On other hand, I feel like with how much they're supporting me, I really shouldn't be complaining and that I kinda owe it to them. So would I be the asshole if I told them to stop taking my money?"

bxm1m7	2019-06-06 21:10:30		AITA for telling my fiancee she should go to the doctors or look into medication?	"Long story short, I've been 2 years with my fiancee, about to hit 3 years. She has depression and anxiety, and sometimes it gets really bad and she goes into a really dark place, some days she seems completely fine, some days any small thing I do can trigger her anxiety and depression. She tells me that she lives with it (depression) 24/7 but most of the times its not as bad and its just been bad the past few months because she's really stressed out about stuff in her life, work and our relationship.

&#x200B;

We have an amazing relationship though, I dont want to make it sound bad. We joke everyday and love each other immensely. But the arguing recently is because of what she's going through because she didn't get upset over such small things in the past. Even she acknowledges it and says stuff as ""I know I shouldn't have gotten upset, it was just my depression. I'm sorry, I'm just stressed so it's bad right now."" I'm always there for her and tell her she can always talk to me and I can find ways to comfort her. I do help but i feel like it's not enough and she is getting worse with time.

&#x200B;

Now here's the issue, she HATES the doctors and psychologists. I've told her that it might be good to just look into making an appointment to talk to a professional, that I can go with her or she can go by herself, but as soon as i mention something remotely close to that she says that it won't help her at all, that she knows her body and she knows that doctors, psychologists, medication, etc, will make her feel even more sick. She says she knows for a fact that if she ever takes medication it will make her mental illnesses worse and she will most likely end up killing herself. That medication only makes you numb and kills you even faster. She is very sensitive with this subject. I've mentioned about 3-4 times and the answer is always ""No and it hurts me you're bringing it up, i've told you it wont work for me so stop it if you love me"" and since the last time I told her that I trust her and that i won't bring it up again and I haven't.

&#x200B;

I really care about her but part of me thinks ""if she wasn't so stubborn, we could go get help with a doctor or psychologist and im SURE it would help her"" but I feel like an asshole for thinking that. I feel like an asshole for thinking medicating her is the right thing to do. I don't deal with depression or anxiety so i don't know what it's like. What if she's right and she knows it wont help her and im just in the wrong here and i should just stop thinking like this.

We all knew she didn't have long left, and I was aware she would probably pass while I was away. I've always had a good relationship with my grandma, she knew about the holiday and wanted me to go. She's always wanted me to live my life to the fullest, and plus she knew the amount of money I would lose if I didn't go.  The absolute last thing she wanted was for me to cancel. So i went, and she sadly died while I was away. Since i've come back pretty much ALL of my family (except my mam)are incredibly pissed off at me for going, claiming all kinds of horrible things like I didn't care about her and excluding me from so many things like planning the funeral. I'm majorly pissed off because I was by far the closest with my grandma. I saw her almost everyday and we had a great relationship.

&#x200B;

This happened today. I was planning on going to my future sister-in-law's high school graduation tonight. I had mentioned more than once to my fiance and various family members that I planned on attending. The drive takes an hour each way, but this is a big event for SIL so I don't mind at all. I've tried to get close with her when I can, but since there is some physical distance between us there's limitations to that, so it's not like we are best friends. I am on very good terms with my fiance's family though, and I love them a lot, so it's not like I was going out of my way for nothing.

This morning my fiance texted me telling me that SIL and MIL had to uninvite me from her graduation because she apparently had anxiety over me driving so long to be there, and she was generally anxious about the whole affair. I understand the anxiety but I don't know what I necessarily have to do with it. We've never had any negative interactions that I can recall. This is pretty much the entire reasoning they gave me, except they also mentioned that very few family members were invited to begin with; I wasn't aware of that. Also I thought I was given a graduation invitation, but it turns out it was only for the grad party that's in a few weeks and not graduation itself.

So now I'm upset with SIL and MIL for not only uninviting me from something I thought I was a part of, since I am considered a family member even if I'm not married yet (we have been together for nearly 5 years). But I'm also upset because they used my fiance as a mouthpiece instead of telling me directly. And I'm also upset with my fiance because he thought it was acceptable to even agree to it in the first place, especially doing it over text rather than calling me. I told him if I were in his shoes, I would have refused to do it and made SIL/MIL say it to me personally.

bxlqng	2019-06-06 20:44:04	Daveydave06	AITA for being mad about how my fiancee Jumps my ass for getting onto my step son	"So this situation has happened a few times but I can use last night as a particular example.

We are sitting down to eat dinner that my ol lady has just spent her time cooking after working all day, simple broke people food, pork chops mac n cheese, and some ranch style beans. I'm happy to come home to a cooked meal and devour my food. My step son, who is 4 going on 5 is given the same food as we are eating. He is a picky eater and sticks to the toddler food groups of chicken nuggets or corn dogs. He proceeds to eat 1 small helping of beans before taking one bite of mac n cheese ( which he always eats) before making a face and saying he doesnt like it because its spicy. I proceed to tell him there is no way it is spicy and that he needs to eat, and that he better eat his TINY 3 PIECES of pork chops she has cut up for him. He takes a pathetic excuse for a bite and makes the same face followed by the same excuse. I am upset now because he refuses to eat anything and my ol lady should not be having to make 2 separate meals every night. So I try to gently reason with him to eat so he can be big and strong to no avail. So I try the stern approach and tell him he cannot get up from the table until he eats more of his food.

So this is where it happens, my ol lady then jumps my ass and tells me to stop being an asshole, and that she was made to sit at the table and eat things she didnt like as a kid and wont do that to him. 

She doesn't exactly do this with a nice demeanor and with a raised voice all while in front of him.

Trying to avoid a larger unneeded arguement, i simply put my hand up in acknowledgment and do not say a word the rest of my meal.

My whole issue is 2 part:

A) I am trying my best as a step parent to look out for him unbiased and make him eat more things, correct behavior I see that is wrong and if left unchecked will be hard habits to break in the future etc. Not to be a hard ass, I get I dont have the bias of making him but I love him like my own. But i feel she some times thinks it's the latter even after expressing my intentions of getting onto him

B) what irritates me the most is how she handles the criticism she gives me, I.E. the going off on me in front of him. I am reasonable enough to understand that she may not see it as a big deal like me and that s fine because it is her child but I have pointed out numerous times that she is undermining me in front of him instead of expressing the criticism privately, to which I feel is only creating a situation where he will not respect my authority in my own home and that he can just run to his mom when he doesnt like what I tell him and doesnt want to do it.

Am i being irrational and an asshole?

Being a step parent is tricky at 25 years old.

Edit, I feel the need to Express that the picky eating is not an issue so much as it was the particular example I used."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bxlppr	2019-06-06 20:41:46	TNT_606	AITA for crying endlessly at work?	"I‚Äôm a gal in her mid 20‚Äôs who works at a restaurant. There was recently an event we were prepping for which featured an assortment of dishes from a bunch of different cultures. My parents are both immigrants from the Middle East, and there was a recipe they taught me (passed down from my grandmother) for a dish enjoyed in my culture that I have always loved. I recommended this recipe to the head chef, and he approved it for this event. For the first time ever, I got to cook my beloved dish myself, for lots of other people to enjoy.

I worked on this dish for hours in the kitchen; put a lot of work into it, and was very pleased with how it turned out. But upon getting back from break, I was devastated to see my dish splattered in one of the gigantic garbage cans in the back kitchen. Apparently, one of the dishwashers/cleaners carelessly threw it away. I know it wasn‚Äôt done in malice (the guy who did it is very careless and clumsy, and has some special needs), but it was heartbreaking nonetheless. The second I saw it, I burst out crying.

And when I say crying, I really mean crying. I sobbed loudly and hysterically; my face got beet red, and I started losing my footing/balance and stumbling around. Everyone turned around horrified, and between wails I cried to them that my dish had been thrown away. The chef reprimanded the guy who did it, came over and comforted me; and told me to take a break to get myself together. I walked over the break room, which had about four or so of my coworkers, and continued to cry my eyes out.

After 15 minutes, I got back to work in the kitchen (working on a completely different dish) and tried my best not to cry. But I saw someone dumping a bunch of trash into that same garbage bin, and it triggered the image of my dish in the garbage, and I started bawling again. Once again, my chef asked me to take a breather; I took a 5 minute breather and got back to work again; but little tears still continued to stream out of my eyes.

The chef told me he thinks it would be best if I just work more basic duties today (like sweeping or breaking down boxes in the back). I agreed to do it, but felt embarrassed. Whilst sweeping, I felt real shitty; embarrassed I had been ‚Äúdemoted‚Äù to such a low-level duty for me, and still broken up about my dish. I started crying again; sobbing and hyperventilating loudly as I swept. The chef came over to me, visibly angry this time, and told me I need to go home for the day. He told me I had better be in a much better mood my next shift, because this kind of behavior is ‚Äúunacceptable for a workplace.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt trying to make anyone uncomfortable or be unprofessional; it just came out naturally as a result of my hard work being destroyed. I feel like my chef/coworkers should have had more sympathy for me due to the circumstances that made me cry. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

bxlnlq	2019-06-06 20:36:36	lunatic_charm	AITA ‚Äì My cat attacked a dog. I think it‚Äôs the dog owner‚Äôs fault.	"**Some Background:** My 15lb neutered male cat is a known asshole. He has some low-key aggression and is okay around my dog and his sister but has attacked every new animal that has dared enter our home. This includes a friend‚Äôs American Eskimo and my Rottweiler when we first adopted him. My male cat also has feline idiopathic cystitis and his bladder becomes inflamed when he‚Äôs ‚Äústressed.‚Äù When this occurs he pees BLOOD all over my house. He has flare-ups when he receives less attention than usual, so I treat his condition is by spoiling his little furry butt with prescription cat food and lots of activity. One of his favorite activities is going for a ‚Äúwalk‚Äù.

&#x200B;

**The Incident:** Once a week, my cat dons his harness and leash. We typically hang around the yard where he eats grass and rolls in the dirt. He‚Äôs a bit skittish outside and runs back towards the house once he sees a person, another animal, or hears a loud noise. Sometimes, he decides he‚Äôs feeling brave enough to walk down the sidewalk, but never far.

&#x200B;

We made it to the sidewalk, and a few houses down from us some visitors get out of their car with their Pomeranian. I see the little dog sprint in our direction and prepare myself for when my cat decides to run away. However, once my cat noticed the pup, he actually moved between the dog and I and lunged. I pulled the leash hard enough to yank my cat off of the dog, but it got a few scratches.

&#x200B;

I ran my scared cat back into the house and returned to a very angry dog owner. This lady immediately started to scream at me about how my ""rabid"" cat attacked and injured her ‚Äú$600 dog‚Äù. She told me that she was taking her dog to the vet and that I‚Äôd be paying for it. I apologized but told her that I didn‚Äôt think I was liable for what my LEASHED cat did to her UNLEASHED dog. She obviously did not take it well and threatened to call the cops. I told her to go ahead, went inside, and ignored her.

&#x200B;

I‚Äôm not worried about being held liable for ‚Äúdamages.‚Äù This happened several weeks ago, my city has a leash ordinance, the injuries appeared superficial, and I've heard nothing since. However, a few of my friends think I should've offered to pay some of the expenses since purebred dogs are expensive and my cat was a feral kitten I got for free. Or that I shouldn't be walking him given his history. My stance is that this lady shouldn't have had her dog off the leash in the first place! Having a small dog does not exempt you from leash laws- it could have been hit by a car or attacked by literally any feral cat in the neighborhood. However, they might have a point about walking him. Exercise is good for his FIC, but is he too aggressive for walks? I really don't want to stop walking him. 

&#x200B;

**Tl;dr:** Off-leash Pomeranian is attacked by my leashed cat. Owner threatens to sue me over the vet bill. I don‚Äôt think that paying the bill is my responsibility. I also don't want to stop walking my cat."	Not the A-hole	0	0

He knew I was kind of insecure about my weight, and he wasn‚Äôt and was always making jokes and laughing about it. Now he keeps commenting on my weight to insult me, even if I don‚Äôt say anything about it first. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where everyone laughs about it. He‚Äôs gotten my other friend to laugh about. Just today, he called me l, ‚ÄúNutella Bella‚Äù saying that I love Nutella, and that must be the reason I‚Äôm fat.

bxlky9	2019-06-06 20:30:15	Jstormtide	WIBTA for going to my ex-girlfriends parents to ask them to let me purchase her a parking pass for the fall semester?	"My and my now ex have had a very tumultuous on and off relationship culminating in me finally getting on antidepressants(trying to fix things with her mind you) and her telling me she wants to be there to support me only to pick another guy over me. A guy that no less tells her what she can/cant wear who she can/cant talk too(note she can't talk to me and he made her block me on everything). But that isn't the point here. I'm fairly certain her parents like me enough to let me do this for her anyways and its not like I intend to take credit for it either.

&#x200B;

We both go to a commuter school that's cold as fuck in the winter and she gets to campus at like 7 am and then has to take the shuttle to campus and then takes it back super late at night when its colder and as you may guess slightly sketchy outside. her family is not as well off and probably isn't in a position to throw away the 300$ to get her the parking pass, but I am so I wanted to do this for her. She always hated me spending money on her, but I think it'd be nice to do for her especially since she hates being cold more than anything and being alone at night gives her anxiety. 

&#x200B;

So will I be the asshole for approaching her parents and asking them to allow me to pay for a parking pass for her?

bxlk3t	2019-06-06 20:28:02	goddessiva	WIBTA if I sent my aunt a Snapchat instead of a thank you note?	"So this is a ""what if"" because to avoid conflict I sent the thank you note anyway. 
My (19f) bday just passed and my aunt and uncle in a city a couple hours away mailed me a card with $100 cash. Pretty standard for them. Anyway my mom and I have realized that my aunt is very particular about thank you notes. If I took too long to send one in the past she'd text my mom asking if I got the card at all. I think it makes sense, there's cash in there and if it got lost then both of us are out $100. 
Last christmas my aunt got Snapchat and I regularly check in with her on there. She comments on my stories and such too. When I got my card today, my mom told me to send a thank you note before I forget and I suggested sending her a picture of me holding the card smiling on Snapchat with a quick thank you. (for the record, I was going to snap a pic, save it, and send it in chat and save it in chat so it wouldn't just disappear. I know my aunt is relatively new to social media so that would make it easier for her to see) My mom was kinda surprised I'd even suggest that since my aunt has always been old fashioned but my argument is that she's evolving toward tech with her new social media presence and she'd get the thank you faster without having to worry about if the mailman stole my bday money or something wacky. 
I still sent the actual card instead of Snapchat but WIBTA if I did just Snapchat her a thanks?

EDIT: I'd like to add just to clarify my ""effort"" levels. My aunt and uncle send me a card and don't write anything in it other than ""Dear _____"" and ""Love, Aunt and Uncle"" and then stick a dollar bill in there. I'm not saying I don't appreciate it, but I've been writing long thank you's the past years and so sending a Snapchat wouldn't necessarily be ""less effort"" (I think, anyway) as I'd still be writing a longer thanks rather than just ""got the card.

About 5 years ago I went to a paramore concert, my first ever concert. I bought a band tour shirt as a momento. Due to me being larger it didn't fit me and my ex wore it several times. Our breakup was painful and hectic so the shirt was the last thing on my mind. 

I've hardly spoken to this guy in 2 years but would I be an ass if I messaged him asking for the shirt back? It's part of his wardrobe now, but I have lost a lot of weight and recently started thinking about that shirt a lot because as someone with major joint issues making my first concert was a big deal. The fact I can fit in the shirt now is a huge added bonus. 

Part of me just wants to leave it, but part of me wants that momento back.

bxldlt	2019-06-06 20:12:07		AITA because supper is the cats?	"My boyfriend and I are friends with a couple. We do things like see movies, have drinks, go for a meal. Like us, they don't have kids but have two cats; we have two dogs. 

Last year they had asked us to come over for supper, which in itself wasn't unusual but they were quite insistent when there were issues with the 4 schedules working. I have a pretty good gut feeling, and at the time felt that there was something a bit off. When we eventually went over, it turned out that they were going on a trip with his parents (who typically look after the cats) and they needed someone to look after their animals. They asked me-10 days to go over and feed the cats, clean the litter, etc. I felt pressured into saying yes, which is completely my fault.

At the time I had felt that 10 days was a pretty big ask. 

This was never discussed at the time, but they decided that in exchange that we would get their food delivery box for that week.

It happened a second time.

This time it's only a week, but I tell my partner that it's not necessarily the asking to watch the cats (which I don't love) but it's the way it's being presented. It feels very manipulative to ask, couched in 'let's get together and spend some time'. He agreed, but said that the friendship is more important and that it's important to do favours. This time they didn't give me anything...just a 'thanks a million.'  

This exact scenario had been done to me years ago by 'friends'. One of them was going to Japan-*for three years*\-and had a dog. I was in school full time and had a bunch of part time jobs-I was incredibly busy and stressed because I was working early morning to very late at night. They asked me over for a meal...then sprung on me that I was the only one who could possibly do it. I said yes, my own fault. For three months that poor dog sat in my house all day and night. I finally had to tell the guy to find someone else because it was not fair for the dog. Everyone was pissed at me, but he found someone and eventually the friendships completely fell apart because of this.

At the beginning of this week they had asked to get together...again with the same insistence. This time we can't make the timing work. Then we get a group text about borrowing some equipment and my partner says yes and arranges a time to go over and drop it off. I'm getting the gut feeling that something doesn't feel right annnnnnddddd...he comes home and announces 'guess what...you're looking after the cats.' I got mad and said that I knew what was happening with meeting them and I didn't appreciate how it's me that's expected to do this, that the invitation was completely fake, and that I found it interesting that I was the defacto cat sitter. He tried arguing with me, but eventually said that I was right and also admitted he didn't want to admit this.

I'm still going to watch the fucking cats.

We don't have the best relationship with our father and nor does he live with us so we barely see him and thought why don't the 3 of us go out for a meal for a change.

Everything was fine and arranged until the evening of the day but I for some reason just assumed we would be going out in the early evening but it was instead at 8:30 which was when the reservation was. I wasn't aware it would be this late and when I found out, I immediately knew it was too late because I have some important exams coming up that I have to revise for. 

At about 5:30, I gave my dad a call, apologised and said that I wouldn't make it because of the time that I would get home and my upcoming exams. He wasn't pleased with this and I could hear he was already getting a bit angry but he eventually accpeted it. My next mistake was that I wrongly told him that my brother would still be coming because it's only myself that has exams. Turns out, when I told my brother I wouldn't make it, he also decided not to come because he wanted it to be the 3 of us and that we should reschedule. I must have misunderstood him because I thought he would still be going which is why I told my father that.

Then, at about 8pm my brother received a call from our dad asking when they would be meeting up and I'm sure you can imagine he was even more unhappy to hear my brother would now not be attending after what I had (wrongfully) told him. Basically, it was a massive communication error that I can't help but feel personally guilty for and I would absolutely think I was the asshole if it wasn't for how my father reacted.

He was just shouting down the phone insulting us calling us irresponsible and disgusting kids and before I could even offer to reschedule for another day soon, he said ""Go to hell! Both of you!"" and hung up. I may not have the best relationship with him, but hearing your own father say something like that isn't nice especially when I don't even think the situation is *that* big of a deal.

He's now basically refusing to speak to us, does not want to reschedule and actually said that ""75 years ago traitors like you would have been shot."" Am I in the wrong here because I feel like this started from my error and to be fair, I get pretty annoyed when people cancel last minute on me.

TL;DR I cancelled plans on my father about 3 hours before the event because of my upcoming exams that I wasn't prepared for. He reacted horribly and told me to go to hell among other things."		1	0
bxlcaf	2019-06-06 20:08:31	Cantarella702	AITA for wanting to cut out friends who are seeking out my abuser?	"Hey all. I'm hoping to get some unbiased viewpoints, and would appreciate any thoughts.

&#x200B;

A couple of years ago, I left someone who was extremely abusive, in every way except physically. He never hit me, but he screamed in my face, called me every name under the sun, threw and broke things when he was mad. He ripped the closet door off its track once because when I did his laundry, I didn't spot a couple of work shirts that he'd kicked under the bed. Then he gave me the silent treatment for a full day because I didn't want to have sex while terrified. 

&#x200B;

I've known two of my closest friends for a long time - they became my friends a few years before I left my ex. They have full knowledge of how abusive he was, and they have many of the details of that abuse. About a year before I left him, one of them held my hand and comforted me when I was afraid to go home. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday, one of these friends said ""hey, we're having a party this weekend, and you're welcome to come, just know that your ex has already said he'll be there."" 

&#x200B;

I don't want to tell anyone who they're ""allowed"" to hang out with. That would definitely make me the asshole. But I also felt like I'd come a long way, and now I'm reliving all the crap I went through, and it feels like a betrayal that my best friends could know who he is, know what he did, and still seek him out and invite him to stuff. For reference, he has never before (to my knowledge) been invited to their parties, he certainly has never shown up (I go to almost all of them), so I don't know where this is coming from.

&#x200B;

Am I an asshole if I feel like I can't have these people in my life anymore? I feel like the way I see them has been forever changed, I can't trust them anymore, and in the interest of my own recovery I need to just turn and walk away. There's no anger or malice, just... I'm really hurt that they could know so clearly that this person is an abuser, and still want to have him around.

&#x200B;

For reference, in the last few years of my relationship I saw these people just about weekly, and my ex saw them twice a year, if that. So they weren't really good friends of his at any point, just people who liked each others' posts on Facebook."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I‚Äôve been there since day one, only missed a couple of appointments and have devoted my life to caring for them. Even to the point where I‚Äôve not worked because I have to be on call. 

They‚Äôre doing okay at the moment. But they are always really mean to me or patronising. I have severe mental health problems, one of which is anxiety and OCD so I have a lot of things going on in my brain and a lot of things cause me anxiety. So she will say things she knows makes me worry and if just generally mean to me. We‚Äôre very close in age so it‚Äôs not even like they‚Äôre just old and grumpy.

I know they‚Äôre going through a lot and having cancer must be awful but I‚Äôm sick of it and I don‚Äôt really want to see them. I‚Äôm meant to be seeing them Saturday but I‚Äôm considering cancelling because I just can‚Äôt deal with it.

I‚Äôm also waiting to be admitted to a hospital to get help for my mental health and I said to them would they make sure that they accepted help from other people (at the moment I‚Äôm the only one they‚Äôll say yes to when I offer help) and they said no they wouldn‚Äôt.

bxl7it	2019-06-06 19:57:10	seanreus	AITA for cutting off my stepfather?	" So to give a little background, my stepfather has been in my life since I was 9 years old and I'm 26 now. Sometimes he was great, a lot of times he had a temper from hell. Never hit us(outside of spanking) but tends to be very emotionally abusive, especially towards my mom. 

 My mom and I are very close, talk on the phone almost every day, I would visit her at least once a week and I grew up very protective of her and my brother as she was a single mom of 2 and my brother is autistic. My brother is in town visiting and I called my mom after I got off from my second job and had a rare moment of not working, and asked to come over. She said yes so I went there. I needed her advice on life and relationship stuff and figured I could spend an hour with her and my bro and talk about it. 5 minutes after I got into the house and started talking to my mom my stepfather comes in and asks ""why exactly are you im my house?"". He asked with attitude and I replied with equal attitude ""to visit my mother and brother"". He told me I better not get an attitude or I can just turn around and leave. So I did. I told my mom and brother I love them and then left. It's so bad my brother was stimming(its a thing people with autism do when they get sensory overload or stressed) and he asked to come over to my house and stay for a while(of course I said yes).

 Now I hate not getting to see my mom, but I cant stand the way he treats her, and I refuse to let him emotionally abuse me anymore. Am I the asshole for wanting to cut him completely from my life? Does anyone have any tips to help my mom get the courage to leave him? We've discussed that she knows he is being mentally abusive, but she never leaves. Sorry for the long rant."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxl79y	2019-06-06 19:56:38	RevolutionaryPizza2	AITA if I don't go for coffee with someone who has no other friends in the city?	"I live in a non-English-speaking country, but in a very international city where a lot of people speak English. My native language is English and it's what I mostly use for work and in my everyday life, although I do speak the local language pretty fluently as well.

A few months ago I was in the supermarket queue and got talking to a woman from India who recently moved there with her husband. She was very friendly and upbeat, but she told me she was having trouble adjusting because everyone only speaks the local language, so she was glad to have met an English speaker.

As I mentioned above, this city is FULL of English speakers. Of course it's tough to make friends when you move anywhere new, but if she goes looking for social activities, there's no reason she shouldn't be able to find things to do with fellow English speakers.

We added each other on Facebook so I could send her a few links ([Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) which is apparently great in this city, and some specific regular events in English that I thought she might enjoy). She made a suggestion that we meet up for coffee sometime, and I was sort of vague and noncommittal. After I sent her the links we made a tiny bit of small talk on Facebook, then never spoke again. I thought that was the end of it.

Months pass, and then today we bump into each other on the train. She tells me she went to a Meetup event and had a good time, and I tell her I'm very glad for her. We make a bit more small talk, then she suggests again that we meet up for coffee sometime. I'm like: definitely, but I really don't have any time at the moment, I'm so busy with work and stuff... She tells me to just let her know anytime I'm free.

Now I feel bad for brushing her off and lying in the process...

I don't know why I'm so against it, but the thought of meeting up with her for coffee really stresses me out. I don't know this person, I don't feel we particularly have any rapport or anything in common, and I don't feel ""she's a nice person who has no other friends"" is enough reason to insert myself into her life more than I intended, which was to give her a few links for stuff to do.

Yes, meeting up would be a polite thing to do, but does politeness override my own anxiety of having to be friends with someone, possibly longer term, when she's basically a stranger and I really don't have the energy for that?

If I was a bit more social and outgoing (I'm not) I'd try inviting her to a group activity so she can get to know more people, but really the only friends I have talk entirely in video game references...

I also realise I shouldn't have lied to her about wanting to meet up, but I'm also not sure of a polite way to say no in that situation.

&#x200B;

I'm not a very religious person but I think religion is fine as long as it's not extreme. This is not extreme religion or anything, but I am being forced to go. My younger brother doesn't care that I don't wanna go. My parents are quite angry at me for telling them I don't want to go to Church. Church makes me feel rather uncomfortable (there are multiple reasons as to why, such as anxiety from being around a lot of people, etc.), on top of that I can't sit still. I'm fine with going to the party and celebrating it etc., but just not going to Church.

&#x200B;

They are just really trying to force me to go. Their main argument is that my brother went to my confirmation (3 years ago) that I didn't even care about either. Also, the argument that we should follow family and their big moments.

I'm sorry for the mess of words but it's all that could come out of my head right now. If I remember anything more I'll edit the post.

bxl1m5	2019-06-06 19:43:07	stelkrokodiles	AITA for not punishing my daughter for standing up to her cousin?	"Hi all. 

My sister Eleanor and her husband Paul were staying over at our place for my much younger brother's wedding over the weekend.

Eleanor and me have daughters who are both 15. My daughter is called Sarah and hers is Becky. They are both very pretty but are polar opposites in terms of personality. Becky is very confident, outgoing, has loads of friends and is a huge party girl. She's also very capable academically and according to Eleanor is top or near the top of most of her classes. Sarah is the opposite. She is a kind and gentle person but is sensitive and at times awkward, with major issues with her confidence. She has a few very close friends rather than being part of a large group. Her academic performance is decent but not exceptional like Becky, but we are nevertheless proud of her because we know she works hard at school. 

Becky bullies Sarah and has done for a long time. She is spoiled by her parents who think that it's ''just harmless kid stuff''. Just this weekend she told Sarah that she was too ugly to go the wedding and that she would have to stay out of the photos. She also tried to push her out of big family photo at the reception. My wife Diane had to find Sarah after she ran outside crying. This bullying has gone on for years and nobody has made an attempt to stop it. 

Sunday morning in the garden we heard someone scream inside the house. We ran into the kitchen to find Becky feeling around the kitchens trying to find her glasses. She has very bad eyesight, bad enough that according Eleanor she needs to feel around for her glasses on her bedside table since everything is a blur for her. She has worn glasses in a high prescription since she was a baby. 
Becky was crying her eyes out until Diane found her glasses in one of the food cupboards. Once she had got them back on she started saying that Sarah took her glasses. 

I called Sarah downstairs and she admitted that she did take the glasses. We were all disappointed but Eleanor and Paul proceeded to tear into her about how cruel and nasty she was and how frightened and upset Becky was because of her. 

Sarah tried to explain that Becky had been taunting her about the photos and had been saying that she would be cropped out, but Becky's parents had no sympathy and said that maybe a ''bully'' like Sarah deserves that. I went ballistic and said that Becky had been bullying Sarah for years and they have laughed it off. Paul tried to say that Becky's ''girly teasing'' wasn't bullying and that what Sarah did was. 

I can see why Eleanor wants Sarah punished, but at the same time her daughter was the instigator and I don't agree with her wanting to punish our daughter after hers inflicted years of psychological abuse on her. We don't want to punishing Sarah. Obviously it was wrong to take the glasses, but it was a response to years of torment.

bxkzcf	2019-06-06 19:37:43	thr0waway456789	AITA for caring more about money than my friend?	"Please hear me out first.

My friend, John, lost his driver's license a couple of years ago due to having seizures. He still doesn't have one to this day and takes the bus to and from work. He lives fairly close to me, works in the same building as me, and also has the same hours. On top of our office job, I do Uber whenever I can for extra money.

I fully acknowledge that John has been a good friend to me. Nothing above and beyond, but good nevertheless. Lately, it seems as though he has been holding that over my head. It's usually when I choose not to give him rides home because I'd rather Uber. I'm not necessarily living paycheck to paycheck, but I do have an ex-wife and a child I need to support. So yes, I do love me some extra cash. It's tourist season in our city so I like to take advantage of the opportunity. They're usually located downtown, whereas our houses are on the other side of town.

One particular argument (via text) chose to me to post on here to see what the consensus was:

>J: Where'd you park?  
>  
>Me: At level 5 but I can't give you a ride today.  
>  
>J: Why, because you're gonna Uber? Dude for real, just give me a ride home and Uber after.  
>  
>Me: I could easily lose $50-75. I need the money.  
>  
>J: I don't care. You don't just abandon a friend in need. I've done so much for you and this is how you treat me?

I stopped responding after that. Honestly, I don't see this as abandonment. It's not like he's stuck in the middle of nowhere and *needs* me to give him a ride home. I'd be there in a heartbeat if he were. But no. He just wants me to drive him home (even though *I'm* not even going home) for his convenience. If he were to take the bus, it would take him around 45 minutes to get home. If I were to drive him, about 20 tops.

Other points to consider: 1) he does *not* give me gas money. I haven't asked him to because I really don't mind giving him rides **if** I'm also going home. 2) I'm all about being grateful. And I am. I give him rides whenever I can, but I feel like just because he's been a good friend to me doesn't entitle him to make me his personal driver just because he hates taking the bus.

But he tells me that I'm the asshole because I care more about the money than my ""friend."" Am I really TA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

He was raised in a place where a lot of people smoke and it's what all the ""cool kids"" did. I've never smoked, and I was raised in a place where smoking was seen as bad and we were shown videos of all the terrible things that can happen to you if you smoke. 

Currently, my fiance has just about quit smoking. I have always been very supportive of him and tried to help and encourage him because I know how hard it has been. I have never tried to push him to quit, even though I really wanted him to. But he just about has it down to not needing to smoke at all.

Which brings us to today when he was talking about going to clean an old storage room at the top of his building. He told me he was going to wait to get a face mask because he didn't want to damage his lungs since they're all clean and healthy now. I told him that of course that's a good idea, don't damage your lungs, but I also told him that smoking has done irreversible damage to his lungs, so they aren't brand new again like he assumes. I am aware that quitting does so much good for your body, and for the most part, you can reverse a lot of the damage done. But his lungs will never fully go back to how they were before smoking. I am worried for his future health so I make sure to keep these sort of things in mind. But he got mad at me for discouraging him and being so negative. I'm not going to sugar coat things for him or lie to him. I'm trying to be honest with him.

A stranger sat on the last chair, the one that is closest to the aisle. We said hi and then slept for pretty much the whole hour of the flight. 

When we landed, my boyfriend and I knew we'd have to get out fast because if we missed the first bus, we would miss the supermarket and then have no food for tonight, (and I really really needed to pee). 

We realised that the stranger wasn't planning on standing because he had no suitcases or bags in the storage above us, so we nicely asked him if he could move his legs and let us pass. 

He said no way, why should I move, and that we would only win 2 mins. I said I had to catch a bus and he said he did not care and he also had transports to take. 
An old couple behind us, who were standing and taking their suitcases, started telling us that the stranger was right and that we should let people in front of us go first. 
This made me really mad because they were behind and they were already standing with their suitcases in front of me (so he was literally telling us it was rude not to let people in front of us pass first, but he was passing in front of my row)
I just raised my voice and said that it did not cost the guy anything to move his legs and let us pass and that we had a bus to take. They were going to argue back so my bf and I just passed on top of the stranger, and told them we had better things to do then argue 4h about who can go first or not. 

I understand that people wait for the plane to empty before leaving but I dont understand why he had to prevent us from passing.

Regarding the title, this year I started college, I did not have any problems making friends and soon enough we formed a group to hang out. In this group there was a really attractive girl who did not speak much and always stayed to eat in the college dinner and to study at the library, so she was kinda distant form the rest , I did not give her much attention at the time, and I barely exchanged a few words with her in months. However, after Xmass, I had to start eating at the college dinner too. 

Because of that, we slowly started to talk a bit, and she really opened up, we had lots of similar interests and bonded pretty quickly. I only thought of her as a friend for a time, but after that, I ended up developing feelings for her and it became obvious to me that she had poor social skills to say the least, I was basically the person she spoke with the most in the group, and did not know anyone else in the campus. To make it worse, we are in Engineering, so there are barely any girls in class, which I think must make it harder for her as well. She also gets really nervous, to the point that she sometimes had to take medication before some exams and has always been a bit sickly.

Also, some of her comments make me think that she is slightly depressed, and although she has never confirmed it to me, I have some serious suspicions about it, I also meet a guy who had been in her High School class that tells me that she still has her friends from there, so she is not friendless, but he also told me that she seemed sad a lot of the time.

We got closer, and in my opinion, she showed signs that she liked me as well, however, the exams were close, and considering her need for meds just for them I decided not to tell her about my feelings until they were done so she could focus on passing them.

I must say that around this time, some people started asking me if we were dating.

We finished our exams a few days ago, I talked to her about my feelings and she told me that she needed some days to think, which is the point at which I am right now, I honestly think she is going to say no, and in the past I have never had a problem in putting some ground after a rejection. 

We live pretty close to each other, so if we remained friends, I think she would expect to hang out with me during the Summer, which I think would be too painful and would make it pretty much impossible for me to move on, If that ends up being the case, I think I will cut contact with her, but the circumstances are making me feel a bit bad about it, so I would like to hear some opinions."

I thought I would end up marrying this man so eventually we‚Äôd all have the same family name anyway. Obviously that didn‚Äôt work out. Not that we are separated it bothers me that my children don‚Äôt share a name with me. I grew up with a different last name than my mom and always hated it. So I asked my ex to agree to change our boys names and get them hyphenated to his AND mine but he very adamantly said no. So I decided I  would just change my surname to match his and the kids, even though we were never married. I don‚Äôt have any attachment to my last name as my bio dad and I have never been close so changing my name is no big deal to me. However when I mentioned it to my ex, he got angry and insisted that it would be very weird for me to do this.

I rescued her a bit too young from a bad situation and raised her on my own. She has the drive and ferocity of 1000 street cats (not really, but we let her think so). She‚Äôs a beautiful, great huntress and I am so proud of her. Anything that moves must and will be hunted.

We recently moved from a place where we had a fenced in yard that she would go outside in sometimes to a studio apartment in the city. We are on the second floor and have the whole porch to ourselves since our only neighboring apartment is empty. This gives her quite a bit of space outside of the apartment and I also have a ton of (safe!) plants that she can hide/play in.

That being said, there is a dog park right next to us. Squirrels everywhere. And a VERY busy street next to us as well as a very busy parking lot.

She is SO happy and in her element outside, and I feel guilty keeping her as an indoor cat but I can‚Äôt afford any vet bills right now (fleas, injuries, etc) and to be honest I can‚Äôt afford it emotionally if I lost her. We are best buds.

She always tests the limits and tries to run down the stairs. I feel like IATA every time I yell at her to come home and when she meows back in a begging way it breaks my heart

bxkoy7	2019-06-06 19:13:39	QuintenAl4	AITA for taking the piss out of sex pest coworker.	"Hi. I need some perspective as I'm not sure how to feel.

So I work at a pub in the UK, nothing special, just bar work. I started there when me, a bisexual man, was on Grindr (a gay dating app). A blank profile popped up, pestered me for drinks but wouldn't announce who they were so I carried on. Turns out this blank profile, I work with them... Awkward times ensue but we become chill.

Following on, there's been multiple instances where he's either been asking me for sex and now recently nudes, to him getting angry that I may be interested in a coworker (I'm not, but he thinks I am) he's interested in. His messages about sex or nudes usually consist of asking, trying to convince me to do so and then being sad about 'how old and ugly he is' to paraphrase after I tell him no (in what I hope is a genuine response and not an attempt at pity sex). 

This all comes to a head where he asks me for sex on Facebook Messenger and my coworker saw, we had a laugh and that was that. Now we had a party with a lot of staff and I was drunk beyond reasonable standards and decided while he was not present in the room to take the piss out of him, show friends the messages and then mess with him over messenger. He joined us later that night for drinks and went home early and cried because he wasn't happy about this.
At the time I thought this was all banter but now I can see it was a bit over the top.

I have apologised for such, in an attempt to make ammends and now he continues to be very aggressive. This is where the issue lies.
Am I the asshole for thinking to some extent he had it coming, I had told him repeatedly I wasn't interested and he still persisted. Additionally, thinking that he should at least be civil with me after the apology."	Not the A-hole	0	0

- Me and my ex broke up 2 years ago but still talk and get intimate. We're basically friends who have sex once a month (she has a very low sex drive). 

- She has a habit of proposing last minute  / spontaneous plans and she knows I hate it
 
- I had a 10 page report due over the weekend for school

- I asked her earlier that week if she wanted to help me with the report, her response: ""You still haven't done it?"". I don't reply and move on

Cue Saturday. I was working on my report during the morning and got 6 out of 10 pages done. (singe-spaced, academic style, citations, etc). I get a call from her around 3, asking if she could come over and work on some of her studying while I finish the paper. 

The only issue is that i already planned to go to a poker tournament for a couple of days now. 

Anyway I told her that I had a tournament at 4 but should be back home around 6:30 and we could study then. ( I also wanted to take a break from the report and get out of the house) She protests immediately saying that I ""always play poker"", I play about 2-3 times a week. I explained to her that this was something I planned on doing for days and I dont like making last minute plans. I didnt think it wouldve been a big deal for us to meet at 6:30 instead of ~4 when she wouldve arrived. She was adamant that she couldn't wait because she ""has to get out of the house"" and ""once I start studying I wont want to stop"". I once again reminded her that I dont like spontaneous plans and that this is just something I want to do. This does not mean I prefer poker over her I was just standing up for my principles and refuse to let an ex stop me from enjoying a hobby of mine. She tried to convince to not go but I assured her I would and she could come over at 6:30 if she wanted to. No show and no communication since then. I felt that it was hypocritical for her to make this plan out of nowhere then be upset when I wasn't flexible."	Not the A-hole	0	0

There are a few people at my gym that I would say are very attractive (to me at least) and of course I'd love to get their info but... I really would rather not bother people while they're working out, it just goes against gym etiquette but I have had multiple people tap me on the shoulder to say they like my tattoos and I'm never really bothered by it.

So this is where I need a little help from you guys. WIBTA for striking up a conversation and trying to get someone's number at the gym? Of course if I can tell they're bothered by me I would cut the conversation short, more so than anything else I don't want to be an asshole.

EDIT 2: Just to clarify, I've never talked to a girl at the gym to get their info before. It's always something I haven't been a fan of, but I did just want some more input. Thank you guys.

EDIT 3: lol ok I'm getting a bit ridiculous with the edits here, but I just wanted to thank everyone for the feedback.

"A little background: My son,12 has been on a competitive sports team with two particular boys for a couple of years now. He also happens to go to the same school as them. We live by the school and so does one of the others. The other kid is about 15-20 minutes south of the school. And about 15-20 minutes south of practice. The one who lives farther has two younger siblings and a dad who wasI'll, but is better now. The one who lives by the school has both parents working. I currently do not work. 

This last season it worked itself out that the two other boys would go to the house of the one who lives by the school right after school, and I would pick them up on the way to practice,which is about 15 minutes drive for me, and get them there. I don't mind at all. This is three days a week. Two of the days it's about two hours between school and practice, and one is an early day so about three hours. 

Well now I think the one boy who lives close to the school is not coming back next season. The boys mom who lives farther has already asked a couple of times to get him from school and take him to practice. She doesn't want to drive north to school, south home and back north to practice. I don't mind here and there. But this also includes feeding her son and general supervision. The days I do this, after practice I bring him back to my house and she picks him up around 8pm. I have a feeling the mom will want me to do this three to four days a week this next season. My son has homework and we have a general routine that works for us.

bxklxc	2019-06-06 19:06:43		WIBTA if I told my Mom to break up with her boyfriend?	"TL:DR at the bottom.

I‚Äôm not saying his name.

Context: He is a abusive drunk, when he isn‚Äôt drunk he‚Äôs using my mom‚Äôs medical marijuana (it‚Äôs for her chronic back and leg pain.) without her permission, even though she needs it to do her job as a hospice nurse. Which btw he doesn‚Äôt have a stable job, he works at a hotel doing dishes (idk how because he‚Äôs awful at dishes, I know from personal experience.), and barely contributes to bills, which makes my mom work overtime, which causes her pain to be worse. One more detail, my mom has mental health issues so she got a boyfriend to fill that void, so that‚Äôs why she refuses to break up with him, he uses this to his advantage. He‚Äôs the only boyfriend she has ever stayed this long with, she said this to me about 3 years ago, still can‚Äôt forget this: ‚ÄúNo other boys like me, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

If my mom ends up in a wheelchair, she won‚Äôt be able to work, which makes her whole life fall apart. But if this does happen, I‚Äôll definitely have her live with me, but I won‚Äôt invite her boyfriend.

Recently she had a miscarriage, so she got a cat to fill the void, and her boyfriend constantly throws his slippers at it, and runs at it. This cat is so jumpy that if you walk up to it, he‚Äôll run away. My mom constantly tells him to stop, but to no avail. I recently found a stray black cat and took him in, I invited my mom over for dinner to talk (I live about 5 miles away from her, not TOO far away.), her boyfriend insisted on coming, my mom said to let him come, I begrudgingly said yes. I come out of the kitchen to serve and I see him chasing and trying to hit Sebastian (my cat), this is the transcript of the convo:


Me: What the fuck are you doing???

Him: This bitch just scratched me, I had to do something to teach him better manners.

Me: Hahaha I don‚Äôt know how you do it at my mom‚Äôs house, BUT YOU CAN NOT TOUCH MY CAT. GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.


Him: (talking to my mom) C‚Äômon babe, lets go.

And before I had time to respond, they left, which left me with a bunch of leftovers.

To wrap this up quick:

He gave my mom herpes.

He is abusive to my mom‚Äôs cat, which I‚Äôm considering taking in.

He still has connections to his ex, my mom caught then sexting, but didn‚Äôt break up with him.

Also, sorry if this was a bit of a rant.

Over a month ago, I asked if I should report my friend for vandalizing a botanical garden for no reason. Now, I‚Äôll try to give the most important details of what happened after the post.

Several days after I made the post, I decided to report my friend. The easiest way to do this was speaking to an adult, so I got with one of my best friends who I trust to speak with our pastor. Our town is small, and our pastor is very well known in the community, so we knew he would be the best person to talk to. We spoke with him in private and it turns out he knows the president of the botanical garden personally. We told him the name of our friend and we told him that this was an anonymous tip, and that when the vandal is caught, we want the money to be donated to the botanical garden. 

After that, nothing really happened. It wasn‚Äôt until about 3 weeks later when something finally happened. In between one period at school, my friend came up to me and boasted that he‚Äôs going to get charged with destruction of property. This made me mad but a little happy at the same time. I was mad because he was being an asshole to the end, but I was glad that he would get punished.

Again, nothing happened for a while, about 2 weeks. However, I checked the local paper today and a section is dedicated to explaining that the botanical garden vandals have been caught. The botanical garden has decided not to press charges against the vandals, however they are forcing the vandals to do community service at the garden over the summer. The newspaper states that the ‚Äútipster did not accept‚Äù the $500, but it never says that it was donated back to the garden. 

The ending of this story was pretty boring, but I don‚Äôt care. I just hope that this will open my friend‚Äôs eyes and that he will stop doing stupid things."	Update	0	0

At the moment my friend (14) is having problems at school where he is without a proper meal at lunch, he often doesn't have time to make his sandwiches in the morning for school. His parents refuse to give him money to have a hot lunch, or make it themselves, and so he often goes hungry. 

Me and one other friend will often pay for his lunch but we do not have always have enough money. It doesn't help that he is on the larger size, and his hunger will put him in a bad mood, which completely ruins his day. I am not sure but I guess it affects his concentration.

He refuses to speak to his parents about it because his mom is deathly strict and both parents are sort of ""traditional"". I want to help by maybe talking to the school or pursuading him to talk to his parents about it. 

His parents are really nice and NOT abusive just strict. I don't want to mess up his life by getting authorities involved but if it keeps up I might have to.

When they took her in it was with a clear understanding that she is still MINE. I am still responsible for her vet care, she's legally registered to me etc. I still go and clean up the poop in their yard every other weekend too. 
Also, while I appreciate my parents taking her on, and know they love her dearly, I don't like how restrictive of her they are. Like, she's not allowed to rome the house freely. Shes not allowed on the carpet, etc. She sleeps on a small rug on the kitchen tile, and she is on a leash attatched to the table when inside. I don't fight them on this anymore, because ultimately it is their house, and they took her as a favor to me. In my home my pets are allowed to roam freely when I am home and are crated when I go to work ( though if I get a home w a yard she would be outside during the day weather permitting. ) 
Also, my stepdad believes that even if he refuses to let me take her, I should still be financially responsible for her. I told him that if he wont relinquish O, that he's claiming her as his dog and will have to pay for her care. Clean his own yard, etc. He disagrees. 
TLDR: My parents have had my dog for a while and I want her back in the nearish future. Stepdad says no, but still thinks I should pay for her care even if he keeps her.

bxke8p	2019-06-06 18:49:04		WIBTA If I Report a 7th Grade Student to the FBI Anonymously because the School Won't Take Action	"(posting from a friend's account) 

I am a middle school teacher in upstate NY (not New York City) One student I believe has undiagnosed Asperger's or Autism (or both) and his mother refuses to have him tested, claiming he is ""just a little unique."" This was not an issue until he developed a fascination for weapons, death, and mass murders.

This student is OBSESSED with weapons . He often searches the Home Ec. room for knives or sharp things, even the blades inside a blender he will try to grab. He has asked (during a sewing unit) if it was possible to shoot and/or kill someone with a needle, resulting in the teacher providing him with a plastic needle instead of metal. He has asked what it feels like to stab and cut people with knives. He has stated out loud that his happy place is killing humans. He has also been caught looking up (on school computers) mass murders and the guns and masks that we're used in previous mass murders.
--I document each of these occurrences and share them with his school counselor who seems less than concerned.

Despite bringing these matters to the attention of school counselors and the schools administration, they refuse to take ANY action. They have stated I could ""write him a referral, but this reflects poorly on you as a teach."" I am a first year teacher and do not want to risk my job or potentially risk not being tenured in the future for deviating from the administrations wishes - But I am TERRIFIED of this student and what he might do. 

I believe the administration doesn't want to take action or write a referral because it will impact the funding we as a school can (in some way) affect the funding we receive from the State.

bxkcqv	2019-06-06 18:45:33	nanapple	AITA for kicking out my best friend who had nowhere else to go?	" Okay, sorry if the title is a little misleading, but it's a complicated situation. So here's some details that will be essential to the story later. The person in question will be named JA. 
He has a record for stepping over boundaries, for example, while I have back problems and say that I need to sleep on the bed or I won't get much sleep and I'll be hurting all day tomorrow, he'll sleep on the bed and make me sleep on the floor. However, as I understand it, his family life is complicated.

So, on to the story.

 One day, after school on a Friday, I head home and decided to lay down, my back had been killing me all day from sitting in a hard chair for 7 hours. An hour later I receive a call from JA saying he wants to spend the night over at my house, I agree, but only on the condition that he goes home tomorrow because I had somewhere to be the next day(I wanted to spend time with my family, so I was going to have lunch with them). So then he comes over. We chat for a while and all things considered, I had a decent time talking to him, even though I was getting fed up with his anitcs. Then, night time comes around and I'm ready to clock out and I tell him I'm gonna sleep on the bed, my back was hurting a lot that day. And just like he did any other day, as soon as I was about to sleep, he comes over, sits on my bed with his phone watching TikToks loudly and falls asleep.

 Since he kicks and takes the whole bed while he's asleep, I go sleep on the couch, painfully.

 Finally, the next morning, I wake him and tell him we'll take him home, it was 1pm in the afternoon. So I was going to leave soon, and for the record, I didn't want to bring him along because I wanted to spend time with family, NOT him. Then he says that his family doesn't want him back for the weekend and his mom told him to not come back. Not only that, but apparently none of his other friends could have him over, so he settled for me. He didn't mention this over the phone yesterday and now he was saying he doesn't have anywhere else to go. Now I had an appointment, and while I could have taken him with me, I didn't, I just dropped him off at his house. I didn't care if he was locked out of his house at the time, I was just really upset that he only told me this now. I kind of feel like he was trying to manipulate me, but I need a third party opinion, so AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I asked the husband when he was moving, since while they were all talking about driving across country it sounded like he wouldn't be with them. Turns out I put my foot in my mouth, because he said he wasn't moving, they were getting a divorce, news to me. Anyways the next few minutes were a little awkward, and I noticed him and my wife whispering back and forth in the corner. Later when everyone is leaving, he gives my wife a hug, and she proceeds to grope his chest and comment how I used to be like that. Then she asks him for his phone number before they go. After they're gone I made a statement along the lines of ""why were you flirting with our daughter's friend soon to be ex-husband"" then my wife and daughter proceed to laugh and try to ridicule me saying, ""Ummmm they're friends?"" I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I find it inappropriate for a woman to grope a dude half her age, and ask his phone number, when they've met a handful of times in the last 6 months?

bxk9z6	2019-06-06 18:39:14	AegonCorgiryen	AITA for avoiding family after they mishandled money	"A bit of back ground of information that's important for the narrative. Family often struggles with money so my Dad often would as me to lend him cash. That was fine as long as he asked and repaid me. My dad has access to bank account as he's the one that opened for me when I was younger. I'm also in the military so sometimes I lose communications electronically for long time periods. 

&#x200B;

Story: I have a month long training exercise in which a lose electronic communications. During this time period I also have a nice back paid amount of cash deposited into my account. During this time Dad decides to take out about $1500 from account. I had told them I would not had contact but they could leave me texts and I'd read them when I did. Such a large amount is deposited that I honestly don't realize that I'm missing $1500. Finally get home and Dad asks for another $1000. Which I say ok (he asked I'm cool with it). This is the point that I start to crunch numbers and find that Dad has been taking out my money without telling me. He's had mulitiple times to bring it up ( I was living with them for a few weeks when i returned plus electronic communication). I finally confront him essentially asking if he had a plan to pay me back $2500. He says yes and I'm ok with it at that time. Even if it's just small chunks atleast I'd hope he'd chip away at it. Fast forward a few months. Nothing no money paid back and in fact he has the balls to bring up conversation about him finally able to start paying me back and immediate asks for more money after (THE BALLS ON THIS GUY). At which point I tell him no I don't have money to give him. 

&#x200B;

Since then I've actively avoided my family as a whole and it's been my mother (who buries her head in the sand about money) who's been asking about why I don't visit and blah blah blah. Luckily I live far enough that I tell them I don't wanna drive to the small town they live in. If they wanna see me they can come anytime (they don't). BTW I have told me my mother that my dad owes me money.  

&#x200B;

It's not the money being owed that bothers me it's the fact that my dad 1) took money from me without asking 2) hasn't attempted what so ever to pay me back or to even mention it. This began almost a year ago.

We've known each other for 5+ years and are pretty close. I feel that she's a great friend --is generally supportive, funny, empathetic, and has definitely been a shoulder to cry on during tough times. 

I've been thinking about what I'm going to get her and realized that I'm leaning toward just not getting a gift. I'd buy a round of drinks or dinner at her event of course. Generally, in our friend circle gifts are welcome, but by no means expected. 

When I sat down to think about it I realized that the last time she'd gotten me anything for a birthday or Christmas was probably 3-4 years ago, whereas I had been consistent year over year. One of my primary love languages is gift giving, so it was never really something I thought twice about until now. This time around, I'm a little worried that I'm starting to feel a twinge of resentment over the imbalance and think that the best solution is to stop doing things that would increase the resentment, i.e. gift giving.

He has a large family with several close siblings and cousins who all live close to each other. It takes us 3 hours by public transit to get to them, and costs a lot (we don't drive). We are both in low paid jobs and money is tight. His family have invited us to three seperate family events in the span of a month, and put a LOT of pressure on us about having to go to all of them.

We made the journey for the first event this month, my SIL (SO's sister)'s birthday celebrations. It was made clear that not attending was not an option and she cried when she thought not everyone was going to make it. So we paid $200 for travel and went.

Fast forward to now: it's my birthday coming up soon,  and I will be back in their state to see my family. I invited SIL and some others, unfortunately not many people would be able to attend, and now she has cancelled on me too, saying that it will be too expensive. To make it clear, she has free travel and what I had planned will cost approximately $20. 

Meanwhile she & SO's family are giving us crap about me not coming to the next family event this month, because it will be too expensive and require doing the whole journey twice in one day due to work. They keep telling us to suck it up and that this is our fault for moving so far away and not their problem, we need to find a way. SO is going to go if he can get time off work, but I told them I can't afford it.

So, AITA for 1) being pissed off about her blowing me off for my birthday after the effort/expense we went to for hers, and 2) feeling like if no one will make a minimal effort for me, then I shouldn't bother for them, especially if it will cause us financial trouble?

TL;DR: Spent $200 and two days travelling for SIL's birthday party. Now she says mine is too expensive, but she/SO's family still expect us to attend 2 further events this month that will cost us another several hundred despite us being in a bad financial situation and having work commitments.

I feel as though my reaction was justified, but I can‚Äôt help but feel really bad about it. To be honest, I doubt she even remembers this ever happening.

My mom and I were visiting my sister in B.C. for the week, we were in the car together on our way to lunch. My mom was driving and she missed the turn, my sister told her that she missed it and my mom got really defensive. She started yelling at my sister for being so critical, and rude. We were both kind of shocked at this outburst as it was completely unexpected. My mom started laying into my sister for always ‚Äòcriticizing‚Äô her. This kind of pissed me off, as we don‚Äôt get to see my sister often and my mom takes what was supposed to be a fun afternoon and turns it into an argument. I didn‚Äôt want to hear anymore fighting so I said something to the tune of ‚ÄúMom, can you please stop fighting? I just want to have a nice day.‚Äù 

She responded with ‚Äústay out of this Sarah.‚Äù 

(Now for context Sarah is my legal name, a couple years ago I came out to my mom as trans and decided to change my name to Sage (my sister thought of it). My name had been Sage for a year at this point.)

I responded to that with ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my name.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt say it rudely, it was just matter of fact. 

My mom then said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the name I gave you so it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to use.‚Äù I understand that for 15 years I was her little girl and it was hard for my mom to adjust. But what she said really hurt, and I think it was completely wrong for her to say something like that.

I retaliated with a simple ‚Äúfuck you.‚Äù I instantly felt really bad about it, but I stood my ground. She told me to apologize to her, I said I would if she apologized for what she said to me. She apologized, not for what she said, but simply for being rude and fighting. This isn‚Äôt what I wanted and I asked her again to apologize for what she said. She insisted that she had already apologized for it. I continued to refuse to say sorry, and I never did. I feel really bad for talking to her like that, she‚Äôs my mother. Am I the asshole?"

bxk6lb	2019-06-06 18:31:05	nastygeek	AITA for telling everyone that survey is not anonymous	" So  a couple of days ago, our enterprise sent out a system wide email  survey. The email also said your responses are ""confidential"". And our managers were pretty anal about getting the survey done.

&#x200B;

My  manager emailed us saying if anyone lost that email, just email HR and  they will send you the survey again, which made me think why does HR  need to email again and why cant my manger just forward the email to  everyone. Upon closer look, the email said, that this survey is  confidential. below that, in smaller font, it also said, that this email  survey has been specially customized for you and please do not forward  the link to anyone. This basically means that even though they are not  asking for name or email or other identifying details while filling out  the survey, the fact that my link is unique tells me that my responses  are automatically tracked to my name and email.

So  I just sent out a text to my group, telling them that this survey  is not anonymous, just FYI. In case someone wanted to write strong comments. Most of my colleagues were genuinely surprised  and thanked me for the heads up, some of them even had a 'oops' moment.

But, one of the my colleagues FREAKED out and accused me of manipulating the  group into lying and being dishonest. She wrote a strongly worded text  to me saying that surveys (whether anonymous or not) are a vehicle for change and honest responses  are expected and are actually helpful. And that I came across as asking them to be dishonest (whether it was my intent or not). In full disclosure, I did send a follow up text  to the group saying that please answer honestly.

&#x200B;

I  freaked out and called some of my colleagues for guidance, who could  not believe that it was even an issue. and most of them that its just a  damn survey, shouldn't be a career deciding factor. They were genuinely  appalled that my colleague was making an issue with this. Eventually I  texted that colleague back, saying that I agree with her in all her  concerns, however, I dont think I have the power to influence the minds  of 15 highly educated, adult **doctors**.  And if anyone's responses change on the fact that this is not  anonymous, then its their problem and not mine. You can not fault me for explaining the terms and conditions to someone. I am not encouraging  dishonesty.

However,  this has deeply bothered me, that she portrayed me as someone  advocating for anarchy and attempting a coup by forcing people to be  dishonest. If a word of this got out, that [u/nastygeek](https://www.reddit.com/u/nastygeek/)  is encouraging people into lying, I will have to explain to the  management, which may or may not appreciate my explanation.

That being said, I‚Äôve had some good times and some regrettable times in my bed. I made a joke awhile back to one of my friends (guy) about wondering how ‚Äúgood‚Äù I was at doing the deed. We laughed and he told me to, literally, ask the girls how it was. I figured this was the best option, why not hear it straight from them?

So, for the past 3 years of college, after a hookup, I‚Äôve asked the girls to rate me, on a scale of 1-10, how good the action was. I‚Äôve gotten a wide range of numbers on the scale and various reactions, but all positive. Some girls (friends with benefits) laugh and give me a 1, while others (hookups) joke about it happening again. 

The number doesn‚Äôt exactly matter to me anymore, by this point it‚Äôs more of a running joke with myself to ask the question. However, recently, I had my first negative reaction to my poll. We had just finished up and we were crawling back in the bed to cuddle (I got her a glass of water and some snacks) and I jokingly popped the question. She seemed horribly flustered and, even though I told her it was a joke and she needn‚Äôt answer, she called me plenty of worse things than asshole, got dressed, then stormed out of my apartment.

"So my friend messaged me a few days ago telling me that his friend's friend (you can already see the degree of separation here) is desperately looking for a job, otherwise she will have to move over to a different country and work for her family's business. He knew that I had referred a couple of my friends to my workplace in the past, with all of them securing a job because my director has a lot of trust in me. 

&#x200B;

I agreed to help this girl out, as a favour for my friend and also because the referral bonus of $2,000 is pretty sweet. I told my director about how I wanted to refer a friend (I still haven't met this girl yet) and sent him her resume. He mentioned he would call her and set up an interview. I later learned that this girl is actually best friends with my coworker's sister. I told him the situation and he immediately expressed how he was disappointed that his sister never told him that her best friend was looking for work. He immediately asked that we split the referral bonus because he would help me make a recommendation to our director to help her get hired (without realizing I already referred her and passed on her resume). As someone with a laidback (borderline pushover) personality, I agreed and said I would split the bonus with him provided that he carpools her, as they live near each other (and quite far from work). Transiting from her area would take an hour and a half, sometimes more - driving would take 40 minutes. He reluctantly agreed and we seemed to have ourselves a deal. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday I wrote a 1000 word document outlining the expectations of our role and also about the company, including tips/tricks on how to succeed with the intention of sending it to the girl. My friend also set up a group chat with his friend, me, and this girl so I could further prepare her for her inevitable interview. I even have a dinner set up this coming Monday to officially meet this girl so it won't be awkward when she actually comes to the office for an in-person interview. 

&#x200B;

I went up to my coworker and confirmed with him that I will be splitting the referral bonus with him provided that he's going to carpool her. He said he is not carpooling her, even if she drives over to his place to save him some time. I said I was only going to split the referral bonus with him because he was willing to carpool her. He said he didn't want to anymore but will still put in his recommendation to help get her hired (hinting he's still doing something to help for the bonus). I said I already referred her so his recommendation is optional/unnecessary at this point. He never replied to this message, and now I'm not sure whether to talk to him and explicitly say that I will not be splitting the bonus with him anymore.

The result of these choices has landed her flat on her ass in our spare room. She and I have always been pretty close as she's a single mom to all boys and I'm the first daughter in law in the family. We have been having these, what I call ""therapy sessions"", since she's moved in and I've been trying to help her through some of her guilt for things she's done in the past. My husband's relationship with her has been on the mend as well. They've laughed more together this past week then I've ever seen. Today, however, while he was at work she dropped a bombshell on me. My husband's brother (who used to live with her before she moved in with us) has picked up his old pill habit and she's been enabling him. She said if he needed $5 for a xanax she would give it to him and drive him to see his guy. She feels that now that she lives with us and is away from him he will get better and get off the pain pills.

So that's the jist of it. I dont want to betray her trust because she never said please dont tell *insert husbands name*, but I feel like she's really hoping that I won't. My husband and I are at max capacity on our limit for helping people since we have his mom now and we have no resources to help his brother. But I've seen what he can become when he's on pills, he's not himself. I also don't want to damage the integrity of my husband's relationship with his mom because it's just now getting better and it makes me happy to see them getting along.

Am I the asshole if I keep this from my husband?

To sum it up: My brother in law has picked up his old pill habit and my mother in law has been enabling it. Am I an asshole if I don't tell my husband about it?"		1	0
bxk66n	2019-06-06 18:30:07	onemoreoneless	AITA for asking for use of the sink?	"Trying to eliminate as many extraneous or biasing details here in order to get as objective a judgment as possible.

The players:

Me and my husband

The facts:

We both work flexible schedules, mostly from home.

""Washing dishes"" has not been assigned as a chore in this household since we moved to this house (about a year ago), and has switched off in the past, but since we moved, I do it 80-90% of the time.

I hurt my back somehow in the past week. Hopefully nothing serious in the long term, but, yesterday, I could do physically do much less than normal. I asked husband to do the dishes after I made dinner (empty dishwasher, reload, maybe a couple pots) in particular because of all the bending over. He was very sympathetic and kind and assured me he would do so today.

I came home today at 2 pm from a short gig. Husband said this was the perfect time for him to start the dishes, so we could chat while we did them. I agreed.

I started making my lunch, at which point (about 3 minutes into his doing the dishes), I asked if I could use the sink for a minute. The food I was making required rinsing something in a colander before I microwaved it and would then be out of his way.

He said, ""Really? Right now?""

And I said, ""Well, sorry, but yeah, to get my food started-- I'm really hungry. It's just a minute. I could use the bathroom, but...""

He said, ""Well, that's annoying,"" and walked off, leaving the dishwasher open and most of the dishes undone.

AITA?

bxk5ga	2019-06-06 18:28:16	SammyTheKitty	AITA for complaining to my husband?	"Some quick background, I (26F) have been with my husband (28M) for many years now. We've always had a good relationship and prided ourselves on communicating well with each other. We have a strict policy of never going to bed angry, so it's rare for me to go sleep without cuddling and smiling/laughing at something with him. Conflict is rare with us, but even when it does happen it's usually resolved quickly.

A couple months ago I had my gallbladder removed and was in and out of doctors for awhile because of post op issues. Things seemed like they'd calmed down and I was doing fine until last week some new issues came up. And long story short, there's been a lot of nausea, pain, and digestive issues this week almost all week (I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow.) I'm doing a food journal and other things to try to help isolate a cause, particularly since I'm the one that cooks.

Earlier today while talking, my husband asked if I can take a break from talking to him about the issues for awhile because he feels burned out from it. I expressed that him saying that felt really dismissive. I've been in a lot of pain and discomfort for days, so I'm pretty sick of it too and I don't get the luxury of taking a break from it. Plus, I'm trying to talk it out to hopefully solve what's going on and fix it.

We both expressed our feelings on it and he hugged me and reassured me that I'm strong and he's proud of me for dealing with all this. He's at work now, but I'm sure we'll talk more when he's home, but I want some third party input in the meantime.

So I'll head over to where she's at and grab her, give her a kiss and compliment her. Something like ""She's so funny. That's why I married her."" Then I leave so she can continue talking. Almost every time, the guy ends up leaving after I do. She's never really flirting with these guys, just talking sports or politics. But she's beautiful and very smart and she has a knack for being very personable so they assume she is flirting. She says all she is trying to do is have a conversation with a stranger but I'll I'm doing is letting people know we are married.

bxk4tx	2019-06-06 18:26:45	Goblinkok	WIBTA for wanting to cancel the support for my two kids I have custody of?	I'll try to keep this brief as possible. So almost 3 years I me and my ex wife decided to do 50/50. I really wanted it and the kids did to. During the first year it quickly became aparent that it would be more like 90/10, the 90 being with me. So I asked her since I have them so much and provide significantly more for them than she does that I would like to cancel the support to her. She agreed I said great. Several months went by and I looked into it with the case worker and found out that I cannot cancel it because she gets food stamps. That was unknown to me, I thought it was strange because she hardly ever has them and she claims them on the food stamps. I also need to mention that she lives with her parents by choice and works a fulltime job. She has lived with them for three years and told me she doesnt want to leave because basically she has it so easy.  After I find out she gets the food stamps I tell her hey we cant cancel because you are on these when she doesnt need to be. She then gets angry and tells me she needs them so we are not canceling. What she is doing is using my kids on the account to get more money and using it as payment and provide food for their house while I have custody of our kids and she still gets my child support. I have let this go on for almost three years. And yes that is fraud to claim kids you dont ever have. Talk about cake and eat it too. Meanwhile I bust my ass at work to provide for my two kids who live with me while she lives it up in her parents basement.	Not the A-hole	0	0

&#x200B;

So I live in Nashville, TN but I'm getting married Halloween of next year near my hometown in West TN. It's a two hour drive from both Memphis and Nashville airports, and less than a third of our small wedding (A total of roughly 15 people out of 105 guests total) is flying in. Part of the reason we're getting married out there is because everything is cheaper for us and for our guests as opposed to getting married in the Middle TN area. 

&#x200B;

Most will be driving from my town in West TN and Nashville in their own vehicles. I've been told rather aggressively that I'm acting like a jerk because I said people can figure out their own transportation to and from my wedding. I'm close to uninviting some people because of how some of my guests are treating me because of this.

&#x200B;

Car rentals are cheap, which they would have to do anyway to get to the town from an airport (total of $70 for the whole weekend). Surprisingly, despite it being a rural area, there is Uber in my area both ways to the venue and hotel we have blocked reservations at ($25 each way, but still, it's available). Both of these things have been made clear to all guests, especially since we have over a year before the wedding even happens. That should be plenty of time to figure out your transportation.

&#x200B;

I truly feel that, as an adult, if you can't figure out how to watch your drinking enough to get home safely, that's not my problem/fault.  My father, who doesn't drink, has also offered to shuttle people if they accidentally get too drunk even though they drove, which I have also shared with all the guests. I've also offered carpool plans and lodging at local friends/family houses to assist with any budget troubles. 

&#x200B;

I've provided my own transportation at every wedding I've ever been to, rural and urban. I've never felt like that was a big deal when I was an attendee.

&#x200B;

I don't know if it makes a difference, but I also requested no gifts. So is it really that big of a deal for people to pay for their own transportation when they have options and plenty of time to budget/figure it out?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

She has no problem living that lifestyle herself and seems content with it, which i have no problems if she wants to live her own life that way. However, she doesn't understand that that isnt how EVERYONE wants to do things and often makes remarks that make me and especially my girl uncomfortable, asking her ""why don't you help clean up this house"" and such (the house being my parents and not our own).

bxjzme	2019-06-06 18:14:48		WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt tell my parents that me and my fianc√© actually got married years prior so I could get in-state tuition?	"So me and my SO have been dating for about 6 years now. We had a court room wedding a couple years ago so I could receive in-state tuition to finish my undergrad degree. The state I‚Äôm from has one of the highest in state tuition rates in the country while his is among the lowest. Plus, I get to live with him and finish my degree with significantly less loans taken out. 

We have a wedding coming up that all of our family will be at. Only my SO‚Äôs parents know that we got married for in state tuition and that we were eventually planning an actual wedding. My parents and almost all friends and associates do not. (A friend signed as our witness on the license) I want to tell my parents but my mom is the reason holding me back. 

My entire childhood was plagued with her untreated bipolar episodes and constant emotional manipulation through her and my father‚Äôs divorce. I knew that I could not initially tell her me and my SO were getting married for that reason because she would have offered to pay for my education if I didn‚Äôt get married. 

This is the problem, my mom has pulled that same scenario my entire life. She offered to buy me a car and teach me to drive if I lived with her after the divorce. Didn‚Äôt happen. She offered to pay for my associates degree and then the rest of my bachelors if I lived in the same state as her. Didn‚Äôt happen. She offered an internship at her work if I studied a certain major. Didn‚Äôt happen. When I changed my major she trash talked me to all my family and said I wouldn‚Äôt finish the degree- I did. (There‚Äôs quite a few more examples but those are the most prominent).  I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable telling her we initially got married and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable telling her it now because of the possible violent/scary reaction. Plus, we‚Äôre getting married in an actual wedding.

I cannot tell my dad because he is the type of person who would for sure tell her out of guilt of knowing.

Also, I have done all of my financial aid, taxes, and taken care of finances for school by myself for these years. Neither parent was able to get approved for any Parent Plus Loan or a secondary loan of any kind. I declared myself independent through the marriage because you receive a significant amount more of money than someone dependent on parents with a middle mid-middle class salary. The expected values of contribution from my parents was set significantly higher than what they would/could contribute to my education.

LSS: Me and my SO go married a couple years ago so I could get in state tuition. I didn‚Äôt want to tell my mom specifically because she would have manipulated me to stay with her and would most likely have a unprecedented reaction."	No A-holes here	1	0

The lady my best friend was marrying has a sister who my friend has had a crush on for months now, but he hasn't really pursued it due to past experiences with women (He struggles with being insecure). I decided to help him try to talk to this girl while we were at the wedding and reception. Basically, he and I walked up to her together and I started talking to her as I know her much better.  Fast forward a few minutes and I excuse myself to get cake, leaving him and her to talk alone. Half and hour goes by and they break for the throwing of the bouquet and garter, after which he comes up to me all happy having had a good conversation with her.  He decides he wants to go back to our hotel and sleep while I help clean up at the reception. Turns out the girl in question was going to stay and help too (I did not know this) so we ended up working together for a while.  Next day I get a text from her thanking me for staying and helping, and we chat for a bit about just nothing.  This goes on for a bit, and the next day she changes the tone of the texting to something more serious and she starts sending pics and stuff (nothing explicit). Tuesday he and I were going out that morning to do some shopping, and i had to stop at the bank.  While we were there I left my phone in the car with him, and I guess I left it on because he was a text come though from her and asked me about it when I got back.  I explained to him that she was the one that reached out to me and I thought nothing of our talking, but he cut the shopping trip short and went home. Now he isnt answering texts or calls and has told me he doesn't want to talk. AITA?

EDIT: So the timeline is confusing (my bad) so let me clear that up. Wedding is Friday.  She texts me first thing Saturday morning and says thank you (he knows about this text). Her and I chat for a bit because were friends and I thought nothing of it. We keep chatting and on Monday it takes a more serious turn, with her talking more serious and sending pics. Tuesday morning were going to go to go to the mall, I hadn't told her I wasnt interested but also did not reciprocate any of the feelings, and she texted again with my phone on in the car as we were using my bluetooth and spotify, which is when he saw the notification. 

He and I texted tonight and we are going to talk it out over dinner tomorrow night and see a movie (Dark Phoenix, yay). I'm sure everything will be fine after tomorrow as he is a great guy and I never meant to hurt his feelings, I should have immediately ended the talking when it got serious. I have apologized and he seems all good, but everything will be ironed out tomorrow night."	No A-holes here	0	0

bxjvni	2019-06-06 18:05:38	Invincrono	AITA for not wanting to apologize after a former friend (35M) went off on me (32M)?	"Like the title says. Had a former friend who went nuts one day when I texted him. Some background, I'm into the craft beer hobby, and our relationship changed when I met my wife. When things got serious with her, all my time started to shift from friends, to her. My former friend, ""Jonathan"", did not take this well and would complain that we never hang out anymore, but prior to this initiating for hanging out was 50/50. 

His job at a uni didn't pay well and I would pay him $50 to wait in beer lines with me so I could get more beer. Recently, he got laid off and asked me to try and help him find a job. I had just started at a job with a different company, and was not comfortable trying to bring people in. I previously tried to get him a job at my former company, but he really screwed up and didn't submit his resume timely.

I sent him a meme one day of a ""grill"". It was supposed to be humorous as it depicted a fidget spinner attached to a tooth as a faux new trend, along with other memes. He flipped out, called me a ""virtue signaling racist who never tried to help him get a job, or hook him up with any of my friends (he's never been popular with women, and all my friends are not single), who only hits him up to mule beer for me, and never stuck up for him when my friends called him Mexi Jon"". He said we were no longer friends. 

I told him the following:  
1. He has a personal responsibility to say something if he's bothered by something. Yes, he isn't Mexican, but the joke was made jovially without the intention to hurt him. 

2. At my prior company (Fortune 100), an Ops position opened up and I told him to get his resume in order. When it does get posted, later that day, he should apply. He responded ""Okay, great!"". Later that night that the posting was up and I told him he should apply. 2 days later he texts he just applied. By Day 2, they already have 1000s of applicants they're sifting through.

3. I disagree with his perception of women, and that's why I would never EVER set him up with any of my friends. He used to say things like ""I just want a family, I want women to know I'm not interested in friendship, I just want a wife and kids"". I would respond with comments like ""Well women want a foundation of respect and friendship to start with, marriage isn't just the first step, it's one of the last ones"", but he stated that dating was wasting his time. To me, it seemed like he considered women just incubators, means to an end. 

4. Friendship is a 2 way street; I was the only one hitting him up to hang out, and he just simply stopped initiating wanting to hang out. If he didn't want to go hang out, all he had to say was ""No"". 

5. I actively organize and march with minority rights activists, a couple memes doesn't change who I am.

Basically, I called out his message line by line, and told him to piss off. My wife thinks I should reach back out to him and apologize, but I really don't see a benefit to the friendship at this point.

But then, my English professor created a project to boost everyone's grades. I thought my study would be a perfect fit for that project. The drawback? It had to be a group project. I grabbed my best friend of three years (let's call her Bianca).

I am a pretty high achiever in my class, the professor likes me a lot. He doesn't like Bianca. He assumed I would be doing all the work. My friend decided that she needed to prove that she was a good student before the year was finished. She wanted to make sure she did at least half. 

We did the first experiment, and she talked over the participants and tried to convince them to change their answer. Not what the study was about. I decided to let it slide because in knew if I brought it up Bianca would take it personally. 

About halfway through the project, I had to leave for a conference in Vancouver. I trust Bianca a lot, so I let her complete the rest of the study. We had less participants then we anticipated. A lot less. The tests Bianca did were pivotal. I left her my camera gear. She then asked if she could use candy instead of money for the rest of the study. I was horrified. I said absolutely not. But I also gave her some money to complete the rest of it because I realized it might be a money thing.

The tests she did she recorded on a PARTICIPANT'S PHONE because she couldn't figure out the camera. That meant the recording was almost usable. Bianca didn't let the participants discuss or explain their answers, and again spoke over them and tried to change their answers. 

She really wanted to edit, so I let her. It was the night before she presented. The video was far from being edited. She couldn't even work on it that night because she did it on a school computer. I was infuriated. I couldn't let my name go on this terrible project. We agreed that I would edit the clips and she would put audio on it. 

I edited the whole thing. It took seven hours but I did it. It wasn't what we agreed on, but after seeing what Bianca had done, I didn't want to let her. What's edited was something I could feel good about putting my name on. I got a text the next day from Bianca, and she was pissed. She said that wasn't what we agreed on, that it hurts that I wouldn't tell her. 

I think she genuinely thought the work she was doing was really good, she wasn't trying to hurt the study. I feel like I didn't do something that bad, but her texts say otherwise. 

Am I the asshole?

During college, communication went down a little, but I could always count on Luke to have my back.

I‚Äôm home for the summer and invited Luke and a few other friends on a vacation at my uncle‚Äôs beach house. He declined, saying he couldn‚Äôt take time off work.

So I was driving solo on the vacation (was going to meet the rest of my squad there) when I realized  I forgot my keys back at home an hour and a half into my drive.

bxjp88	2019-06-06 17:50:13		AITA for losing my cool with my cognitively-challenged partner?	"My partner was injured very badly three years ago.  He lost a lot of blood, almost died, and spent weeks in intensive care to recover.  

&#x200B;

He has mostly recovered physically, but there are some long-lasting cognitive repercussions.  He's still a clever guy who holds down a full time professional job.  But, he has memory problems, is easily distracted, has trouble with logical reasoning, and is more immature in his emotional responses than he used to be.   He's gone from being neat and organized, to a bit of a slob.  This vascular brain damage is a part of recovery that doctors don't tell you about.

&#x200B;

Rational me knows that this is hard for him, and that my role is to be patient and supportive.  But, day-to-day frustrations just keep bubbling up.  In the last week, he's:

* Lost my car/house keys by dropping them in the basket where we keep our dog leash.
* Put our good chef's knives and a cast iron pan in the dishwasher.
* Put ethanol fuel in our antique car - again.
* Ordered the same item from an online retailer three times by accident. 
* Lost the cap to the toothpaste - never found. 

&#x200B;

His take is that I'm picky about wanting everything done my special way.  He gets pissed off, or sulky, or extremely argumentative.

I feel like these issues aren't personal pickiness - he's flat out ruining stuff.  I don't want to argue and I try to let the little stuff slide, but some things have to be addressed.

&#x200B;

We've worked on strategies and he makes some effort to take notes and make lists, but he'll make the same mistake over again in no time.  He could look online for instructions, but he doesn't.  He could wait and ask/let me do something he's not sure about, but he doesn't.   He could work harder at the habits that could help - like putting the keys on the designated tray every single time, but he doesn't bother.  He could get professional help to try to optimize the skills he still has and repair those that are lagging, but he refuses to go. 

&#x200B;

Last night I ended up getting really irritated and telling him to just get out of the kitchen, and that I don't have the time, energy, or money to keep fixing things he's f'ed up.  On one hand I feel like a total asshole because I know much of this isn't in his control and it is frightening and frustrating for him.  On the other hand, I feel like he should do the best he can, and he isn't putting in the effort.

bxjp6a	2019-06-06 17:50:06		AITA for wanting my bf to sell tickets to a concert he bought last minute, when we already had plans?	"I usually work every single Saturday, but this upcoming Saturday I am **miraculously** not scheduled to work. Since it‚Äôs supposed to be a beautiful weekend where I live, I thought it would be nice for my bf to dust off the camping gear and spend a night drinking beers, grilling hot dogs, and hanging out by the fire at this cozy little campground we like to frequent. When I mentioned this idea to my bf earlier in the week he was super pumped about it, and it had seemed like the gears were in motion and we‚Äôd be able to go. 

Cue last night when he realized one of his favorite artists is coming to town and immediately on the spot bought 2 tickets to the show, (music I like, but this particular artist is a little heavier than I prefer, like mosh pit heavy) so it‚Äôs just not my scene. I was **really** pumped to go camping, and when I mentioned this to him he said ‚Äúwell you can just have a night in with this girls and I can see if a friend wants to come with‚Äù. Both my girlfriends have kids and I don‚Äôt, and I have super duper wanted to have a fun night this weekend (not to be a stick in the mud, but some *kid free* fun) I am frustrated he is so quick to brush me off to have a night with friends when I got my hopes up for the camping trip this weekend. 

I kind of regret saying this to him, but I sent him sassy a text like ‚Äúwhatever, I‚Äôll just stay home, give a friend my ticket and have a great time‚Äù. Obviously the snarky comment doesn‚Äôt help my case in the not-an-asshole department but I just need some feedback here."		1	0
bxjovz	2019-06-06 17:49:21	3m3ti8	AITA for cutting off contact with a friend.	" 

Back story: I've been friends with her for a little over 2 years. I don't have a lot of girlfriends because I not a gossip queen, I have always kept women at a distance. I let this one in.

She (Linda) is now in the middle of a nasty divorce and has come to me as sounding board. I have never been in a divorce however, I have been in some long term relationships that did end in heart ache. I give her solid unbiased advise. She then does the exact opposite of what I thought I made clear. He asked for space and to leave him alone. She texts and calls all day long, when he picks up, she verbally abuses and threatens him. Tries to get him to be physically abusive so she can all the cops and have him thrown in jail. Just nasty stuff. Her husband told her 2 years ago he was not happy and would like to work with her on things that needed change (Money, laziness, lying, lack of disciplining kids)

Shes talked with me on all of this. She feels bad but continues to do nothing cause shes lazy, until now. Papers have been served. She refuses to take ownership in any of it. Its everyone else's fault.

I have caught her in a few lies to me. We also have a mutual friend (Sara), that will send me screen shots of her texts contradicting herself, lying about lies and acting like a total basket case. However, Linda does not say these things to me directly. She keeps me out of the loop per say. But I'm in the loop because of Sara.

examples of lies that she has told me: Linda has told me she owned the house her and her husband live in and she will just sell it, only she doesn't own the house her grandma does. Her name is on the title yes but gram is the owner. This makes things more messy and difficult. Linda has also said that her daughter wrecked her car by hitting a soggy clay pocket, throwing her into the ditch and wanted to know if my husband would repair it cause the shop was too expensive. Only to find out, her daughter was texting and driving, and wrecked her car.

bxjmk6	2019-06-06 17:44:06		AITA for returning almost every gift my boyfriend's parents get me?	"I normally don't return anything. I used to work in retail and it gives me a lot of stress to put retail workers through any amount of extra work. My boyfriend's (22M) parents barely know me. They live across the country, I've met them three times at weddings and our college graduation.

I did not want to tell them I didn't like the watch they got me for graduation. Close to the date of graduation, he texted me to ask how I felt about silver watches.  I'm very particular about my belongings and I've told him numerous times that I don't wear silver and I hate the feeling of anything on my wrists. We had that conversation a few months before when I bought him a watch for our anniversary. I'm particular about my things because I try to keep a minimalist lifestyle and I don't like owning things I don't love. For that reason my family usually buys me gift cards or tickets to movies when they want to buy me something. 

He told his mom to get me a silver watch two months before. I laughed at him a little and told him that's on the spectrum of worst gifts he could have told his mom to buy. I also mentioned that she didn't have to get me a gift at all. My plan was to accept the gift and put it in the back of my closet, maybe take it out if I was going to an event with her to score points. Unfortunately, my boyfriend sent screenshots of me saying ""lol that's the worst gift you could have told her to get me."" 

I am mortified. I texted her to tell her that maybe I don't like watches because I've never had one and any other bullshit thing I could think of in 5 minutes to make the situation better. She swore it wasn't a big deal. 

I accepted the gift with my best ""thank you so much smile"" and she made a comment about how I was a good actor. To this day makes comments about how ""She clearly doesn't know what I like"" etc which is the opposite of how I wanted our relationship to go. There is a lot of tension in her comments. I'm really good at accepting gifts I don't like, I've been doing it for 23 years. If my BF didn't send screenshots I would be in the clear. 

He then started badgering her about a receipt to return it without asking me. She sent him the receipt and he made me go return it for something I liked. I got a really cool purse and wallet from the same store. 

This cycle has repeated on almost all gifts she's gotten me. I'll tell my boyfriend that I don't like it but not to tell his mom. I tried lying to him and telling him I like whatever she got me but he can always tell when I'm lying and ends up getting me to admit I don't like it. He tells her anyways and makes me return it for something I like.

bxjmiu	2019-06-06 17:43:59	indypendant1380	WIBTA for not offering to watch my girl friend‚Äôs cat?	"She‚Äôll be going on vacation soon and has been mentioning how she‚Äôll have to pay someone to watch her cat. I don‚Äôt like cats (or pets of any kind) because of reasons just like this: they limit you on travel and cost money. I‚Äôm very busy during the week with work and other matters and have little free time to spend driving 40 minutes round trip to her place a couple times during the week to watch a cat. I don‚Äôt mind driving to see her when we hang out, but for this instance, I would mind. She hasn‚Äôt asked, but I feel like she‚Äôs dropping a hint. I don‚Äôt have any pets because I don‚Äôt want to be burdened by them, and this is Exhibit A. WIBTA for not offering to watch her cat? I‚Äôve never spoken poorly about this cat or have any ill will against it, I just don‚Äôt like them and don‚Äôt want to care for one.

I also live in a pet free home with other roommates who believe the same as I do, so keeping the cat with me is not an option. 

Edit: she will be going on vacation for a full week. And it would cost her about $30 to pay someone to stop by and take care of it. 

Edit: I‚Äôm also not totally against it, for the record. Just wanted to get some opinions. Vacation isn‚Äôt for a while, so I‚Äôm thinking about offering. Or maybe offering to do it once and then she pays for the other time?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bxjjgz	2019-06-06 17:37:01	ohboyhelp	AITA for getting on my sister about money?	"This is my first post on here, so I am very sorry about formatting. I am very confused about this entire situation and my parents keep making me out to be the asshole. 

My sister (19) moved back in with my family ~3 months ago when me and my parents moved to a different house. She has a semi-okay full time job and she has minimal bills (phone, car, and that‚Äôs pretty much it). She spends all of her money on food and shopping. My parents let her know when she first moved in that they needed money from her every month for car insurance, which she hasn‚Äôt paid at all in 3 years. She gave $50 the first week we were in the house, and after constant hounding from my dad, finally gave $100 the other day. This $100 was after she told my mom she would give her $250 3 weeks ago, it steadily went down, and down, until after telling my mom she would give her $150 the day previous, the gave her the aforementioned $100. I have been on my sisters ass about saving her money for years and years. She never, ever accepts that what she has done is wrong, this isn‚Äôt only with the money, she does it with everything in life and always has, she refuses to accept that she is wrong. Knowing that, I try my best to call her out whenever possible, strictly to stick up for my mother. My mom doesn‚Äôt like to call my sister out on ANYTHING. This brings us to yesterday. 

My sister came home from work after I did and started to talk to my mom about how she was trying to lower her car, this would cost her ALOT of money that she doesn‚Äôt have. So my mom simply said ‚Äúwell I‚Äôd appreciate if you can make sure you‚Äôll pay me.‚Äù My sister responded with some dumb excuse about how she will definitely be able to pay my mom etc etc. I responded by chiming in ‚ÄúWell, are you really sure you have the money for it? That‚Äôs going to be expensive and you haven‚Äôt really paid mom anything‚Äù she said how she paid her the other day and I asked what about the other 3 months we have lived here, and she said that she‚Äôs been ‚Äúgetting f-ed on her paychecks‚Äù. I then said ‚Äúwell technically if you were paying rent anywhere else you‚Äôd be behind on your payments and you‚Äôd have to catch up.‚Äù She then responding by repeating that she‚Äôs been ‚Äúgetting f-ed‚Äù and I responded with ‚Äúwell mom has been getting f-ed too, royally‚Äù.  This made my sister stomp off to her room and after about 5 minutes she just left the house in general. 

My mom thinks it was a dick move, and while I may have gone a little too far, I feel justified. So AITA?

EDIT: I forgot to include my age, as it‚Äôs been pointed out. I‚Äôm 16 and I turn 17 in 5 days. Im the little sister, my bad."	Asshole	0	0

bxjhju	2019-06-06 17:32:24	katerade_xo	WIBTA if I made sure my cousin's wedding isn't during our vacation?	"My first cousin and I practically grew up as siblings, since my Grandma had us both almost every weekend/school vacation growing up. We've grown apart as adults, which is probably mostly my fault. He's extremely racist/transphobic/generally bigoted. I call him on it because he's going into the healthcare field and it just seriously concerns me for 10 million different reasons. He ended up deleting me on Facebook, which is fair.

&#x200B;

I now live on the exact opposite coast from where I grew up, and I haven't been home in 5 years (since I've had kids). My Mom and Grandma usually come to us 1-2x a year, and almost everyone came out 3 years ago for my wedding. We decided that it's finally time to bring the kids to Mommy's hometown, and I haven't met my niece yet who is now 1, so we spent a ridiculous amount of money on plane tickets to fly our family of 4 literally across the entire United States.

&#x200B;

My cousin now lives 3 states away from our hometown with his fiancee and  new baby. I got wind a couple hours ago that even though they haven't set a date yet, the timing they're looking at is uncomfortably close to when we would be on our trip. Their wedding is going to be a small, backyard wedding, no big thing, no formal deposits with venue or vendors. I really don't want to drive 13 hours with two kids under 5 both ways during the 8 days we actually get to chill and relax (this is our first vacation since kids, literally), but I also don't want to be alone for 3 out of those 8 days while our family is obviously (and rightfully) celebrating their union. This trip is exclusively to relax and have our kids get to know my family. If we were going to spend $2k on a family vacation we would have gone somewhere a lot cooler than my hometown, to be honest.

bxjh56	2019-06-06 17:31:23	blanket28	WIBTA for telling my mom not to stay with us anymore?	"My mom moved to Florida a couple years ago and my boyfriend and I bought her house. Ever since she moved, she comes back 4-5 times a year and stays at our house (sometimes with my stepdad and sometimes just her) and sometimes for up to one week. 

The first year, she asked to stay with us the week between Christmas and New Years and my boyfriend and I were so upset that she would be lingering around our first Christmas in our new house‚Äîso I felt obligated to tell her no. She was understanding and I thought she wouldn‚Äôt ask again. But, she has done it several times since. She is obviously not picking up on subtle hints so I feel like I need to be brutally honest but I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings. 

Also, to give a better understanding of the situation, it is a small house with one guest bedroom and only one bathroom. We have to all share one bathroom and one shower when she stays. It is the kind of house that is very open as well so you can hear everything that goes on in every room and there is basically no privacy. If we had a big house with an in-law suite, that would maybe be different. She also never seems to make very many plans so she just hangs around the house most of the time and wants to do stuff with us.

The worst thing is that it is really testing our relationship and causing fights between my boyfriend and me. We‚Äôve been together 6 years so we both spend time with each other‚Äôs families and such but having her stay with us this much is a whole other level. It is putting a lot of stress on us.

When I talk to people about it they seem to be not as shocked by her behavior as my boyfriend and I are. Am I the asshole for wanting to tell her no from now on?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxjghs	2019-06-06 17:29:46	manicberry	AITA for being upset about my ex's salty behaviour?	"So I (18F) met this guy (18M) on a discord server with a bunch of my old gamer friends from school in it. Him (H) and I hit it off almost instantly, became close friends and kept talking. H even helped me, an introvert, break out of my shell a little.

A few months later and H and I have liked each other for a while, we've decided to date. It's sweet, comfortable and we're happy, until one of my old friends from the server, A, whom I've also been talking to all this while tells me he's into me. Now, A is a guy whom I've crushed on hard pretty much since high school started, but who I always thought was out of my league. It's hard for me to even believe he likes me, I've always thought I wasn't his type. I tell H honestly about how I feel about it. We break up after only about a month of dating. H explains he's really hurt but grateful I was honest. I agree, mad at myself for screwing things up with a great guy, apologise profusely, promise I'll still be there for him. I admit I was wrong to have put him through this ordeal, but I wouldn't have wanted to lie to him. He tells me he understands and wants to try and remain friends.

A few weeks from that and H tells me he's gotten over it all, but on discord and all our common groups, he keeps dismissing what I say, actively making me feel bad/like an idiot almost every time I talk. I make a lot of puns (he said he loved them) and he's been acting annoyed at them and basically just dissing me every time I say or type anything, even if addressed to other people. When I asked if he was still upset about us, he says he doesn't blame me anymore and he's gotten over it, although a little shaken up. He calls it banter - but he never does it with anyone else on discord, almost a pushover with the others. One time, he said I wasn't talking enough on the server and it seemed like I didn't care about him anymore, then proceeded to take jabs at me when I went online, passive aggressively talking about H being 'better than him'.

I know what I did was an asshole move. I'm also trying very hard to be understanding of how he's probably still upset, but he keeps reassuring me and being normal with me privately and then being a first rate asshole publicly most of the time. A tells me it's been too long for him to still behave like this, a couple of our friends tell me I need to give him more space. AITA for being upset about him being mean to me when my friends are around? If so, do I stop talking to him as much and distance myself from our common groups?

(TL, DR: I broke up with my ex-boyfriend over another guy I really like. The ex has been personally telling me he's okay, says he's forgiven me and moved on but behaves like a douche on social media platforms and a discord server we share with a lot of our common friends. AITA for being upset about him being that way publicly and aggressively reassuring me that everything's okay in private?)"	No A-holes here	0	0

Today Annie and I were walking through Walmart, doing our grocery shopping. We were having a great time, talking and playing in the produce section when a woman (probably in her mid 30's if that matters) came up and started smiling at Annie. Not a big deal, people smile at her all the time and she smiles back. This time she waved, the woman said she's adorable and I said thank you and gave her a smile. She lingered for a bit and then walked off and Annie and I continued on. A few minutes later we see her again in a different isle and she just keeps staring at Annie. Then she walked up to us and explained to me that about a year ago, she had lost a daughter who was about Annie's age and the two look very much alike. I gave her my sympathies and we talked about her daughter and she ended up asking if it would be okay to give Annie a hug. I didn't really know how to respond and I felt for the woman, so I told her ""if she's ok with it, sure"". So she smiles at Annie again and goes in to hug her and Annie was uncomfortable right away, and started squirming. She then said ""no"" very clearly and wiggled her finger at the woman. (Like, the ""no-no"" index finger motion) I asked the woman to back off, as Annie was very clearly not liking this, but she didn't right away and kissed her cheek instead. At this point, Annie is screaming ""Mommy! Mommy!"" So I snatched her from the woman's arms and put Annie back in the cart. She then told me that I was being ""unnecessarily cold to a grieving mother"" and pushed me out of her way as she went to walk away. At that point something in me just snapped and I yelled ""we were just trying to get groceries and YOU came up to US. YOU asked to hold MY child and she DIDN'T LIKE IT. A child that you don't even know doesn't want to be held by you and prefers her mother? What a shock! Such a surprise! Bye.""

A bystander told me that I was being a bitch and should have just had my daughter deal with it to make the woman feel better. Maybe I could have handled it better, but I don't think that my daughter should have to put up with anything just to make somebody feel better. Am I the asshole/bitch here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxjg9i	2019-06-06 17:29:15	grannyinwaiting	WIBTA to not tell my dad about a genetic condition?	Hi first time poster so be gentle with me...please? After decades of being let down by my dad I decided to just not get in touch with him. Not that he noticed. 5 years (yes 5) went past and I get an email from him ‚Äújust checking in!‚Äù I replied cos I‚Äôm an idiot. After a few emails back and forth exchanging various niceties he drops the fact he has non Hodgkin lymphoma. I sympathised with him but quickly realised that he had only contacted me because there is literally no one in his life that gives a shit. His wife has had her own cancer battle recently apparently( father is a known liar so may not be true) and my half brother is in his early teens. Because of his behaviour towards me in the past all of his siblings and my grandma before she passed away had basically disowned him. So I‚Äôm the last resort. A few polite emails were exchanged but there was a massive elephant in the room about certain issues surrounding my grandmas funeral that I have a MASSIVE problem with. He point blank refused to get in the funeral car with his siblings because his wife would have to walk all of 300 metres on her own and literally bundled me into the back of the funeral car. At the graveside he refused to throw In a handful of earth and instead got his then 7 year old son to do it for him (the same one who is now a teen) also allowed said son to go in and view his grandmas body because then he could tell his friends about it (he had never met her) basically he did everything to upset his family purely out of spite. So I brought it up and basically asked him why he just didn‚Äôt bother going as he clearly didn‚Äôt want to be there or had any respect for his mother....guess what he never replied.  Anyway fast forward to last month. I got a message from a 2nd cousin through ancestry DNA. He has a genetic blood condition that was passed down through a mutual ancestor. It‚Äôs not fatal anymore but can be painful and degenerative if not treated. I‚Äôve told my aunts and uncles but I really don‚Äôt want to strike up a relationship that brings me nothing but hurt and anger. WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt email him about it? I suppose know I would be but the thought of resuming an extremely toxic relationship is making my anxiety levels spike badly. Thanks for reading	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxjfb5	2019-06-06 17:26:52	QueenLorne	WIBTA for doing group projects by myself because my group members, though trying, are objectively bad writers?	"I'm in a summer course for college that is relying heavily on group projects. There are 3 total, the first of which is due tomorrow night. The professor picked the groups, and the groups are to remain the same for the entire summer semester. For context, this a senior level course.

My group members are perfectly nice and for a change, are actually doing work. I don't think I've been in a group project since leaving high school where my group members actually participated this much. Unfortunately, none of them appear to be able to write at the college level. 

By no means do I consider myself to be an above average student, but I'm almost confused how my group members have made it this far and are allowed to take a senior level course. This is a research assignment, and every paragraph they wrote for it used 1st or 2nd person. Their work has tons of homophone slip ups (accept vs except, faze vs phase etc) and grammar mistakes. One girl offered to edit a portion I had written and she changed its to its'! They all like to capitalize phrases like presidential administration and government policy as if they're common nouns and not a single one has included a source for any of their work even though the concepts used would not be considered common knowledge. They either have a very light grasp on vocabulary or are using thesaurus.com because a lot of the wording they are using just doesn't make sense. To put it simply: they are objectively bad writers. 

To make a long story short, I not only have to write my part of my assignment, but find sources and page numbers for what they write about and fix all the errors they have made. Right now I am having to fix all of the ""fixes"" one group member did on my work. I understand the point of group projects is to work together, but I feel like having to explain when to use citations or that you need to use 3rd person in research assignments is not something you should have to do for your group in a senior level college class. 

Here's my question: even though my group members are trying, is it acceptable of me to ask my professor to work by myself for the rest of the semester because they are not writing coherently or grammatically correct, leaving me having to fix all their work?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bxj9lh	2019-06-06 17:13:25		AITA for wanting my parents to kick out my pregnant sister	"I‚Äôm pretty much convinced my older sister, who I‚Äôll call Sophia, is the reason my life sucks as much as it does. When she was 12 or 13 (I would have been around 10 or 11) she started sending inappropriate pictures to old guys on the internet and starting trouble at school, so my mom decided to start homeschooling us. She put us in a homeschool group with other kids but I never found any long term friends and this turned me into an awkward loser with no friends. I‚Äôm now at the age of 16 and I literally have zero friends and my entire life consists of waking up, doing schoolwork, playing video games by myself, then repeating the next day. 

Meanwhile, all these years Sophia has been messaging old guys online, sending gross pics, and sneaking out in the middle of the night to have sex with strangers (some of which are old enough to be our father and actually have kids our age). She ended up leaving the house last year when she was 17 because our parents wouldn‚Äôt let her just go out and continue doing what she had been doing for years. This is after years of people trying to talk to her and warn her about how much danger she‚Äôs getting herself into.

Well after a few weeks of being out of the house, she meets a dude who‚Äôs 25 and starts dating him. Now she‚Äôs pregnant with this dude‚Äôs child and shows back up at our house because she has no money. Apparently, he‚Äôs also a stalker and somewhat emotionally abusive.

Now onto wondering if I‚Äôm the asshole, I don‚Äôt really care at all. I don‚Äôt want her and her bratty kid living here, and I don‚Äôt care that this dude treats her like crap.

bxj95s	2019-06-06 17:12:27	throwaway297810	AITA for keeping pictures of my ex?	"Throwaway cause my mates know my real account, and if I am in the wrong, I may be really in the wrong..

Basically, my ex (F) and I (M) dated for almost 5 years. It was one of those relationships where both of us thought we were punching - I.e. we both thought the other was the most attractive one in the relationship (please for the love of god don‚Äôt try to tell me punching means we were abusive to each other - we weren‚Äôt, it was a great relationship).

So naturally, as we loved each other‚Äôs bodies a lot, we shared photos of one another. I‚Äôll be the first to admit I had more of her than she had of me, but they were all consensually given and taken at the time, and we agreed we would never share these photos outside of the two of us. A promise we have kept (well I assume she kept her side. But then, I‚Äôm nothing worth sharing anyway lol).

The relationship has since ended (a couple months ago) for non-physical reasons (essentially new jobs and long distances). However, we never really brought up what we would do with the pictures we have. So my question is - am I the asshole for keeping the pics of her?

Disclaimer - I have absolutely zero intent to share them with anyone. Even if the relationship had ended badly, that would be a disgusting thing to do. I still care for her as a person. She was just really hot and I enjoy... reminiscing. I realise that sounds yuck to some people..

bxj7zl	2019-06-06 17:09:47	GermanRealFan	AITA for my choice of pin up art picture I brought to my workplace?	"Sorry if I mix up some terms, my English probably isn't that great and I'm not from the US. 

I work in a mechanical workshop, it's located in the applied engineering faculty of the local university. We have only male employees, and only a handful in total, 8 including me. It might be different in the US but here it's pretty standard to have what could be called pin up art (similarly to the sort of pictures you could find in Playboy), like pictures of women but no nudes, more like in bikinis, that sort of thing. The walls aren't like plastered with it but there's a few, for motivational purposes, we joke.

However the girls in the pictures the other guys brought aren't really my type at all. They're like the curvy, stacked woman type, think Kate Upton, and I'm more into small, cute, not curvy women. Which is why recently I brought my own, a picture of a Japanese gravure model (18+) in a school swimsuit, who's exactly my type: small, cute, and delicate. 

So I put that on there with the others, however some time later I got feedback from the others. First stuff like asking me if this was new, so I said that I put it up there, and another guy was asking whether that was okay and if she wasn't too young and I told him her name and that she was 20+ in that picture. But she looks really young though they claimed and told me I should better take it off, some might get the wrong impression, and one of the guys joked that he hadn't taken me for someone who was into middle schoolers. 

I removed it then but I think it's fucked up. They basically shamed me for my sexuality just because I find different physical attributes in women attractive. It honestly upset me a bit. So I'm just looking for some feedback on this."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

Also, on mobile so sorry for formatting. 

I (28M) am white. One friend in this, A (27F) is black and the other J (28F) is white. 

We all went out for dinner last night to hangout. A is excited to tell us that she has an opportunity to speak at an event to white foster/adoptive parents who have taken in black children. There's apparently going to be six different black women speaking about different topics. A (whose education and day job is heavily geared towards positively impacting black culture in the non-profit sector) is speaking about the importance of racial mirrors, basically saying how important it is to have black people in your social circle that they can identify with and look up to. 

J was really excited for A but I think it's weird? Are their workshops for black people with white children? A is really outspoken about being pro-black and while it can be a little much at times, I usually don't say anything. 

I just shared my opinion that it seemed a little ridiculous and that shouldn't we just be thankful that these kids have found a home instead of telling their new parents they aren't good enough to raise them. 

A argued that it isn't about telling them they arent good enough but helping them have the tools they need to be the best parents possible for their kids which is why theres also going to be a session on basic haircare and skin routines because it's meant to help out with the overall care for the child's wellbeing. 

I doubled down and said that it seemed over the top and that the whole thing seemed like a scam to get money out of people.

At this point, A and J decided to pay for her food/drinks and leave. 

Having spoken with J this morning, she told me everything I said was insensitive but especially the part about it being a money scam because the fee the parents pay go purely towards securing the venue that its held in, paying for lunch for everyone in attendance, and the hair kit that will be given to every set of parents. A and the other speakers are not being paid for their time and that A is willing to do this without compensation because she believes in helping parents be able to create environments in their home that celebrate and not erase the culture they come from. 

I may have been wrong about the money aspect but AITA for everything else that I said? Do I owe her an apology?"	Asshole	0	0

bxj4wo	2019-06-06 17:02:43		WIBTA for reporting roommate?	"So I (19F) have been dating BF (24M) for about a year and he has three male roommates (4 bed/4 bath apt). Around January I ended up moving in with them seeing as I get along with all the guys. BF and I decided to get a dog. Obviously, we asked if they guys were okay with it before we just got one, and they seemed excited about it. So in February we went to the shelter and picked out our [adorable year old puppy.](http://imgur.com/a/HHH7scx) Our dog was already house trained so wasn‚Äôt having accidents.

After a couple weeks one of the guys who we‚Äôll call John, suddenly kept talking about getting a dog. So one day while I‚Äôm the only one home John comes into the apartment holding a towel. I ask him what he‚Äôs doing and he just goes ‚Äúlook I got such a great deal‚Äù and unwrap two 8 week old puppies. TWO.  This 21 year old boy can‚Äôt wash his own dishes or clean up after himself (leaves them out for a week+). Also, he never registered them with the apartment complex and they don‚Äôt know he has them.

It‚Äôs now been a few months and things are unbearable. He still doesn‚Äôt have them house trained, so they go to the bathroom all over the apartment. His bedroom is the last in the hall and the smell coming from his room is so bad you can‚Äôt walk down the hall. He doesn‚Äôt even clean it up right when it happens. He will leave pee puddles out in the living room for hours. We have to watch super carefully when we‚Äôre home because they‚Äôll pee in our room and he won‚Äôt offer to clean it up, and we don‚Äôt want to punish our dog by trapping him in our bedroom. I‚Äôll come home to the puppies being locked out of his bedroom in the living room when he isn‚Äôt home, so they curl up outside his door in the hallway just laying in pee so obviously I feel horrible and don‚Äôt know what to do so I grab them and give them a bath and treats and play with them for a bit. 

We pretty much have to say ‚Äúoh hey John I think the puppies peed over there‚Äù if there‚Äôs any chance of it getting cleaned up. When he‚Äôs not home I end up just cleaning up whatever mess they make which just annoys my BF because if I do it for him then John definitely never will. I feel like he only got the dogs to one up my BF and I because of the attention people were giving us and our new dog, but then I do see him play with them and it looks like he cares (albeit not enough). 

I‚Äôve had mono for three months now and still am pretty sick and having other health issues while my immune system is pretty weak. I‚Äôve been getting testing done, but the doctors aren‚Äôt sure what the problem is. One of the other roommates was hospitalized for three days for some infection/reaction that they said he most likely caught from something in his environment. My friends and some other people said we should just suck it up until August when the lease is up, because John‚Äôs from out of state so it‚Äôs not like he can just go to his parents house if his housing is affected and we‚Äôre making this a big deal.

bxj4wh	2019-06-06 17:02:42	ToughConsequence	AITA for not wanting to go to my dad's retirement party?	"Hello everyone. I'm currently in a very difficult situation. I'm the youngest of three brothers. I have a... Correct relationship with my brothers. I'm 8 years apart from the oldest one and I feel like I have trouble bonding with them. The thing is, I love my brothers but I have personal problems and I have difficulties maintaining relationships, even with my family. They have reproached this to me in the past and I agree with them but it is hard, since I feel left out.

Recently, our dad has retired after a long time of working. He has expressed the desire to NOT have a retirement party. Even then, my brothers have decided to organize one. They started prepping for it two months ago, and it's suppose to take place at the end of the month. The problem is... They didn't talk to me about it. I only know about it because my mother has told me. I thought they just didn't find the time but I've had phone calls with them where they could have told me but didn't. The other thing is, they mostly call me to get help with computers since I'm studying in computer science and they don't really ask about me.

So this is where I am right now: I love my dad and I know it'd hurt him to not see me there. I've talked to my mom and she said she understand where I'm coming from with this and she can't force me to go. I'm tired of being only the IT guy and I feel like if my brothers want me to connect more with them, I should also be involved in important family event, especially a surprise party (we all live in different cities and we're all at least 2-3 hours away from each other with full-time jobs, so I feel like I should have been consulted for when this is going to happen.) I have plans with friends to week-end of the event and I feel like I'd have a better time going there instead of going to an event I wasn't invited to...

Would I be the asshole to not go even though it is such a big event?

Edit -- You guys are right, I should not punish my father for this. I'll get him some small gift and I'll go. I'll talk with my brothers after the party."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bxj3fm	2019-06-06 16:59:19	Onelilreggroll	AITA for needing to break a lease with a friend to save my dad from homelessness?	"Back in December my husband and I signed a fifteen month lease with a friend.  We figured she needed a better living situation and we could save around $3-400 dollars a month in doing so. There were no foreseeable circumstances that could have messed up the living situation as far as we knew of. About a month later my dad got himself into a legal battle over my Grandma and her estate. I wasn‚Äôt involved in the case, I told my dad I thought he was making a mistake over it, and otherwise just went about life.

Fast forward to two days ago and my dad calls to tell me that he was taken to court, lost, and therefore lost his income(it came from my Grandma). He said that he is facing homelessness and asked if my husband and I would move back in for enough time until he could get his SSI and disability which would take around six months. I told him that I wanted to look into other alternatives and talk with my roommate before making any decisions.

Yesterday my husband and I brought this to our roommate‚Äôs attention.  We said we didn‚Äôt know what we were gonna do yet but we wanted her opinion. We also said if we come to the decision to move back in with my dad that any financial penalty of breaking the lease we would handle and we would give her at least thirty days notice if/when we decide to move.

Her opinion was that my dad did this to himself and it shouldn‚Äôt affect the living situation here. She feels that if the consequences of his actions include homelessness then that is his problem and it shouldn‚Äôt cause her to have to be kicked out. She feels that the fair thing to do is for my husband and I to stay here and just let the dominoes fall so to speak.

After this discussion she went to her room, slammed the door, and yelled to either her boyfriend or her parents over the phone about it. My husband gets a phone call from her boyfriend saying that if we choose to move in with my dad and break the lease then I will have betrayed her trust and we would no longer be friends.

My opinion is that while it isn‚Äôt my responsibility to help pay for my dad‚Äôs rent, it is equally not my responsibility to stay here if I feel my family needs me. In all fairness it‚Äôs not my responsibility to be stuck in a lease, feeling like a terrible human being, just so my roommate can continue to be out of her parents‚Äô otherwise safe/stable environment since she can‚Äôt afford a place of her own and is currently unemployed.

Thanks.

Edit:
The policy here is we can break the lease at any time as long as two months additional rent is paid, which my husband and I are prepared to pay.

I never would have signed a lease if my roommate were unemployed. At the time she was but then suddenly quit without telling us in advance a few weeks ago."	Asshole	0	0

Well, I was watching youtube videos and sending her commands every few minutes. After about 45 minutes, I decided I was done. It was midnight and I had to go to bed. I told her that's enough fun for now, but then she broke character- she said we don't do this enough (wonder why) and that she wanted a chance to hump her vibrator. I said I have work tomorrow and a final project due soon. She said she was still horny though. Well, to remedy the situation, I sent her some of the most ridiculous Spongebob memes I could find.

bxj1xr	2019-06-06 16:55:56	pumpkinsnice	AITA for resenting my friends for not telling me our friend was in a coma?	"I think about this all the time- it happened about two years ago now but I have never been able to forgive these people. And I‚Äôm wondering if maybe I‚Äôm overreacting.

I had this friend, who was a remarkable woman and such a fun person to be around. Lets name her Summer. She lived a few hours away from me though, so we only really saw each other every other month or so, and most of our friendship was limited to social media and text messaging. She was also one of my girlfriend‚Äôs ONLY friends. My girlfriend is a very shy person and doesn‚Äôt make friends quite as easily as I do.

After a trip to see Summer, I think the trip was just more stressful than usual and we all kinda got annoyed at each other. Nothing friendship-ending, just we all kinda gave each other space afterwards. So I didn‚Äôt really think about it when my friend hadn‚Äôt texted me in awhile. I also have so many friends on social media, it didn‚Äôt stand out to me that she hadn‚Äôt been posting. To be frank, I hadn‚Äôt even really noticed due to my own life being busy.

Then i got a private message from another friend of mine, asking ‚ÄúHey do you know what happened to Summer?‚Äù I said no, and I immediately got worried. Just an overall bad feeling. I checked Summer‚Äôs facebook, and there was one post by her brother. Apparently, five months prior (about a month after we‚Äôd hung out), she had been a victim of a drive by shooting. She was shot through the head and was in a coma with permanent brain damage. I freaked out. I messaged our mutual friends, all of which said ‚ÄúOh I assumed you knew.‚Äù No messages to me. No one reaching out. I didn‚Äôt even see any of them talking about it. This was someone we love and care about and no one even mentioned this to me.

To be fair, I hadn‚Äôt seen any of the mutual friends in person since this happened- I‚Äôd been mostly focusing on working full time and my free time was with people who didn‚Äôt know Summer. But everyone knew she and I were close friends, and it boggles my mind that it occurred to NO ONE to tell me.

Summer, since then, has awoken from her coma. But the brain damage is permanent. She can‚Äôt type anymore, can hardly speak, and overall is just a wildly different person. I‚Äôve only seen her once since she woke up, and i feel so bad for what shes been through. Which only makes me angrier at the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù who didn‚Äôt tell me what happened to her.

I have never forgiven them. I haven‚Äôt hung out with any of them, i only talk to them when I have to, etc. Am I being too harsh?"	Asshole	0	0

bxiw2d	2019-06-06 16:42:10	vernq	AITA for returning everything I got for my birthday?	I just recently had my 21st birthday, and a while before my mother had asked me if there was anything I had wanted. I normally don‚Äôt want anything in specific for my birthday since I normally just buy stuff I want, but this year I actually had a few things I wanted. Notably a pair of jeans, a few pairs of shorts, and AirPods. I not so subtly hinted to my mother about them by sending her links to the exact things that I wanted. Birthday comes and nothing I had asked for was there. There was instead a different pair of jeans, a rather extensive set of bar tools, and some short sleeve button down shirts. The jeans she gave me were the right size but they had a much wider leg than the slim fit jeans I had asked for, and I honestly cannot see myself ever wearing them. Furthermore they were also significantly more expensive than the pair I had asked for ($69‚Äì>~$130). The bar tools are a nice thought but I‚Äôm not exactly a big drinker, and the drinks I do consume aren‚Äôt really mixed cocktails. On top of that I live in a shoebox of an apartment and I physically do not have the space to put this stuff without throwing things away or buying some sort of shelving unit. And lastly the shirts are too big on top of me already having several similar shirts. Overall she would‚Äôve spent ~$100 less on the things I had actually asked for. My sister called me to tell me I‚Äôm an asshole for wanting to send this stuff back and that I should just keep it and not use it. I‚Äôd personally rather not waste my parents money on stuff I know for a fact I will not use. I kind of feel like an asshole, but am I one?	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxivxz	2019-06-06 16:41:51		WIBTA if I make my partner open a new bank account	"So I feel like I've been going insane because I don't want to tell anyone else this and I'm at my wits end.

We've been together for ages and he's always had a very passive attitude to things which is neither a positive or negative thing.

We're basically married but we won't go into it until we've made use of a home buyers initiative in our country. We put our money and things together. He earns more money than me and we have several bank accounts. One for everyday use, one for rent and big purchases, both his. And mine are our backup accounts and I basically forward money I get there to our everyday one.

This post is only about our big purchases account which his mum helped him open up so she has access to it. She's not dodgy by any means so there's no risk at all but I find it too weird to have your mum check on her 30 year old son's bank account.

I have issues with people messing with my ""bubble"" like people messing with our house, people cleaning our house when they visit or putting new furniture in without asking. Generally despise my safe space being touched except my partner.

Every so often when the funds run low on that account (because it's not an account we use, only scheduled payments for rent) his mum would call in to ask if we're okay. I know she means well but everytime that happens I get that feeling that I've just been gutted on the street and people can see my insides. I feel violated and so angry.

I've brought this up with my partner but he doesn't think much of it. He keeps saying he'll tell her ""don't worry about this account"" on it but of course she still does because she has no idea whatsoever about this issue.

It's 2.30 am here and I am irritated to the core thinking about other people having access to how much money we have. I plan on telling him tomorrow to close the account and make a new one if he refuses to talk to his mum. I can't stand it anymore.

bxiuzf	2019-06-06 16:39:36	Purplefish994	AITA for telling my children their grandmother is dead?	"**UPDATE:** 

Took some time to think about it and read over what people have posted and came to the following conclusions/actions:

1. My husband was being an asshole by flip-flopping on our agreed lie. We talked about it and he agrees that it wasn't fair for him to do. He also admits that my mother's outbursts were a sign shes still the woman she was. I guess in my initial rundown of events he missed the part when she touched our son, so now he's pissed. But he still pressed me to come clean to the kidos

2.  Lying to my children is not okay, even if its to protect them. When I think about the possibility of this coming up again when they're older I believe it would be very damaging to our relationship. 

3. six-year-olds are smarter than they let on. When I sat them down and told him that the woman actually was his grandmother he said that he ""knew I was fibbing"". My daughter couldn't care less, which was to be expected. 

4. I also did some internet stalking and discovered that my mother now lives in the same state as us so I suppose another encounter could be in my future... yuck. 

&#x200B;

Ok so my husband's birthday was last week, for the occasion I decided to make a number of traditional West Indian dishes. We live out in a somewhat rural area and the supermarkets nearby don't have most of the necessary ingredients. So I pack up the kids (boy 6, girl 3) and head toward the city where I know of a store that has what I need.

&#x200B;

I've got everything and I'm standing in the very long check out line when an older and somewhat disheveled woman attempts to squeeze between us and the people in front. Shes got salt and pepper hair and a worn tired face. At first glance, i didn't recognize her. But she shouted ""oh my god""; it was her voice that made me realize. It was my mother that I've had no contact with for nearly 20 years. I froze. I couldn't even think. I just stood there.

&#x200B;

She was going on, something about how she can't believe it's me. Then she noticed my children. My son was riding in the basket of the carriage ( yes I know he shouldn't be in there) and she reaches over and puts her hand on his head and asks ""are these my grandbabies?"". I flipped the fuck out. Her touching him sent me info a literally panic. I shouted at her not to touch him, then lifted him out of the carriage, scooped up my daughter and we headed for the door. As I was leaving she yells ""You bitch, you won't even let me meet my grandchildren!"" Now she's following me as I try to weave my way out the crowded store. My son is asking me ""whos that lady"" and just as we make it through the door she shouts again, ""no matter how you run I'll always be your mother! I have a right to see my grandbabies! Your nanna loves you!"".

&#x200B;

When I get in the car I'm at the point of tears, I never thought I'd see that woman again, its been so long and I've literally moved to another neighboring state. I couldn't believe the odds. My son asked me again who the lady was; ""is that grandma?"" I lie, "" no that was some confused woman"" He's not buying it at all, more questions until I distract him with his tablet.

&#x200B;

When I come home without any of the stuff my husband is confused and asks me what happened. I get the children situated and tell him all of it. His response is not good... he accuses me of potentially damaging our son and confusing him because of the lie that we **BOTH** agreed to tell him. That my drug addicted, physically, emotionally, and financially abusive mother was dead. He claims that maybe shes changed, its been all this time, but I don't think it's worth the risk to involve her in our lives now.

bxit8e	2019-06-06 16:35:37	pekkauser	AITA for deleting my brothers Instagram because I felt he was getting obsessed and being selfish?	"So I made a post on this sub a bit back where I got mad at my brother for treating me like his own personal photographer and making me do weird things. Also he was getting mad at me for not taking the best photos. So I told him he was a selfish prick and to stop treating me like his own personal photographer.

So basically my brother for a few days kept trying to convince me to go to this location with him. I knew he was doing it just so he could get pictures of himself because he went a bit back and his friends took photos of him. He complained they sucked though I looked at them and said they looked fine. He said it was cuz he wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúcenter focus‚Äù of the photo. Therefore I knew he wanted me to come so I could take photos of him. For days and days I told him no and that I‚Äôm trying to focus on my studies and pass all my finals. I‚Äôm on the verge of getting a C in one of my classes and I want to be able to do well enough I can get a new phone. He was persistent even when my parents kept telling him no and that I have to study. Hell I like a distraction from studies here and there but like if it‚Äôs not for my enjoyment I ain‚Äôt doing it.

So basically I‚Äôm still busy cuz finals are next week. He still was persistent but this time my mom gave in and said he will go with him to that location. 

Fast forward to later last night my mom is giving my brother a lecture on how he was selfish and how bad it was he was persistent to make me go with him in a time I had a lot of work. 

My mom talked with me later and said he basically made her do some dangerous stuff in order to make her take photos of him. Like she could have almost tripped and gotten badly injured. I talked to her about how he would make me squat in the middle of a walk path to take photos of him. He even made me look stupid trying to get in a position so I can take a photo of him. He gets angry when they don‚Äôt come out his way and makes us do it again and again till he gets what he wants 

It‚Äôs bad cuz I feel like Instagram is corrupting him. He‚Äôs so obsessed over his followers and likes. He has around 750 followers and gets around 250 likes. He also gets mad when a certain person doesn‚Äôt like his photo and talks about Instagram crap with me when I clearly don‚Äôt care. He‚Äôs always like oh this and this drama or beef is happening. It‚Äôs like the increased amounts of likes he gets inflates his ego. Me and my parents have seen changes in him how he‚Äôs more arrogant and thinks he‚Äôs better than me. Like I swear so what if I have 140 followers and average 50 likes per post I‚Äôm happy with what I have, it‚Äôs not everything and it never should be. 

I proposed the idea of deleting insta for a bit from his phone and my parents weren‚Äôt sure since they felt he wouldn‚Äôt be happy. So what I did was I took his phone while he was sleeping, deleted insta and had my parents delete the App Store so he couldn‚Äôt redownload it. I put it back.

There‚Äôs is this woman I‚Äôve known since we were teenagers, maybe a little younger. She's in her late 20s and I'm in my early 30s. We're not close at all. More like acquaintances or friends of friends, we‚Äôve had maybe 2 or 3 solo conversations ever. Our families (as part of a larger group of families) sometimes get together for holidays and stuff like that. 

So a few months ago, at a family event, we talk for more than 15 minutes and are kind of clicking. Later, she messages me on Facebook and we talk more, exchange numbers. We decide to grab dinner together and it‚Äôs pretty fun! We hang out a second time and it's not bad at all but I am just not crazy about her and after the second ""hang out"" I kind of just let things fizzle out. I stopped texting her and didn‚Äôt initiate anymore hang-outs/dates. I never had a conversation like ""This isn't working"" or ""I don't really feel any chemistry"". I just let things end.  

Additional info: There was no physical intimacy (no kissing, no holding hands even) and we never got into the territory of we're dating or ""this means something"".

**Am I the asshole?** 

The reason I bring this up is I felt sure in just letting things end. I do not like the idea of ""ghosting"" but I 100% did not think this warranted a deeper conversation. I only thought about this situation after talking about dating with a friend yesterday. I mean it was two playful, flirty half-dates, was I supposed to have a discussion about this? 

(I actually ran into her a few weeks ago at a funeral of mutual family friend's relative, which obviously sucked, and we said hi, hugged and went on our separate ways.)

I‚Äôve been thinking about posting this for a long time but I‚Äôve honestly been terrified. So I‚Äôm 25 years old, I live at home with my parents and my younger sister. My childhood was... messy to say the least. I got beat up for really trivial things. I was a problem child. I did give a lot of shit to my parents, but I believe it was due to undiagnosed mental illness that went untreated. I‚Äôve suffered from severe anxiety for as long as I can remember and I believe my mood disorder started in my early childhood. I‚Äôve since had to go through years of therapy just to be able to cope with everyday life. One of the things I was abused for was not doing the dishes. Now when I say abused, I mean my mom would hold me down and choke me or squeeze my arms and scream in my face. She would rip doors off frames, smash windows etc. I‚Äôve never gotten a true apology, everyone basically acts like I deserved what was coming to me. Now to today, my little sister is the same age as I was when I was being abused. My dad has seen all the things I‚Äôve been through due to my traumatic childhood and basically doesn‚Äôt discipline my sister at all bc ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want her to feel the same way about her childhood as you do‚Äù. She can basically spit in my parents face and they will apologize. She dropped out of high school because they couldn‚Äôt get her to go and basically just lays in bed all day. They‚Äôre upset with me because I don‚Äôt do the dishes, but honestly I‚Äôm traumatized by them. They can‚Äôt get her to get up to do anything, and I feel like they know they can make me feel bad for not doing them. Such a stupid thing to say but when they ask me to do them I get filled with anxiety, and resentment towards my sister. AITA for never doing the dishes?

Edit: thank you all for the advice. I decided to put more effort into doing other chores and show my parents I‚Äôm trying! Holding on to the resentment is doing more damage than good, it‚Äôs time to let it go and get on with my life! Again, thank you all!"	Asshole	0	0

Today is my dad's birthday, he asked for help and I told him NO. 

Back story: My dad is addicted to weed and alcohol. He can't function if he isn't high or drunk. Growing up, he couldn't hold a steady job, we lived off the generosity of his friends, and there was no stability. He was verbally abusive, sometimes physical but we dealt with it. My mom wasn't really around. My parents had a difficult relationship that lead to her leaving us with him for long periods of time. He tried to raise us in his own way. 

When my mom finally got her shit together and got married, she asked my sisiters and I to move in with her. My two younger sister's moved in and I almost followed. I was in highschool at this point. However, my dad said he couldn't emotionally handle living alone and said he would hurt if self if we all leave. My sister's we're still young and I volunteer to stay and live two more years with him. It sucked but we made do. 

Fast forward, I graduated high school and left for college. Our relationship got easier, I didn't see him often. I got married and now live in a different state. Things seemed okay between us. 

Two years ago I got a call from my uncle. He told me my dad started to do meth. While, I hate my father for not taking care of us properly and for his addiction to weed and alcohol, I still loved his sorry ass and I offered him help. He was sorry for everything, stopped doing meth, asked for help. I started to schedule his appointments for support groups, I made him a resume, and I bought him clothes. He seemed better. He adopted a dog, found a cheap apartment through a friend. I was happy with his progress. However, he kept asking me for more.
 I told him this was only temporary, that I can't afford to always help. He accepted that and finally time went on. 

My youngest sister saw him recently at a family funeral. He was drunk before it started and asked her money for weed. When she told me this I stopped helping him out. 

Today, is his birthday. He posted on Facebook how is he getting kicked out of his apartment. He no longer has a job and ge has no where to go.  A family member commented that he should move in with one on his daughters. So, he asked me and I told him no. He then posted on FB how his daughters refused to help him. Family is now messaging me, asking how I can let my dad become homeless. Telling me it's my duty to help him. He raised us after all. I owe him. I haven't replied back. My husband said I did the right thing. Yet, I feel like shit. My dad is probably going to be homeless and I told him no. I'm feeling like the asshole. Especially when I have family telling me that I am doing the wrong thing.  

So AITA?



TLDR: my father is about to be homeless and I refuse to give him help or offer him a room in my house.

bxinpj	2019-06-06 16:22:19	elijah112358	AITA For being angry my friends are too busy for me?	"I go to university in a mid-sized city, and this year I made two good friends. I would frequently get food individually with them and bring them food and hang out together and do homework and everything. We had really good talks and I even had them over to my apartment a couple of times. Both of them live less than 15 minutes from the university.

I stayed on campus this summer (well an apartment super close to campus) for summer classes, and I hoped to hang with at least one of them. After finals they both went home and got super busy. I asked to hang out pretty regularly, like every other day or so, but they were busy with all their friends coming home and such, and I thought I understood pretty well. I made it clear I really wanted to hang out but I understood hanging with your home friends.

It's been 6 weeks since finals, and I have asked probably 15 times to hang out. Both of them haven't seen me even once. One of them has even stopped replying at all. I'm getting really frustrated and have no idea what to do, because I made it clear that any time they were free would work for me, and I think it's highly improbable they'd be constantly busy for 6 weeks.

The dumb thing is we're all in the same club so we're going to see each other in the fall regardless, so if they're planning to just ghost me permanently then that's not going to work.

AITA for being angry with them for not hanging out with me? Or at least ghosting me/not owning up to not wanting to for some reason?

bxikw6	2019-06-06 16:15:40		AITA For Telling my sister she needs to drop out of college	"My sister has ADD. She flunked out of public school and attended online homeschool for her senior year. After barely passing, she attended a tiny, expensive Christian university that accepts literally everyone. When the school didn't give her enough money she begged my parents to pay it. Also, the school is in a neighborhood she can't get a job without having to walk a few miles so my parents send her $100 a month to live off of. I tried to give my sister other options and have her be open to cheaper secular schools but she said that  ""God brought her here"" and she wouldn't entertain any other ideas or community college. 

She was kicked out for poor grades but begged the dean to stay. After my parents refused to pay tuition again, she was then kicked out the following semester for failure to pay.

Now my sister got accepted to a new Christian more expensive university after begging me to write her admissions essays. But she applied for financial aid super late and probably won't be able to attend. She is technically supposed to be a junior by now but has to start everything over as a freshman.

Every time, I bring up that she needs to consider cheaper secular schools, it causes a huge fight. She says that since I graduated from a top university, I'm just being stuck up (even I had to give up my first choice to go to this cheaper school that I had a lot of scholarships and low-income grants to attend). She means well and she't not entitled. She is just doing what she believes god wants. And I was always ""the smart one"" out of the siblings so I understand if she has some frustrations. But I don't think it is fair to myself or my little brother, who is now applying to school, to make cheaper choices in universities. I don't think it's fair that my brother is having to sleep on the couch while she gets to go to school. And I really think it's important that at least someone in this family lets her know that college isn't everything and she should look into something in the trades. But I'm not religious and I'm unsure if my constant pushing her is being offensive or ignorant. AITA?"		1	0
bxikt8	2019-06-06 16:15:29		AITA for cutting off from a passive-aggressive friend?	"Hey guys. I‚Äôm a sophomore. Recently, I had a fallout with a friend of mine (A). 

We casually discussed with our friendship group to meet up at A‚Äôs house and watch movies but nobody made any tangible plans so I assumed nothing was happening and made plans with another friend earlier in the day.

A calls me an hour before they want me to be at their place, asking if I‚Äôm going to be on time to their place. Apparently they planned everything that morning but I hadn‚Äôt read it in the group chat yet. I remind them that I‚Äôm still at my appointment but will try and get their on time. 

My mistake here was that I forgot about how unreliable the buses are in my city and how A lives more than an hour from where I was by bus. I arrive an hour late and A complains about me always being late. Throughout the night A is moody, we end up playing card games for 6hours and they complain I‚Äôm too loud for laughing but won‚Äôt say the same when my other friends laugh. Later, they dare me to be quiet for 10 minutes in a game of truth and dare.


Later, I argue that while I should have explained that I wouldn‚Äôt make it on time, I DID try and plan with them in advance so I had a precise idea of what we were doing and what time I needed to be there. A brings up how I‚Äôm always late for classes and how I prioritise work over school, both of which seem irrelevant to this discussion and make me suspect A is fixating on this on purpose to make a point.

Two nights later, I decide to apologise for the sake of our friendship. I feel guilty and struggle going back to bed so I call A around six a.m. They hang up. Around 1 they send a long text saying if I ever call that early again they‚Äôll cut my dick off, and that they don‚Äôt want to talk about the other night because it‚Äôs in the past now and I‚Äôm being dramatic.

I decide not to tell the rest of the group what‚Äôs been going on because I don‚Äôt want them to feel they have to chose a side. But A becomes more passive aggressive, making snarky comments in the group chat towards me or ignoring me completely. A even removes themselves from the chat with no explanation but the mod puts them back in.

Now, I ignore A too. Then out of the blue they text me asking if I want to hang out. I‚Äôve made an excuse and my plan is to cut off from A outside of the group until they get the message: it‚Äôs been 2 months now and I feel there‚Äôs no point having a discussion about it. A even wants us to move in together, like nothing happened.

What do you think?

TL; DR: friend gets upset because I was late, I apologise, friend says they‚Äôre over it but starts being passive aggressive, friend decides they‚Äôre over it and asks if I want to move in with them, I don‚Äôt want to be friends with them anymore."	Not the A-hole	1	0

bxijk1	2019-06-06 16:12:35		AITA For resenting my siblings for their lack of willingness to make space for me?	"So Ive recently enrolled in college starting in September, to facilitate this I'm moving back in to my family home where I had a bedroom for years. I've been pretty unhappy living where I was and need to leave my dead end job and turn things around. I moved out of my family home and rented an apartment for a year while I was working but can no longer afford to live there, my mother always let me know I was welcome to move home if I needed to. 

So the time came to start moving home, it's a decent sized 5 bedroom house where my mother and 3 siblings live, 18, 20, 21, I'm the eldest at 23. My 20 year ago sister moved in to my old double room, my 18 year old brother in to her old double and they converted his small downstairs room in to another sitting room, although it would just take moving the couch out and moving a bed in.

Since my siblings have heard the news they have been anything but welcoming, they'd prefer I didn't move home at all and if I do I should be in the single room downstairs. I have a long term girlfriend that would be staying over and I'm also the only one that's going to be paying rent. The bedroom in question was mine for years, the single room my younger brothers. I only planned to move out for a short time and thus think i should be due my old room back but my siblings are very entitled and don't think they should have to move things back to accommodate me. I'm pissed off at my siblings for being so selfish and unwilling to give me my room back. 

The way I see it the year of extra space was essentially a privilege and they should move over to make room for me, I miss my room I had for years, I pretty much need the double bed as my girlfriend stays over often and I'm the only one apart from my mother paying rent. This experience has just made me resent my siblings as they don't care about my attempts to improve my situation and think that I should either be out on my ass or given the small single room so they can keep their comfy setup they had without me. My sister won't even move in to her old bedroom which is literally nicer than the one I want back. I get on well with them despite how self centered they can be but just seeing their unwillingness to give up the extra space they had without me is upsetting and now I just think they're shitty people. I will out last them though and get my room back, I'm currently unemployed and determined lol

They want her back, I‚Äôm not going to let that happen.	"Sorry if the title is off and for any mistakes here goes,

I visited the shelter because I was feeling low and cats are awesome so I thought I‚Äôd volunteer and maybe get some cat therapy.

So I went down with my BFF and BF and we played with kittens and old cats (PS: favourite gala name was granny and she was so moody, I loved it). I saw my now cat Zuzu, I didn‚Äôt go up to her at first because I knew I‚Äôd fall in love with her. So my foresight didn‚Äôt save me and I learnt she had been abandoned since late Jan 2019. It was then May, so she had been there for +/-5 months. I spoke with the manager and he said he‚Äôd phone the owner and see if they‚Äôd get back to him and he told me to wait a week. So I did, I confirmed payment on her shots and snips and waited another 3 days for the owner to contact back. They never did. 

So it‚Äôs now a about month in an I post a pic of her on social media, the owner is a distant acquaintance, a friend of a friend kind of thing. It‚Äôs a small town. She sends me a direct message and claimed ownership. I explained the situation as well as the attempts at contact and she called bullshit. She never addressed the abandonment, and bowed when I firmly stated that the cat was now in my care and I would provide her with a lovely home. She hasn‚Äôt responded yet and I did apologize to her in the messages. It‚Äôs weird I know where she lives and works, it‚Äôs one of the nice bars in town. She‚Äôs a sweet person but,

I just feel bad. I understand cat love. I understand bonds, but how can you leave a kitten in a shelter for +/-5 months? How long is that even in cat time? 

I‚Äôm conflicted but feel like I‚Äôm doing the right thing. I thought very long about bringing a cat into my home and even got the support of my housemates and close friends. I gathered supplies and made what I couldn‚Äôt afford. I love that fluffy stinkball, but how do I manage this relationship in a small town? Do I ignore it? I just don‚Äôt know how not to be the asshole here...

Edit: 
Abandoned as in at a shelter, not on the side of the road. Left there after being put into boarding,

bxiex7	2019-06-06 16:01:35		AITA for being upset with my pregnant wife for allowing her best friend to touch her belly time and again.	"Wife and I are pregnant with twins. Now my wife's best friend's ( let's call him Mark ) wife had a miscarriage recently. 

We were hosting a dinner recently to which Mark and his wife were invited. After the dinner I was hanging out with my friends. And when I went to take a leak, I saw him touching her belly. I stepped in and asked him what he was doing. My wife told me that he was just touching her belly because he wanted to feel the kids. I told him that he was crossing a boundary and he left calmly to join the others. I didn't want to sour everyone's mood, I avoided any confrontation.

Later, when I asked my wife about it, she started crying and told me that she just felt bad for him because he lost his child recently. And told me that this happened before and it's nothing and I should be more sensitive. I told her that this is something I don't like because he is effectively touching her time and again.

bxieeg	2019-06-06 16:00:25		AITA for wanting to move out of my mother‚Äôs house?	"Context: I‚Äôm a 22 year old graduate student. My mentor in undergrad always told me ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no romanticism in being a starving masters student‚Äù. He‚Äôs probably right. Which is why I‚Äôm lucky to have a mom who will let me live with her, rent free, for the duration of the time it will take for me to get my degree. Right?

That‚Äôs how I should feel, at least. Except I don‚Äôt. Because living with your mom when you‚Äôre in your twenties is a nightmare.

Dating is essentially off the table completely. I tried to go on one date, and when I came home my mom examined me for hickeys (‚Äúthat little mark on your neck looks like one. That‚Äôs so childish of you.‚Äù) and asked me how far I‚Äôd gone with the guy / demanded to know if I was the kind of girl who slept with someone on the first date. I told her this was inappropriate and an invasion of my privacy. 

She said ‚Äúif your lifestyle is right in front of my face, it can‚Äôt be out of sight out of mind anymore. A good mother asks questions. When you‚Äôre a mom you‚Äôll understand. And if you wouldn‚Äôt check in on your daughter the way that I do, I‚Äôm sorry, but that would make you a terrible mom.‚Äù

Eventually I got her to relent, but the next time I went out with the guy, I was subjected to the same inquisition when I came home. I also can‚Äôt leave the house / stay out past ten, because she wakes up and freaks out if she doesn‚Äôt know where I am. Even if I tell her, she stays up all night wringing her hands until I come home, then complains the next day that I‚Äôm ruining her sleep schedule.

I said if this is how my life will be for the next two years, I‚Äôm out. She replied simply with the statement that we all must make sacrifices, and my sacrifice is my privacy. She said I‚Äôd be both ridiculous and ungrateful to throw away this financial opportunity (if I stay with her, I will save an enormous amount of money.)

I told her I plan to get a job and move out. She pointed out that since my classes are at night, and I work for the school during the day as a GTA, I won‚Äôt have time for a job. I said I‚Äôd bartend and waitress on the weekends to make up the rest of the money that my teaching assistantship doesn‚Äôt cover. She says that‚Äôs unreasonable, and I‚Äôll burn myself out. 

For context, she would not only let me live in her house rent-free‚Äî she‚Äôd also do most of the grocery shopping, my laundry on occasion, and cook meals.
She‚Äôs flabbergasted and *deeply* offended that I‚Äôd throw such a generous offer back in her face. 

I don‚Äôt think I can put a price on my privacy. AITA, or at least ungrateful and naive, for wanting to get a job and move out?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

He didn't want to play since he was low on money so I gave him 50$ to gamble so we could have fun together. Basically him and I played a couple games of baccarat. I lost the all the money i bet however he won almost quadruple the $50 I gave him. I asked him if he could share his winnings since it was my money he was risking. That's not what he thinks, he thinks that since he won, its his money and he doesnt need to give me any. I was upset after he said this and told him that it was a dick move on his part.  Anyways, Ive been ignoring his texts telling me to get on discord. AITA here for being upset and ignoring my friend?

Edit: After reading comments, i decided to tell him that im upset with him about him not returning atleast the $50 i gave him. He didnt seem to care that i was upset. I guess this is a small price to pay to see what kind of friend he is."	Asshole	0	0
bxidih	2019-06-06 15:58:19	mcraaa	WIBTA For being an hypocrite and letting a guy sleep in my couch?	"So I am currently posted in a  developing country and in an LDR.

&#x200B;

I would in no circunstance be comfortable with my boyfriend having a girl sleep in his couch (he lives in a big city so I don't even see a realistic need for that).

&#x200B;

There's this guy from my original country that recently came to work in the country that I'm posted. He is a friend of a friend and I had never met him before his arrival to the country I'm currently working in.

&#x200B;

There is no public transportation here. He lives in a ""prison"" (closed compound- work where you live) and doesn't have a car. I tried to include him in my friend group with some success.  But my friend group works on saturdays (they all work for the same company which is different from mine) so we usually hang out only on saturday evenings and sundays.

&#x200B;

He knows that I don't work on saturdays and has asked me to hang out, have lunch together, etc. Even though I know it is probably innocent (I met him 3 times) I just know I wouldn't feel comfortable if my boyfriend did the same thing and I don't want to be a hypocrite. Also, I don't want to create this precedent in our relationship.

&#x200B;

Now, we are all going on a short trip sunday. My friend doesn't have a ride to town sunday morning but has one for saturday evening. He asked me to sleep at my place.

&#x200B;

I feel bad for saying no but I don't want to create this precedent in our relationship as well. My boyfriend would NOT understand the extenuating circunstances and it would become ""okay"" for him to do the same if the circunstances present themselves (hanging with friends that are lazy to go home or something).

&#x200B;

Edit1: Yep. IWBTA. Double standards and hypocrite. It's not extenuating circunstances. But Am I an asshole for leaving hanging? He might not have a ride for sunday... I still won't let him sleep there if he can't find a ride to town.

&#x200B;

Edit2: Told the friend. He said no problem and thank you for warning ahead of time. I still don't know how he will be able to go with us on sunday but I'm happy I won't create a double standard."	Asshole	0	0

Throughout the year this guy, who was always following me, dated 2 of the girls that I had liked, cheated on them, sent unsolicited DPs to a girl 2 years younger than him, asked one of my girl friends if ""she was lonely in the bath"" and how he could fix that. He was one of those people. So fast forward to the end of the year, he had just gotten back from rehab for alcoholism, 5 days before school ends. So on our reverse day (just reversed schedule) we go to our athletics period. The coaches let out a heartfelt, honest speech to all of the athletic kids and then the period was over. The next period, you ask?


Choir. So we are all chilling in the choir room, cause y'know it's the last day of school, and at the end of the class he asks to do a speech... So he begins his speech and i'm obviously not going to watch his speech, but I hear some words that I have already heard before... This... Person had copied the exact speech the coaches had gave us before, the other members in the choir weren't in the athletics period, so they thought he made it himself. So here comes the AITA part, one of the younger students in choir saw me on my phone, not paying attention and says ""OP why aren't you listening to L?"" and I just tell them that ""I don't care about what he has to say. He's not worth my time."" And of course the director overheard this and reprimanded me for it. 

Tl:Dr: Dick claims coaches speech for himself, I say that I did not want to hear what her had to say."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bxid4m	2019-06-06 15:57:25	nivekerotavlas	AITA for getting pretty mad at my fiance over this?	"So I (M26) and my fiance (F26) are in the process of moving out of our well furnished 2400sqft 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom third floor apartment in with her in-laws to save money for our wedding and eventually purchase a house. We have to be out by end of day Sunday. I work Monday through Friday 7am - 6pm. She works three nights a week as a nurse 7pm-7am. This week she worked Monday through Wednesday nights and slept during the day everyday until basically 3pm. 

Basically everyday since the beginning of the week I've been coming straight home and working on the move since the beginning of the week carrying heavy ass furniture down the stairs with my father-in-law because I didn't expect her to help carry couches and dressers down flights of stairs, driving to the storage unit until they close at 9pm back and forth, and running around finding boxes and boxing items. I've been up to 12am-1am every night this week. 

I obviously didn't really expect her to help the beginning half of the week because of her work schedule and the nature of carrying heavy shit down flights of stairs but now that's all done and she's off the rest of the week.

So getting to the meat here, This morning she calls me around 8:30am and basically tells me she has dinner plans with her friends from work tonight that she had since last week (she clearly knew we were moving this week) and asks if I'm cool with that.

I tell her that I'm actually not considering I've basically been slaving over work and the apartment non stop and would like to get it done and I would like her to do her part while I'm at work so we can just be done with it and enjoy the weekend. 

She rebuttals with anger and basically tells me that I ruin all her plans with her friends and that shes not a slave and that we have all weekend to do it. (My days off)  She goes on to say that basically because I told her the truth she won't hang out with me on my days off this weekend even if we get it done in timely fashion because I ruined her dinner plans. I would not have had a problem with her going to dinner if she had been packing all week and we were almost done but that is not the case. At this point we will be done moving and cleaning by Saturday morning if we bust our asses as a team with the help of family.

She has tried to sherk her fair share of household responsibilities in the past like this, but never to this extreme. 

I told her at this point I don't even want her help but she supposedly cancelled her dinner plans and has made me out to be some kind of villain because I asked her to do her share of the responsibilities.

For some context: I really enjoy those experimental YouTube channels where they make experiments with random people who apply to participate. There was this one video that I watched that I really enjoyed and noticed that one of the guys were cute. So I found their Instagram and followed them. 

Now the issue here is that I told my boyfriend a few times that I found this person cute and I got really excited when he requested to follow me back (since I didn‚Äôt expect). I didn‚Äôt intend to do anything else, i don‚Äôt even know if Ill accept his follow request anyway. I thought this was no biggie since I considered this like a ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù crush in the sense that I saw him online and knew there was no way I would ever meet them or talk to them. 

However, my boyfriend got upset by this and said that I was doing too much and we got into an argument about it. He said I shouldn‚Äôt have gone out of my way to find his Instagram (One of the guys in the video commented his ig in the YouTube comments so I found this guys) and that I was calling him cute like how I called my boyfriend cute.

Both Molly and David are Spanish and immigrated to the USA. They speak Spanish to each other. That's complete fine with me. However, they would said ""Chinita"" in the middle of their conversation, look in my direction and then laugh. I am Chinese-American and I know what Chinita means. This happened more than once. When I asked Molly what they would talk about, she would say it was nothing. Yesterday I confronted her and told her it pissed me off that they would do that and not tell me what the conversation is about. She told me, once again, it was not about me. I asked her to look at the situation from my point of view. Her response was that she understood where I was coming from but the conversations are not about me.

bxiape	2019-06-06 15:51:29	ifogotminame	AITA for feeling sad/lonely/upset for being left out on my vacation?	"I've been on vacation with 2 of my close friends (both girls, best friends) since mid May. They originally planned this trip together, but because my background is of where we spent the last 3 weeks, they invited me to come along. We recently just left that country and are now in a new one for another week before returning home. 

I was always aware of them wanting time together, to go out clubbing or to meet some guys, as girls their age do. They have their own dynamic and need time together without me there. I have no issue with that. But it's gotten to the point in the past week or so where they go out all day and night and leave me behind at our airbnb or place we're staying at, in a foreign country I'm completely unfamiliar with, by myself. It's not that I don't ask to go or want to, it's specifically stated or implied that it's just the two of them, and it's often in consecutive days. Sometimes they just leave without saying anything and I'm stuck not knowing where they are or what they're doing, and this can be an all day thing. They say to just go out and experience what I want, but that's not what I expected or what was discussed.

The first two weeks were fun, we experienced a lot of sights and things together. I do understand that people can get sick of each other when spending so much time together living in the same space, as I have often gotten tired of some of their tendencies (and needed my own alone time), but now I just feel excluded. 

We've discussed this many times while on this trip, because they need their alone time together. It's just gotten to the point now where my vacation on another continent is just me by myself watching Netflix like I would at home. I go out shopping or to a restaurant/bar, but I'm not the type of person to do really extroverted things by myself (and neither are they, as they've had each other). A walk around where I'm staying is only so entertaining and venturing too far from where I'm staying honestly scares me as I don't want to get lost. They don't seem to think of me or how I'm feeling when doing these things even though I've brought them up, and it keeps happening. I want them to have fun and enjoy themselves, but now it's just at my expense because now I'd honestly just rather be back at home if I'm going to be doing what I normally do there, here instead.

I began to pay rent while his friends girlfriend was staying here a majority of the time whilst renting a place of her own. After a while they were still spending most of their time here, and I started feeling like it was unfair that I was paying rent and that she was *essentially* living here but not paying/contributing anything as I was.  This caused a disagreement and she started to feel unwelcome here and what have you (mind you, she was never unwelcome, I just didn‚Äôt think she was welcome to live here for free). Eventually this got brought up and they refused to see things from mine and my boyfriends side (that she *does* live here and that she *should* pay). We all sat down and tried to address the situation like adults and all was fine until she interjects and starts getting condescending to me. She even goes as far as saying ‚Äúcan you please leave‚Äù ... yes, she asked me to leave the place that I call home. Further condescending comments ensue and I honesty just can‚Äôt take it anymore. I storm off to my room, grab my bag, loudly yell ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to both of them and storm out of the house.

bxi8pg	2019-06-06 15:46:38	SmokedOutMamaLlama	AITA for keeping two circles of my friends separate?	"So I have these two circles of friends, one of them just being one friend.  The other circle consists of 3 guys who I go on golf trips with and do some other fun, random stuff.  For the remainder of the summer, one of them is working about 5 hours away, and rarely comes home, so we hang out with him very infrequently.  This is important for my question.

The solo friend of mine and I play at a different course, just us two, because we are members there but the other guys are not.  That's the only time I hang out with him, so I'm not as close to him as the other guys since I went to high school with them and do other stuff in our free time.

So whenever I go out and play with the 3 (now 2) guys, we have an extra spot open.  I would like to invite my solo friend to play with us, but I feel a selfish need to keep the ""vibe"" the same so I don't invite him because this friend of mine is pretty socially awkward.  They know who he is, but he's never been a part of their lives.  It's not like I neglect him, I'd say the time spent with those guys and him are fairly even, but favoring the 2 other guys for sure.

bxi8mi	2019-06-06 15:46:24		AITA for choosing future pets over my boyfriend	"So we had been dating for a little over 3 years now. He‚Äôs always seemed okay with my dogs. Like he‚Äôll watch them, but he‚Äôs not one to actually play with them. I‚Äôm fine with that I get that not all people are dog people.

I wanted to get back into running again and get back in shape. It had gotten out of habit after my current dog developed arthritis and I couldn‚Äôt take him with me anymore. So I started looking for a younger dog that would also be mellow enough for my older dog. 

When I told my bf he said he would just go running with me instead since I feel awkward going for a run by myself. I thought it was a great idea for us to both get some more exercise.

A week or so later we were chilling on the couch and he noticed I was still looking at dogs on my phone and asked why. I just told him I still wanted to get another dog. 

He eventually said he didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea, that he didn‚Äôt really like dogs, didn‚Äôt want to live with one (we were also talking about him moving in with me around this time) and was allergic so it would be uncomfortable.

Now that I get to a certain extent. I‚Äôm also pretty allergic to dogs and sometimes I do get hives swollen eyes from mine. It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt let him on the furniture or in my bedroom and had all the carpeting pulled out and invested in a roomba. 

Like me it seems like this helped as he only has an allergic reaction when he actually touches my dog, which he doesn‚Äôt have to.

Anyway I told him that I would want to always have a dog. I like having a little buddy around the house. He said it was a deal breaker for him and that he didn‚Äôt want to be uncomfortable in his own home. At the time I just said okay. I kind of tend to freeze in awkward moments like this.

The next day I talked to him and said that I love him, but I think we need to take a step back. He asked why and I said because of the dog thing. He asked if I was joking. When I said I was he seemed really upset and just said fine and hung up the phone. So now it just feels like we‚Äôre in some weird limbo. AITA?"	No A-holes here	1	0
bxi8by	2019-06-06 15:45:46	mrsboozeandcupcakess	AITA for putting down my paralysed dog?	"Recently a ton of handicapped dogs have popped up on my instagram feed, and it's been making me so uncomfortable because it's reminding me of what happened a few years ago. 

&#x200B;

I had a weenie dog I adopted from a shelter. I didn't really do my due dilligence and research his breed since I was mostly focused on helping him adjust to life with a new human (he had been adopted and returned 2 times before I had him). 

&#x200B;

One of the things about weenie dogs I learned too late is they have terrible back problems. I didn't know this, and used to take him for very long walks (he was a mix and VERY stocky and full of energy). One of the things we'd do was go walking up and down stairs to try and get his energy out. Worst mistake ever. 

One morning, I woke up and he was dragging himself on his front paws. Took him to the vet and it turned out he slipped a disc and would be paralyzed for life. I felt like a monster when I realized that it was my fault he had hurt himself. Worse yet, he would have had to be in a crate for over a month and would need surgeries costing thousands of dollars, not to mention whatever he'd need for wheelchairs/accessories. I tried to crate train him for a couple days, but all he did was howl and cry at the top of his lungs, even with doggie xanax. He had had such a hard life up until then and I knew that if he had to get to know a new owner all over again that he would probably end up being put down because of his neediness and separation anxiety. Long story short, I couldn't afford the surgeries and I couldn't imagine giving him up to a shelter in his old age while he had a broken spine, so I made the choice to have him put to sleep. 

&#x200B;

Now that I'm seeing all of these dogs on insta in wheelchairs, it looks manageable. It makes me feel like I put down my best friend over something trivial like a broken bone. AITA?  Was paralysis a shitty reason to put my dog to sleep? (A part of me is thinking that if it was really manageable, the vet would have never offered the option to put him down, but now I really don't know after seeing so many happy dogs in wheelchairs lately.)"

bxi7bk	2019-06-06 15:43:26		AITA for being upset that my bestfriend said she can no longer be a bridesmaid in my wedding.	"So, I have been engaged for about 6 months now and my wedding is in 10 months. One of my closest friends (bestfriends for ~5 years) was supposed to be a bridesmaid. I grew up in the midwest, where she currently lives, but now live in California and my wedding will be here. Planning had been going great and most details are set. I have been running everything by my bridesmaids so they know what to expect, even asking their opinions to make sure it's not too much money. 

Yesterday my friend tells me she will no longer be able to make it to my wedding because she is having car troubles and her boyfriend is having back pain treated and will have medical bills. Her boyfriend is a complete asshole. Can't hold a job, gets felony charges for bar fights etc but whatever. So I'm understanding at that point. I know it's a lot of money.. currently plane tickets are about $500. It is really important to me for her to be there so I offered to help her get her bridesmaid dress, plane ticket, and she can stay at my house so she doesn't need a hotel. She still said she wouldn't be able to. Every step of planning for this wedding she has had a complaint and I have changed a lot to make it work for her and not have her anxiety make her not enjoy herself. Everything is in the midwest (bridal shower, bachelorette, where they get dresses etc) to make it more affordable for her specifically. I was planning my timelines a certain way to not overwhelm her.

I called her out. Saying that clearly money wasnt the only reason she wouldn't be a bridesmaid. I told her I'm hurt that she's giving up a year out from my wedding instead of making it work. I'm not angry I'm just upset and realizing we may not be friends anymore. I also told her if she was planning something I would be there no matter what...I make way less money than her and living in California is way more expensive. So its also annoying when I consider those details.

"So this past year, I was living in an apartment with 5 of my friends, and dishes were always a major issue. Most of my roommates were so bad about doing dishes that I eventually just grabbed a big box to put all of their dirty dishes in, otherwise nobody could use the sink. Its a small kitchen. 

I've always been very good about cleaning my dishes as soon as I was done using them.  The dirty dish box was always full of dishes usually from the same 3 people, but it wasnt that big of a deal because it was out of the way. The box made a very good compromise for all of us when everyone was around.

Unfortunately, winter break started and 3 out of the 6 of us went home for break, but me and 2 other people were planning on staying in the apartment and working at school for break. Before winter break started, i tried to emphasize to the roommates who had the most stuff in the box to please try and clean up their stuff. I would leave notes on the fridge, texts in our groupchat, and even told them personally that if there stuff wasn't cleaned from the box by winter break i was going to take all their shit and stuff it in a bag, since i didn't want to have to deal with their dishes that they didn't clean up. Also because it was a bit of a health hazard. The few times my girlfriend had touched some of the dishes in the box she immediately broke out into huge rashes all over her hands.

So to no ones suprise, winter break comes and the box is still full of dishes. True to my word, i took everyone's crap in the box and stuffed it in a black bag and put it in the corner. This was mostly because one of the roommates who had stayed behind is the worst offender of leaving dirty dishes everywhere and had borrowed literally everyones dishes in an effort to not clean his. So there were piles of dirty dishes everywhere and i needed the box to fit these new dishes. 

When everyone returned (a month and a half later) three of the roommates were fine with what i had done, took their stuff out of the bag and moved on with their lives. 

Two roommates in particular (who were gone for the whole month and a half break), we'll refer to them as R and T, got extremely angry at me for putting their stuff in a bag, claiming that their stuff was ruined beyond repair, and that i should have cleaned up their stuff, because that's what friends do. 

I am much more friends with R, and was more acquaintances with T. Anyway both of them basically called me and my girlfriend assholes for not cleaning all the dishes in the box for them. Even though half those dishes had been there since thanksgiving and it was February when they finally even noticed it. Also they didnt clean the dishes that were in the bag afterwards and just put them back in the box.

He is worried about his mom being alone (widowed 10 years ago) so he goes and spends the night at his moms once night a week to start with. She had anxiety about living alone. 

He is planning on taking her to a football game that is close to his house. His mom lives further so he wants to have her spend the night. He mentioned that he needs to get the futon ready and I joked that she‚Äôs better off going home because it‚Äôs uncomfortable. He then said that if anything, he would put pillows between them in his bed and have her sleep on the same bed since it‚Äôs a ‚Äútwo person‚Äù bed. (Full size). I spend the night a lot at his place and we have sex on that bed. It‚Äôs weird to me he planning to have a sleepover with her but put her in the same bed as him. I would never share a bed with my dad. It‚Äôs weird to me. That combined with his mommas boy tendencies makes me cringe. I want to tell him that‚Äôs weird and he should sleep on the futon.

bxi1zk	2019-06-06 15:30:45		WIBTA- if i told my boyfriend hes being kinda selfish about his career path?	"So my boyfriend and i are already long distance and for this career hes wanting he would have to move further away. Which isnt the problem, it sucks but ill deal with it. And along with that he would be traveling most of the year so i would never see him. That alone is really hard for me and i feel like im giving up a lot going along with it but ill make it work. 

The real problem im having is that his job requires a lot of physical labor and it would be very easy for him to hurt himself. On top of that he has a chronic illness that basically just makes living painful and every day tasks hurt. I brought this up to him and told him maybe its not a good idea and he should change his plans a little ( his job is still possible without all the physical parts of it he just wants to do that part the most) and he said he is willing to die doing this and he just wants to do it. 

Which i want him to be happy but at the same time i dont want him to die. I dont think hes really thinking about us and our future together and hes more just thinking about him and then we figure out a way around it. But this is a little too much for me. I dont want him to die in general but i also dont want him to die young and i changed my whole life plan to be with him and theres no way of going back. 

Would i be an asshole if i told him hes being a little selfish with his career choice and he needs to think of his health and our future together as well?"		1	0
bxi1si	2019-06-06 15:30:19	hurnadoquakemom	AITA Birthday Accomodation Request	"I'm 29. I have some sensory issues to put it mildly. I also have hyperacusis (sensitivity to sound). There's some trauma associated with my birthday. It's not a fun day for me. 

I request no posts, texts, or calls. The dinging is painful. Even on silent, the frequent notifications are overwhelming. I also ask that people don't do the big excited behaviors that usually end in a hug. I don't demand or get angry when they do those things, unless they touch me or clearly disrespect the request. 

People tend to be mad or hurt. Some say it's rude or ungrateful. Some think my requests are too burdensome to others. I guess it's the guilt of not doing the normal nice things. I can understand that to some extent, but that's a them problem IMO. Some people try to fix me. I find that condescending. 

I think it's rude to disrespect someone's request solely to make yourself comfortable. Especially when I've said it makes me uncomfortable. I'm not telling them what to do on their birthday. I'm asking not to do it on mine. 

I work hard to adapt the rest of the year. I want one day where people let me be comfortable. I think my birthday is a reasonable day to ask that.

I have nothing against pit bulls; they are great dogs as long as they live at your house!! First, I‚Äôm terrified of big dogs. Second, we already have two small, older dogs who do not want a puppy around (which should have been clear as we dog sit for my stepson‚Äôs young dog occasionally). 

I knew this dog wasn‚Äôt going to be a good fit for our family but my husband insisted on keeping the dog. He‚Äôs housebroken but he is not well mannered. I‚Äôve really tried but I think the dog can sense my fear. He has knocked me over more times than I can count. All of my shoes, lamps, and pretty things have been locked away because he chews them up or knocks them over. 

I rehomed him three months ago. However, the new owner begged me to come get him because she was bitten in a dog fight. She put her hand between the dogs to break them up and doesn‚Äôt know which dog bit her but she no longer wanted the pit bull. I agreed to pick up the dog because he doesn‚Äôt belong in a shelter. But, I cried in despair over bringing the dog back into our home.

My husband is overjoyed to have the dog back and I am beside myself with anxiety. Although I have no idea who bit the previous owner, I‚Äôm upset about the possibility it could have been the pit bull.

I want to regime the dog again. My husband is upset with me because I want to rehome the dog again.

I usually tell my mom where I'm going before I leave the house though, so I don't think to check in with her that much. She HATES this. She freaks out every time she can't get ahold of me (even though she never answers when I call either). For context, I am 20 years old and I don't ignore her on purpose.

&#x200B;

Yesterday, I fell asleep at my friend's house and woke up to 6 missed calls and about 20 texts from my very angry mother. She always threatens to file a missing person report with the police, and, surprise, that's exactly what she threatened to do yet again. One of the texts even said ""the police are on their way"". I got annoyed and responded back telling her that I'll call the police myself and let them know to not take her seriously. 

&#x200B;

This sent her on a rampage of passive aggressive texts telling me how ungrateful I am, how horrible it is to make her worry like that, how she's the victim here, etc. I got pissed (because she ALWAYS does this), so I went off on her. I told her that I don't always have my phone on me and that it's crappy and manipulative of her to act like this all the time. We yelled back and forth, and the final text she sent was ""I am your mother. I will act how I please. We will discuss this later...."" 

&#x200B;

Any time I try to talk to her about how I feel when she does this, she tells me I'm lucky for having someone who worries so much about me. I don't FEEL lucky. I feel anxious that I'm going to piss her off. When I tell her I've consulted other people about it and they agree with me that it's manipulative, she says they don't know what they're talking about.

bxhybj	2019-06-06 15:21:38		AITA for wanting my boyfriend to skip his friend's birthday?	"My boyfriend and I are moving in together in two weeks. Because of all of the moving expenses, we decided not to take a planned vacation, and instead take that week off to get moved in / unpack / spend that week together as a little staycation. We've been planning little things here and there, outright calling it ""our vacation"". 

Yesterday a friend of his planned his birthday, for the Saturday during our vacation. We would've had the week off together by then, so it is the tail-end. It's an all-day event, and it wasn't exactly implied that I was invited (the friend and I aren't close). 

A note about my boyfriend - he has a HUGE social circle, and there are events at least 3 out of 4 weekends, and every single Wednesday night. It's honestly exhausting, but they're all very nice people so I've gotten used to it. But it adds up to not a heck of a lot of time alone together. This week was important to me - it would be the first time in our year and a half relationship that we were on our own for an entire week. I was looking forward to spending that time in our little nest before the insane social calendar inevitably fills up again.   
BUT. It's the guy's birthday, and it's only 1 day out of 9 (though we'll be moving/unpacking for the first few days). So I don't know. I don't want him to go, I want him to think the way I do, ""No this was our planned vacation and we're supposed to spend it together."" But I don't think it'll occur to him. So am I the asshole for wanting him to skip that birthday?

bxhvxz	2019-06-06 15:16:07	Pulp_Writer	AITA for cutting off communication with my step-mother?	"When I was around twelve my mother found out that my father was seeing someone else. They fought over this for months while my father would go back and forth; leaving us - me, my mother, and my three older sisters ‚Äì to be with this other woman. I remember feeling like there was a revolving door on our house in those days. The other woman would call and curse out my mother. This was long-ago before even caller ID. At times, we would go without heat or hot water for days. Once this woman chased my, then fifteen-year-old, sister around a bar as my sister tried to get my father to come home or at least give her money for oil.

My mother eventually threw his clothes onto the front porch, cutting up some of his favorites before adding the shreds to the pile. They sat there for days. And then, my dad didn‚Äôt have anything to do with me or my sisters. Not even phone calls.

It was seven years before I reached out to him. I was getting married and joined the Air Force. He had married the other woman. He never apologized for his actions, and I never asked him to.

For years we had a lukewarm relationship with no more feeling than you might have towards an acquaintance, but at some point, I truly forgave him.

My father started having serious health issues and I started taking him to his doctor‚Äôs appointments. We became closer, friends even.

My dad‚Äôs health deteriorated, and he was hospitalized. When the hospital could no longer treat him, he was sent home under hospice care. He died peacefully two days after his release.

Afterwards, I would go over to visit with my stepmother. I never felt close to her, but I did feel a sort of obligation to my father. She only has a son-in-law and her granddaughter‚Äôs family left.

My father had a joint plot at the cemetery for him and my stepmother. One day she called to ask if my mother had a burial plot. I told her that I thought that she did. (She‚Äôs been remarried for years.) She asked me to check. She decided to be buried with her daughter in another section of the cemetery and bought a plot there. If my mom wanted, she could be buried with my father. She said that she would give her the plot. Someone would only need to pay for its opening and closing upon burial. I was shocked and didn‚Äôt know how to respond. It felt like she was telling my mom, ‚ÄòI took him in life, but you can have him back now that he‚Äôs dead.‚Äô I couldn‚Äôt ask my mother this. I couldn‚Äôt even tell my sisters about it as I knew one of them would end up going over to her house over it. I tried to call her only once after she made this weird request, but I didn‚Äôt reach her, so I left a message. I can‚Äôt bring myself to call her again. I don‚Äôt want to apologize for not reaching back out to her (though she certainly hasn‚Äôt called me either). Maybe she was just clueless about what she was asking. I still can‚Äôt face her after this, and I don‚Äôt want to explain how this question hurt me so much."	No A-holes here	0	0

bxhv7m	2019-06-06 15:14:14	lolsamuellol	WIBTA if I violate my parent's religion while I'm living with them?	"Hey guys. Please excuse any grammar issues as English isn't my main language.

So some context: I am visiting my religious family for around a week before I go somewhere for college. I myself have been agnostic for quite a while now, and my parents reluctantly accepted it but stated that as long as I'm in their house I need to follow the rules, which I respect and understand.

However, it gets a bit more complicated - I am very soon leaving for my second year in college. Like, June 11 soon. I want to hang out with my friends (who are closet atheists) one more time, but the thing is, tomorrow begins a holiday of my religion, where we are not allowed to drive or use any electricity-using equipment.  The holiday begins on Friday night and continues until June 10, and on Friday morning and noon I'm going to be too busy helping my family prepare for the holiday. 

Now, my friends (who live at least a 10 minute car ride from all directions from me so meeting on foot is not feasible) and I thought of going somewhere DURING the holiday since that'll be the only time we'll be able to do so. 
I asked my parents if I that will count as disrespect towards them and they said that I can't violate the religion as long as I live with them, and this counts as such. I feel like since I am going to be out of the house for the social activity, and since I'm not going to use any of my parent's money or belongings (one of my friends also has his own car so there's no issue of stealing from our parents anything) it's really my decision from here and I'm not doing anything morally questionable since I'm 19 and an adult now. However, I'm unsure and would really appreciate some less biased opinions.
Thank you so much for your opinions. I am ready to accept either result.

INFO - just so people know I have a healthy relationship with my parents, and even if they do somehow find out they wont kick me out of the house (no that itd matter since id be leaving for college the next day anyway) so thats not a risk. And the plan is that I get outside the house, go somewhere where no one from my religion will be present in and get picked up by a friend from there.
More INFO - walking is NOT possible. Me and my friends tried to discuss that and found out that way at least one of us would have to walk for quite a bit in the heat in just one direction, which even if was possible would just ruin the mood)

EDIT - So far it would seem IWBTA. Welp, sucks that I won't get to see my friends without being TA but I respect my parents.
EDIT 2 - well looks like it's getting a bit more polarized now. Both sides use solid arguments.  I still tend towards TA but it's subject to change.
EDIT 3 - ok now I'm not sure...
EDIT 4 - well I'm beginning to see where the other side is coming from
EDIT 5 - Woah, that post seens to be more thought provoking than I expected. Thank you so much for the food for thought guys.
Edit 6 - well so far it would look like the NTA side is winning, not considering the NTA opinions that just bash religion or YTA opinions that forget im following the rules while im in the house. Thanks so much for the inputs y'all
EDIT 7 - well guys I think we pretty much said it all. It was definitely an interesting, thought provoking discussion. I think that so far the best option ia go through with it and just tell half truth to my parents to prevent the relationship from getting more strained. This might count as disrespect towarsa my parents but at the end I also want to meet my friends one more time before i go down under. Still feel free to add your opinion of course if you feel like something can be added. I thank you all one more time for the intelligent opinions."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxhtfl	2019-06-06 15:09:54	dailypineapplenews	AITA for canceling a trip with friend the day before?	"I have a very good friend whom I've known for years. She has strong opinions and she makes them known. We have a very similar world view which is the reason we get along so well. However, the one fight we've had really opened my eyes to what kind of a person she is.

She didn't really contact me or try to make things better, she just left me on read and claimed she wanted to give me space and let me calm down and also have time to think about what she wanted to say. She had said something that really hurt me which started the fight in the first place, and her apologies were haphazard and ""sorry IF I hurt you"", and I told her over and over why I was hurt and she never really acknowledged this.

I wanted to resolve things but she kept ghosting me which pissed me off much more. Finally when things weren't going anywhere, I told her we should just forget this, move forward and that this is stupid. Her reply? She started bitching about work like nothing happened. We never talked about it again but things went back to normal.

So, now. We had talked about taking a one day trip together. We had a date, no set time or anything, she had asked two days off work (the days she asked were Fri and Sat and she knows I work both days). I tell her I have to work on Saturday and thus can't party on Friday, and she kinda just ignores that. I wanted to be nice so I tell her ""ok we will try to make it work"". In my opinion, we didn't set the plans in stone, just talked about the date and left it at that. After that, we don't really talk for a week or so, except a few random messages here and there.

Then one day a week before the trip she suggests we meet on a Monday since we're both free, and I say yes. Monday comes I ask her if our plans still exist. She just ignores the question.

So, I was reluctant to take Friday off work for the trip, because I wasn't sure if she was still on board with the trip. She didn't say anything about it all week so I chose work. I told her this, granted only a day before the trip (but I would've been the one paying for it anyway) and she gets very upset. I tell her my reasoning - no contact from her all week, the Monday blowoff etc - and she just says ""okay"" to this. Still upset tho, so I say sorry and that I didn't realise we had agreed. I would've needed some kind of a confirmation from her that she still wanted to do it. She says she thought we had agreed because we had talked about it and ""why would've she bailed when she asked the days off from work"". I say that I just didn't want to risk it because my company loses money for every hour it stays closed. She's upset and says ""I guess I'll do something alone tomorrow then"".

I know I didn't handle it the best, so I tell her I understand she's upset and I'm upset with myself that I didn't just book the trip, and if she lets me, I'll make it up and take her to the trip next week.

She ignores me.

I wasn‚Äôt a very popular kid. I had my group of friends, but most outside the circle used me for jokes/avoided me, and some would straight up pick on me. 

I love to bake. I would bake things and bring an assload (like if I brought cookies, I would bring close to 80-100) to school to share with friends/teachers. But bringing cookies to a place overcrowded with teens gave me a lot of attention, especially from the assholes who targeted me.

I have a common name that has a few different spellings, but one is extremely uncommon. I have the extremely uncommon one.

bxhmzy	2019-06-06 14:54:36	imabigballofanxiety	WIBTA if I put my dad's dog down behind his back	"(Sorry to the mods for reposting, didn't know spaces counted as characters)

So this sounds terrible and I honestly likely won‚Äôt do anything because I know that dogs always look for their masters when they go to sleep, though how aware she is is debatable. My dad's dog (was originally mine) is 16, has 1 almost working leg out of 4 bad ones, incontinent, blind can't hear, can't drink on her own, needs to be hand-fed, has to take an average of about 6 pills a day, can't lay down or stand up on her own, and she just seems so sad all the time. She can't go on walks and can barely get to the end of the driveway. Her whole body is arthritic.

She had a few close calls over the past few years: her liver stopped working, and then randomly started up again, her paw got run over by a car and the stress and pain caused a lot of issues, she's had at least one seizure that we know of. My dad was actually going to put her down, but then she woke up when the vet left the room and he said he still saw some light behind her eyes so he took her back home.

That dog was/is well loved and taken care of by us. A few years ago, I moved away to a neighboring state to go to university. I can't have dogs in the dorms, so I didn't take her with me (and honestly, she was in constant need of care by the time I left already). When I moved away, my dad took even more care of her than he did when I was home, so she‚Äôs his dog, now.

I will say that my dad pampers this dog so much, I don't think he's treating her badly or anything, but I think it's cruel to let her live in so much pain - I don't care how many pills she takes, you can tell she's in bad shape. My mom and dad live alone with the dog and my siblings will come over to visit, but they can't ever leave the house with no one home because the dog will have an accident. My dad took her to the vet recently for more pills and, while the vet gave her what he asked for, she said ""I could just slap you."" My dad's reply? ""Oh the last guy who ran this practice would have grabbed me by the lapels and shook me.""

He KNOWS that the dog needs to be put down, and he refuses to do it! We've all offered to take her to the vet ourselves and he still will not let us. I've been debating giving the dog benadryl when I visit one weekend, but we've given it to her before (as a sleep aid) so I would hate to have it not work and only cause more harm. I feel like a monster for even considering it. The only other thing that I can think of is to give the vet a house call and to do it when I'm the only one home. I feel terrible even thinking about this, but this dog is in so much pain, and there is no way I can convince my dad to say his final goodbyes. WIBTA if I were to SOMEHOW put the dog down behind his back and attempt to make it look like a natural death? I know that if I just took her to the vet, unless she had a reason to go like another seizure, he would never talk to me again.

EDIT: let me clarify (and probably dig my own grave some more), I WOULD NOT DO IT MYSELF, if at all. No excuses for myself, I phrased it horribly. I don't want to hurt the dog anymore than he already has by keeping her alive. Also, y'all this is my dog too, he just took over when I left for Uni.

EDIT 2: I think that the next time I go home, I will talk to the rest of my family to see if they will do a sort of intervention with me. I will let my dad know of some euthanasia services that can do house calls for the dog. I really want to drive home the point that he and the dog can part on his terms. I know he's going to argue that she's not going out on her own terms, but it's better that they say goodbye, because I feel like even she's ready to go. I feel like if she dies in her sleep then he'll never be able to move on from it because he won't get any closure."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bxhmz8	2019-06-06 14:54:33	BumbledBFF	AITA for using Bumble to find friends?	"I'm 25F and my boyfriend of 6 months is 27M. I've been living in a pretty large US city since graduating college, but haven't made any close friends...I've found that it's much harder to meet people as an adult when you can't just share a class with someone.

I downloaded Bumble, which most people know as a dating app but it actually has three separate ""modes"" - dating, friends, and networking. The friends mode, BumbleBFF, only shows you other women if you're a woman and other men if you're a man. So I've been using that for a couple weeks now and had a couple of coffee dates with some girls. No super best friendships blossoming yet or anything, but it's gotten me out of the house and it seems promising.

I was over at my boyfriend's apartment the other day and I pulled out my phone to do some swiping during a commercial break. My boyfriend walks in and is like ""what the fuck are you doing?"" which annoys me that he's instantly jumping to conclusions even though it's clearly all girls on my screen. So I show him the app and explain it, and I swipe through a couple of girls to show him that it's not a dating thing, and of course with my luck a guy comes up in the queue. Occasionally guys will put their gender as female and try to get dates on the BFF mode...this is maybe 1% of the people on there, the rest is really just girls looking for friends. So my boyfriend gets even more upset, and I am annoyed because I feel like I haven't done anything wrong, so I tell him to look it up on the internet if he doesn't believe me. The evening pretty much ended after that and I went back to my place.

This morning he tells me that he's ""uncomfortable"" with me using the app because ""Bumble is a dating app"" and it would not take much effort to switch over to the dating mode. I don't think that logic really holds up because it wouldn't take much effort for me to download Tinder either...effort is not the obstacle that keeps me from cheating, I don't cheat because I'm not a cheater and I just want to make some new friends.

bxhldh	2019-06-06 14:50:31	jkinthejk4	AITA for buying going on holiday whilst my gf was recovering from an accident?	"My girlfriend was hit by a drunk driver 2 months ago, the paramedics rang me and said she was in critical condition. She had broken one leg, her wrist, fractured her skull, slipped a disc in her back and broken her collar bone + 3 ribs. She was in a bad way but recovered well. She spent 4 weeks in hospital and then was released with the use of a wheelchair until her leg and back were fixed. 

We had a holiday to Amsterdam booked for us two and 3 of our friends. My friends said they understood I wouldn't be able to make it but the flights were non-refundable. My gf was kept on morphine so was sleeping a lot. I asked if she'd mind me going and she wasn't really with it but said it's fine cause she wouldn't be much fun. 

Last week, I went for a week to Amsterdam as planned and my GFs sister took care of her. 

My GF sister sent me a message when I was away saying she couldn't believe I'd gone and that of course my GF would say it's okay, she is doped up and would feel guilty telling me to stay but that I should've stayed anyway. 

I returned yesterday and my GF sister and my Mum and Brother think I was an asshole. My GF hasn't really spoken about it other than to say she missed me. 

AITA?

bxhld6	2019-06-06 14:50:30	Zimlingking	WIBTA for cutting my alcoholic father out of my life?	"My (21M) father (55M) has been an alcoholic for the entirety of my memorable childhood, with cycles of months-long benders followed by several years of sobriety. I‚Äôll note at the start here that, during these sober periods, I believe he was an objectively good parent to me and my sister (now 18F). He worked hard at a well-paying job which afforded my family an upper-middle-class lifestyle in a wealthy area, with my mom staying at home fulltime. I‚Äôll also preface the rest of this by saying that he never came close to laying a hand on me or my sister, though he did threaten my mother (55F) with it several times. I do disagree with many of his beliefs (climate-change denying, strongly fiscally/socially conservative, etc.) but he is not particularly vocal about them and I don‚Äôt think that, on their own, they justify going no-contact.

For the sake of brevity, I will just note that my parents went through a divorce last year after my mother uncovered extensive evidence of my father‚Äôs continued secret alcohol use and infidelity spanning several months. The negotiations were complicated and it was a messy process for both sides. Hearing the facts from both my mother and father has made me realize how much of a loathsome person my father was toward my mother in the past year as well as the majority of their marriage.

I am enrolled as a full-time engineering student entering my senior year of college, after which I plan on entering the workforce immediately. Since my parents are now jointly funding my education, it feels wrong to completely cut off contact with my father. We occasionally exchange brief text messages for birthdays, holidays, and important life events, but never have any real conversation (by my choice). I do still maintain contact with my aunt and grandmother on my father‚Äôs side, and visit them frequently throughout the year. I have not seen my father in person since last August, just before the cheating evidence was uncovered and the divorce proceedings began.

Recently, my sister has decided to start opening up lines of communication with my father, catalyzed by inviting him to her high school graduation. She has lived through and remembers less of his alcoholism than I do because of her younger age and the fact that I tried to keep her sheltered from it as much as possible, and I think this may be factoring into her decision to reconnect.

My question is: WIBTA if I stopped contacting my father completely after I graduate college and am no longer financially dependent on him in any way? I can‚Äôt help feeling that, after all these years and financial support from him that I ‚Äúowe‚Äù him a bare minimum of contact (similar to the arrangement we have now).

My father has hurt me, my mother, and my sister very acutely, remains unapologetic for the most part, and continues to live a life alternating between alcoholism and sobriety. I simply see no future benefit to keeping this man in my life."	Not the A-hole	0	0

With the negative feelings towards the English this is important.  Today I was walking my two setter puppies passed a neighbours property.  They have four dogs but the biggest is a male 3 year old Japanese Aikita.  Seeing my two pups it came over their low fence and attacked my two boys snarling and biting.  I let my boys go (joined on a split lead) and I screamed and kicked and beat at the Akita.  My attack as well as the pups screaming, and barking stopped the attack and the Akita backed off.  My dogs are relatively unscathed but I‚Äôve twisted my neck and back and my arms throbbing from  being wrenched during the fight. This is not the first time the Akita has has attacked but before my boys were smaller and I could pick them up. My instinct is to call the wrath of God down on this beast but they are my neighbours.

bxhh2m	2019-06-06 14:39:43		AITA for not wanting to bring my girlfriend to my friends wedding?	"I've [24M] been dating my girlfriend [24F] for about two years.  Things have been a bit rocky for us over that time, its been a downright struggle at times to be honest but we are working on things.  So the main reason that I do not want to bring her to the wedding is because of something that happened during a Halloween party last year.  This party was the first time she was introduced to my friend group, we are all very close and have known each other for years longer than I've known her.  

Anyway, within this friend group are a few female friends who I am equally as close with.  One of my female friends, we will call Lara, was upset over the course of the night and I was trying to talk to her and calm her down as a friend would.  My girlfriend seeing this pulls me out of the party and asks me if there is something between me and my Lara, I assured her there wasn't anything not even romantic feelings between us which was the truth.  This conversation did not go quickly or smoothly, it was about 20 minutes of me telling her that I wasn't involved with any of my female friends.  She then proceeds to sit down with Lara after all of this conversation and talk to her about the entire situation as well, which I felt was inappropriate.  She should have taken my word for it.  

Fast forward to current day, we have had numerous conversation very similar to that night about me having feelings or spending too much time with Lara or my other friends.  For context, I work with one of my female friends and never hangout with Lara alone aside from lunch every now and again.  I see then frequently because they are in my classes and we study together often.  Personally I'm offended that these conversations even need to happen and I feel like bringing her to the wedding would cause far too much drama and discomfort when I want to just be enjoying the atmosphere with my friends and congratulating my newly married friends.  


TL;DR  Girlfriend has accused me of being in a relationship with a close female friend, as a result I do not want to bring her to a friends wedding in which she will be present."		1	0

I'm in my early 20's, and I was living with my father while I attended college. My father suddenly passed away in a car crash early last year, so I was suddenly weighed down with a lot of expenses. I couldn't afford to live there alone (I wasn't paying him rent, I was offering alternative methods of payment like cooking, cleaning, shopping for him, etc), and on top of that, he didn't have life insurance so I had to eat the funeral costs.

During the funeral my mom (dad's ex-wife, it was a nasty divorce) offered to let me live with her until I can get back on my feet, since I would have to put college on hold until I could earn some more $. I agreed and moved in.

I was unable to find work for nearly six months. During my stay their, I took care of all the household chores -- I did 100% of the cleaning, cooking, shopping, and other errands like going to the post office or calling for maintenance appointments. I also did both of our laundry and dry cleaning, and made her bed/tidied her bedroom every day. 

I had access to the guest bedroom, of which I was not allowed to decorate nor was I allowed to have friends over. My mother would frequently (daily) barge in and did not let me keep the door closed. She would often demand my attention at any moment to rant at me about various things for several hours long -- I had zero privacy and was essentially her handmaiden for several months. (My therapist used the word ""covert incest"" and ""narcissistic personality disorder"" to describe the situation. I was a surrogate husband). She used this time to frequently bad-mouth my father around me, even though I told her often that I was still going through the grieving process and didn't want to discuss him.

After awhile, I suddenly got a job and was able to move out on my own. My mom is now claiming I owe her rent for the time I lived there. We HAD discussed rent briefly before I moved in, but she never gave me a quote, and even when I tried to follow up, she never asked me for the money until after I left. There was no ""official"" agreement.

I told my friend while venting I had no intention of paying. She says I would be an asshole for not paying, but my logic here is, I was essentially paying my rent with my time and effort. Not to mention, yes I had a bed to stay in, but I didn't really have a room or any privacy.

bxhgbe	2019-06-06 14:37:40	TrappedinSCSendHelp	AITA for not wanting to visit plantations?	"I used a throwaway because I‚Äôm paranoid about my friends finding my main account. 

I recently moved from New Jersey to South Carolina. I‚Äôm going to be completely honest and say that I was extremely reluctant to move. The only reason I did is because with the cheaper cost of living, I will not be working full time and instead will be focusing on finishing my degree which I was unable to do in Jersey because I couldn‚Äôt afford to not work part time. My husband really didn‚Äôt like living in Jersey for various reasons, the cost and the cold winters being two of the biggest reasons. So we comprised. 

I never pictured myself living in the south. Ever. I don‚Äôt like the weather, the politics, how spaced out everything is, how slow everything moves; I didn‚Äôt think it would ever be for me. However I‚Äôm really trying to find things to love down here but it‚Äôs really hard when I don‚Äôt have any friends besides my husband and I haven‚Äôt started school yet so when he‚Äôs at work, I‚Äôm driving around trying to get to know the area, going to the gym and just generally trying to keep myself occupied however I‚Äôm home alone a lot and the depression is real. 

So my husband really tries to get me out of the house when he‚Äôs not at work. Plantations are very popular attractions down here. I went to one once when we visited his parents down here and I said I would never go again. It‚Äôs weird to walk around and stare at pretty old houses and flowers while almost entirely glossing over slavery and the horrible things that happened there. 

He thinks my refusal means I‚Äôm not trying and that I just need a reason to hate the south and southern people when honestly I just think it‚Äôs fucking weird and makes me uncomfortable.

Am I wrong? Maybe this is coming from a place of resentment.

Edit: so I definitely need to try and work on my attitude and being more accepting of my new home. I totally get it and that‚Äôs on me. If anyone wants to suggest any fun stuff to do, please message me! I‚Äôve already got my feelers out for fun outdoorsy activities."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxhgb4	2019-06-06 14:37:38		AITA For snitching on my friend that he started smoking weed?	"Me and this past friend are both 16 and studying in 10th grade. Before I go on I should probably say that we know each other since 6th grade and we‚Äôve been very close friends.

One day my friend called me up and offered some weed to smoke, I rejected because I have a very negative attitude towards drugs, even if they‚Äôre legalized. In our country (Switzerland) weed is legal as long as it has THC concentration below 1 and if you‚Äôre 16 or older. 
On the next day he told me that he bought some ‚Äúreal shit‚Äù and showed me a full bag of weed. He then told me that this was some Mexican marijuana that would give him a much stronger high than normal. I assumed that he bought it from some illegal dealer and started worrying about him so I told him that he is getting addicted and that he should really stop, and if he needed some help I could help him. He told me that he is fine and that he is not addicted.
For the next few days I haven‚Äôt seen him bring weed to school, I checked his bag and his pockets just to make sure that he stopped as he promised.
So for a day or so I thought it‚Äôs alright until one of our common friends asked me where he is because he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt show up for their daily puff‚Äù. Apparently my friend and this guys have been smoking weed in the public bathroom just outside the school campus. I was really upset and instead of confronting my friend about this I just sent an anonymous email to the school director asking them to drug test my friend. The next day he got drug tested and expelled on the spot. 
It‚Äôs been over a month and I haven‚Äôt talked to him since. I know he is much better now because his mom and my mom talk to each other. I don‚Äôt know how to talk to him again because I think he is a good kid, he just met the wrong people.

My sibling is currently away for work so I am currently alone with the aunt, siblings spouse, and their one year old child. Sibling asked me to watch the baby while him and spouse are at work, and I did, but my aunt was also home and took pretty big offence to this and came in crying about how the family doesnt trust her to watch the baby etc etc, and she often speaks about how when we move she'll have nowhere to go (multiple people have stated she can stay with them) but she says that she cant live with them because they all hate her. From what shes told me in the past, she went through pretty heavy issues and had her child murdered, but shes been known to lie a lot, and none of my other family members have ever brought up the baby (but I can see them steering clear of the subject due to trauma)

My aunt regularly gets upset with us because, from her exact words, we all stare at her like we hate her and we want her to move out 24/7, which is just blatantly untrue. My aunt has said for years that I am her best friend and constantly refers to me as her child, although my real mother is distant but still very much in the picture. It makes me slightly uncomfortable to be having a 40 year old woman tell me, a young minor, that I'm her best friend and that I'm her only friend she can talk to. Ever since my mom said I'd have to move in with her she has been clearly on edge and has stated things like ""im the only reason she's alive"" and has subtly threatened harming herself before to keep me from leaving (I have no choice in the moving aspect) I'm just confused and sad and have almost no idea what to do with her anymore because anything you say is like walking in a minefield.

bxhawf	2019-06-06 14:23:41	b56th	AITA for not letting my wife buy $200 worth of party supplies for my mother-in-law	"OK, so I'll try to make this short.

My mother-in-law is planning a surprise birthday party for my father-in-law.  My wife got roped into helping set this up...specifically with decorations etc. (despite the fact that we live 2 hours away from my in-laws).  Mother-in-law asked my wife to spend $200+ on decorations for the party on our own credit card so my father-in-law wouldn't see it.  I told my wife that I wasn't comfortable doing this and she got all upset.

My points:
1) We're not a bank, we don't have unlimited amounts of money to loan out to people
2) My mother-in-law already owes us ~$75 for something else (from a couple weeks ago).
3) She lives 2+ hours away, so it's not exactly 'easy' to get money from her (she doesn't use venmo or anything).  
4) We've done things like this before, and she typically doesn't pay us back for several months.

Edit: My wife and I have joint accounts for everything.  In general, we always talk to each other whenever we're spending money on something out of the ordinary (such as this).

When I returned, my wife  told me that she was really upset with Madison ( my bio daughter ). Both the girls were in their rooms and my wife told me what happened. 

Madison wanted to prank Taylor ( my stepdaughter ) and she ended up hacking her hair off when Taylor was asleep and continued to do so even after she woke up. She did it in an uneven fashion and it looked really bad. Taylor was really upset and crying. So they went to the salon and they had to cut off most of her hair. She ended up with really short hair and it didn't look fashionable. I felt really sorry for her. 

I asked Madison why she did that and she told me that she was really sorry and she didn't realize that it would end up like this. So I took the girls out for some ice cream and pizza. They got along well. Madison apologised and Taylor was fine. 

Now my wife insists that I should have Madison's hair cut in a similar fashion as her punishment. She thinks it's fair. I did nit agree with her.

I don‚Äôt really want to ruin the pictures by cutting him out and one of the frames is like this really cool mosaic thing that is fragile and I worry if I start messing with it I might break it. However I did say if it bothered her that much I would cover his face up with a sticker. 

She lives 7 hours away so she‚Äôs only really st my house like 2-3 times a year. She‚Äôs just coming to visit with her new boyfriend soon so I don‚Äôt want to make things weird or get into an argument about it as the pictures are displayed rather prominently around the house. Last time she came she did kind of pick a fight with me about it so I have feeling she will say something if the pictures are still hanging up. She‚Äôs been divorced for over 5 years so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs super recent however it was a very messy divorce and she basically straight up hates him as he cheated on her and was abusive. 

Also in my wedding pictures are both of my husbands brothers with their now ex wives (lol idk why everyone in our families can‚Äôt seem to not get divorced except us) and they live 15 minutes away and are over more frequently and don‚Äôt seem to be bothered or at least have never said anything to me about them. My husbands brothers ex wives were in the wedding party so they are in a lot more of the pictures while my sisters ex was just a guest at the party so he‚Äôs only in like 3 of the pictures I have hanging up from the reception and they are group shots so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs just a picture of them together. 

My parents said I shouldn‚Äôt do anything and my husband agrees, I just don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings. Should I just take them down when she‚Äôs here to avoid a fight?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxh18r	2019-06-06 13:59:08		AITA for ghosting my boy crazy friend?	"Me and this girl were very close friends and spent nearly every day together. Before we got super close I had heard she was crazy but I didn't see that side of her till we got closer, and she seemed like a nice friend. I noticed she would get obsessive over guys if they didn't immediately respond to her, and everything she did seemed to revolve around whatever guy she was ""talking to"" at the time. When we first became friends she had just gone through a breakup so I figured it was just a phase and she would grow up. But I started seeing a pattern and it honestly really got on my nerves. For example she mostly would talk to them on Snapchat and constantly refresh the app to see if they had been active and keep track of their score on the app to see if they were ignoring her. If they ever did this she would freak out and go on a tangent about how no one likes her and she's not good enough. At first I would try to support her and be happy for her if she was talking to a new guy, but I always knew it wouldn't last long when they saw her crazy behavior so I started being short with her. She would say things like ""why can't you just be happy for me,"" and how I never am. The last straw was when she dated a guy for three weeks and he dumped her. She obviously wanted me to be there for her, but I pretty much ghosted her and left her feeling confused. She contacted my best friend wanting to know if she did something wrong, but I was just done with her. I feel kind of bad for doing this but I felt like a broken record constantly caught up in her relationship drama and wanted to get out. 

I wouldnt even care about this situation if it wasn't for the fact that we are living together in a few months for our junior year. AITA for doing this to my friend? Am I in the wrong for honestly just not giving a crap about her love life?"		1	0

bxgxu0	2019-06-06 13:49:33	ApprovalG	AITA for moving on and being upset at my ex?	"Warning r/foundthemobileuser ahead.

So I recently broke up with my gf and she wasn't the nicest to me. She was very honest but in a way the made it feel like she was attacking you to get her way plenty of other things she did too. Well im trying really hard to move on from her but she hasn't.

she's constantly sending me huge messages about stuff that I did to screw our relationship. I never really talked about my emotions that much (thanks mental health.) My mental health is something Im not honest about.  I wasn't there for her that much when she was upset because she would always turn it around onto me this applies for when I tired to tell her something is bothering me about something she is doing. Lying saying I was cheating, threatening to hit me that kind of stuff

So about 3 weeks ago I decided to break up with her. I couldn't keep going with what was happening. It was toxic. The thing was I never gave her a second chance. But here's the thing, over 6 times she threatened to break up with me. So when it was my turn I broke up with her. 

I've tried to move on as fast as I could. I don't want to think about her. I wrote a huge. I mean Huge message on why I broke up with her and then the starts saying stuff like why I broke up with her that I didn't even say.

 About 5 days past since we broke up and she went and had sex with her Ex, and is already on tinder texting other guys sending nudes. I have downloaded an app to make friends (not tinder) but not once have I sent nudes or tried anything with the people I have met. But she attacks me saying how fast I've moved on and how disappointed she is.

I have had my fair few spats about how she is acting and how she has moved on more than me. 

The point in asking is. Am I the asshole for being upset with how she's acting and moving on as fast as I could?

Edit. I haven't asked her to tell me the things she's told me. I don't want to talk to her that much just casual conversation here and there nothing more. And I have moved on as much as I could for the amount of time it has been. she still hasn't.

bxgx9s	2019-06-06 13:47:57	Lord-A-X	WIBTA for telling my step dad I don‚Äôt like him	"For some context I‚Äôve known my step dad my entire life, at one point I thought he was my blood dad as he was married to my mom,and around me since the day I was born. Now after finding out he wasn‚Äôt my biological dad that didn‚Äôt do much to make me dislike him because at this point him and my mom divorced. Then eventually they got remarried. Now the reason I don‚Äôt like my step dad is because he constantly bullies me,calls me names,belittles me etc. One time he needed to pay something off so he asked me for the money I said no so he stole all the money($900) from the safe I had and hasn‚Äôt payed it back that was over 3 years ago. Another thing he did was say I ‚Äúhacked‚Äù his phone then punched my TV and broke it(he did give me his TV so I forgave him for that) then stormed out of my room I locked my door because I was in fear he was going to kill me for something I hadn‚Äôt done then he broke my door open and asked if I was afraid(I was visibly shaking and had tears on my face) I said no out of fear he would do something to me. My step dad also would scratch my door to make my dogs bark in the middle of the night. He also constantly calls me names and treats me like I‚Äôm lesser(he claims this is his way of showing love to me) I have told him I feel verbally and emotionally abused by him and he says that‚Äôs not real and laughs it off. All these things have given me a deep dislike of him. So I ask would I be the asshole for telling him to his face I don‚Äôt like him and I don‚Äôt want to be around him. 

EDIT:My step dad also has ADHD so my hope is that by saying something to him it would make him realize he should take his medicine so he can be more calm/not such a jerk

EDIT 2:Instead of sating ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like you‚Äù to him I‚Äôll change it to I don‚Äôt like the person you are when you aren‚Äôt on medication and it has and continues to strain our relationship 



TLDR:My step dad has been around my entire life and while doing some nice things for me,he constantly makes me feel like shit through verbal harassment and what feels like emotional abuse sometimes."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxgx9q	2019-06-06 13:47:57	GoodPandas	AITA - Date Night gone wrong	 I live about an hour from the city, this girl who‚Äôs quite a bit younger but very attractive wanted to go out so I suggested (after she had bailed on me once before) that we meet up around 830, go for drinks then to the comedy cellar for a 930 show. I texted and called her a couple times during the day, knowing she was kinda flakey to confirm. These plans were very straightforward, not a lot of room for miscommunication. We would meet up at grand central station in nyc at 820, go smoke and to a bar then the show. Well I get there at 820, and she tells me she‚Äôs still at work (her first day) and she can‚Äôt talk. Meaning while I‚Äôm stuck wondering if this is show is happening at all since I can‚Äôt get a response from her. Around 845, I decided cut my loses and head home. I told her and she freaked, said we were always supposed to meet at 930 and that she had been looking forward all day to seeing me and blah blah. But after a long day and an hour train ride the last thing I wanted to do was stick around NYC for an hour by myself and wait til we met at the comedy club. btw I live an hour train ride away, so tbh, getting out of a comedy show and taking a midnight train home wasn‚Äôt super appealing anywAys. So I left, she freaked out, said I over reacted. I wasn‚Äôt necessarily mad though, I just wanted to cut my losses and go home. Not wait in humid ass NYC to go to a tiny comedy show where we can‚Äôt even talk. She lives in the city so the travel home is nothing to her, but after working all day, I just wanted to leave. My question is this: am I the asshole for leaving NYC and not going to the show after getting barely any response all day, then learning id be waiting an hour by myself, after we had already made plans to hang before the show?  Ps. This is the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm instagram famous‚Äù type girl - doesn‚Äôt like not getting her way, but she‚Äôs sweet and I do like her.

My brother is one of those kids who we knew was gay from the time he could walk and talk. It's really no big deal and it's just who he is. However there are 4 kids total (I'm the oldest, 10 years separates all of us, brother in question is youngest) and this brother is the absolute golden child of the family. He has been in all manner of trouble; things like stealing almost $20,000 from our grandparents, armed robbery, drugs, aggravated DUI and on and on. However my parents have bailed him out at every single turn. He is also incredibly arrogant on top of all this and I can barely tolerate him. My two middle sisters have been really guilted by my parents into always being there for my brother and I've definitely become something of a black sheep because I just can't deal with him. Now that he's ""clean"" (which I seriously question) the family has been expected to rally around him. He's living with my parents and I have been going over for Sunday dinner so I'm not avoiding him by any stretch. 

There is a huge pride event in Bisbee, AZ and my family is expecting all of us to pack up, drive for 4 hours share an Airbnb with 7 adults and 2 kids all so we can watch my brother be in a parade, in addition to just sort of being around for the entire weekend. In addition to everything I mentioned above, I've very agoraphobic and I just don't enjoy crowds. My parents know this about me and still are insisting I go. They and my sisters are really trying to guilt me into saying basically that Philos has been clean for almost a year now and if we don't support him then we don't know how bad the fall may be. 

Then I got this little gem via text from my brother last night:

> ""So I heard you weren't going to Bisbee with us, well I want you to know if there were a weekend for homophobic, introverted pieces of shit that hate their own family, I would go to support you. Piece of shit.""

**The Story:** Today my dad sent me a text while I was on the bus on my way to work, with an forwarded audio, and under it he said more or less ""I want you to hear it, it would make me very happy"". It was an audio of some person doing prayers and talking about Jesus.

He has many times tried to make me go back into cristianism, although usually he is very chill about me not being religious.

**Question:** WIBTA if I asked him not to send me those kinds of texts again? I know he means well and this is the first time he has done that, but I would not like it if he started sending me similar texts when Im abroad studying.

&#x200B;

Here is the story

I went out with some work friends last week. We are in a close group. You know how at work or school you have your close circle of friends, right? In our group it is me, two other guys, and a girl. We went to the bar and it was just me and the two guys (A and B). Our friend was on her way (C ). B tells me and the other guy some rumors about people at work. He heard this from a former coworker who was let go a few months ago. B told us that nothing he says leaves the table. He told us a bunch of good rumors, most seemed to be nonsense. One of the stories though involved our friend, C. It involved drugs at work w/ another colleague, but it was obviously not true. C did not know that this rumor/story existed. An hour and a few beers later, C arrives. We are all hanging out. I casually joke with C (right in front of B) about the story and I reveal the rumor about her. I wanted her to know because 1. It was a stupid funny rumor 2. In case our boss found out and wanted to use it against her, she would be prepared to defend it as fake news while being able to cite an unreliable source (dude who got fired months ago), and 3. She is part of our group and I assumed it was a protected secret. I also thought that since we are all close, B would have told C anyway if she was sitting there when he began telling it. The fact that it seems he would not have told his friend the bad rumors about her is a little messed up IMO, but anyway‚Ä¶  
 

Well here is where things get bad. C told our other coworker about this story since it also involved him. He got mad at the fired coworker because they used to be friends. Fired coworker yells at B for telling people, and B is now mad at me for telling the secret. He said, ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt supposed to leave the table‚Äù. I said I was sorry for the drama but I explained myself using the reasons stated above. Additionally, I did say it didn‚Äôt leave the table from my lips. C was the one who broke the group and told someone. In my mind, it was news about her so she had some leeway with whether to share it. So B is only mad at ME, not C. I don‚Äôt think he should be mad at anyone but he is legitimately really angry over it. Everyone in our group doesn‚Äôt think the blame should be on me or anyone really, and that it ultimately is not a big deal, but he is making it one. Again, I feel bad for telling her because it ended up started drama, but am I the asshole here or is my friend overreacting or misdirecting his anger at me?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bxgpnn	2019-06-06 13:26:37		AITA I just hit my girlfriend.	"Like I was saying, we were having an argument and she went too far. She made a comment along the lines of ""your loser father couldn't keep a relationship together and you can't either!"". When I was around 11, my parents got divorced and fought for custody. My dad wanted me and my brother because he genuinely loved us. My mom wanted us just to spite my dad. She won, and my dad kinda lost it over the decades.

This was too far for me. I had never, EVER hit a girl before, but it happened so fast I didn't even know I did it.

Basically, I cocked my fist back, and flew it straight into her nose. I thought it would be like the movies where she would get a little trickle of blood. It wasn't. Her nose EXPLODED. I think I must of broken a bunch of cartilage or something because blood shot out of both her nostrils, got all over me, got all over the floor. She staggered backwards, hit her head hard enough on the wall to leave a dent, and slumped down.

We were both stunned for about 10 seconds before she started crying hysterically and ran into my room and locked the door. So I went to wash my hands, and while I was in the bathroom I heard her run out of the house and take off in her car. That was about 5 hours ago so I guess she didn't go the cops or anything. So later I went home and broke down in tears.. My mom came in the room and when she heard about the story she got scared and said your moving with your auntie and uncle in bel air. I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and had dice in the mirror. If anything I can say this cab is rare But I thought 'Now forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'"		1	0

bxgogc	2019-06-06 13:23:16	KeithStone97	WIBTA For quitting my job and possibly screwing over my brother?	"
So, in February I started a new job. A factory job that my brother and uncle both work at. I started out in the lowest spot and a physically demanding position. But just a month ago I got a new position which is at the plant my brother works at and also happens to be possibly the easiest job there. 

I don‚Äôt know how much or even at all if my brother pulled some strings to get me there since he just became a supervisor there. The plant manager told me that they chose me because I could pick up using the computers quickly, which I can. So I think they chose me legitimately. 
 
Here comes the issue. A friend of mine just told me that the prison he works at is hiring a new class of workers, 25 total. And wants me to apply to work there with him. It would pay considerably more(around $7 more) and has equal if not better benefits (like retiring at an earlier age). It would also be a less physically demanding job and much cleaner. I would really like this because it would mean I would be able to start a family sooner, and support me and my gf more.
 
I really don‚Äôt want to screw my brother over if he stuck his neck out for me and helped me get a job but this new job would really be great for me. I feel like he would see where I‚Äôm coming from but sometimes he‚Äôs a bit of a wildcard. 

So would I be the asshole? Thanks. 

**Other info**: My girlfriend and I did just get a new house, so a higher paying job would help a lot with upgrades to the house. 
I would also be able to carpool with my friend at the new job. 

TLDR: My brother may or may not have helped me get a new and better position at my current job but a new job opened somewhere else that pays more and better benefits."	No A-holes here	0	0

So I've my thesis due in 6 weeks. I also have been looking for work for months with no luck.

My uncle got me into this popular restaurant and the owner told me he'd give me a TRIAL for the weekend - no guarantees of work once I'm done if he deems me not good enough. 
I cancelled my work experience for this chance at a job, with the idea they'd wait 3 days for me - today I got a call saying I could lose it as they need someone right away. The work experience would allow me to work on my thesis as it's only 4 days a week for 5 hours, whilst a full time job wouldn't, but I need the money for a variety of reasons, but I also need my degree as I failed last year and if I don't get it this year I will have no degree. 

The owner of the job hasn't called me either, yet. Which could mean I got screwed over but still (I had told the WE that this was a guaranteed job). I don't know where to go, if I'm a massive arse for telling this man I'd do the trial - then say no if he calls. Also for saying I have to work the weekend to the people counting on me for work experience and then telling them ""hey, I can work"".

I feel like an arse, because my uncle did me a massive favour and now I feel like I'm screwing this up, but I'm not sure about wanting to ruin something that might get me a job in the future nor am I sure about ruining a chance at a job right now."	Not the A-hole	0	0

When I responded to the post *actually* being empathetic towards that group of people and just gave her a different, less hateful perspective, she flipped out on me and ignored me when I told her she was being closed-minded.

And if your behaviors don't align with whatever perspective you're claiming to have, you are definitely not woke. Actions speak louder.""

So I called her out on all of it publicly. I pointed out that first, she couldn't think of anything original so she had to steal what I'd written a day before her, and that she was a huge hypocrite and wasn't actually woke because she used it as a ploy to get attention.

My younger brother is 20. He never managed to make it into college and got no GCSE‚Äôs. He always gets fired from his jobs and spends all day sleeping and playing xbox. But he still thinks he‚Äôs fine and always has *plans* for what he wants to do but there just not possible because of how he did educationally. The problem is that it‚Äôs not for any reason other than he just doesn‚Äôt make an effort. 

So the other day when I was at home with my parents and we were talking and at least where I from in the north of England you always have like a jokey relationship with family. Like always joking around and ripping into each other. So a conversation came about and I can‚Äôt remember what fully was said but my brother says to me ‚Äúyeh but you only go *my university*‚Äù (don‚Äôt wanna say it‚Äôs name here) to which I replied jokingly ‚Äúat least I got GCSE‚Äôs and got in you‚Äôre sat around doing nothing all day* would like to point out it‚Äôs not the first times he‚Äôs belittled about my university or what I do for a job.

My brother got angry about this and started shouting calling me words that are common in England but I know Americans don‚Äôt like the word so won‚Äôt put here. He then stormed out of the room. My parents got annoyed at me and said I should be more careful about what I say about all of it. But I can‚Äôt see what I did wrong.

bxgm6w	2019-06-06 13:16:56	Banterous__	AITA For getting pissed at my ex?	"Last night my ex called me asking if I could do her a favor. I'm pretty handy on Photoshop and she was wondering if I can make a business card for her. Under most circumstances I'd be completely fine with that, however in the last month she hasn't talked to me whatsoever except when she needs something from me.

I called her later that night to tell her that I feel like she's using me, and that I didn't really feel respected. She told me that it's still really hard for her to talk to me (it's been about a month since we broke up on good terms) and this is the only way she knows how to talk to me. I didn't accept that and I got really angry because I felt like if she was able to ask me to do stuff for her she would also be able to ask me how my day is going.

Honestly I don't really know if I'm the asshole here or not, so any take or opinion on this would be really nice :) I can also add more information if anyone needs it.

Edit: people are asking about the Photoshop project, I finished the design about a month ago and she said she didn't like it and that she was going to get another designer which I was fine with. I'm more just brought it up because I feel like it's one of them anything that she's asked me to do since then."	Asshole	0	0

bxgkn6	2019-06-06 13:12:47	thysen1402	AITA for misunderstanding the signals?	"Hi together, I have met a girl from tinder and we got a really good start, where we did have quite similar interests and got along pretty well.

We had after that a few other dates, that all went pretty well and we ended up having sex on the 4th date.

A few days after that I asked her if she had time on the weekend, which she declined, so I proposed the weekend after to spend some more time together that is not just the evening.

She declined there too with a generic excuse, it felt like she didnt want to see me again.

So I said that it was okay and didnt respond after, to give her space if she needed and thought that she would reach out if she still wanted to have contact.

I wrote her after 1 1/2 months, she answered and we met again in a bar and talked for a few hours, where she asked me why I didnt text her anymore, so I explained that I thought she was done with me.

During that time we were cuddling a lot and were in a good mood, in the end I dropped her off at home and got a kiss.

We met again in that week and she told me that she could not have any commitment and could not get attached to a person right now.

Which i totally understood, as I am planning to leave the country in 3-4 months, but we were still sitting on a bench and very close together.

She wanted to stay friends, to which I reacted more skeptical.

I was feeling a bit down, but the next morning I got a text from her, asking how I was and starting a longer text conversation.

We were writing again frequently and got along pretty good again.

So we planned another day to meet and we planned to go to a bar and after that maybe watch a movie.

It was raining so she decided to come to my place directly.

As we sat down and watched a movie I started cuddling again with her, as I was used to it from before.

So some when i started touching her boobs, to which she did not say anything or moved away or pushed my hand away or did anything.

She still kept a normal conversation with me, but was not actively cuddling back.

Some when she said that she would need to leave soon, to what i brought her home.

Later the evening I received a text from her, that she did not like that I touched her, as she just wanted to stay friends, but she did not know how to say anything in the moment.

For me some glass shattered as I had interpreted the previous occurrences as she could not get into a relationship but still wanted to keep it going.

I apologized to her saying that I had interpreted the signs wrong and that I would have wished that she said something before to signalize it to me.

She said then that she didnt want to make me feel awkward in the situation.

I apologized again and told her that we should take a break in having contact.

I feel terrible and I had serious problems falling asleep following her message.

bxgj9s	2019-06-06 13:08:54	Ocean_Spice	AITA for giving a guy a fake number and then pretending I had to leave?	This happened the other day. I had to return a shirt at my local mall, usually while I‚Äôm out alone I listen to music or a podcast or something with one earbud in so I can still hear what‚Äôs going on around me. (This being important because it showed my phone was on.) I had returned the shirt and am walking back to the escalator to go down to the first level again and this guy starts hollering in my direction. I stop and take out the other earbud to see what‚Äôs going on, he comes up and says he likes my tattoo and that I‚Äôm pretty and stuff. So I say thanks and go to put my earbud back in, but I notice as I start walking away again that he begins to follow me. I keep the earbud out and kind of pause at this point because I don‚Äôt really know what to do. And then this guy, who doesn‚Äôt know me at all and has only said like ten words to me and gotten one back in response, asks for my number and says he‚Äôd love to ‚Äúkeep talking.‚Äù And I don‚Äôt really know what to do with this either because despite being in a public place, I‚Äôm getting creeped out and don‚Äôt want him to react badly if I say no, so I give him a fake number. He immediately tries calling it, obviously my phone doesn‚Äôt ring so I say my battery had been low and it must‚Äôve died while he was talking to me. He says he‚Äôll text me and to call him sometime, I say that I will and ask him if he could tell me what time it was because I had to be somewhere. I didn‚Äôt, obviously, I just wanted to get out of the situation. I left the mall immediately after because I didn‚Äôt want to run into him again. I told a friend what happened though and he said I was rude to the guy who likely did just want to ask me out or something, so now I‚Äôm wondering if it actually was fishy or if I was just paranoid and rude because of it?

bxgick	2019-06-06 13:06:13	Rexblade99	AITA for hyping a girl up to try something while wanting her to fail.	"So a female friend of mine who I have some feelings for and I (both very early 20s and single) were talking early this morning about an ex gf hitting me up for what was going to be a very fun weekend.  We pro conned through it and she talked me out of going for it.  

I made a joke about her oweing me a weekend of fun and she hit a slightly more serious note for talking about for real relationships.  She needed a confidence boost so I started hyping her up and getting her a real head of steam, until eventually the question of if she was into a specific person had to be asked.  

So she is and it was a dude she has never meant and knows nothing about other than she works across from him at work.  So I gave the best advice I could,  just ask him out to something like a cup of coffee and see if she likes him as a person rather than lust from afar.  And I continued to hype her up until she was confident enough to say she was gonna try today.

So now I am keeping my friend confident enough to try and ask out someone they have a crush on, while still wanting not for her to fail or be unhappy.  I still ultimately don't want her in a relationship with someone else for selfish reasons.

Two of my buddies have weighed in that I am an idiot, and the other believes I'm too altruistic, which sparked a long debate on if what I did could be considered selfish acts.

TL DR: AITA for encouraging a person to try asking someone out while hoping the end is her not ultimately end in a relationship because I have feeling for her.

Edit: clarification, I am not doing anything malicious to her possible relationship, and I am trying to help her as much as I can.  My question is more so am I shitty for being jealous and feeling like ""I wish this just wouldn't happen"" while not taking steps to prevent it."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxgi8b	2019-06-06 13:05:55	UsedToSuckDick4Coke	AITA For Misinterpreting a Bar Tender's Actions Towards Me?	"This happened about 5 years ago, but it still sticks with me because of one person's reaction.  I'll try to keep it as brief as possible.  I went out with a group of friends to a bar in downtown Los Angeles.  We get inside, and while some of them go looking for a table I quickly head to the bar to grab a drink as I want to catch up with everyone else as they had been pre-gaming.  The bar tender (who I'll admit was a VERY attractive woman) takes my order, and when she brings me my drink tells me she loves my cologne and asks me what brand it is.  I told her it was Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male (the one that comes in a bottle shaped like a male torso).  I take my drink, go over to the table the group has found, and start drinking.  

&#x200B;

About an hour and a half later I get up to go to the bathroom (I've had about 3 drinks at this point).  On the way back I stop at the bar for another drink.  The same bar tender comes over to help me, I tell her what I want, but before she makes the drink she hands me a bottle of water (""on the house"" as she puts it) and a pen & paper.  I'm a bit stunned about the pen & paper so I ask her what they're for and she says ""oh, you know what I want"", and then walks away to make the drink.  I have absolutely no idea what ""oh, you know what I want"" means, but since she had been acting pretty flirty with me, and had straight up handed me a pen and paper, I figured she wanted my phone number.  I write my name and number on the paper, and when she comes back I hand it to her.  She takes a look at it and says  ""oh no, I wanted the name of your cologne.""  Pretty embarrassed, I apologize, take the paper back, and write the name of the cologne.  

&#x200B;

I then take my drink, go back to the table, and then tell my buddy about the embarrassment I just suffered.  His girlfriend and her female friend that they had brought along immediately start berating me, telling me that I shouldn't have hit on her like that, that I probably made her really, really uncomfortable, and that I should never hit on bar tenders or waitresses.  My response was that I wasn't hitting on her at all, I wasn't spitting game, and I friggin ASKED her what she wanted me to write down and SHE responded with that weird, cryptic answer. 

&#x200B;

 I am well aware that in many service industry jobs, the employees, ESPECIALLY female employees, are expected, or even required to flirt with the customers.  I've been to Hooters, I've been to Vegas, I know how the whole thing works.  But I had NEVER had one of them hand me a pen & paper completely unsolicited, let alone give an answer like this bar tender did regarding what she wanted.  I don't think I'm the asshole at all for misinterpreting her intentions given the way things went down, but I figured I would ask this sub.  So, AITA or not?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxghzn	2019-06-06 13:05:13	GilmoreMonster07	AITA for not telling my siblings their mother is dead	"My mother passed a little over a year ago....it was fairly quick and we were in shock. For years before, she had always made me promise not to tell her other children (plus her side of the family beyond a couple people) she died since they had chosen not to be around for various reasons. The three siblings in question had all chosen to stop speaking to her and since I took her side, cut me off as well. Realistically I could only get in contact with one of them easily (have one's phone number, did have another's address), but I feel he would tell the others. For some additional info, my sister is a bit psycho - as in pulling her own hair out, completely believes things she has made up in her mind - and I don't know what she would do to try to annoy/torture me or my stepdad afterwards.

For a year I have kept this secret and while I feel guilty for not telling them, I keep remembering the promise I made to my mother. But with this said, I know how upset I got when no one chose to tell me for several years after my biological dad died.

Our school works on project-based learning principle so curruculum development is really important. Moreover, in a year or so I am supposed to take over a higher years english department together with her as another teacher is retiring. So far, the soon-to-be retiring teacher has taught me many things about running the department while my colleague/friend was absent (for various reasons). She often misses gatherings, does not answer her emails and if she hands in work, it is always after a deadline. She also does not ask any questions so multiple issues regarding tests and grade averages have arisen within the department due to her behavior. 
 I also follow a course with her at a uni and today we were supposed to do a group presentation to which she did not show up. I snapped and basically angry texted her all my pent up frustration. We had a fight, during which she then told me that she has an autoimmune disease and she needs to undergo surgery soon and it is having financial strain on her life as well. I was shocked! I only knew she suffered from mild depression and gluten allergy. I had no idea and now basically I am doubting between whether IATA or am I being gaslighted by her?

bxgh36	2019-06-06 13:02:44	carbonised	WIBTA for not accomidating for my MIL at our wedding?	"My SO and I have been engaged for a while and we decided to set a date. It's over a year away and deliberately the week after school summer holidays midweek so It's quieter. The area we're getting married in is incredibly busy in peak times and my SO would hate any attention.

&#x200B;

We picked this date, asked our parents if it was an issue to speak up. No issues so we went ahead and booked. Fast forward a week and we get a message asking if we could move the wedding to within the school holidays to make it easier for the MIL who works in admin at a school. Speaking with my partner our instant reactions were ""absolutely not."" It's not the wedding we want. 

We explained this and got a reply asking to move it to the Friday a week later. We both winced a bit and i put forward that Friday lunchtimes are also likely to be busier and it's not what we'd really want.

Her dad replied again and asked if we could move it it would really help them.

I know my MIL is very unhappy in her work and probably doesn't want to stick her head above the parapet so hasn't asked for time off but i feel like your daughters wedding should be an exception, regardless of workplace rules/politics.

Of course if the choice was move the date or her Mum can't be there we'd move the date but i also feel like it's an unfair request, there was an opportunity to raise an issue, a small (<15 people) quiet wedding is what we both want more than anything.

We've also had offers from her dad to pay for the wedding and my Mum to pay for the honeymoon, neither of which we expected and my Mum's was given with the sole request of ""Do whatever you both please"" To the extent she didn't even expect an invite if we wanted to alope.

bxgfj0	2019-06-06 12:58:24	PandaKing185	WIBTA if I don't return $45 to McDonald's after a mistake in tendering my money?	"So I have this $20 bill that has this cool old design as it's the previous design from the 80's I believe. Then this morning I pull up to McDonald's, get a couple items, totalling to $5.01. I pull up to the window and give the lady my cool $20 bill and one penny, she holds it up to the light which I understood as it looks weird and I figured she's making sure it's legit. She puts it under the cash drawer, gives me my change back, I get my food and leave in a hurry (I was late to work.) 

As I'm driving trying to put the cash in my wallet I notice she gave me 2 $20 bills and a $5 bill. For a moment I was incredibly confused wondering if I just took money out of my wallet some how, I check the receipt and low and behold it says I paid with a $50. Now I was seriously about to turn around and go give the money back thinking this worker is probably freaking out realizing she just gave me $25 more than I was supposed to. But after some thinking I realized 

1. This girl probably didn't even notice as she put the the bill under the tray 
2. She probably won't get in trouble as I have worked in the food industry and they'll see she tendered a $50 and there's only a $20 under the drawer, most she'll get is a stern talking-to because mistakes happen and she clearly wasn't stealing the money 
3. McDonald's is a multi-million dollar company, this is a McDonald's I go to all the time and they have probably made hundreds of dollars off me alone, so what if I get $25 back.

So if I don't go back later today WIBTA?

EDIT: To the people saying this could be the one mistake that breaks it for her and leads to her getting fired, wouldn't me showing up and giving the money back not draw attention to the transaction that she messed up on? Would she not get in trouble whether I bring it back or not?  I feel not giving it back keeps the blame off one person, if I bring it back they know exactly who messed up. They're not going to let her off just because I brought it back, if she messed up she messed up.

EDIT2: I appreciate all the feedback and the many points I didn't take into account, I'll let you know what the verdict is when I get off work.

EDIT3: Even though my coworkers agree that there's no harm in keeping it, I've decided to take it back on my lunch break to try and get there while the cashier is still there. Y'all are ruthless but I appreciate it the feedback and the many points I didn't think of. I'll let you know how it goes.

FINAL EDIT: Well instead of going to return it on my lunch break, I instead had to call the bank for a charge that was disputed yesterday and after they agreed I shouldn't have received it, it was posted to my account today. I called and they said they couldn't refund more than one false charge a year. WTF?! So yeah I didn't get to return it because of the stupid bank, and I'm not going to. This lady probably didn't get in trouble and if she did for this happening multiple times, maybe she shouldn't be a cashier if she can't count money.  And to those saying ""but good karma!"" Well I just got fucked out of over $30 so I'll take that as karma paying me back."	Asshole	0	0

I left my phone to charge on the other side of the room. While I was stacking chairs (end of club) I reach for my phone and it's gone. The only people left in the room were me, my friends, the culprit (Anne) and two teachers.

Thinking it's a joke (it normally is) I immediately turn to the usual culprit and say ""where's me phone"" and get the usual 'I don't have it'. I keep pestering them and ask them all individually **3 times** ""where is my phone"" and they all say they don't have it.

I'm getting worried and start panicking. My travel card is with the phone (I literally just got a replacement yesterday I lost my other one- I paid for it out of my savings) and if I lose it (the phone), i don't get another (unlike the culprit, I don't get everything bought for me by my parents), and I'll be in super super big trouble.

The teachers don't do anything because we ""the well known jokey bunch"" and ask us to sort it out in another room- that's fair.

My friends start walking away to their next lesson and I'm still asking 'where's my phone' (**i am visibly distressed at this point, it's very obvious**). They all start laughing at me (I assume that they all assume each other has the phone, I don't blame them- that's normally the case).

I go back to the room try to find it, and Anne walks in laughing saying ""omg here's our phone haha"" **AND I ABSOLUTELY LOSE IT**

I start shouting and yelling at her saying it's to cool to lie, and that's she's an asshole and stuff. She claps back saying ""take a joke"" and ""you're so rude"" and get shouty at me for shouting her because apparently ""respect your elders and chill out"". 

She thinks I have no right to be annoyed at her, that I'm too sensitive, can't take a joke, and I'm super rude. She has since blocked me on messages. She thinks that I'm shouting at her for no reason and she's telling me ""don't start shouting at me you have no right to shout at me""

A few people have told me that I'm an asshole for shouting at her for ""no reason"" and not accepting her feeble apology, by I think otherwise 

AITA?

*Edit: a few phrases Anne used when she messaged me:*

*""Don't start shouting at me like I've done anything wrong""*

*""You have your phone nothings happened to it""*

*""You're lucky I didn't have a big go at you for shouting"" (Anne is literally 6 months older than me)*

*""You're just too much to handle""*

*""You're lucky I didn't get angry at you""*

*""You don't have the right, Don't ever skit at me""*

*My responses were super blunt and sarcastic if I'm honest. Things like 'oh wow, yep that makes perfect sense!', which might be kinda pushing it I'm not sure*

**Edit 2: now she's saying that 'if it had been anyone else this wouldn't be your reaction'. The people in the group who I'm closer too have seen how made I can get and I've gotten into an argument with all of them at least once over the past 2 years**"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxgd2y	2019-06-06 12:51:01	FoolishAdvisor	"WIBTA if I stayed quiet about a ""stolen"" longboard?"	"For context I work at a supermarket at night. Naturally we get a bunch of deliveries in the morning and of we have a lot of waste that comes out of the store daily.

One night I opened up the doors for a delivery and one of the delivery guys asked me if the longboard by the dumpster belonged to anyone and if he could take it. I was kinda confused what he was talking about because we don't sell longboards, so I go and take a look. The board was in decent condition and didn't look like it belonged in the trash but there's a bunch of other stores around and it's possible that someone left it here on a whim. I told him I'd ask around the store to see if it belonged to anyone.

Over the next couple of days I asked a few people around if they knew whose longboard was out back. Nobody even knew there was a board there. After a couple of days the driver came back around and asked about the board again. I said he could take it because nobody seemed to know whose it was so it was probably abandoned for some reason.

That day after my shift I get a message from my line manager asking me if I said someone could take a longboard out back because a driver stole it and is claiming I said he could take it. Shit... I said that I did and the driver was not at fault, the blame should fall on me. Apparently the board belonged to a guy who worked in the coffee shop that's connected to the front of the store, which is why nobody I asked knew about it since he works in the day and we don't really interact with staff there. Why he chose to keep the board on our side when the coffee shop has its own waste area next to it or why he was storing it by the trash is beyond me.

Anyway my line manager told me that a day manager was told about it and he saw the delivery driver take the board on camera and called the company he works for. When the driver arrived again in the morning he brought the board back and said that his boss doesn't believe that he was told he could take it and he could lose his job, so I used my line manager's email and sent a message to the driver's boss to let him know that it was a mistake and that I was to blame here. He thanked me but said they would handle it internally now which didn't really sound good for the driver. I had gotten his details so I called him to let him know that I would help him out with proving his innocence if he needed it.

The next shift my line manager told me to stay quiet about it all because the store manager doesn't believe the driver either and that I could get into a lot of trouble over this with him. I'm still on probation as I've only been working here for a couple of months. I'm really worried that I could lose my job if it escalates beyond this. The board is back but it seems that the driver might still be in trouble. I'm considering keeping to myself and letting what happens to the driver, happen but I'd honestly feel terrible about it.

bxgct6	2019-06-06 12:50:09		WIBTA for throwing away ex's belongings?	"I found out my (then) girlfriend was cheating on me last Tuesday. She went to her hometown for the Summer and was planning to come back at the end of August for school and at that point we were going to rent somewhere together. She created a tinder account almost as soon as she arrived home at the start of May, and I found some messages proving that she was actively trying to date another female.

&#x200B;

There's some other messy stuff involved but that's not the point of this post.

&#x200B;

I am obviously crushed and she has not so much as even acknowledge my existence since I called her out on it (gone totally ghost on me). So I messaged her on Sunday and told her that I want all of her belongings that she had stored in my garage to be gone by the 19th. Belongings include typical dorm appliances, decoration,clothing, and accessories.

&#x200B;

So WIBTA for throwing away all of her things even if she doesn't read my message? It's not like I'm giving her an impossible task either, she has family members here that could pick the stuff up (I don't have their names or numbers or I would have already dropped it off to them)."

I have a friend that I've known for about a year now. She loves the sea and she loves to swim. I, on the other hand, hate being in a bathing suit and I can barely tolerate heat. I love staying inside where I don't feel like I'll have a heart attack.

We live in different cities, but we go to the same school. We obviously don't have school during the summer, so she suggested we do some summer activities. Like swimming. I said that I don't want to go, and she said that she knows, but thought I would change my mind.

Then I told her:
""I'll probably go swimming, I just don't want to go with you."" (I never go swimming with any my friends). 

She's ignoring my texts now (I explained that I have never gone to the pool with a friend). 

Was that a harsh thing to say? Should I apologize? Or should I go, just to get it over with?

I still absolutely do not want to go, I just want to know if I was being rude for expressing my feelings."		1	0

"I am a male sophomore college student in a heavily female dominated degree program. Actually, I am the only male in sophomore year. On a few occasions, one of my classmates has hosted a party that all or almost all of us in sophomore year have gone to (some movie nights, a barbecue, etc). A few days ago, one of my closest friends in my program, Lauren, told me that Andrea, another girl in our year was having a party and I should come. So I said sure. Well, I arrive at Andrea's place and to my shock, it turns out that this is a party where a woman has come in to sell sex toys. I was a bit shocked to say the least, as I was not told this was the case. The saleswoman, Andrea and a few other classmates seemed a bit, well, unhappy to see me there. But I did not want to make things awkward and just walk out. So I sat there for 15 minutes or so while the woman talked about the products but at that point, I was feeling a bit nauseous and made an excuse about forgetting an assignment for my elective class that I had to go finish and left.

The thing is, I'm 20 and still a virgin, so being involved in something sexual that is so public is very awkward for me. I've also never discussed anything romantic with my classmates beyond ""I've been single for a long time."" Honestly, I couldn't stay without feeling nauseous about it all. I felt really blindsided. To be clear, I have no problems with my classmates buying or using sex toys if they choose to, but I just did not want to be involved.

So, I'm wondering AITA for either not immediately leaving or leaving suddenly? Do I owe anyone an apology here or does anyone owe me an apology? Also, AITA for feeling left out, in the sense that a party was being held for all my classmates... except for me?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I even follow tons of women, usually sex workers, on Twitter just so I can see hot girls as I'm passing through social media. 

This never leads to cheating or even thinking about it. It's more of just that I find people attractive and the human body attractive.

I spend a lot of time doing this, looking through those Twitter accounts and checking out attractive women.

Context: I (35M) definitely feel women hold the control of relationships today. It‚Äôs not a dig, just how I see it. I‚Äôve had more female bosses than male bosses at work. I‚Äôve liked them better, too! I was raised by three strong women who are independent and caring. I love yinz but sometimes I just don‚Äôt completely understand situations or viewpoints.

To me, modern feminism is essentially anti-masculinity and extremely pro-choice. 

Perhaps this is because I‚Äôm silently pro-life and it‚Äôs something that drives my vote because of its importance to me religiously. I will never comprehend how a woman and man receive a gift from God and her unfortunate decision is to kill that life. I believe life begins at conception.

Rick - the boyfriend who got cheated on
Ally - the girlfriend who cheated 

Rick and Ally are acquaintances of mine I met through my bf. They have been dating for 3 years now and in the second half of that time started to do a good amount of long distance as Rick started traveling for work and is only home a few weeks a year. Ally at one point did travel for work for a year as well. 

Cause of this I heard they were experiencing a rocky period trying to manage seeing each other while being physically apart for long durations. While on that one year work trip Ally cheated and had sex with somebody at least once (as far as I know).

Now their rocky patch is over. They‚Äôre getting a house together and seem happier and better adjusted to their work schedules. But Ally never confessed to Rick. Rick doesn‚Äôt know she had sex with another guy even though Ally‚Äôs friends know. Yo, even I know and I‚Äôm not even friends with either of them. 

I get that it‚Äôs none of my business. I forgot about this whole thing when my bf told me because I don‚Äôt even hangout with either of them. The reason I thought about it again and am asking now is because lately Ally posts photos of them together on Instagram (lovely dovey stuff) and I heard they‚Äôre getting a house together and it just rubbed me off the wrong way. 

I guess if it was me I would 100% appreciate it if even a total stranger told me my bf cheated. At least then the future direction of the relationship wouldn‚Äôt be built over this gaping hole. But that‚Äôs just my perspective. My bf tells me not to because it‚Äôs not my business.

Okay, so here‚Äôs the story. When my husband was younger (teen years), he didn‚Äôt have the best of friends. They all partied all the time, smoked, did cocaine, drank to oblivion, etc. He hasn‚Äôt talked to those guys since we‚Äôve been together (about 6 years). Recently he started talking to one of them again and my husband has been talking about making plans and hanging out with all of them again. I know for a fact that none of them have really changed their ways because we still have mutual friends we keep in touch with. My husband and I just recently had our first child, a beautiful baby boy, and it just makes me so nervous that he wants to put himself into that environment again. I trust him to not do anything but it still scares me. What if they get in a car accident? DUI? Get arrest because his friends are stupid and are carrying weed and coke on them? I don‚Äôt want our family ruined because of something stupid his friends did.

8 months ago a friend wanted to buy a MacBook but couldn‚Äôt really afford one. I have an old MacBook from 2013 I wasn‚Äôt using so I offered to lend it to her for a couple of weeks. She wanted to buy it and we agreed on a figure of $400. However I didn‚Äôt feel the need to collect the money from her, and was happy for her to continue using it and pay me when convenient for her. We left it at that.

Recently she messaged me because the laptop‚Äôs battery is no longer working and she needs to take it to the Genius Bar. She asked if it would be ok for her to take it in and get a replacement, (which I‚Äôve got no worries with) but asked if this could also lead to a discount from the $400 figure. 

I feel uncomfortable with being asked this, as I have basically let her use it for free for 8 months and been pretty flexible around payment. To be really honest, I wouldn‚Äôt even mind if she just kept using it and never paid me, because I wasn‚Äôt using the MacBook anyway. It‚Äôs just the way she hinted that the battery issue was somehow a fault and therefore there should be a discount that made me feel annoyed. When I gave it to her I was pretty clear that this is an old laptop anyway, and if she had paid me $400 on the spot, she wouldn‚Äôt come up to me 8 months later and ask me to pay for repairs, right?

bxfu61	2019-06-06 11:53:12		AITA for losing weight?	"So i've been agoraphobic for about seven years, and my weight *ballooned* because of it. Too much chocolate, too much junk food, sedentary lifestyle, you know how it goes. Considering i'm only short (5'2""), I tend to carry my weight fairly obviously, especially around my middle. That being said, i've never been more than a UK size 18 and a lot of that is a preference for baggier clothing. 

My sister in law is a BIG girl. She's easily a size 20,22 plus. Even at my biggest, she's always been bigger. 

Now, SIL went through a bit of a health kick. I was pleased for her. she started going to the gym, started eating healthier. Her facebook and instagram feed was full of green and leafy meal prep or artfully posed protein shakes. That's all good! I was pleased for her! 

The problem came when she came to get rid of her clothes. 

Remember what i said about our size differences? She decided to give ME her old clothes. Her clothes were all far too big for me, considering she already outstripped me . I received this suitcase full of clothes with the statement ""I was just going to throw these in the trash otherwise"". Now, I might be a socially awkward fatass, but i'm also proud. When my SIL sends me clothes that she deemed fit for trash and not a charity store donation, clothes that were easily two, three sizes too big for me at my biggest state...what was i to do with this? It might have been nothing, or a clumsy but well-intentioned gesture, But I saw red. 

Now, we're all going on holiday together soon. As soon as christmas had gone, I got to work. Put myself on a very low calorie diet. Meal replacements, low carbs, the works. I took up running, I took up yoga. In the meantime, SIL decided to give up on her health kick. She has two kids, and had a whole load of real-life stress too. I'm not blaming her....but I kept at mine, and i've not put a damn thing on facebook or Instagram about it. I've not made some massive show about what im doing like she did. 

I've worked my ass off for it. I've gone from 12 stone to 9.5 stone in five months. I've still got fat to lose but i'm now in my healthy weight bracket, my BMI is good. I can jog now without getting totally out of breath and I recently bought my first swimsuit since I was about 15. I've even got a tan again.  Every time the family get together, everyone has remarked on how much weight i've lost. Sure, i've got some of the whole...loose skin thing, but it's worth it. 

 My Mom had bought me a lot of summer clothes too, because I'm unemployed and she didn't want me trudging around the hotel in my baggy jeans and now *massively* oversized shirts. However, the weight loss meant that most of what she'd bought would no longer fit me...  Still, it was a size 18, my previous size, so she gave it to SIL, since SIL gave me all her old clothes, surely, they must fit her now!

I had a good friend in class, m, and he was always joking around with me since we sat next to each other. Sometimes his jokes were insulting but i let it pass. i thought that after a few months me and him were friends. I thought he felt that way too. I was erasing the board one day during recess and i saw him standing there and i gently slapped him with the eraser just to get the chalk on his face. He kept yelling at me asking what position i was to do that. I myself was quite shocked since he had always been the playful type to do those kinds of things with me. I got to admitted i was scared. Im a girl and I wanted to talk to him about what happened but i couldn‚Äôt. After a week he started talking to me again as if nothing had happened. Fast forward, We have a class project where he need to perform a dance, so of course there will be people dancing, making props, organizing the event, and people playing the instruments. M was in the IG while i was in the PG. He had to practice outside with the others expect PG. At the 2nd period he comes barging into the room yelling how OE‚Äôs were stupid, they were doing everything wrong, etc. Of course I just didn‚Äôt say anything since nothing comes out from fighting, so i decided to bystand. At 3rd period m is still on his iPad. I was my part in props and we were pretty much done for the day, so I was too. In comes this other IG who starts doing the same thing m did, and m just supports him and starts yelling about things i don‚Äôt want to even mention. So far everyone in PG was mad since they kept on doing this, and I‚Äôm not the type to stay quiet. I said, ‚Äúour peers are students too, they‚Äôre having a hard time too‚Äù but that was enough to make him go MAD. He started yelling and so did the other guy, no one in my class was standing up for me.I was so embarrassed though and he kept saying I didn‚Äôt do anything and he was working so hard while i just played on my ipad. I told him he was doing the same thing, and then he told me to go outside and go watch what he was doing. That was like an invitation to a fight. After that i realized just ignoring him would be the best way to make him be quiet. So i ignored him and he finally left the room. I felt like crying. A few minutes later his nice IG guy came in and explained what was going on with m. He said how DG were off beat while m was on the correct beat and they kept blaming it on m as to why the dance was a mess. I didnt know. I feel kinda bad but he made me feel hated by more ppl. He then acted as if nothing happened the next day, and tried to be friendly.	Everyone Sucks	1	0

My supervisors and my coworkers are such excellent people- it's the best work environment I've ever experienced. However, it's become apparent the company is a little too lenient on insurance fraud. Basically, we have a productivity that we have to hit. All you need to verify that you were with a client at a given time is their signature. And, since many of them are significantly mentally ill, they are unaware or uninterested in the times you've written on the form. Basically, you get fired if you don't make productivity or you get fired for committing insurance fraud. The turnover rate is unbelievable. Out of 9 people in my department, I know of 4 of us looking for work. 

So I started secretly applying and good luck hit me. A place I interviewed in the past at reached out and invited me for an interview- I got the job!! Huge pay raise and in my field of Geri psych. How could I say no. 

The catch is; they need me to start in 13 days. I can't give a two weeks notice. So I chose to give a one week's notice and just slide for a long weekend. 

My supervisor was upset. She said I would not be eligible for rehire (lol, bummer) nor could she write me a reference. The thing is, though, I have a copy of my 90 day report- which is a glowing recommendation.  So I have that locked down. 

It feels like an A move because I love my clients but...I don't want to postpone my start date.

"Long story short, I asked a question on r/CreditCards [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/bx728f/do_my_annual_fees_still_get_waived_when_i_get_out/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;amp;utm_term=control_2) to see if I still get my annual fees waived when I leave the military. 

That led to someone saying they don‚Äôt see why service members get that benefit in the first place. [Full response to my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/bx728f/do_my_annual_fees_still_get_waived_when_i_get_out/eq4rnhm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2) 

Which got me thinking about one time where I got a free upgrade to first class and a female passenger didn‚Äôt feel like I deserved it. (The flight was about 50% full and had empty first class seats.) There‚Äôs been other times where I‚Äôve gotten discounts and free items just because I was in the military and gotten responses with people that were in somewhat of a disagreement about me getting them. 

I do see their point of view because we already get a lot of benefits, but can‚Äôt civilians do the same thing? For example they can literally just go to any of the U.S. military branches and get a non combat mos (job) like admin or musician, and get the same benefits. They can even take college classes and have there respective branch pay for it once they hit their 2yr mark and when they get out after 4 yrs they can use their GI Bill. They literally can get their school paid for two different ways. So I honestly don‚Äôt see why people get their feelings hurt when service members get special treatment."		1	0

I will try to stay neutral in this post.

My aunt used to be married to a real gentleman.
She wanted to have kids, but he was sterile.

They divorced later in life, and everyone in my family was devastated. She was too but she had to live with it. 

A year or two passed, she found a guy in her office. He was handsome and a """"nice guy"""".
They got married the same year.

A few months later, she came home to my grand father with bruises and a purple eye WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT.

This really grinded my grandfather's gears. He went to his family and started a fight. From that time my grandfather have not talked to them again. The baby was born fine, but my aunt was not.

She thought about divorcing him, but that manipulative motherfucking bitch tricked her back into his trap.

She now gets beaten alot and is rarely visiting us, and she isn't thinking about divorce

So, AITA

Edit: Whenever I am talking about not talking to my aunt, I mean that I CAN'T talk to her because I rarely see her.

bxfl11	2019-06-06 11:23:28	Pigeoncake1	WIBTA if I tell friend's(F27) family is soliciting with a minor(M13) who is 2nd cousin?	"Right, first time posting, long post, native English speaker etc Also the 2nd cousin is her 2nd cousin, I am not related by blood to either.

So I (F26) have a friend(F27) who is needlessly insecure, whether it is in looks, art, fitness, relationship you name it. She's constantly seeking attention too to the point where she hooks up with anyone who pays her compliments- basically hot girl insecurities. She was in a relationship for five years but they broke up as they were both toxic. Two years on she has been having flings,she calls them that but of course, she wants a relationship - which in turn allows men to use her. It's not a bad thing but it is frustrating when she keeps coming to me for advice, ignores it, then tears ensues.

Now for the problem, she has been dumped by a 22 year old and two days ago she asked me not to tell the instructor at the gym we frequent (who is her cousin and I am very close with) that when she went to Gibraltar to meet her 2nd cousins who are 13 and 15, the 13 year old kept staring at her. Of course, he then ensues to send inappropriate texts like ""you're so sexy"" and ""I love the way your hips move"" and telling her he stares at her pictures all the time. Throughout all of this, she is blushing and  thoroughly enjoying herself. I am pretty reserved so to me this was disgusting. I told her in plain terms that the idea of 13 year old possibly jacking himself off to you does not sound appealing. She stopped and snapped ""Larry down the road is possibly jacking it to both of us as well"". She continued but I could not bear it anymore when she asked him ""what exactly do you like about me?"" And of course he started listing off more inappropriate comments about what he wants to do to her. I cut her off:

Me:""you really should have stopped it in the beginning!""

Friend:""I tried but he wouldn't stop""

Me: ""How did you try? You should have told him it was inappropriate and blocked him, then showed his mother""

Friend: ""I don't want to hurt his feelings, I told him to stop with a big red emoji sign (on word she said this) and he still wouldn't! I had to ask my friend to step in like help meeee -giggling-""

At 13 I remembered how many African ""Uncles"" would talk about my shape and how ""good I would look when I am older"". She is doing the exact same thing with her cousin: ""He is so cute and handsome, but he's my son, I love him"" It's predatory so I wish to distance myself further from her. Problem is, knowing her, she will continue to entertain and solicit with him to fill her fragile ego but I don't feel right. I want to tell her cousin (F40) but I love her family, her family are very kind people. I just don't want to destroy that and keep to myself. But I know it's illegal, she knows it's illegal: ""Oh gosh I could get into real trouble with this! -giggle- (yes she giggles a lot)"".

TL:DR - WIBTA if I tell the family of this woman(F27) is accepting and soliciting with a minor (M13) even though she asked me not to tell anyone?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxfii7	2019-06-06 11:15:10		WIBTA for letting my friends know about my ex and his probable new gf ?	"Hi Reddit. I'm exhausted and stressed out about a possible cheating so I'm asking for your advice. Long story short, we were in a very fusional relationship for two years, interspersed with two breaks, which he always started, and a lot of arguments, but I was in love and happy so at first I didn't care. We started drifting away from one another in the last months, him because I didn't satisfy him enough and was too absent because of work (12h away/day) and me because I was getting tired of his unpredictable changes of behavior. 

It went downhill from here and I started thinking he was cheating on me, for finding an used condom in his bin despite the fact we didn't use any (but he sometimes used one when we masturbated together as not to stain his bed so I shrugged it off) and a girl, one of his childhood best friends and very close to his family, let's call her Mary, who sent him ""what time do you come back sweetie/darling ?"" (unsure about translation). I was pissed off and confronted him about it and he said she was almost his cousin (she is indeed regarded as such by his whole family and always comes with his female cousins to family √©vents, even formal ones like weddings) and that I shouldn't be jealous and insecure because of that. Still knew something was off but I never got anything out from confronting him so I dropped it. 

We broke off some times after for unrelated reasons, so 10 days ago, and agreed on not excluding each other from social events and not criticizing each other in front of our friends. I was completely OK with that, thinking we could still regain some trust in each other one day as friends, but since we broke up he organized a special party a day I couldn't come because of work, despite the fact he told me I was invited, and blocked me from his HBO and Netflix account. It may seem very petty from me to complain but we had a very significant relationship and a lot of respect for each other, and that sudden change makes me think he's doing this on purpose to make me feel the absence, the difference even more. He was very idealistic all through our relationship, making fun of people using that kind of retaliation after a break up which is inconsistent with his current behavior.

His behaviour and my suspicions about Mary really make me think he has been planning to break up for a very long time. She recently posted a very kind message on his FB and a few minutes after he proposed me to have a conversation, and I guess he is going to tell me they are in a relationship and maybe even that he cheated on me with her which I have very few doubts about. I'm even afraid of what ghe could do about our friend group, trying to exclude me as he already started and to include her. Would I be the asshole for telling my friends about my suspicions (both the cheating and the new relationship) and beat him from it so I can defend myself ?"		1	0

bxfhmv	2019-06-06 11:12:17		AITA for faking lung cancer during high school?	"About 5 years ago when I was 14 I was depressed. I was unmotivated and crying all the time and just having a hard time with doing anything. 

Because of this my parents (who are doctors) pulled me out of school because it was an incredible burden on my mental health and decided it would be a good idea for me to go to a psychologist/therapist and take a break from school for about a year.

When I returned to school I knew the other students were going to bully me because I was already a target to them so I lied and said I had lung cancer and was in remission. I was a loser in school and if they were to find out that I was depressed, I would probably have to be home-schooled. 

My parents were hesitant to go with my lie but they knew what my life at school was like so they agreed to lie if they were asked about my time off."	Asshole	0	0

I didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time in my hometown during my adolescence due to the far and wide travel of hockey in the US. My sister figure skates and the travel is nowhere near as extensive so she got to stay home a lot, hang out with friends. I moved away from my parents and sister when I was 14 for hockey, while my sister stayed back and went to a normal high school (I‚Äôve done online school since freshmen year)  and has done the typical highschool things like football games, dances, etc etc. So she‚Äôs definitely the more sociable of us. 

I met a few of her friends when I went to a football game with her about 2 years ago when I was back home on break. Did the usual exchange of snapchats and instagrams. 

I‚Äôve noticed from her friends snapchat stories that theyre kind of the wrong crowd. They‚Äôre the heavy partiers and drinkers crowd. Me and my sister have always been the kids who were on the straight and narrow. No drugs, no drinking, none of that. 

Last night she went to hang out with her friends and took the car that we share. I don‚Äôt know how much she goes out with friends if its not for an event, like a fair or football game or stuff like that, during the school year, but this was the first since I got home for the summer

I was pulling an all-nighter for my online schooling being due in a couple days so I took a break to check snapchat. I see one of her friend‚Äôs snapchat stories that shows my sister driving the car very slowly, 4 dudes almost pushing the car, the cameragirl  tapping on the car with a baseball bat, because my sister almost hit the girl with the car.

I went outside this morning to check on the car and there was nothing to suggest that it was stuck in mud and it has been pretty dry where I live for the past few days so it‚Äôs not wet at all.

The only conclusion i could come to is that they were messing around but that grinded my gears. I didnt want her actions to ruin my privileges and things like that. I showed the story to my parents and told them that i didn‚Äôt want this coming back to me. They said they‚Äôll figure something out. I‚Äôm probably not going to get in trouble but my sister might. The only way that my parents could know about it is if I told them and my sister will probably figure that out and know it was me who told them. Am I the Asshole for ratting on my sister?"

I manage my fianc√® and I savings because he says I'm better at it. I'm okay with this because I'm really good at budgeting and even tough we don't earn a lot we can always get whatever we want/need.

Since I'm the one managing money I was the one to suggest we could fly to London in May for a long weekend for my birthday and then go on a cruise in June for a week (instead of going to the same place we went last year). He was really excited so I made sure he understood that if we booked both holidays in March we would have to watch our expenses for the whole month of April. He was okay with it and so for the next month or so we didn't go out or bought unnecessary things. I still bought the same groceries, everything was the same except that he couldn't buy videogames or for example go out to eat/order takeaway as often as usual. 

My birthday is in May, just before we leave for London. We find out that my parents fully paid for it and that my grandparents paid my cruise almost in full. I pay what little is left to pay for the cruise and I officially tell my fianc√® that our saving-month has come to an end. We have a lot of savings and we can go back to spend normally. 

When he first planned his weeks off for the summer we agreed that if we had enough money we would go on another holiday at the end of August. Something cheap that would have a minimum impact on our savings but that still allowed us not to spend the whole summer in the city. I worked extra hard these past few months and we now have saved enough to go on this August-holiday without needing to worry about money.

Here comes the AITA part. This morning I tell him I want to book a room with a free cancellation/pay later policy and he tells me that he's not sure he actually has the August-week off. I tell him that that's okay, because as I've told him the room has a free cancellation/pay later policy so we can see how things go and if in August we still want to go good, if we can't for whatever reason I'll just cancel the booking. He then tells me that ""we've already been to London and in a couple of weeks we'll go on a cruise, we had to budget to afford these holidays and we gave up a lot of things. I don't want to budget until August"". I then asked him what he had to gave up since we had to budget only in April and he still got to eat out, etc. and he simply stated that ""You don't understand. I'm not going anywhere. You're spoiled"". 

Now, I'm really confused and angry. I don't feel I'm a spoiled woman. We agreed that if we had enough money we would leave in August too so I've been working extra hard and managing our money wisely to be able to do so.

"My father in law is a beekeeper and sells his honey in bottles and jars. He made up his own logo and showed it to me. He had printed up one sheet of 24 stickers so he wasn't deeply invested in it yet so I thought I would give him honest feedback which was that I liked the wording and picture but didn't like his choice of Comic Sans. He asked me why and I was honest and said I didn't think it looked professional. He said I was just one person and he thought it looked great and I mentioned that there is a bit of a running joke about that font on the Internet. He seemed hurt and I felt bad but at the same time I wanted to give him what I thought was constructive criticism before he went and printed thousands of these logos. Should I have kept my mouth shut?

ETA- he asked for my opinion but I am usually very non confrontational and will say things are great to make people feel good- so he was probably expecting me to say how great it was yada yada. I just know how much time and money he has invested into this business that I thought I really should just be honest if I think it will impact his business."	No A-holes here	0	0
bxfffd	2019-06-06 11:04:26	LFC_Yorkie96	WIBTA If I sent out a company wide email about toilet etiquette?	"Hey all I'll keep this one short.

I often use toilets in office as you usually do but one thing I have noticed that's becoming a frequent occurrence are the toilets now not being flushed. These toilets are normally well cleaned and kept well so it's a shame to see this. Other colleagues have sent out emails before regarding other things (washing hands, not cleaning up etc). So WIBTA if I sent a company wide email complaining about this as I'm sure the situation isn't very pleasing for other colleagues to see and again it's not fair on the cleaners who do a very good job. I hate to be that one guy but I feel that it's gotten one time too many.

Edit: To answer some of the stuff people have said:It‚Äôs not a mechanism fault, the toilets are fully functioning and flush properly, even the ones people don‚Äôt flush so it‚Äôs a bit of negligence from people I think. Chatting with HR and/or someone else who can handle this properly is probably the better option actually with me only being an apprentice at the firm, it‚Äôd probably appear abrasive from me if I addressed this without consulting anyone."

bxfbjg	2019-06-06 10:51:13	Electronic_Award	AITA for suggesting an adult takes NSFW pictures while their SO is away? Her mother is furious.	"Obvious throwaway. The mother in question is my best friend. We both have 19 year old children.

Her daughter and my son are dating. We kept it to ourselves, but we were ecstatic. She's beautiful, hilarious and like another daughter me.

We both have very sex-positive families. Sex is not a taboo subject, especially now that they're adults. When they got serious, A went on birth control. During a discussion on planned parenthood, he mentioned that A went off it because of mood-swings, but she's not ready for sex yet. I'll admit I thought it was strange, but it's her choice.

The other day the two of us went on a run (yes, we are that close). A mentioned missing my son and insecurity about al the Brazilian women on the beach he'd be saying. **I told her that if she trusts him, she has nothing to worry about. He loves her and her probably misses her more because she's amazing.** She mentioned being worried he'd be bored and I gave her advice on what I do when my man is far away. I suggested that she puts some makeup on, get into something sexy and take ""pictures"".

Not long after my best friend and I were hanging out. We were talking about the vacation. I said I missed my husband. I told her I sent him some pictures and about the suggestion I gave her daughter. She lost it. She was fuming that I suggested her daughter take nudes and include her face in them. She was going off on me and calling me awful things.

I told her that her daughter is an adult and I'm not responsible for the choices she makes, I just gave advice.

She said that I'm an idiot if I don't think her daughter wouldn't take the advice ""an adult she trust like her own mother"" and run with it. She mad that I went ""you're insecure, here give him naked pictures with your face in it"" (which isn't the case)

I told her that we're both the grown ups there, I didn't force her daughter to do anything and it's advice I got from her. She told me to stop ""shut the fuck up about semantics"" and sex advice you give to young adults is different etc. That sending photo's to your husband is different than to your 19 year old boyfriend.

She's furious about the face thing especially, because of the shit can happen. I stand that regardless of my advice, her daughter is an adult who chose to include her face in pictures.

Then she called me a creep who valued my son's gratification over her daughters safety. I told her that she's infantilizing her daughter and said she isn't being as ""sex-positive"" as she says she is.

She said that sex-positive means making an informed choice, her daughter was not informed about the consequences of taking nudes. She said that I gave awful advice to an inexperienced girl to feel ""cool"". I told her to relax, because her daughter is old enough to take nude pictures and even do porn if she chose to.

She started screaming like a madwoman saying that her daughter does not want to star in porn and that's ""the fucking point"".

She then excused herself before she got physical. I feel like she grossly overreacted and going ""mama bear"" over a 19 year old is ridiculous. I love and care about my son deeply, but I don't doubt that his choices are his alone.

Edit: She's also furious I suggested that she text them to him, so he can look at them when he missed her. That telling her to purposefully give him pics to save was irresponsible. But isn't that the point of pictures?

**Edit: I am not involved in my sons sex life. This young woman approached me for advice. Her partner just happened to be my son. I gave the same unbiased advice I'd give to ANY adult. Because that's what she wanted.**

"TL:DR - I didn't let a customer exchange a 3 month old pair of underwear without a receipt, got undermined by a colleague, then got told off for making her upset after I told her how I felt.  


I work in the menswear department of a department store in New Zealand (I will leave the city unnamed due to the country itself being quite small and there only being few department stores nationwide).   
Two weeks ago (May 2019), I was cleaning the register and a customer approached me with a pair of mens underwear in hand. She asked if I was available to serve her and of course I obliged. She explained to me that she had purchased a pair of Ted Baker (designer brand) underwear during our February sale. They had a rip (not on the seam) and she was wanting to exchange them for a brand new pair. Our returns policy is very lenient and we generally aim to please the customer providing that said customer isn't try to pull one up on us. I asked if she had a receipt, she replied ""no I don't, sorry!"". I asked her if she had the box, a tag or even a screenshot of her internet banking indicating the transaction happened, and she wasn't able to provide anything at all. I then told her that we wouldn't be able to do an exchange without proof of purchase. She understood and was about to leave.   
One of my colleagues (Linda) appears and says ""oh! I can help you!"" and then she takes the customer away and  I observe her do the exchange I had just denied. The customer turns around to me and says ""your colleague is so helpful!"".  


I am fuming at this point. My colleague completely under-minded me and made me look incompetent. I told my one of my other colleagues (Jennifer) about it and she said ""yeah she'll do that to look good and get sales later"".   
Shortly after, I decided I wasn't going to to through the entire day irritated and annoyed, so I decided to confront Linda about it. I approached Linda and said ""hey, next time I'm with a customer discussing a return, do you mind not undermining me right in front of the customer and making me look like an idiot like you did just there?"" Linda profusely apologises and I walk away.   
Later on, my manager (Ben) approaches me and said, ""did you know Linda has been crying in the bathroom? You should apologise for what you said"". Confused at this point I responded ""oh, are you talking about the 3 month old underwear without a receipt I denied returning?"". To that Ben responded ""she was only doing the right thing by the customer, those type of returns are definitely a grey area"". I thought what I asked from the customer was completely reasonable, and my point I brought up with Linda was valid.

So she starts to promote the product to me and encouraged me to buy the supplement on sale which is a buy 2 free 2 promo and share the payment and the product with my other close friend. So the way she explains the price through whatsapp confuses both me and my friend, the way my friend and i understand the total price for the product is RM225 (Malaysian currency which roughly around 54usd) and we need to split the payment and it became RM112.50 (27 usd) and both of us will get 2 product each.

I delayed the payment because I want to reassure with my friend about the product and the payment. A few days later I decided to pay the product RM225 total and my friend would pay me back later. But to my suprise when I ask the bank account and the total price went up to RM450(108 usd) and at first I didnt notice the different in price but had a suspicion because I didn't feel it was correct and I couldn't check my old chat with my female friend that sells the product because my WhatsApp was acting weird so i had to reinstall it( i did a backup but it was an old backup dating back to 10th april , this happened on 4th june) so i had no history regarding the supplement. I paid it and went on to tell my friend that i share the product with about the payment and he got mad because it wasn't the price promised. So i chat back with my female friend about the price. It was very confusing and she keep on saying she did say it was RM450 as she explained before, then she choose to show a screenshot of a chat she had with my friend and I forwarded it back to my friend. To our suprise we both understood it was RM225 for the total price not RM450. I confront my female friend about it and she blames me that I didn't focus and take notice about it. I then proceed to tell her that my friend that shared with got mad and she suddenly starts to blame me that i twists the fact and lied to my friend quote from her"" you are trying to ruin my relationship with her with lying and your rotten heart""( forgot to mention my friend that shared with me is also a female and I'm a male).

So right now I've been fighting with me seller friend and now she chose to block me on every social media.

bxf1q7	2019-06-06 10:16:15		WIBTA if I told my friend that I don‚Äôt think she should get married to her fianc√©?	"I hate to be this guy, but ever since they got engaged the idea that they could be getting married does not sit right with me and nearly makes me sick. They‚Äôve both been two of my best friends since high school, I care a lot about them and don‚Äôt want them to make a mistake or get stuck in a toxic marriage. But a lot of aspects of their relationship have grown to become toxic.

The girl is very sweet and shy, and has an anxiety disorder that makes her very timid, she seeks guidance in other people and that can make her, in my opinion, easily taken advantage of.

The dude turned his life around to Christianity a while ago, but since then he has been very immersed in the Christian conservative culture. As much as I hate to even think about how much he has changed, I can‚Äôt deny he‚Äôs become racist, misogynistic, and thinks very regressive ideas like that women exist to serve men. Because of this, he has also convinced (to me it feels more like he‚Äôs manipulated her) his now fianc√© through her faith into thinking that ‚Äúgod‚Äù wants her to serve him. He makes all the decisions in their relationship, forbids her to go out or do things she wants to do, and makes her do things he has no business asking of her.

Example: Last election he made her vote for Trump and gave her the impression that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs going to put God back in office‚Äù or whatever. She openly didn‚Äôt want to be involved in politics, but now she thinks this is just part of a good Christian relationship to do what the man says.

Now he has proposed to her, she said yes, and even though my girlfriend and a couple other people in our friend group agree it‚Äôs a bad idea, it‚Äôs like no one has the guts to say anything even though so much is at stake. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy.

I don‚Äôt think she deserves this and I feel as if I should say something to her, just to encourage her to think it over more before she marries him.  

But at the same time, I know it‚Äôs not my place. 

Especially because they do genuinely love and care for each other. I‚Äôm not denying that and I‚Äôm not trying to interfere with love, but it feels like someone should say something just to let them know that it might not be a good idea? But I don‚Äôt even know how to go about saying that. I just want to know if I would be the asshole if I told her how I really felt and encouraged her to consider how she‚Äôd be living with all the toxicity and all the bad aspects (as well as the good) if their relationship for the rest of her life.

Should the fact that they are in love be all the evidence I need to keep my opinions to myself? WIBTA if I told her to reconsider?"		1	0

bxexp2	2019-06-06 10:00:57		AITA for being annoyed that my friend isn't remembering my pronouns?	"Hi - as the title probably makes quite clear, I'm trans, male-to-female.

I came out to my group of friends about 14 months ago, and it went really well. There weren't any negative reactions, and barring a few understandable mistakes in the first month or two, basically everyone got the hang of using the name I prefer (nothing unusual or complicated) and ""she"" pronouns instead of ""he"" ones.

This was all except for one guy, who I'll call Tom.

To this day, Tom is still really consistently making mistakes in this regard. It's about a 70/30 split in favour of mistakes, and honestly, it seems to have gotten even more pronounced recently.

To be fair to Tom, I can understand why it would be hard to switch. I've known this group of friends for about 9 years, and it's hard to suddenly change how you address someone. Due to my circumstances - I have a less-than-enthusiastic family and I currently live in an unsafe area - I can't really present myself the way I'd like, so I still dress and talk like a guy, which doesn't help matters either. He's never said a bad word about me being trans, and I love him and all my friends to pieces, so I don't want to paint him as some awful person.

Still, it's reaching the point where this just feels unreasonable. Every other one of my friends (from this group or not) that knows about me has got it by this point. My cousin, who has known me my entire life, has got it to the point where the first time I saw her after I told her, she accidentally called me ""she"" in public (which was thankfully unnoticed and quite funny). I've been taking hormones for almost two years, and coupled with my long hair, I get seen as a girl by strangers fairly frequently even when I try and look like a dude - even if my appearance doesn't affect the validity of my identity, I can't deny that it should probably make it easier.

I've never been rude or anything to Tom, or acted out that stupid Internet stereotype of the screaming harpy trans person distraught over not being called xer or whatever, but I'm starting to get quite annoyed by his constant forgetfulness. It seems quite disrespectful at this point; I've told him quite clearly that I was not a big fan of being a guy and that being reminded of that is hardly the most pleasant experience. I don't think asking him to remember is a tall order, and at this point it seems far beyond ""trying to remember but occasionally forgetting"" and into ""not bothering to remember"". 

The worst he's gotten from me when he makes a mistake is a raised eyebrow or someone else will correct him (I've never asked people to do this for me, just to be clear). If I'm NTA over this, then I think I'm going to start correcting him myself (just saying something like ""she, Tom"" if he makes a mistake) and, if it carries on, then I'll talk to him about it directly and try and get to the bottom of it, because I don't want to constantly feel disrespected by and annoyed at one of my closest friends.

bxeuc3	2019-06-06 09:48:24	LeaningPost	AITA for being ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù to a customer for their religious accommodations?	"I am a new manager at a pizzeria and we have this regular who always asks for religious accommodation. Normally this is fine, we have many people come in who request we clean cut their pizza, but this customer takes it further. He request that we open whole new bags of ingredients for his pizza. At first I was accommodating, but over time I have grown to resent seeing him show up, not only because of this request but for the complaints he gives even after we accommodate him.

He shows up tonight and asks that we open new bags of ingredients. Now I have an issue with hiding my emotions on my face, but I try to be as respectful as possible when talking to this guy, but I can tell he senses the animosity I have over his request. For some reason I decided this time was enough and I would let him know that his request is going above and beyond. I tell him normally they don‚Äôt like us to open new ingredients, but I will do it this time. This is where I wish I stuck to my guns and refused because 1) what if every Muslim who walked in asked that we used a fresh bag of ingredients, we would have multiple open bags of ingredients, and I would have to stop what I was doing to properly put them in new containers and date them. Now this would be fine if our company didn‚Äôt run labor so tightly and I wasn‚Äôt the only one in the store running the back, 2) our own Muslim workers are perfectly fine using the ingredients we have open, though sometimes they will wash them (which I offered to do but he said no), 3) no other customer has ever made this request.

He said that the previous manager was fine with it and he‚Äôs been coming here for 15 years. I say ok, and go to make his pizzas. Hours later he comes back to complain that the veggie pizza was terrible this time so they threw it away (it looked perfectly fine to me when I gave it to him). I said sorry, would you like us to make you a new one or put a credit on your account. He said he doesn‚Äôt want anything, he just wanted to tell me. I said ok, I am sorry (again) next time could you please bring the pizza so I can see it. He says they threw it away. I said alright, well what would you like me to do for you? He said nothing, he just wanted to tell me. I said alright, well if you don‚Äôt need anything I need to get back to work. He says I can‚Äôt talk to him that way, he‚Äôs the customer, and he‚Äôs not done yet (with what idk, I guess bitching). He then goes on a rant about how I always act weird to him and that I am disrespectful and he begins to demand that I respect him like he respects me (for a guy that runs a religious school I thought this was a little too prideful, but I didn‚Äôt say anything). Again, I say I‚Äôm sorry but if there is nothing I can do for you I need to get back to work.

My dad passed, and they decided to 'adopt' my brother and I.  I have gradually felt super uncomfortable in this household, with plenty of unwarranted aggression and just a generally negative atmosphere. We had a huge fight a while back, which started when I wanted to get a dog. They started to criticize and basically explain that all of my dreams for the future were stupid and that I shouldn't move out as soon as I want to. I was devastated, and felt as uncomfortable as ever with such hostility. I didn't want to interact with them, and even as we had people come over, they pretended that everything was fine and that they didn't just tear me apart. The next morning, My uncle was leaving for work, and said 'goodbye' and 'I love you' to each of us as he was leaving as per normal. I was still sobbing even though a day later, and I just said goodbye. I didn't tell him I loved him. That afternoon, my Aunt demanded I apologize to him because he cried the whole way to work. When I did apologize, he started crying again and explained he didn't want to feel like he was failing me as a father, or that the household was inadequate. It felt so genuine, and I felt so horrible. But some of my friends and extended family suspected that they were being manipulative to make me not leave the home, as they are quite controlling and erratic.

bxesna	2019-06-06 09:42:10	Lady__stoneheart	WIBTA if I told my sister that she needs to get a reality check about her education and her studying?	"I'm Indian, my sister (20) and I live with my family and my parents have been paying for our education. 

My sister is doing BA and plans on taking Economics as her major in her last year. She gave her second year exams and her results came out today. She has failed in a total of 7 subjects (which include previous subjects she had to reappear from first year). And hence won't be able to move on to her last year and has to take a drop/gap year. 

I have no idea exactly how difficult or easy her studies are but by looking at her books I'd say it's not at all easy. She took Arts stream because she didn't want to study a lot like me (I'm doing engineering). So right from the start I told her that no stream is easy and that everyone has to study in college. But my she and my parents let her take psychology, economics and statistics even though she said she didn't want to study ""hard"". 

In her first year she failed in stats so she gave it up in her second year. She bunked her classes and tuitions all year round for both years. In the first semester of her second year she didn't attend a practical exam because we had to go to a cousin's wedding. Me and my father didn't even know she had an exam until her results came out. She had told her decision to mom, but I have no idea why mom would agree to her missing an exam to attend a wedding.....? 

In addition she loves dancing and is learning classical Indian dance Bharatnatyam. She is really good at it and probably could make a career out of it but she doesn't even study for the exams for her dance. 

Her logic is she doesn't need to study as much as I did or even half of that because arts isn't as hard as engineering. This was essentially drilled into her by my parents and society as a whole that arts is super easy. 

Now that she is going to probably spend a whole year at home I think I should bluntly tell her that if she doesn't take her education seriously she will ruin her life. 

She is very scared now that her results are out and has been Crying nonstop.

WIBTA if I tell her (in exact or slightly different words) that she is delusional about her courses and her capability to study and retain what she has studied. If she still hasn't figured out (after 2 years) how to study so that she can atleast pass then she is more stupid than she thinks. If she cannot handle the subjects she has chosen then it's about time she takes her tuitions seriously or have a serious talk with her teachers about what subjects she should take. 

Please advice on how to go about it and what else to add.

EDIT- Please note that I'm asking whether the words I'll use will make me the asshole or not since she is very scared and has been crying. I've tried to have multiple talks with her in previous years but she simply blows them off."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxesfd	2019-06-06 09:41:17		AITA for leaving my friend group?	"Some backstory: I‚Äôve been in the same group of people (save for the addition of a few as time progressed) since I started high school in 2015. There are a few other friends mentioned here, but the main group over the years has consisted of me Z, N, S, and K.

2 weeks ago I was brought into my counselor‚Äôs office for a meeting where she told me that I was credit deficient and wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to walk in my school‚Äôs grad ceremony. To make matters even worse, the day after that my parents sat me down and explained that they were getting a divorce. I immediately broke the news my friends in the group chat we all shared. The only people to express concern my situation were J and L, two other friends who were newer to the group, whereas Z, N, and S who I‚Äôd been very close to for ~4 years made remarks about how I had slacked off the whole year and I should‚Äôve known this would happen and how divorce was too common for me to be upset.

I attempted to discuss with them that I was hurting and needed a little bit of compassion aside from our usual method of humor and aggression to cover things up, but instead I got shot down by being told that I was passive-aggressive and a bitch, and the chat went silent when I tried to defend myself. After this I distanced myself to the point where I would not speak in the chat when it picked back up and refused to make plans with Z, N, or S. I finished my summer school things and began hanging out other friends, and this point I was still getting ignored by the others aside from J, L, and K, so I thought that was that and we would all just move on.

It all came to a head when I woke up on Monday to a text from S that 10 paragraphs of her accusing me of ruining the friend group, taking her for granted, and distancing myself for what she considered no reason. The whole thing seemed as though it was intended to guilt-trip me or make me feel bad, and struck me as odd because I‚Äôm the quiet one in the group. I hardly ever get angry or upset, and when I do it‚Äôs never directed at someone. It seemed wrong that S was trying to flip a situation where I was getting treated poorly back on me by saying I was tearing the group apart, while said situation could have easily been avoided by listening to my concerns.

At this point I lost it, told S not to talk to me anymore until she can take responsibility for her own actions, and removed her on all social media. Z and N in turn removed me from all of their socials and the group chat, both telling me that I was in the wrong. J and L assured me that I made the right decision and left the chat as well, and K is Switzerland but still supports what I did. I know I threw away 3 pretty great friendships and caused tension for everyone else, and I‚Äôve been thinking about it nonstop for the past few days. Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt the first time I had sought love and help from the group and they had made it to be a joke or not cared enough to reach out.

So, a little bit of background: I am 20 years old, my sister is 13(turning 14 soon) and my mom is currently divorcing my dad. I live with my mom

My father is a money wasting idiot, so we were always short on money. When I was younger, I alway wanted to do various activities, like going on concerts or conventions, wished for new technical things(my computers was stuck in the last centurie and I didn't got an smartphone until I was 16). When I asked my parents, they said: ""Wait until we paid all our depts, then we get these thing for you!""

Now we're still short on money, yet my sister doesn't seem to care. She demands new iPhones every year, gets to go on varois concerts and always gets money when she asks for it.
When I asked my mom about it and that I would also liked to go on some concerts, her response was ""We are short on money, don't you understand? Anyways, you are old enough to earn your own money""

I am kind of jealous of my little sister, since all she has to do in order to get something, is throuing a tantrum and yelling at us for not loving her. When I decided to throw a tantrum in the past, I was usually shut up and told ""You are the older one, behave like an adult!"" (I was 13 when I first heard that)

Also when I want my mom to drive somewhere or drive me home, I normally shoukd take the bus. She would only drive me, when there no buses anymore.

But my mom is caring for me. She gets me and my sister brandet clothes, when where shopping groceries I get what I asked for. My mom even offerd me to do my laundry, when I am going to move out next semester(The washingmashines in the university dorms are disgusting).

Also I get my childrens money (don't know how it's called in english, basicly the money you get from the goverment for your child. Roughly about 200‚Ç¨), even thou I paid for most of my stuff. Like eating at the university, getting stuff for university, shopping for shampoo, skincare products etc. I also pay my bustickekt.

Now P and I attended the same primary, intermediate and high schools together. But I will get to this soon.

P has always had a childish behaviour even in high school and her mother would encourage it. She would use fake cries to manipulate me into either going to her house and either playing with her or hanging out with her when I just wanted to be either at home as I have chronic pain and she knew this or hanging with someone else, I basically felt stuck in this friendship where she would just use fake cries to get her own way. It got to a point where she would fake cry to make me spend the last day of high school and her childish behaviour took a toll on me mentally and I couldn‚Äôt deal with it anymore.

I ended up messaging her on Facebook saying that I couldn‚Äôt be friends with her anymore, she rang me upset calling me ‚Äúmean‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt want to deal with that. I said to her that I couldn‚Äôt stay friends with because her attitude had mentally affected me and I ended up hanging up on her. I felt that her mother probably had a grudge for saying that.

Her mother spoke to me a year later saying that I was harsh for ending the friendship but my parents say that if I felt like it was the right thing then that‚Äôs okay.

bxeocd	2019-06-06 09:25:03		AITA For Not Wanting To Give My Roomates 200 of their deposit back?	"Hi everybody. 

Currently, I am a college student and was enrolled outside of campus in my own apartment in my first year. My roommates went to the same high school as me and choose me as their roommate. In the beginning we all got along, and took turns each week individually cleaning the kitchen. It was until me and one of my roommates began bickering that the system fell apart. Since then, my roommates including the ones I share a bathroom with refuse to clean the kitchen or bathroom in the past year. I ultimately gave on cleaning somewhat (except when it came to dishes those were always washed)  considering I was tired of being the only one that cleaned everything in the kitchen and bathroom. I tried to communicate that we should have taken turns but they refused and never took turns cleaning. Now the house is an absolute disgusting mess to say the least. The Problem arises now that we payed 800 dollars for the security deposit and pay rent of 500 dollars a month. I told my roommates that they would be able to swap the lease in July, and the only thing they would have to do was clean the food in the refrigerator and remove the stuff from their rooms, and they would get 200 dollars in total. They now are demanding I give them 400 and they refuse to clean anything. One of my roommates even left food in the apartments for 4 weeks and it was completely rotting. I also have to pay someone to clean the house and the gasoline to even travel to the apartment to clean it since it is far away in another city."	Not the A-hole	1	0

I‚Äôm just gonna say it, no offense but he gives off the 40 yr old virgin vibe. I was in my front yard one day and he walks up to me and makes conversation, cutting his morning walk short. He introduces himself to me and tells me that he‚Äôs always seeing me & my mother going into our house. That day was the first day I‚Äôve ever seen him in my life. 

So he brings up his profession, which is in tech. I told him that I‚Äôd been trying to learn xyz in tech & he ecstatically tells me he can help me. He invites me over into his house. I accepted his invitation a week later. 

Upon arriving, he gives me a run down and he says something about me being in high school and I was like no, I‚Äôm 24 haha. He was like oh ok, I thought u were younger haha. I didn‚Äôt think too much on it but I left after some time. 

Months later, he catches my mom as she pulls into the driveway as he just happens to be on his nightly walk, this was around 9:30pm. He comes inside and talks for over an hour about his life and his ex wife who became violent towards him. & his ex Friend who he stopped talking to because she led him on, in his words. 

My mom said she was going out of town so he said I could come over for dinner if I got bored. So a couple days after my mom left, I asked him when I should come over and he said that we could ‚Äúventure out‚Äù to grab something to eat or to get food and bring it home. 

I didn‚Äôt respond because... he made it seem like he makes dinner every night so I could just swing by if I wanted to. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs just being a friendly neighbor anymore, I don‚Äôt want him to think I‚Äôm leading him on. Also I do not find him remotely attractive. Also, he‚Äôs been acting like this before he knew I was a 24 yr old so it‚Äôs just kind of weird to have a teenager in your home without asking the parents. 

Soooo now I‚Äôm just kind of avoiding him. Idk if I‚Äôm overreacting or being paranoid or what... but it‚Äôs rubbing me the wrong way."	No A-holes here	0	0

bxean2	2019-06-06 08:29:33		AITA for saying something that pushed my friend back into the closet?	"A few years ago I started attending a new school and met a bunch of new people. One of those people happened to be a girl I'll call Catelyn. She's trans (mtf) but wasn't out of the closet at the time. She saw me, a decently flamboyant ftm guy, and wanted to be friends with me pretty quickly. Bear in mind, I didn't know she was trans at the time. She was shy and would kind of hang around me, mainly because we had a mutual friend who's pretty amazing. Somewhere along the way she fell for me and her behavior at the time was a little stalkerish. Imagine super edgy poetry and confessions, which I turned down because I'm not into girls. Sometime after I rejected her she mentioned to a couple of us she thought she might be trans as well. A few of my friends thought she was just doing it so I'd pay more attention to her, which may sound a bit extreme without context but she'd done stuff that was almost as bad. She would snap at our mutual friends for spending time with me and taking attention away from her in conversations, yet she would never directly have a long conversation with me. She would message me paragraphs every night despite not talking to me in person and say that she would kill for me. Love the energy but kind of disturbing.

&#x200B;

Flash forward a few years and things are pretty amicable after the initial rejection. She's no longer in love with me but adores me in a different way, kind of like Louis Litt to Harvey. She's a decent friend and I helped her come out to more people who are now also calling her Catelyn. She says she wants to change her name because she hates when people shorten it to Cat, ok cool. So I try helping her pick one out. I'm pretty mortified when she almost chooses a name that's two letters off my own, basically the feminine version of my name, and I advise against it. I came out to my parents for the third time recently after cutting all my hair off without their permission and they've said the usual stuff like 'what did I do to make you like this' or 'who influenced you'. Hearing I have a trans friend with a name almost identical to my own would worsen the situation. I also didn't want people at school thinking she 'copied' me or accidentally calling me her name because they're so similar. When I explained my reasoning to her I accidentally mentioned that people first thought she was doing it to get my attention and it'd make things worse for both of us. She now wants us to start calling her by her masculine name again and go back into the closet because the news upset her. I didn't think it through before mentioning it to her and it just came out mid conversation."		1	0

bxe91g	2019-06-06 08:23:04	MyDogsADickThrowaway	AITA for taking my aggressive dog to the dog park?	"My dog makes other dogs deeply uncomfortable by barking at them and chasing them; no biting, but being an aggressive asshole. I spent 6 months trying to train her, then I hired a dog trainer, but it didn't improve.

Let's call her **Dogbutt. She is a small-medium doggo, an Aussie Cattledog.**

**Here are the measures I take to coexist with other doggo owners while I'm out with her:**

* She stays on a lead.
* She wears a basket muzzle. She's never attacked or bitten but I want to make sure other dogs are safe.
* I keep her out of enclosures at the dog park unless there are no other dogs there, in which case I let her in off the lead in the enclosure with the gates shut, and leave the moment someone else wants to use it.
* If there's other dogs around I avoid them as much as possible.

**We had a problem today with another owner and it's making me wonder if I'm being an asshole anyway.**

One of the dog parks I like to take her to has two enclosures. The smaller one is almost always empty, so I like to go in and let Dogbutt off the lead so she can exercise until someone else wants it.

Today I saw another owner nearby. He had a big golden retriever, and he was hanging around nearby, but he didn't seem to be going in and his dog was tied up.

So I took Dogbutt in and let her off the lead after shutting the gate.

Hadn't taken three steps when Dogbutt started going absolutely *ballistic*. The golden's owner had untied it and it was barking at Dogbutt through the fence. I don't know who started it for sure, but LBR, it was probably Dogbutt.

**Owner:** ""Doesn't she like other dogs?""

**Me:** ""No, sorry, she's aggressive.""

**Owner:** ""Then why are you in there?!""

**Me:** ""Oh, sorry, I thought you didn't want to use this! We'll leave.""

**Owner:** ""No, I mean, why are you here? It's for all dogs. Why would you bring her if she doesn't get along with other dogs?""

I didn't argue, just dragged her away and left.

To answer his question -- I take her to the dog park and to places where there are other dogs because **the only places where I am allowed to take my dog are places where other people also take their dogs**. That's just how it is; if dogs are allowed, people will take their dogs there.

But what he said is now bothering me and I'm wondering if I'm being an asshole by taking her out anyway.

my auntie has been coming over to check up on us and make sure we are ok. my parents are away for a week. 

my auntie has a 10 year old son (max) who does not listen and acts like a toddler half the time, he also gets what he wants when he wants it. 
my sister suffers from anxiety and quite bad ocd, her room is set exactly the way she likes it and she likes to keep it that way  

my auntie knows about this and has been taught by my mum what ocd is and how bad my sisters ocd is. 

she comes over to make sure we are ok and let max loose, max decided to go into my sisters room and moved some stuff around, it caused a minor panic in kate but she moved on. I told my aunt that max is not allowed in Kate's room, my auntie shrugged her shoulders and seemed to not care, this caused me to be annoyed but I moved on. 

that was until max managed to find the cereal and decided that Kate's room would be an awesome place to dump it. Kate went into freakout mode and started shaking and crying. I turned to max and told him off and explained that he can't do that. he started crying and my auntie comes into Kate's room and started to tell me off, she told me I'm not Max's mom so I have no right to tell him off. 

I just went off at her, I screamed at her and told her that she let her son destroy Kate's room twice, caused kate to panic and still seemed to not care, you are a piece of shit for not caring for your neice. you have also  still not told your son off for being a little shit,  I want you to leave my house.

The legal drinking age in my province is 19, but I have never ever had drinks with friends before. Whenever we usually go for dinner, I just get a pop. I‚Äôve just never really been interested in it before. 

Tonight I went to a local pub with my coworkers, and I got persuaded into having drinks. I wasn‚Äôt planning on drinking, but I just felt like giving it a try. What started with a blue raspberry cocktail turned into a couple tequila shots and jaggerbombs, and while I was definitely drunk, and could not drive, I could walk pretty normally and carry on an intelligent conversation. I just got home 30 minutes ago. I still feel tipsy and impaired, but it‚Äôs way less than before. 

The reason why I‚Äôm asking: in the past whenever I have gone out my parents have asked if I would be drinking and that they would give me ride home if I needed, whatever. I started drinking and I just was having so much fun that I didn‚Äôt even think about letting them know, I just planned on leaving my car at the pub and getting a ride with the DD. I came home at 0:30, and was immediately lectured:

- ‚Äúwow I can hear their music, why are you home so late?‚Äù 
- ‚Äúyour car will probably be broken into, why would you leave it there?‚Äù
- ‚Äú why would you drink? Were you planning this?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI have to work tomorrow, instead I was up all night being worried about you‚Äù 

It could just be that I‚Äôm still intoxicated, but I felt like they were attacking me to be completely honest and I felt really confused given their attitudes in the past. The last point that they said really bothered me, they insist on having me in their Apple family so that they can see my location, so I don‚Äôt get what they were worried for? I really don‚Äôt know if I did anything wrong and I definitely did not mean to. 

If you guys could just let me know, I just feel completely bewildered and I don‚Äôt get what I did that was so rude.

bxe5tl	2019-06-06 08:09:48	Kat_Avy	AITA for changing plans and asking friends to wake up earlier so that my bf would not miss his grandma's funeral and snapping?	"Throwaway

We just went to a four day trip with our friends (Max, Nina and Maya, Max and Nina are a couple, Maya is Nina's sister).
My bf got a call day into the trip that his grandmother died. The funeral is on the day of our departure, so we asked if we could leave early that day because we also had a flat tire on our car and need to change it before we go to the funeral. We agreed.

Everything on the trip was ok. We pretty much went by their schedule, we were late most of the time because of the time they took to get ready and changed schedules for their plans + inbetween driving was always at least two hours more than expected. 

On the last day, we asked if we can leave in the morning at around 9.00 at the latest. They said ok. We went to the concert and they stayed at the hostel. In the morning, my boyfriend realised that due to the roads, that we need to change the tire, shower and get ready for the funeral and go there, we did not have much time.

So at 7.40..

Me: can we please leave at 8.30 at the latest, we need more time to get through this day

Maya: sure, I can get ready in 15 min

Max: why, all of a sudden?

Me: because we calculated we need more time

Max: ok

Nina heard us, but continued on sleeping. Max lied there as well,Maya got up and got ready. 

Me and my bf get ready,Max and Nina are still in bed.

Me and my bf sat on the bed waiting.

Max is looking at his phone.

Me: can we hurry?

Nina gets up: Yes, we'll go early, 8.30, what's the big deal???

Me: we asked to hurry up so we can leave early because we need more time

Max: why didn't you calculate this yesterday?

Me: are you serious? We calculated everything wrong all the time together.  You know how it is.

Nina: but you're just like ""lets go!!"", we will go!

Max: yeah, you just demanded, didn't even ask nicely, you were supposed to ask this way: ""hey we just figured out we don't have a lot of time, can we please go early""

Me: we did ask this way and then when you asked why we said because we need to go

Nina: no you didn't, you demanded! And why are you all walking around for 20 minutes, making noise for 20 minutes??? You're really inconsiderate.

I snapped at this remark. My bf is just staring shocked.

Me: we're inconsiderate???? There was no problem going early for your exam (she was supposed to have an exam that day) and his grandmother DIED and it's a funeral!!!

Max: oh you're playing the death card

Me and my bf: what??? This literally is the card!!!

Max: relax, i'd get him to the funeral in any scenario

I stood up and was about to leave.

Max: Nina also has an exam you know

Me: you must be a dumbfuck to compare an exam to the funeral!

Max: you compared it!

Me: fuck off (i stormed out)

My bf came out a couple of min later and thanked me for taking a stand for him (he's not good at confrontation, introverted) and reassured me that I did not do or say anything wrong and that he is really disappointed in their behaviour.

I said ‚Äúwhat are you going to say when there is complaint about loud banging?‚Äù My coworker responded, ‚Äúwhat banging?‚Äù And winked at the other coworker. She is 33. That coworker then invited her friends to the office to hang out


On Monday, the team received a meeting notification. I was looking through some incoming emails to the team and noticed one that was titled ‚Äúyour office‚Äù. I looked at it and it was the office next door. The message had been forwarded over to my manager. In the email, he said something along these lines ‚ÄúI am writing to you because I have been harassed and heckled by some of your employees for asking them to turn down the music. They were banging on the wall by my desk and they made inappropriate gestures (flipping me off and stomping at me) when walking on by.‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt know they were flipping them off or stomping at the other office.



I reached out to my coworker that had experienced this and had not participated. He told me he felt the same We decided to tell our manager what we had witnessed (besides the drinking).

Also, I dont know how to use reddit so... hehe

So where I used to live, there weren't a lot of kids around. Occasionally a couple of boys would ride by on some longboards but that was about it. However, I lived across the street from a girl three years younger than me (I was 11 when we met, she was 8)

Eventually we kind of became friends. She'd come over and we'd play minecraft and stuff. But I started to get annoyed with her. I've always hung out with people that are older them me, so hanging out with an eight year old was a little  aggravating. Plus, she was weird. Once, she just decided to stay over for dinner. Without asking her parents. We ate spaghetti and she just ate ALL OF THE GARLIC BREAD (and left the crusts). Whenever she came over she would ring the doorbell a bunch of times and press her face against the glass to see inside the house (the door was mostly glass). Whenever you opened the door, she would push her way in even if you said you were busy. She also really liked licking things. She'd lick the posters on my walls, she'd try and lick my cats, and even me! She tried to lick my guitar once and that's when I kicked her out. 

After that, I never answered the door when she would come over. I would just wait for her to leave. I felt bad though, because she was just a kid and wanted a friend. Eventually she stopped coming after a while.

Then that Christmas rolled around and my sister and I were giving Christmas cookies to the neighbors. We went to her house and her grandma opened the door and thanked me for ""being a friend to her."" and explained how she was a bit of a strange kid so she didnt have a lot of friends, and the fact that I was friends with her meant a lot.

He has become very attached to the haircut. When I asked about it, he became very defensive. Now, I'm not one to tell people how to cut their own hair. I just think when you stand up in someone's wedding, it should be expected to not start an out of the ordinary hairstyle before you will take a bunch of photos at the wedding.

The worst part about it, the haircut wasn't even well done. It was a sports cuts haircut. It doesn't even do the movie character justice. I did offer to pay for him to get a haircut somewhere a step up from sports cuts. If he's going to do it, at least get it done right."		1	0
bxdwfl	2019-06-06 07:31:57		AITA for not wanting to help my step brother to learn from his exams?	"My step brother is the son of my step mother ( the wife of my father) from another marriage. I am sure that he is adopted, but this is another discussion. The idea is that he was very spoiled by my step mother, and, now, at 18 years old, he can't learn himself, because my step mother help him doing his homework all of his life, or put me or my father to do them for him. My step mother is a very smart person, she is a scientific researcher in Chemistry. She loves my brother very much, but  by doing his work all of his life, she transforms him in a person who couldn't do anything without someone, and in a person not so smart, in general. 
She wants me to stay at home with my step brother and help him to learn for his final exams for finishing highschool. The problem is that I have to finish my work for my bachelor degree diploma, because I will graduate next month. Currently, I stay with my boyfriend in another city, where is the uni, and I don't want to help my step brother. My boyfriend, also, has epilepsy, and has seizures two times this month, despite he takes his medication regulary. He works 9 hours a day to help me finishing my studies, and this is exhausting for him and causes these epilepsy attacks. I want to stay with him, because we love each other very much and he currently needs me to be with him.
My step mother thinks that I am selfish and I don't love my family because I don't want to help my step brother. She says that my family is more important that my boyfriend. I love my step mother, because she raised me from a very young age, but I have a lot of work to do and I want to stay with my boyfriend. I think that my brother must learn to handle the situation himself.  Also, I think that, despite I will help him, he will not pass the exams, because he has a very bad grammar and spelling in my native language. Do you think that I am selfish in this situation? AITA here?

She's a little nervous with the ""finding the right person"" situation. Yesterday, during conversation she told me that she just wanted to talk to someone. I casually suggested that, only if she felt like it, she can talk to mom, who she's really chill with, if she doesn't wish to go ahead with therapy. Mom's great at this stuff and she has counseled a lot of people, of all ages. She then told me she was pretty sure about therapy and thanked me for asking. Then later that night she sent me a long text saying that she ""got where I was coming from"" and she ""respects"" the notion but she had thought it through and wanted to go ahead professionally. I told her I was glad she was doing it and called it a day. This morning she texted me saying that she slept over it and was really ""disturbed"" by what I had suggested and doesn't think she would be ""comfortable"" talking to me about ""anything"" for a while (she said ""I don't know how long."") I respect her space and haven't texted her but I am a little conflicted. I only suggested something as help and more importantly didn't force it. I also have been really supportive about her wanting to go to therapy since the beginning (I was the first one she told).

bxdr4w	2019-06-06 07:12:24	hateful_gator	AITA I let my sister move into my new home as a temp favour and shes taking over	"Hi reddit this is my first post so bare with me.

So some backstory ,I'm 21 ,I've been working a full time job since I was 17 and a couple of months ago I finally managed to finalise and buy my own house, I'm super proud of it and so was my family, now comes the hard part, me and my sister has always had a on off relationship shes very selfish and will manipulate and gaslight people into getting what she wants or making herself seem right, I had to leave my mums house and she let me live with her and her boyfriend while my house got sorted I thought I'd repay the favour, I regret that.
My sister recently left work because of ""illnesses"" and hasn't gone back, this means the financial burden of a home and the upkeep has been put on her long suffering boyfriend,  they couldnt afford their rent and were close to being homeless so I offered them to move into the spare room in my new house, we had alot of conversations about it and in the months leading up to me paying the deposit she was always promising they wouldn't take the piss or take over my new home, flash forward to them moving in and shes done a complete 180, she uses her ""illnesses"" to get out of doing anything spends most of her time in her pyjamas in front of a TV, smoking weed or going to doctors appointments to milk more diagnoses out of them to claim P.I.P.

 I have asked them over the past couple weeks to clear the other spare room of their stuff cause my housemate is moving in soon and I need to decorate,  my sister said it would be done and that it was an easy job and 2 weeks later it's still there, she went off on one last night saying that I haven't been understanding of the stress their move has put on them and how I'm putting to much pressure on her by asking for small things like taking our trash or clearing their shit from a room I told them they arnt allowed to use in the first place. 

Now my dog is terrified to walk through the halls of her own house cause my sister cat attacks her on site , my cat cant eat a meal without being locked away cause her cat eats all his food, it's got to the point where they've been living with me for 2 weeks and I already want to kick them out , all of my family warned me prior to letting them stay that this was a bad idea and I didnt listen cause I wanted to help my sister out and in return shes taken the complete piss , she accused me of not being understanding about the stress this has caused but shes not considering the stress I'm dealing with moving into my own property,  redecorating, furnishing, paying Bill's I've never had to deal with before, working a full time job, and upkeaping the pitiful dreags of my social life, on top of accommodating them , am I an asshole for wanting them gone?, should I kick them out so soon?, if its started off like this I genuinely cant see it getting any better and they planned to be with me for six months I dont think I can take this shit for that long, what do I do reddit?"

bxdpfg	2019-06-06 07:06:02	thescarecrowk	AITA for asking my friend to stop talking to my roommates?	"This has been bugging me for years so here goes.

First year of uni. A couple of my highschool friends go to the same city for uni. One of them (A) and I are the only ones who get an apartment in the city, the others stay with their parents and take the train to class. I don't live in America, these are really common situations in my country. 

We all meet up every now and then but A and I see each other more often because we're the only ones in the city at night and I was closest to her anyways. 

Near the end of the semester, a friend from the latter group (B) decided to move to the city too. From then A, B and I met up at least once a week. A and I did also meet separately occasionally because we were used to being by ourselves by now and we liked the quality time. B found out and was hurt. We apologised and explained we didn't want to exclude her but we just wanted to have our own quality time every now and then. We made sure to invite her like 80% of the time. We apologised but insisted on our quality time and the incident sort of passed. 

Then I invited A and B to a party in my building and that's when everything really started. B started texting one of the guys from my building flirtingly after the party when she knew A had a crush on him. She also texted one of my friends from my floor behind my back (I found out from him because he thought I knew). This guy and I had had our fair share of issues and she knew that I was slightly creeped out by him but apparently that didn't stop her from trying to befriend him. I  told her I was uncomfortable with all of this and asked her to stop talking to both of them. She didn't understand and ended up in a relationship with the first guy. 

More stuff happened but character limit, I'll clarify in the comments if you need more info. 

I get that she was new to the city and lonely, but it doesn't give her a free pass to ignore my boundaries... I felt like she was trying to insert herself into my life. I'm pretty sure my dad is a narcissist so boundaries are a very sensitive topic. My sister (who grew up with the same dad) totally understood how I felt and so did A. My other friends said I was an asshole for asking her to stop talking to my roommates. I think I'm allowed to tell her I'm uncomfortable and ask her to stop (I never demanded, I asked politely!). It's up to her to make a decision and I'll accept that decision but she needs to accept the consequences of her choice: me being hurt and not wanting to see her. 

I don't think she's an asshole for doing these things, but for not respecting my boundaries when I talked to her about it. I know I probably could have communicated better with her but I had issues with opening up in the past and didn't know how to express myself. I did what I could but  I probably wasn't clear enough, I'll admit that. However, I was very clear about not wanting her to speak to these guys, I just couldn't put in to words why. I can now.

I use Facebook for some of the funny and interesting stuff, and a little bit for family too, so I don't like seeing constant post after post that she shares about her political opinions. We live in Canada so it's a lot of anti-Trudeau stuff as well as others. 

I can ignore most of what she says (complaining about fake news, shitting on the PM, etc) but there is one topic that gets me so aggravated when I see her post about it. And that is ""climate change is fake"". 

Whatever your standpoint on climate change is doesn't really matter here, I just want to know if I WBTA if I messaged her privately (or commented publicly) about her fucked up views? I could unfriend her but I feel like that's too petty for this situation. 

I just want to ask her to keep her opinions to herself about it, since it really bothers me and she's constantly on there posting about it. I could handle it if it were only once or twice a week, but it's more than once *per day*.

bxdnm7	2019-06-06 06:59:47		AITA for not taking our cat back home?	"So here is the story: two years ago my husband and I got a sweet little kitten. She is the only kitten of my PIL cat. 
I sometimes complain about all the fur she is loosing and all the mess she is making but I still love her. 
My husband and I currently have a baby on the way. Because it's our first and I have no idea what to expect we gave our cat to my PIL for a short time. So when the baby is here we have time to adjust, before I have to take care of a child and an animal. 
Our sweety has been at my PIL for three weeks now and I have never seen her so happy. 

Sideinformationen: My husband and I life in an apartment with three rooms and a balcony. Because of the nearby railroads and crazy laws we can't let her run free. Also she is a total derp and could never climb up or down the balcony. 

My PIL got a big house and an even bigger garden. Our sweety has her mother to play with and is able to run free in the garden. She is beyond happy and healthy. 

Every time I bring this up to my SO he is getting kind of absent and says it's only my decision. If I want to get rid of her it's fine and she can stay with his parents. 
Am I the asshole for not wanting to take her back with us? I just want the best for the little sweety and it breaks my heart if e would take her back to the apartment where she would be alone and bored. It's not like I don't want her anymore. I just want her to be happy."	Not the A-hole	1	0

Around a few weeks ago, I got a call from a customer panicking and asking if we see could find her wedding ring she left in our salon. 

I and the employees looked around but we could not find anything and I told her over the phone. She proceeded to explain that her wedding ring is worth $50,000 and I NEEDED to find the ring or she was going to call the police. 
We did a walk around the store again and I could not find it. I told her that again over the phone. 

She then said I had to check every bodies pockets and bags including employees to see if any of them stole her ring. I told her this is a family business, every employee here is part of my family and I am 100% sure none of them stole her rings. I also said I‚Äôm not checking any of my customers bags or pockets and she can head down here and try and find it herself. 

She said she was heading down there right now and after our phone call she was going to call the police. I told her she can go ahead and do that. 

As she was coming to the salon I walked around the store again and saw rings on a table a customer was sitting at that I thought belonged to said customer. I asked if the rings were hers and she said no they were already at the table when she came. 

I grabbed them just as the customer on the phone came in and told her I found them. She yanked the rings out of my hand and said she was going to call the police back and tell them not to come and left the salon. 

I thought that was the last I‚Äôd hear from her but today she came in and I told her I was denying business by the way she acted. I told her she had no business accusing a family owned business of stealing her belongings and she had no authority to tell me to check my employees/customers pockets and bags. I also told her I understood she was panicking because her rings are expensive, and well it‚Äôs her wedding ring but before you accuse someone or threaten to call the police, come down and try and find the item first. 

This is not a validation post. She told me I was being too harsh and left a review. My friends and family don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm wrong but I‚Äôm trying to see the customers POV. What do you think?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

The story starts a couple years ago when I didn‚Äôt feel like driving my sportier car in the winter. So I bought a beater for about $400 and and a couple hundred dollars in parts and fixed it up. Used it for a little while but eventually sold my sportier car and bought something more practical. My little brother at the time was looking for a job but didn‚Äôt have a way to get there. So i told him if he got a job he could use the beater since I really didn‚Äôt have much use for it anymore. After he had been working for a while I just gave the car to him. If something came up I would help him with it but I told him that it was his car and his responsibility now. Fast forward to today the car is 27 years old now and basically falling apart. I told him that he really needs to save up some money and buy something more reliable because that car is not going to last forever. Well then I see that him and my dad have been watching videos on building gaming PC‚Äôs and what parts to buy and so on. I told him it wasn‚Äôt a good idea because he really needs reliable transportation and not a new gaming PC. He went and bought the PC anyways. Well earlier today I hear him outside trying to start his car and it just isn‚Äôt starting. Then I hear him come inside and walk over to my room. He asks me if I can give him a ride to work and I refused. I told him to ride his new gaming PC to work. Now my father is mad at me and we have been arguing all day about how I am a jerk for refusing to give him a ride. Even though I warned him that the beater car could be junk tomorrow.

I had plans to go hangout with friends today. Her class ends at 5:00 PM and she usually comes home at 5:25 PM. My friend came over at 4:00 PM and we were just waiting because she didn't have the house keys and I also thought it'd be nice if she came with us too. Her phone died and I couldn't contact her. At around 5:35 PM, her phone was on again and all my messages were delivered and I called her 14 times until about 6:30 PM and she wouldn't answer. So I was like ""fuck it"" and and just left with my friend, and left her a text to meet me at the location that we were going to be hanging out so that whenever she saw it, she would know when to come.

&#x200B;

When she saw the text, she said that she was at a classmate's house getting a drink. I said ""Wow. You could have told me."" That escalated into her getting defensive and saying that she ""just checked"" her phone. It was true and understandable, but I expressed to her I was a little upset because I felt like she wasn't considerate enough to think about me to just let me know that she was out and that she wasn't going to be coming home anytime soon and expected me to just sit around the house waiting for her. Basically, I was salty because I delayed my plans and waited for her and she wouldn't answer her phone.

&#x200B;

It wasn't that much of an issue honestly but she was so defensive about it and kept saying ""my phone was turned off I didn't do it intentionally. I have no reason to apologize.""

&#x200B;

The fact of the matter is that I knew that she was distracted and just didn't check her phone and I just expressed to her that I was salty given the fact that I was sitting at home with the dogs like an idiot waiting for her because she doesn't have the keys to get it. She then says ""you didn't have to wait"" which is total bullshit because if she came home and I wasn't there, she would have been locked out and then would have been upset at me.

"I just got into a huge fight with the wife because I was reluctant to call in sick after finding out she's tweaked her back.  She was over at a friend's house and had a back spasm.  Friend gave her a couple advil.  She was able to drive home and walk up the stairs to the house, I got her to lie down.  She seems able to move around, just has pain in her lower back and trouble bending.  Her back has been an ongoing issue lately. 

She basically told me I have to call in sick tomorrow but I was reluctant to do so.  I get 50 hours of paid sick time per year but I dont like using it, don't like calling in to my boss and making excuses.  I'm a telecom technician. I broke my leg last year and am still recovering, I'm on a modified schedule and dont have as much physical labor as I normally would and get fewer jobs assigned to me.   Because of this I've been feeling less valued at the company which plays into my reluctance to call in sick.  We have a 2 year old daughter, she's very active during the day, and a 12 year old who's with his dad this week. 

Essentially she needs to take care of a toddler for 10 hours while I'm gone, and her mother was already planning to come over for about 3 hours to help out, she'd be here between 11 and 2.  

Am I an asshole for asking her ""so... do I absolutely have to call in?""

Edit:  well, I guess I'm an asshole, fair enough.  Just to let people know, I'll update... first of all, surprising as it is, I've actually looked after my toddler before.  It's not that bad.  She plays with stuff, you feed her stuff, she makes messes.  I wasnt expecting wife to clean up and chase after the kid, I was just hoping they would survive while I went to work...  And arent you supposed to keep moving and doing things if you have back spasms?  

Anyway, I called in sick.  I've been up with the baby since 7am, didnt really have to do much.  Fed her some food, let her play with her toys, let her watch Max and Ruby, followed her around while she played in the garden.  Wife seems ok.  She says her back is much better today, and feels bad because I probably could've gone to work.  

Either way, it's nice to have a day off I suppose.

I honestly lost all hope when the end of the semester was approaching as my grades were going spiraling down and I ended up with a ""C"" grade in one class. Well this is where the asshole part comes in. I told my mother that I was going to graduate literally last minute. Thus, I forgot that my mother for some reason tells the entire world.

bxd6f1	2019-06-06 05:58:11	NachoClouds	AITA for getting extremely drunk, vomiting on a flatmate‚Äôs car and then refusing to clean it again?	"So I‚Äôm not used to reddit and I‚Äôm on mobile so I‚Äôm very sorry for bad formatting! I‚Äôm writing this post on behalf of a close friend who will not, so I‚Äôll write it in the first person but I‚Äôm not actually referring to me!

 I‚Äôm a medical student and I just finished my first year exams, so me and my friends had a party at which I drank an entire bottle of gin straight. Needless to say, I got absolutely smashed and quite unwell towards the end of the night, but my friends took me home to my uni flat, which I share with 2 other flat mates.
At this point it was about 3am and I was vomiting in one of the two communal flat toilet when I began having an asthma attack and couldn‚Äôt breathe. 
My girlfriend was there and asked my flat mates for help but they declined and instead decided to complain about me. I stumbled outside (still vomiting) to try to walk to the nearby hospital and this is when I vomit on my flatmate‚Äôs car accidentally before calling an ambulance. 

Skip to the next day, I‚Äôm okay but horrendously hungover. I apologised profusely to the flat mate and cleaned his car for him as soon as I woke up, despite feeling awful from the hangover. I‚Äôm fairly sure that I did a decent job of this and that the car was clean once I‚Äôd finished.  

Now to current day, (6 days after the incident) I get a text saying ‚Äúyou clearly didn‚Äôt clean my car, you need to do it again‚Äù and was publicly called out on our university confessions page. I‚Äôm sure I cleaned it properly last time and he‚Äôs been a dick to me ever since so I‚Äôm not feeling particularly friendly.

bxd536	2019-06-06 05:53:25	StrainedTimes	AITA for not tipping at Sonic	"This happens often.

Let me begin with context. I am paranoid about carrying cash. I have a wad stuffed away at home, but never carry cash on my person. I prefer having my credit/debit cards because if I get mugged, I can freeze them with a phone call. If I am carrying cash, that money is just gone.

Now for the meat of the post. When I go to Sonic, I get inconvenient items. For example, I get mozzarella sticks at 7 am. I work night shift, so my sleep and eating schedule is different than normal. The problem comes in paying/tipping.

When you finish your order, the drive-in has a card reader so you can pay immediately. But, it has no tipping option. This is where the context comes into play.

On one hand,
I feel bad that I am not tipping. I always tip 18-20%. But I am unable to at Sonic. Also, that someone else is suffering because of my paranoia.
On the other hand,
I can't help but feel that my hands are tied. I'm not trying to say I am not to blame in anyway. I would not post here if that were the case. But, a lot of businesses include tipping options when paying with card.


EDIT: After reading a few comments, I think people are mistaken about how employees get paid at Sonic. Sonic employees do not get minimum wage, technically. They are paid 2-3/hr. The employer only has to make up the difference in the case that the employees didn't make enough in tips. I think people are misled by the fact that it is a fast food restaurant."

bxd4yb	2019-06-06 05:52:59	elamewu	AITA for feeling lack of trust/comfort because my roommate wasn‚Äôt honest about borrowing my shirt?	"So I own this black cropped tank that I usually wear to workout, but I haven‚Äôt seen it in a couple weeks. Looked through all my clothes last night and wasn‚Äôt able to find it. So I accepted that I might have misplaced it or simply lost it. 

As I‚Äôm coming home from work this evening, I walk into my driveway and I see my roommate wearing that same black cropped tank top that I‚Äôm missing!!! I obviously greet her as she‚Äôs leaving and I‚Äôm going into my home. But immediately my next question to her was ‚Äú hey is this my black top, I‚Äôve been looking for it.‚Äù And  she looks at me, pauses, and nervously says ‚Äú Uhh I found this in our laundry room, tried it on and thought it was cute and didn‚Äôt think you would mind‚Äù and just say ‚Äúoh okay, yeah it‚Äôs mine. I‚Äôve been looking for it‚Äù She immediately apologizes and asks if I wanted it back, and she‚Äôd change out of it.  I tell her ‚Äúno, it‚Äôs okay‚Äù Despite wanting my shirt back, I‚Äôm not gonna be a dick and make my roommate go change when she‚Äôs already dressed and ready to leave with her boyfriend. Making that move would be extremely petty of me and would rather say a lot about my character. 

While they were gone, I chilled at the house for a bit and decided to grocery shop. When I came home, my roommate and her boyfriend were back at the house, and I could just feel the awkward tension arising. 

It‚Äôs now been over 3 hours, and I‚Äôm still bothered by this situation. I know it‚Äôs not a big deal  nor a  serious matter, but where my issue lies is: Did she ever think or consider to ask if it was cool to borrow my things? Would she have returned my shirt or even ask ‚Äúhey this shirt doesn‚Äôt belong to me, but it was in the laundry room, could this be yours?‚Äù BEFORE deciding to try it on, wear it, borrow it, and possibly keep it with the intent of knowing it‚Äôs mine? 

I‚Äôve never grown up with siblings before, so maybe this is the experience I‚Äôm lacking. I think regardless of the scenario of this situation, she should‚Äôve asked me if it was cool to borrow/wear because my answer would‚Äòbe been 100% yes! I‚Äôm not upset at her wearing/borrowing my things. I‚Äôm disappointed that there wasn‚Äôt permission. She clearly knew that top was mine. 

(To clarify, me and my roommate live in a house and are the only ones who have access to our laundry room) 

I know the next step is to speak with her about the issue and how I would‚Äôve been more appreciative if she would‚Äôve asked instead of assuming I was cool with it. Because now, I don‚Äôt even know if she had intentions of keeping my shirt and playing it off as if it were hers if I didn‚Äôt directly ask. 

I know it‚Äôs just a shirt and I‚Äôm having difficulty letting go and processing my emotions at the moment. I almost feel as though my sense of trust is betrayed because of the lack of honesty. AITA?

"So my wife and I separated 6 years ago and divorced 5 years ago. 4 years ago I became a Sugardaddy to a wonderful girl. In the beginning it was a lot like a regular relationship except that sex was a more sure thing. 3 years ago we moved in together. In most respects we are like any other couple that have been together and cohabitated for 3 years. And she receives a healthy allowance as well as all living expenses. 

There are a few reasons we will not be together for life. First she really wants children. I don‚Äôt. Honestly I have kids that are nearly her age. Secondly, she really wants to be married. I‚Äôm 10 years to retirement and not taking the chance of giving away half my stuff a second time. And finally she wants to live in a big city. I don‚Äôt. The minute I can, I will move back to the small town I love.

bxd383	2019-06-06 05:46:56	thesecondgaycousin	AITA for not telling my cousin his religious family knows he's gay?	"Throwaway for reasons. My mother's family immigrated to the US from Italy. My generation were born here. Most of my family are very Catholic and conservative. I myself am a lesbian. The only people in my family I am out to are my mom (who is very progressive) and my cousin Vinny. Vinny and I were close as children. We are months apart in age so we were in the same classes in school. People often thought we were twins. Vinny has a brother Gino but he is older than us so wasn't around much.

I lost touch with Vinny in highschool when I moved cities. We reconnected at our grandpa's memorial service as adults. When we did, it became apparent to me that Vinny seemed very, flamboyantly gay. I never brought this up with him for several reasons. Mainly, if he wanted to come out to me, he would. And tbh I didn't know him well enough as an adult to make assumptions. Straight men can be flamboyant and there is nothing wrong with that. Most importantly, it was none of my business. 

When I came out to my mom, I came out to Vinny too. I asked him not to share my gayness with the family as they are openly homophobic. He agreed and thanked me for sharing such an important thing with him. I half expected him to come out to me too, but when he didn't I figured either he's not ready or there was nothing to tell and both options are fine by me. 

My Mom told me today that the family knows Vinny is gay (she had suspected for some time too). I was floored as I never thought he would come out to his parents. But it turns out, he didn't come out at all. Enter shitty brother Gino. Arguably the most religious and bigoted member of my family. A colleague of Gino's mentioned he ran into Vinny and his boyfriend in the city. Gino lost his mind. He told his parents and they are also a wreck. It broke my heart to hear this and I could only imagine what Vinny must be going through. I texted Vinny and said I had heard his family found out about his ""personal relationships"" and offered my support. I also said if it would help to ""tell his family about me"" so he is not alone in this, I'm ok with it. I used vague language because I was trying the be as sensitive as possible.

Vinny responded thanking me, but was confused as to what his parents know. I brought it up with my mom and she said ""Vinny doesn't know his family knows about him. They asked me not to tell him because they're still upset"". I felt so awful. When Vinny assumed the text was mixed up and asked if I meant his personal relationships with his parents are strained, I panicked and said yes because I didn't want to cause a blow up. I just played off my vague language as I heard things are tense with your parents (they generally are for other reasons) and I'm here if you need me. 

I feel like it's his right to know he's been outed. But at the same time, I don't think it's my place to get involved. I also worry that if I tell him, I could cause an even bigger rift in his family.

bxczyb	2019-06-06 05:35:38	ayeacheoheleee	AITA For asking my friend to pay a fee for being late on rent?	"My wife and I have a friend who was being kicked out of their current apartment and in desperate need of a place to live. We had just bought an RV, and could honestly use the extra cash, so we offered to rent out the space in the RV to them once it's ready to be lived in. The RV was a bit of a fixer-upper, so it has been undergoing renovations; however our friend was in need of a place immediately and couldn't wait that long. So, trying to be nice and help her out so that she doesn't have to live in a homeless shelter (that was literally her only other option at that point), we offer to let her rent out our garage until the RV is finished and we would even discount her rent until she was able to actually move into the RV. Our friend agreed to this and moved in a few months ago. Unfortunately, there was a little more wrong with the RV than we first realized, and the repairs ended up taking us a bit longer than intended since we didn't have the funds to get it all repaired at once. 

Everything has been going just fine until a couple weeks ago she decided to go on a road trip with some new friends she made. She told us she was going to be gone for at least a week, maybe two. Well, the first rolls (around about Nine days into her trip) and we hear nothing. We figured that she was probably busy having fun and that she would get back to us when she was able to. Four more days go by and we don't hear a word from her about the rent money, so we finally decided to message her and see how things are going and when we could expect her rent money. (Side Note: She agreed to the prices of $450 once in the RV, and $250 for the time she's in the garage. We did research before giving her a price because we didn't want to overcharge her, and the price we came up with was still cheaper than renting a single room in an apartment in our area. We all opted to not bother with a lease agreement (I know, dumb mistake) as we were friends and thought we could trust them to pay their rent on time.)

She then proceeds to tell us that she had some unexpected expenses, and could only pay us $150 this month. We then asked if she could pay a late fee to help cover the late fees we will be incurring from the bills that we planned to pay with her rent money. Our friend then says that she is being used and not valued as a friend because we asked her to pay a late fee and that she doesn't even like staying in the garage. So we tell her that we aren't trying to use her for money,that nobody is forcing her to rent the space, and that we just want to break even.
At this point we honestly can't tell if we're being the assholes here or not. We never intended to devalue her as a friend, or rip her off. We also had no idea that the Garage was that big of an issue for her, as she hasn't really said anything other than the occasional ""How's the RV coming along?""
So we are just honestly wanting to know if we are being unreasonable here. 
I'll post the exact text exchange in the comments.

Edit for clarification: We never told her that the RV was going to be done for sure in any set amount of time. We told her MAYBE a month, but that was never a guarantee, so we're not sure where she's getting the two weeks estimate from, because that was never the case. The tent was entirely her choice though, and honestly makes her situating sound worse than it is. We offered to help her turn the garage into more of a bedroom until the RV was finished, and we set her up with a little stovetop, microwave, and mini fridge. But she declined the help to turn it more into a room and just wanted to set up her tent."	Asshole	0	0

bxczjr	2019-06-06 05:34:17	undercoverweeaboo	AITA for not punishing my dog for eating my roomie's food?	"Notable details:
-My roommate likes to leave food on the floor of his room and by the couch on the floor. He never takes the trash out when I'm at work and instead leaves the full trashbags by the door.
-when I first adopted my dog around a year back she was extremely overweight and is still on a diet to get to her healthy ideal. She also is a pig, however she is well trained and will never counter-surf. Another thing worth noting is other than this problem she is EXTREMELY well behaved and never chews, pees on the floor, etc.

You can probably see where this is going. My roommate has been getting steadily more pissed off every time he leaves his door open and my dog gets into his bags of food left on the floor of his room. This last time she got into a whole box of cereal and he told me I should ""punish"" her for it. I don't see why since the food was on the floor, the door was open, and she's just doing what a dog does. I've been just as pissed at him because I'm worried that his laziness will cause her to eat something dangerous and get sick. She never gets into my food because I put it in the kitchen, where food belongs.

Tldr: roommate is pissed because he leaves shit on the floor for my fat dog to inevitably get into, wants me to ""punish"" her. AITA for not feeling sympathetic?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I finish work at 10pm, get home at 10:30 and try to get to bed by 12:30. My husband typically stays up later than this (1-1:30, gets up at 9 but he‚Äôs always tired. I try and encourage him to come sooner.) and sometimes I can‚Äôt sleep until he comes to bed. Last night was one of those nights, so I called out for him to come to bed at around 1. He was busy playing     Total War and yelled he was busy and that he‚Äôd come in soon

I‚Äôm just about to drift off when he comes in, gets into bed, gets out, turns the light on because the sheets aren‚Äôt sitting right and starts to try and straighten them out. He‚Äôs making me cold and is asking me to help him pull the blankets around and at this point I‚Äôm cranky. I can‚Äôt pull the blankets the way he wants me to from my position and I lose it. I tell him to F off and that he should just make the bed when he gets up in the morning (he gets up after me) the way he likes it instead of throwing them off like a spaz in the morning and leaving them there like that. 

At this point he storms off to go and sleep in the bed in the other room, which is tiny and the blankets aren‚Äôt as good. We both know he‚Äôs going to have a bad time. I‚Äôm yelling at him to just stop it and come back to bed, he refuses and we both have fitful sleeps in both beds. 

This morning he didn‚Äôt really speak to me. Before he left for work I said I wanted to talk about it when I got home from work. I forget what he said next but he told me he was upset I had called him a spaz. He‚Äôs dyslexic and calling him things like that really bothers him. If isn‚Äôt specifically choose that word to hurt him, it was the first one that came out of my mouth. I told him I‚Äôm sorry for calling him that and for flying into the rage I did. I was tired and trying to sleep and he woke me up. 

He went to leave, I told him I still love him even though I‚Äôm upset at him, he says something to the effect of yeah right.

So this story starts a couple months ago when I ""loose"" one of my books. I nearly failed the semester because of this, and later found out that it had been stolen by a person who I'll be calling Z for now on.

Z wasn't in our class when I found out about this, and I was understandably upset about it, so I decided to report this to the teachers with the help of a friend who supported me. She claimed to not know the book was mine but I know she was lying.

Z is generally not very friendly towards me. Even before she stole from me, she insulted me behind and in front of me, when I have never done anything to her. She's generally quite impulsive and aggressive so I just didn't want anything to do w/ her.

Fast forward a few months and I find that my friends, who I thought supported me, talk regularly to Z and hang out with her. I would have no problem with this had she apologised for stealing and insulting me, but that isn't the case.

I don't know if my friends even know about her stealing from me and insulting me, so I wouldn't feel comfortable pulling a ""her-or-me"" type ultimatum.

bxckgm	2019-06-06 04:43:52	WarlockMasterRace02	AITA for getting mad at my friend	"So my friend and I play destiny together. I wasn‚Äôt able to play and he was. There is a mode that alternates each week and it allows you to kinda cheat the game. No one plays it so you get 8 people in 2 groups and communicate until you match up with each other. This allows you to farm each other for kills and objectives. My friend did this for himself and then tried to do this for me. I said that I would help him complete his campaign (which he is totally capable of doing by himself) if he got me the gun. He wasn‚Äôt assertive and let other people who had less progression than me go first and when it got to my turn (him playing on my account) the group quit. He says he wasted 5 hours of his time it was more like 3 and that he demands I help him with his WHOLE campaign which takes 8+ hours to complete. I‚Äôve got other stuff to do and told him to fuck off and that our agreement was that he GET me the gun and I‚Äôd help him and he didn‚Äôt.

Tldr: Friend tried to get a gun on my account, wasted time, wasn‚Äôt successful and now expects me to help him. Our deal was he complete the quest and I help him.

I recently got into a argument with my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù he got really mad at me saying ‚Äúyou need to change your fucking attitude it‚Äôs unbelievable what people are like these days.‚Äù (This was said in a group important later) so me and him went back and forth over the weekend and last night he called me a stalker and other things and he got the other person in the group chat to go against me and call me a bully etc. Later when we was making fun of me I believe he was talking to the friend in dms and then the other person wanted to help me and ‚Äúfight the friend in our group chat‚Äù the same kid also said I was ungrateful (which I cried to because they had been my friends in the saddest point in my life) I said no and to please leave me alone for now. Earlier today one of kids told me not to contact him further and said the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù was right so I‚Äôm very pissed and sad because those guys were my only friends and I‚Äôm really shy and hate talking to people so I find it hard to make friends unless someone offers to be my friend

bxcjqh	2019-06-06 04:41:29	MasterMoeMeme	AITA for not wanting my good friend to date an a-hole?	"         My good friend, a straight female has had an interest in a guy, which she recently told me about. I know the guy for being an incessant troublemaker. Some things on his record include but are not limited to: getting into a needless fight at an ice skating rink, stomping on the spokes of a lyme bike (the things now broken), and being a general idiot/troublemaker. He also dated one of my other friends, and caused her to be pretty depressed seeing as none of her friends liked him, including me. This boy has been pretty good friends with my close friend, and she apparently liked him for a while before she told me because she was scared of my judgement. 
           While I think he‚Äôs horrible for her, she praises him a lot. She‚Äôs called him a ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù and ‚Äúreally nice‚Äù. She also noted that this kindness is only to her and her friend group, which he is in. I‚Äôve never seen him demonstrate the fact that he is a ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù or ‚Äúnice person‚Äù. She says he makes her happy, but I feel like so many better guys could make her happy. I‚Äôm afraid of her getting sucked into bad things because of him. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being overprotective, but I want her to be happy, just not with an asshole.

I usually tip at least 18%, but normally I tip 20% because I know what it feels like to work for tips. So tonight I went to eat. We were there about an hour before they closed. It took about 15 minutes for our server to get our drink order, then another 10 to get our food order. The server never asked my friend for a refill on her drink, never refilled the water, and never asked if we wanted more fries (we were at a restaurant with bottomless fries). On top of that she brings one check for 3 of us, before even asking if we wanted dessert. As soon as she brought the check she disappeared for another 20 minutes while we waited for her to come back to split the check. I went to the restroom while we waited and when I came back she walked to our table looked at me and said ""I'm just waiting on you to close out"". While I already had my credit card on the receipt ready to go. 

So I didn't tip her. And now that I am home I feel a little bad, but at the same time I know she gave shitty service so I feel a little justified. So AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxcdi1	2019-06-06 04:21:47		AITA for cancelling a date I scheduled because I met someone that I developed feelings for prior to the date?	"Background‚Äî I met the person I scheduled a date with on a dating app. Due to school and distance, he and I have never actually met, only texted / snapchatted back and forth. However, we‚Äôve been in contact for a few months now, on and off.

After finally moving back home for the summer, it seemed we would get the opportunity to meet. We scheduled a date for Friday. On Monday night, I went out and met someone completely by chance at a comedy club. Nothing happened between us, but the awesome vibe we had was obvious. We really, really hit it off. Chemistry through the roof. We hung out the next day, and the day after that. We just instantly clicked.

I felt very conflicted because I‚Äôd set up this Friday date, but honestly, I was really feeling this ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù guy. I knew the whole time at dinner, I‚Äôd be thinking about someone else‚Äî so I decided to be honest with the person I‚Äôd set up the date with and admit that I‚Äôd met someone. I know I could‚Äôve lied and just said I‚Äôm not interested, but I did this for two reasons. 

1)I knew I‚Äôd end up referencing the man I‚Äôm seeing now on social media in some way, and I didn‚Äôt want the first guy watching out for my profiles only to feel hurt and lied to / maybe assume I‚Äôd been seeing the new guy this whole time. 

2)I truly did feel guilty, and wanted to be open with him.

The guy I scheduled the date with insisted I was irrational, disloyal and uncaring. Since we‚Äôd never agreed to exclusivity, or even met for that matter, the disloyal comment seemed unjustified. The other two accusations might hold weight, though. He also said my ‚Äúlack of foresight‚Äù that i might meet someone didn‚Äôt excuse calling off our date.

He told me to stop contacting him, so I blocked his number to avoid a random 2 am angry rant / slew of insults (he has an extremely short fuse). I also wanted to adhere to his wishes that we cut contact.

To be clear, I completely understand why he‚Äôs upset and he has every right to feel hurt. I just can‚Äôt tell if I owed him something or not. Any time I feel guilty or ashamed I assume I‚Äôve done something objectively wrong, but in this situation I can‚Äôt tell. For further context, Surprise Guy and I are now exclusive and we‚Äôre crazy about each other, so I guess I made the right choice, I‚Äôm just not sure about my methodology.

bxcd6k	2019-06-06 04:20:50		AITA for not wanting my dad to live with me after i finally move out even though he bought me a house?	"Ever since i was little my dad has been extremely manipulative, and emotionally, physically, and mentally abusive. But, he‚Äôs also loved and cared about me, and he went as far as to buy me and my siblings all houses so we wouldn‚Äôt have to struggle to get one later in life and he‚Äôs renting them out to other people while we still live with him. He also has a brain condition called Chiari Malformation, and doesn‚Äôt take any medicine for it or anything because he‚Äôs crazy antivax and stuff, but drinks beer all day and smokes down cigarettes like he‚Äôs drinking water. he goes through 2 packs a day. Which is crazy considering my mom passed away from lung cancer a couple years ago. 

but as my dad got older, he stopped getting physical but nothing else changed. if anything he got more obnoxious. he never talks normal. ALWAYS yelling. and since i was always promised a house, i never started setting money aside to get one. so here i am stoked about moving out in like a year, and my dad starts talking about wanting to move in the downstairs of the house. i told him i‚Äôd just let him have it and i‚Äôd save up for my own house because tbh, i was excited to get away from him. but he said ‚Äúyou already got one‚Äù and is like trying to force me into living with him to take care of him.

It‚Äôs his worst fear to be stuck in a nursing home, but quite frankly, thats not really my problem once i turn 18. but even if i did want to shelter him, he would destroy my house and i‚Äôm not okay with that. he saves his beer cans because he‚Äôs trying to melt them to make sculptures with so he just has about 100 bags of beer cans spread throughout the backyard that he‚Äôs been saving up forever. 
he smokes in the house and gets ashes everywhere. and he don‚Äôt care

he also apparently has problems with his bowels and ‚Äúcan‚Äôt shit right or at all‚Äù so he relies on blackberries that he keeps in the freezer for weeks but throws a fit the second anyone else opens them, but when he eats them, he eats 3 and acts like they‚Äôre some magical remedy that‚Äôll cure him. yet he also shits on the floor all the time and wont clean it up. 

once, i stepped in it and when i brought it up to him he said ‚Äúi pooped myself but not right there‚Äù to try and back himself up. he then claimed he didn‚Äôt see the big brown splotches and laid back down because ‚Äúhis feet hurt‚Äù 

once he got drunk with one of his friends and shit himself and had it running down his legs and me and my little brother (i was 13 at the time and he was 9) had to carry him up the stairs and help him bathe and he got naked and sat in the bottom of the tub slurring his words, and reaches out of the tub, grabs his shitty boxers, and starts dunking them in the bath water that he was in. we then had to help him in bed. he shit from the bathroom, to his bed and me and my brother had to clean it up

 i‚Äôve been pretty thrilled to escape. WIBTA if i don‚Äôt be his caretaker even though he worked his whole life to set us up?"		1	0
bxccti	2019-06-06 04:19:41	cyxcii	AITA Friend treats me like social media	"So my best friend of three years has a habit of going out with friends, which doesn‚Äôt bother me. What does is that she goes out with her friends doesn‚Äôt invite me then relies on me to keep her entertained through text when her friends get boring (she does 2-3 things with friends excluding me every month since I‚Äôve known her) Out of the three years I‚Äôve known her I‚Äôve only been invited to four things involving her other friends.

When she turns to me, in these situations majority it's because she wants entertainment not because she had something she wanted to tell me. Side point I believe whoever you‚Äôre spending time with should get majority of your focus. I try to end her texts because it's uninteresting conversation and I want her to fully spend time with her friends. If I had to guesstimate she‚Äôs done this about 20 times and every time I have ended the conversation early. She has previously teased me about not liking when she this and continues to do it.

This most recent time she came to me ‚Äúbored‚Äù pouting for my attention I ended conversation and then she texted me again hours later still with company so I replied and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with you‚Äù I haven‚Äôt messaged her for 4-5 days because I‚Äôm still annoyed at her, she's tried to message me twice, once to tell me about how her day at work was and other pouting that I haven't messaged her.

I intend to talk this over with her when I feel like associating with her but for now I‚Äôm done with it

bxc9l3	2019-06-06 04:09:14		AITA for feeling that my Aunt stole my inheritance?	"My grandma died a few years ago. She had 4 daughters. The eldest had 1 daughter, the 2nd had a daughter and a son, the 3rd had a Son and a daughter (me), then the 2nd had another son, then the 4th daughter had a son and a daughter.

So.. 4 daughters, grandchildren aged 40 through 7 at time of death. 

I was sent regularly every summer to be with Grandma. We'd visit the senior center, catered to others with limited means and just be sympathetic to those in the community. 

When my grandma died, I was broken. Weird, because I was the outcast of the family - due to having a vibrant, living family from my father's side. I always felt I was lucky to have 2 sides of my lineage proud to have me.

When she died, all daughters and grandchildren were present to request a momentos. I asked for paintings from her bedroom. Everyone agreed that it was fine. 

I lived out of state and assumed they'd be sent to me when the house was sold. 

6months later I inquired about the paintings and was told that 'no one ever really gave permission' and that because I didn't take them, they were up for grabs. 

I've repeatedly requested them from my Aunt who continually denies me. 

AITA because I hate her with all of myself for denying me the only thing I ever asked for? They're nothing of value. She's constantly homeless and selling off valuables. She 'claimed' grandma's car (that aunt#1 paid for) as her own, racked up $10's of thousands of debt on grandma's credit cards due to her cheating on her man and running away to Hawaii. When Grandma died, she 'squated' in her house till aunt #1 sold it.

She's been here since the 1960's from Mexico and has yet to earn her citizenship.

I feel she literally stole my inheritance because I couldn't fly home with the paintings and has made up every excuse in the book to keep me from having a promised momento after 7 years while claiming hardship.

I want to disassociate with the whole side of the family because of her.

bxc8fr	2019-06-06 04:05:32	Dirtyrottensmoker01	AITA for being a dirty rotten smoking liar?	" I'm (40F) a dirty rotten smoker. Yes, I know it's disgusting and bad for me. Your criticism into my dirty rotten smoking habit will be politely ignored.

I live in Australia where in their ~~attempt to stamp out smoking~~ desperate money-grabbing excitement have taxed cigs so a pack of 50 is more than $55. You do the math. Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm also a dirty rotten smoking fool.

So I live in a non-smoking building. Fair enough. I'm a considerate smoker (cough). So I do my walk of shame down to the street where there's a little wall where I park my butt and indulge in my filthy habit.

I am approached at least 5-6 times a day by people wanting to bum a cig. I must look like a pushover as often there's 2-3 other people out there and they make a beeline directly for me. Sometimes I'm feeling nice and they've been polite so I give them one. There's a sweet man who comes by fortnightly and tells me God loves me every time...it's adorable. So I'm not a complete A...I think, but put it this way, I would be completely broke if I gave everyone who asked one.

Some started taking the piss and turning up daily however I put an empty pack in front of me and they got the picture and either vanished or dialled it back.

I have a good job however have a teenager, am a single mother and have had to work for everything I have. I have been through bad times in the past and have been without cigs on occasion...so I get it. But I've never been the type to beg off complete strangers unless I was drunk.

There's one woman who to begin with I gave her one each time she asked (maybe once a week) until her visits became daily. I think she may be homeless and perhaps mentally impaired...I'm not sure. And when I say asks, it is more like demands. I tried the empty pack and she would argue with me. TBH it is tiresome. She's also harassed me when I've been talking on the phone. She just expects me to hand over free cigs at her pleasure and doesn't get that I'm literally doing her a favour.

Yesterday she came and I did the 'sorry last one' thing. She said ""I know, I know, it's always your last one"" and then just stood there. I said nothing more and turned to my book.

I was outside longer than usual and about 20 minutes or so after she left, she walked by again...just as I was lighting another cig...oops.

She looked at me, looked at the cigarette, smiled sarcastically and walked on.

So now I feel really guilty and like I can't ever say no to her again if she comes by.

bxc8dm	2019-06-06 04:05:21	sweetrazor19	AITA because I refuse to pay for my niece and her friends‚Äô feminine products at my brothers request?	"My brother, who has 5 children with 3 different women, sent me a text about a month ago asking me to buy feminine products for my 17 year old niece and her best friend that lives with them.  

I‚Äôm going to try to make this story as short as possible.  My brother, 36, was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic at a very young age.  As time has gone by, he‚Äôs been able to manage his disability with the proper medication and therapy; however, he‚Äôs always been very spoiled and acts like everyone owes him something.  Example: he was living on the streets for quite awhile and called me randomly (it was out of the blue because I had tried to help for years, but he just pushed me away making the relationship very unhealthy) one night telling me he was ready for rehab and to please help him.  I then paid $8000 out of pocket to send him to a very nice residential rehab. Because of the fact that it was private pay, he was allowed more luxuries than most residents restricted by insurance.   Unbeknownst by me, this meant less supervision (that‚Äôs a whole other post), so because he makes poor choices, he snuck in a former resident which is against the rules and was kicked out after one week.  That means, I spend $8000 on room and board at a rehab to get my brother off of street drugs because he was self medicating, FOR A WEEK!   I asked him why he thought he could break the rules and his response was ‚ÄòI paid cash, so I don‚Äôt have to do what the general population does.‚Äô  I had to firmly remind him that HE did not pay cash, I DID!  I told him that I would no longer support him financially and to never ask me for money again.  

That leads me to this post.  He has been holding down a steady job and has even earned a few promotions over the last couple of years, so he seems to be doing well.  But, he‚Äôs constantly bragging to my family and anyone that will listen about how he‚Äôs always ‚Äòdone it on his own‚Äô and how much money he‚Äôs now making.  He sent me a message asking me to purchase feminine products for my niece (whom he now has custody of because her mom is also a drug addict, go figure) and her best friend, who lives with them because ‚Äòshe has a bad home life‚Äô.  I told him ‚Äòit sounds to me like if they‚Äôre old enough to have their period they should get a job‚Äô.  And, ‚Äòsince you‚Äôre doing so well financially I‚Äôm not really sure why you need my help‚Äô.  I also informed him that when he took on another individual because he wanted to help her that her needs were his responsibility, not mine.  

Now, I was raised poor, so I know what it feels like to do without and to work for what you need, so I understand my response was harsh because my niece shouldn‚Äôt have to do without just because her dad doesn‚Äôt have the financial means to support her.  So, AITA for not buying the necessary products that my niece and her friend require by no fault of their own because I‚Äôve been taken advantage of by brother, her dad, in the past?

EDIT: He has, multiple times in the past, taken advantage of my generosity.   Used my CC to purchase things without my consent (I found out because my bank called me due to suspicious activity) because I gave him the number (incredibly stupid) to pay his electric bill, used my nieces as leverage to get what he wants, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll tell them you said ....... if you don‚Äôt do this for me‚Äô. And, he even told me one time when I asked him to reimburse me after purchasing something for him on the premise that he would pay me back the following week ‚ÄòI‚Äôm your brother and it‚Äôs my right to screw you over‚Äô and walking away smugly without paying me a cent.  So, there has been manipulative behavior in the past that made me leery with the request, which is why I did immediately shut it down.  I feel/felt like I was stuck in a cross fire between his greed and my nieces needs and that has brought me to this post."		0	0
