c522yb	2019-06-25 03:59:57	26Haoleguy	WIBTA if I went to the concert of my favorite band knowing my ex will be there and that she more than likely doesn’t want to see me?	"To keep this shortish, I’m gonna skip over a novel with of details and just say it: I broke this girl’s heart. My drinking spiraled out of control and I couldn’t get a grip on it. By the time I had finally distilled the problem down to “it’s either her or booze,” it was too late. I’m sober now, but she won’t talk to me. I’m blocked on everything, and rightfully so. After I had been sober a few months, I reached out via letter which was VERY controversial in terms of breaching her boundaries. I had her address through some odd circumstance (I didn’t do any Jon from You shit I swear) and I decided to send her a letter despite her obvious signaling to leave her alone. On the surface that might sound outrageously selfish, and maybe it was. But, the essence of the letter was “Hey, I finally figured out why I’m such a cunt. I stopped doing the thing that makes me a cunt. In the off chance that you would be interested in not-cunt me, I still love you, and I am without cunt qualities.” Though, I like to think I put it a little more eloquently.

Anyway, back when we were dating, I loved this band—still do. Being the sweet heart she is, she bought us tickets to go see them. And being the wretched, decrepit, raging alcoholic I was, I got too drunk and got us kicked out for getting caught peeing outside the concert. We never saw them.

Fast forward to sometime later, when we are broken up but still talking, she finds that they are playing again. Not near either of us, but somewhere. She buys a ticket, so naturally so do I.

Fast forward again to now. We don’t talk. She never responded to my letter, i.e. she doesn’t want to see me, and this concert is coming up in July. I have the ticket, I do want to see them—it would honestly be healing in coming to terms with my past, but I can’t help but to think that the only \[or at least a BIG\] reason I am motivated to go would be to pursue the off chance of seeing her. I know some of you guys might be thinking “how do you not know whether or not X is what is motivating you, or Y?” Well, idk what to say other than alcoholism taught me that I can be pretty good at lying to myself, sadly. It’s not like it’s a small venue though, it holds just under 10,000 people. Maybe you guys can enlighten me as to what the odds of running into someone at an event that big actually are, because I’m not as well acquainted concerts as I would like to be.

I just love her. I just want her to be happy, and I don’t think seeing me unexpected like that would be a healthy experience for her.

Lastly, whereas I am admittedly at a loss in identifying where my motives lay, I can say with confidence that if I were to go, I wouldn’t try to reach out or look for her. I’d be lying though if I said I have the self-control to not scan the crowd.

So, what do you guys think? WIBTA?

&#x200B;

Update: Ok thanks guys. This was way more back and forth than I would have expected. After thinking about it some, I dont think I'm the AH, but I'm not gonna go. I love that band but id be going for her, and that does make me the AH. If I love them that much, ill see them later in life. If I love her that much, just gotta leave it alone. Fuck, I hope she calls someday though."	Asshole	0	0

Now I'm a really lay back guy and wasnt controlling of who my gf hung out with but she would tell me about her gay friend who she said would constantly talk crap about me to my girlfriend. She would never put a stop to it or defend me and would tell me about the things he said the day after it happened as if it were nothing and would insist that I not be upset when she went to hang out with him. This eventually turned into a recurring argument and all though was not the reason for our break up, definitly aided in my decision to break things off with her.	Not the A-hole	0	0
c51wo3	2019-06-25 03:45:48	fzooey78	WIBTA - for sending screenshot of racist chat to guy's family	"Matched with a fella on Tinder and quickly realized we weren't going to be a good fit at the end of the evening of some text based conversation. When he followed up the next day, I briefly told him it probably wasn't a match, and wished him well.  


I know the smart decision would probably have been to unmatch him myself at this point and move on. But I didn't, because he immediately got ugly and aggressive. Lord knows petty me loves to troll a troll. He proceeded to pull out all the creepiest ""Pick up Artist"" moves and suggested he wanted to f$#k me in relatively explicit terms, and say that I should be so lucky considering he was much better looking than me.    


Amongst the reasons he's so much better looking than I am? He claims it's because he's Punjabi and I'm South Indian. I knew full well what he meant, but I played dumb and pushed for clarity. He straight up said I was uglier because I was dark, and everyone knows ""South Indians are bottom of the barrel. Just like Russians are for white people. It's the way the world works. Everyone knows it.""  


He then said I'd be lucky to have him and so on. I did, finally, at this point unmatch him. But only after I screen shotted the conversation.   


I did warn him earlier that if he continued, I would share it on social media, which didn't stop him. He was pretty easy to google search, and hit the jackpot when I found he's connected to 6  of his family members on Facebook.   


WIBTA if I group messaged his family with the bigoted portion of the conversation?  


&#x200B;

**NOTE**\-  To clarify some things if this post seems confusing, Punjab is a region in the north of India. If you're from the north, you're typically lighter complected. If your family is from the south of India, there's a greater chance you have a relatively darker complexion. A lot of cultures, Indian in this case, find lighter skin more attractive than dark skin. This is particularly ludicrous because we were both born and raised in America. It's bananas, but some people remain biased this way. If you need more clarity, please don't hesitate to ask.  


**NOTE**\- I recognize racist is not the appropriate term here. ""Colorist"" probably is, but much harder for people to understand in a subject line.  Apologies if the misuse of the word bothered anyone."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c51wne	2019-06-25 03:45:44	LadyMaryCrawley91	AITA for wanting my pet back?	"I traveled to Australia for 6 months, and I left the care of my pet rabbit to her. Now, I’ve been staying with her for the past few weeks while I organize my life. This whole time, I’ve been trying to figure out the elephant in the room — the rabbit. 


See, I know she’s grown attached to my rabbit, but at the end of the day she’s *my* pet, and besides, she already has two cats of her own. So I thought maybe she’d understand that I’m taking her when I move to my new apartment. Also, never did I once say she would be keeping her when I return. 



So I came home from work today, I was kind nervous to talk about this with her.  At the end of the day, I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. But I just bluntly said, “So, I’d like to take my rabbit with me when I leave. I missed her a whole bunch.” Then she left the room, and I could hear her starting sob.


I apologized. Then she told me I was disrespectful, and selfish. “You didn’t for once take MY feelings into consideration? I’ve grown attached to her and you expect me to just be okay with giving her up like that?”  Then we had this huge fight. I even pointed out to her that since I’ve been home, I haven’t seen her actively do anything for the rabbit.   “Well you’re home now, so I don’t have to” she said.

*general side note, I wasn’t pleased with the state of my rabbit when I came home. Her nails looked like they hadn’t been trimmed since I left, and they must be kept trimmed. She told me to  “be careful with how much food I’m giving her” because she can’t afford a new bag of food this week. Her cage was absolutely filthy. Obviously I went right back to taking care of her...since she’s mine after all* 


So like, she stormed out of the apartment after this huge brawl we had. I said some nasty things to her, I will admit, and I feel bad for doing so. At the end of the day, I want my rabbit back, I just want her back.

I didn't quite hear what she wanted for coffee so I assumed she wanted the usual long black. When the order came, she said ""that's the wrong order"" and between the waitress and I we were trying to set it right to get the order right and she said ""oh it's fine, it's just this idiot got the order wrong"". She later apologised and I said ""this is not the first time you've done it"" and she said ""no, this is the second"", to which I responded ""well that doesn't sound particularly apologetic"". Cue a few minutes when the food came and we ate in silence, which got me pretty annoyed since I was the one that was called an idiot in public. We were supposed to watch a movie afterwards and she still didn't want to talk so I said I'd walk home instead if she's upset (she drove) and walked out. Later when we talked she then said that she felt embarassed herself since the waitress and I were making a scene over getting the order right and she tried to diffuse it by ""affectionately"" calling me an idiot.

I've never taken public humiliation well and I feel like I could've taken it better but the tone she used when calling me an idiot, and what I've been through in terms of work has made me particularly sensitive to being called an idiot (she knows about this) so I'm here wonder AITA for reacting the way I did."

c51t57	2019-06-25 03:38:20	sunnydew22	AITA for not letting my mom and her boyfriend stay the night at my house while their A/C is out?	"So for context, me and my fiancé live together in a house with our 2 month old son. My mom and her boyfriend live maybe 10 minutes away along with my sister. 
My mom and her boyfriend just started dating not that long ago, and he moved in with her very quickly. It’s only been about a month since he moved in. I have only met him twice because I have been very busy adjusting. Both times the boyfriend came over to my house with Mom and spoke to me just a handful of times, so we have no idea what this guy is about. My sister who lives with them is always telling me about weird things he does around their house and how she just overall doesn’t trust him. He’s also already “moved out” then BACK again due to a fight between him and Mom.
Anyways, my little family had a very busy day today so I was napping when we got home. My mom texted my fiancé and said that the air conditioner is out at her house and asked if her and boyfriend could come stay with us tonight.
*My mom has stayed the night at our house several times (by herself) to help out when we first got home from the hospital from having our son.*
Well, fiancé read her text very quickly and told her sure that would be fine. Once he read the message again he realized she said her AND boyfriend. Well fiancé is absolutely not comfortable with that so he woke me up and told me to text her and call it off. I didn’t really want to do it because I felt bad since he had already told her yes, but at the same time I really am not comfortable with him staying the night either. Not that I don’t trust my mom, I just don’t know ANYTHING about this guy and he is extremely shady. We’ve also found out a few things about his past that are not very savory.
I texted Mom in the nicest way possible and told her that we weren’t comfortable with him staying the night here with her. She is welcome to come stay alone, but I already know my fiancé is not gonna sleep a wink if the boyfriend stays. I know that it royally pissed my mom off but she just said “ok” and we left it at that. 
I called my sister and asked her what she was gonna do, and she’s staying at a friend’s house. I told her what I told my mom, and sister told me that I was being asshole-ish and that I should text my mom back to tell her to come over anyway. But I’m just not gonna let them come stay even if it’s only for one night if neither me nor fiancé want him over here. We will even offer to pay for a hotel for the night if it’s a huge problem. But at this point I think they’re just gonna stay at their house in the heat. 
Does that make me an asshole for telling her she can’t come over if she brings her boyfriend, that nobody trusts, with her to stay? I am honestly in the middle of a moral dilemma at the moment. Note that fiancé is of course not bothered in the slightest, lol.

c51sar	2019-06-25 03:36:34	officebirthdaydrama2	AITA for still doing an office birthday tradition after it was voted out	"Last year I started working at a smaller company. When I arrived there was a birthday tradition where our head teacher bought a large card (they were really nice, usually 3D and everyone got a sticker where they wrote something and stuck it on) and gave it to whoever’s birthday it was. This has been going on for a while, and I assumed since she was head teacher this was part of her duties.

After a few months, another staff member messaged our work group chat and said the head teacher had been buying these cards with her own money and had to organize everything just out of goodwill, but she doesn’t want to do it anymore and she wants to share the responsibility. The timing on this was a bit poor, because it was someone’s birthday just a few days before. They said we either need to think of a system where everyone helps out, or maybe get rid of cards completely. 

Lots of people in the chat said they wanted to keep birthday cards because they contribute to a sense of community in the office. A lot of the staff are also working abroad, so as we are away from friends and family it’s nice to have our birthday acknowledged in some way. A few options for how to share the responsibility were proposed. The person who started the chat put out a poll, but there were so many possible options in the poll there was no clear consensus. The “no cards at all” option won with only 4 votes, but the majority of the office did want to keep doing birthday cards in some form. 

Some people were really disappointed in this because birthdays are important to them. I was one of these people, as I think having a sense of community at work is important. A month or so after this whole birthday card debate, it was our head teachers birthday. A few coworkers and I decided we should get her a card like she got for other people. She was really touched by this and told us it was very sweet of us to do. 

A small group of coworkers and I decided that we should still do something to celebrate each other’s birthdays in the office. For a few of my friends I got them a card and a chocolate bar or something small. One of my friends commented that she really liked the nice 3D cards, so I got her one for her birthday and asked people around the office to sign it. When I asked our head teacher to sign it, she said, “Oh...I thought we agreed we weren’t doing these anymore.”

Now I feel like a jerk. On one hand I know the office “voted” to not do cards. But on the other, I willingly spent my own money on it and it was no trouble for anyone else.  AITA?"	Not enough info	0	0

c51qbs	2019-06-25 03:32:29	HnyuQ_	AITA for getting mad at my BF for having his laptop password be the date he met his Ex?	"To keep to short and sweet:

He got a NEW laptop. I wanted to play with it while he goes to sleep so I asked for his password. He tells me it's ##-##-15. I'm suspicious of these numbers because they sound like dates, but we started dating in 2017. I then remember he had a fuck buddy before we dated, and I do NOT like her because of some drama.

Anyways I called him out on it. He said he kept that one to remember the worse day of his life. I called his BS. I asked why he didn't put our dates. He said ""because I'm with you everyday""

I then told him ""I hate when you do this"" and stopped talking to him.

AITA? Was I being unreasonable? I don't care anymore about the password. The fact he had it makes me upset. But idk if changing it will make me feel better 

Edit:

Common questions/things I noticed and want to clarify:

This is a NEW laptop and he claims it's the ONLY device with the password of the date where he met his ex 

I'm NOT upset at the use of the date, but more of his response to when I asked him, specifically ""I don't use our date because we hangout everyday"" 

Also I am curious if this is common for ppl to use the dates of their ex. If anyone wants to share that would be much appreciated.


Update: not that anyone cares
Seems like ESH. It's the next day and we are going on like nothing is wrong. He actually messaged me first. When he comes home I'll apologize for saying rude things. I won't ask him to change his password"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

It has not been moved, and judging by the spiderwebs on the mirrors and door, nobody’s even accessed it. Furthermore, the driver side window is cracked open. There’s a laundry basket and other crap inside it. For all purposes, it looks like it’s been abandoned. I don’t know for sure if it belongs to one of my neighbors. I really don’t want to be a bad neighbor, but sometimes my visitors have to park further away. This spot is right next to my own assigned spot. I am this close to making that call to the towing company.  Technically, it violates HOA rules, so I’d be within my rights. I just don’t want to be that asshole.	Asshole	0	0

I haven't looked at porn or done anything wrong since then, and have asked both my parents if I could have my computer in my room, and they said no and they don't want to talk about it.

It feels like they want to control me and monitor what I do as their helicopter parenting strategy. I'm 17 years old and haven't done anything seriously wrong to warrant this.

My parents say they want to see me ""mature"" before I can have my computer in my room, aka change my behavior and stop fighting with my little brother. I have stopped, I just ignore him when he's being annoying, and I am changing my behavior. But I'm not sure how it relates to my computer, when I'm mature enough not to do anything wrong. I swear I haven't done anything wrong since then.

I know people are going to say ""wait until you get a job and move out"", well I have applied for a job about a week ago but they haven't called back yet, and I'm not able to move out with a snap of the fingers. Plus it feels like my parents don't want me to move out just so they can keep me under their roof and force their rules on me.

I just want some privacy as I've been stripped of it for years and it's making me feel like I can't do anything.

Again, I've tried talking to them about it but they don't ever want to talk about it and get overwhelmed and offended really easily when I'm not doing anything wrong. It feels like they just want to control me.

And they also want to monitor what sites I visit and what I do online and on my phone, when again, I haven't done anything in a while to warrant it. It feels like I'm a child all over again.

Husband got a job in a teeny town 2 hours from anywhere else. In the desert. We stayed for 2.5 years and I was miserable the entire time. Yes I got a job, yes I made friends. But every summer I was so miserable bc I was stuck indoors till 9pm every day. I have two dogs and they hated the summer too.

 For the first time in my life I was put on depression meds and meds to help me sleep. 

Finally we left and are back in the area we are from. I have a yard, grass, trees, garden. I can take my dogs on walks in the neighborhood and it's in a pretty populated city. Life is good and I'm very happy!


He applied for a job and we both hope he gets it. Problem is they could relocate him anywhere-- and while it is his dream job, I dont know if I have it in me to follow him to another desert state. 

If it's literally anywhere else I will be happy to go. But I barely survived the last desert and I dont know if I can do it again. Am I being selfish? 

I really don't know if mentally I can do it again.

Edit: yes we have talked about it. He dismisses my feelings and says I can suck it up for a few years. He doesnt understand how serious I am about not going to another desert. :/


2nd edit: Spoke to him this morning about it and told him how important it was to me that he is aware of my feelings. He promised to ""do everything he can"" to make sure we arent relocated to a desert. That's as good as I'll get for now I guess, but it's good enough.  I know if he just tells the employers that theyll be accommodating. He never wants to look like a ""problem employee"" so he was against making any requests at all.

Although they made a bathroom for me in my room, it has orange lighting which makes me feel dirty/sick and the sink has gross stuff in it. Over time, I developed an aversion to using my personal bathroom for anything other than showering and using the toilet. Depression makes it hard for me to even care about brushing my teeth anyways, so I can’t wrap my head around why my parents make it a big deal about the bathroom I choose to brush my teeth in. I only use their bathroom whenever I need to brush my teeth so that’s 3 times a day or less depending on my mood. It’s not as if I’m hogging it all the time. They know how hard it is for me to care about brushing my teeth and I only ever do it when I use the master bathroom because it’s cleaner looking and feeling. So shouldn’t they be supporting me instead of pointing fingers at me calling me a walking disease because I’d rather use their bathroom to brush my teeth than my own bathroom that they built for me? I wonder if there’s something I’m not understanding that others can understand.

Then I thought he would think I pity him or something. Perhaps along the lines of, ""I don't need your charity."". He gets stamps, but I don't ever see food anywhere in his crib.

"I was let go from my job 2 weeks ago and have been struggling to find another of similar caliber (I'm optimistic about finding something else before it's financially too late, this is just background). I moved to another state for this job, and left my good high school buddies back in our home state. We used to be thick as thieves, hanging every weekend/camping/BBQs/etc. We still maintain regular contact via groupchats and I got to hang with most of them (5 of 6) back in May for a music festival.
To further keep in contact, we started playing Dungeons and Dragons regularly before I moved, and I took over as the Game Master after, as it was easier to manage playing with me on one screen and them all together on another.
For those unfamiliar with D&D, there is a TON of prep work for the DM before each session (figure about 4-hours of prep for a 2-hr session). After losing my job, my time has not been as freely-valued as to prepare properly for them, and due to other scheduling conflicts on their end, we haven't played in about a month.

So my question now regarding WIBTA, I am hurt that this group of close friends of mine have made ZERO attempts to check on me during the two weeks since I told them I lost my job. I want to cancel our campaign now as these guys have shown me they have little regard for my well-being and success. I know this sounds selfish, but I would call them whenever they had something inconvenient/worse happen to them, and they can't take 2 minutes to at least send me a text. AITA?"		1	0

I pass by a homeless person on my way to McDonald's. Feeling great, I decided to make the homeless person's day better, but my form of donation isn't through cash, it's through food gift cards. I am a firm believer in that if you give someone cash, it's theirs and they can do anything they want with it, buying drugs etc.  So I always choose to donate food or gift cards etc. I go to McDonalds and I grab my meal and grab a 10$ McDonald's gift card to give to him on my way out. I give it to him and I expect to be on my merry way.

&#x200B;

But instead, he's awfully mad about me giving him a gift card instead of cash. He asks me for cash again and again and I say I don't have anything but this. He tells me he can't use this and asks me to get a refund for it, since they won't let him in, while he waves it in the air. That's not true, they have to serve him. I don't want to give him cash at this point and he's ruining my mood. I tell him take it or leave it and he throws the gift card at the ground and wants cash, he calls me a dickhead who doesn't love his country and their veterans. I grab the card off the floor and he keeps begging for cash, insulting me at the same time while he appears to be on drugs.

He ruined my day and now i'm sick of him. I go on my whole rant about if you want money, work for it, instead of being a bum. (dude looks like he's about 45 and can get a job if he tried). He tells me to shut the fuck up and I say ""you want money so bad? take it"", I grab a few pennys and throw them directly at his coin jar and everything falls.

c51aqd	2019-06-25 02:58:51	wyzwunx	AITA For Phone Etiquette	"Ok, so this is something that happened a month ago that’s been driving me crazy that recently was jogged back into my brain.

I (38m) have a coworker/friend (40m) that I talk to on a regular basis, but the vast majority of our communication lately is via text, as we both have personal lives and family that consumes a lot of our time. We don’t work in the same exact area, but do see each other for meetings and events, and go out to lunch when we get an opportunity.

A lot of our conversations we have are centered around work, and since we share a lot of the same management and coworkers that work between departments (plus he used to work in my department, coworkers are the focus of some of these conversations. 

Now, I’m not super gossipy or anything, but we do talk about who isn’t competent or productive, or who is being a problem at work, what we don’t like about our managers, etc...

Here’s where the problem comes in. We had a huge work event, and at this event, my friend loses his phone. He seems fairly indifferent, until it comes up that he has NO SCREEN LOCK.

I proceeded to tear into him about not locking his phone. He tells me that he’s not concerned with other people reading his stuff, but all my conversations with him are on it, all his friends, his family, and probably other coworkers. My phone number is in his phone, social media contacts, possibly address, all in his phone.

I feel like in an era of text heavy communication and online information people have an obligation to lock their phone to protect not only themselves, but the people they talk to. Now I have no idea who is digging through his phone and what information they have or what conversations they have read through/shared with other people.

AITA for yelling at my friend for not locking his phone and telling him that I’m done talking to him until he guarantees me that his future phones are locked? He’s being incredibly stubborn about this, and insists that I’m making a big deal about it and that his phone lock is his business."	Asshole	0	0

"A little background, I drove without issue from 17 to 23 until on a long road trip I had a panic attack at the wheel during a major rain storm in a mountain area. Luckily I was able to pull over and let my (now) wife drive. Ever since then I've had major anxiety about driving. I tried driving again shortly after my first panic attack and had another one. Same situation, started raining, I freaked out and pulled over again. To make a long story short I have not driven since then. My license expired and I didnt renew it and must take the drivers test again to get another. 

I feel really awful about making my wife drive literally all of the time for the last 4 years but she understands and doesnt mind. Regardless though I feel a good amount of guilt over this. 

I would love to be able to drive again but I still feel very anxious over it. I dont want to be a danger to myself and others on the road, obviously panic attacks while driving are a major issue but I feel like I have to find a way to get over it. Does this make me an asshole?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c516sr	2019-06-25 02:50:18	cactushugger8	WIBTA if I kept my co-worker from getting a government driver's license?	"My co-worker and I are both new on a government job. We are supposed to be getting federal government driver's licenses to drive their vehicles. We had to take a 4 hour defensive driving class and have background checks done. This was all about two weeks ago, and as far as I know we are currently just waiting on them to be approved and/or mailed to us. The government is super slow so I have no idea how far along the process is.

&#x200B;

However, I have some concerns about my co-worker's driving. Just today, I was in the car with him (his personal car), and he sped up when someone was trying to pass him (ie crossed into opposing traffic to pass him on a one-lane each way road). I didn't realize why he was speeding up until the car got around us. When I asked him why he would do that, he was just like ""oh well, he made it around us"". He clearly knew that the guy was trying to pass us and was just messing with him. I'm pretty sure that that is illegal to do, and very unsafe. Additionally, a few weeks ago I was in the car with him for a few hours, when he tailgated numerous people that he was trying to pass and almost hit the back of someone's car.

&#x200B;

I am seriously considering talking to the guy at work who approves the licenses and telling him all of this. On the one hand, the co-worker might drive more safely in a government vehicle. On the other hand, these seem like really unsafe behaviors and I don't really think he should get a special license. I would be fine with the tailgating and all if he didn't realize that he was doing it, but he clearly knew what he was doing today.

&#x200B;

Edit: The class that we took was not a test. We sat in a conference room and listened to someone talk for 4 hours. No one has seen us drive and neither of us has driven a govt vehicle because the licenses aren't in yet."	Asshole	0	0
c516p1	2019-06-25 02:50:03		AITA for cutting ties with my coworker	I'm a 18 yo M and my coworker is a 21 yo M. We both joined 2 months ago. We both sit next to each other and we became best friends. However things turned sour when we started talking about politics yesterday.  Basically I said soldiers working in the army office should get a pay raise of $200 because its unfair for them to get $600 per month. Him and 2 other coworkers said it is ridiculous to increase the salary of soldiers because of the amt of work they do in the army.  Him and the 2 other coworkers said increasing the salary would affect political balance in my country. I still don't agree, soldiers working in the office should get a higher and basic salary, it's ridiculous to get paid that amount. Coworkers said it's justified since free healthcare is provided for soldiers (even surgeries). We soon got into a heated argument on why the gov isn't doing right, and I called them out on being pro gov. He then started saying I don't know shit about life & politics because I'm 18 and I took a diploma in a private college while he was bragging that he is a straight ace GSCE A level student who's going to get a degree (implying that I can't get a degree, which isn't true.) He also said he knows more than me since he studied economics and was in the army getting paid $600 for the service he did. In some sense, basically he's the kinda guy that would vote for Trump and I'm the guy who likes Bernie. (sorry to bring this up) Also at one point, I did tell him straight up that he sounds like he loves this current job very much and if he does so, he can stay here forever because I've got bigger plans (he was telling me that I wasn't working hard enough, while actually I'm getting paid the same amount to do less work) 2 other coworkers agreed with what he said. He is leaving the job next week. We haven't spoken since the argument yesterday and I can only assume we have cut ties with each other.

c516bm	2019-06-25 02:49:10	Ottawa-toss	AITA for wanting to kick out my roommate with an eviction notice?	" 

Not sure where to start here.

I've been good pals with my roommate. I own the place 100% and there is no lease or anything for him.

However, He's been here for over 11 years. In the middle of May, I explained that I wanted to start living alone soon. I told him to take his time, so he could find a good place and I wasn't in any rush. He said he understood.

The NEXT DAY, he suddenly gets an over seas assignment which likely starts in July for 3 months. I am frustrated, but at least he won't be living with me, and I'll be saving a few bucks. However, he's also apparently gotta go hunting for a month in October.

So he won't even START LOOKING until November. Right now, I feel that it's unlikely he'll move in the winter.

I'm going to explain to him that when he comes back from over seas and before he goes hunting I want a hard date where I can count on him being out.

I'm getting serious with a relationship and I have like 0 space here. I feel that if I want some quiet time, I either have to leave or go to my room.

I'm kinda sick of his stuff all over the place and he acts like the apartment is his.

I'm thinking of just getting an eviction notice from a lawyer and when he gets back from ""vacation"" he'll have 60 days to move out.

I'd like to remain pals, but I'm just at my wits end. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of here.

"So my boyfriend of 5 years has this ""friend"" I'll call him Alan, that made it very clear early in our relationship that he couldn't support us as a couple so he kept his distance.(I think he didn't like the lack of attention from my bf)

Well about 3 years ago Alan called my boyfriend with this ""girls bathroom at prom"" drama and wanted him to come out to this middle of no where ""intervention/support session"" FOR ANOTHER FRIEND at 2am. I said I didn't want him to take my car in the back roads that late that time of year. He agreed because the drama wasnt really anything emergent so he told Alan he'd meet up with them the next day. Later my bf found out they just had a bonfire and didn't really talk or do anything.

3 years pass of my boyfriend almost dying from sepsis, numerous birthday invites, boyfriend graduating, all while trying reach out to Alan to make any kind of converstion with him through text or calls. And minimal to nothing from Allen. He calls three weeks ago with all this catch up crap,talks for 2 hours and then they hang up. He's called tonight with a new drama. His girlfriend has left him and fucked his brother. And wants my boyfriend to drive 3 hours away on his night off...

Now while that's shitty as fuck I don't think he should uproot his night or plans because Alan decided he needs a friend. I explained to boyfriend the evidence and blatant bullshit Alan has pulled and how to me the friendship seems one sided and I would like him not to go because Alan doesn't deserve a friend out of him because Alan hasn't been there for him the last 3 years.

c514gr	2019-06-25 02:45:24	iunhUe2s	AITA for forgetting to tip after a machine malfunction and refusing to correct it after the waitress called us assholes?	"This happened a while back but a recent post about tipping on here made me remember this.

So, I live in Alberta, Canada, and we have pretty much the same tipping culture as the US. You are viewed as an asshole if you don't tip.

A while back, three buddies and I got kinda baked and ended up at Denny's at around 2am. We ordered a couple beers and some food, nothing out of the ordinary, the waitress came to our table ~3 or 4 times. Place was relatively empty other than us. Probably spent ~$35 each? At the end, we went up to the counter to pay, as you normally do at Denny's.

They had issues with the point of sale system. The credit card reader wouldn't fire up to ""Insert Card"" when the waitress pressed the button. If you're unaware of how credit card machines work in Canada (it is different to the US system where you write the tip on the receipt), basically, the machine will tell you the total, you confirm it by pressing OK, then it will ask you to insert a tip percentage, and it will show you the new total after tip.

After a few tries and some finagling, the card reader finally fired up. We had been trying to pay for like 5-10min by this point.

Unlike normally, the machine didn't ask for any tip, and honestly, nobody noticed that it didn't prompt for a tip. Keep in mind, it was 2am, we'd been trying to pay for a while now, and we'd all smoked and had some drinks. With these kinds of PoS systems, generally you just follow the prompts on autopilot when paying, so the missing tip screen before asking for the PIN or whatever didn't really even occur to me.

We each paid separately. After the last of us paid, when the waitress was consolidating her copies of the receipts right before we walked out, she noticed no tips on any of them and said ""Really? I'm here serving you at 2am and no tip? Assholes."" Sure enough I looked at my receipt and oh shit, I didn't tip (and I presume my friends were just as surprised as me).

It was an honest oversight, and I would've corrected it, but the way she said it was so inflammatory, so I got pretty ticked off. I told her something to the effect of ""sorry, I didn't remember because I didn't see the machine even ask for it, but you can get fucked if you think I'm going to correct it after you called me an asshole"" and left. 

Two of my friends came with me, the other guy gave her a $5 note that he had and apologized, and joined us down the road.

The general consensus among the three of us that left is that she was extremely unprofessional in the way that she handled what pretty obviously was an oversight (we were nice to her whilst she was serving us and had no issues waiting as she resolved the payment issues, so she shouldn't have had any reason to believe we'd short her on the tip) but the other guy felt kinda bad because the place was pretty much empty (being 2am) so she was already not making much in tips, which is why he gave her the $5. 

So, am I/we (the three of us) the assholes here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5103r	2019-06-25 02:36:30	littleshopofterrors	AITA for posting my old friend and I’s “breakup convo” to my Instagram Spam?	"Hey Reddit. Some background information:
I used to be really close with this group of girls, and things went south as teenage friend groups sometimes do. It got real messy. I thought I made it out of the fights with one person I could still be friends with, keyword- “thought”.  This all happened a little over a year ago. This girl (let’s call her “C”) and I didn’t hang out that much after the ordeal, especially since I started going to a different school, but I assumed we were on okay terms because of our long history of friendship.

 I texted her a few times over the last few months, asking her questions about certain things she would know, wishing her happy birthday, etc. (The birthday message was responded to with a simple “Thanks” which was a little out of character, but I didn’t think much of it). I saw her in passing at a city event last month, and she didn’t want anything to do with me. I tried to talk to her, but she kept walking after a brief high five. Again, I thought it was a little out of character, but I hadn’t seen her in a few months, so she might not have recognized me right away.  

Fast forward to yesterday night, I invited her to a similar city event this weekend, since I wanted to catch up. She said she was going with someone else and apologized, which was fine, but again a very short, unemotional message. this is when I decide to ask her about last month, and asked her if we were still friends after the falling out of our previous mutuals. She told me she wasn’t mad anymore, but she was done with me. This came as a shock, and I got upset when I realized I officially lost someone I once considered my best friend. 

For those who don’t know- it’s a popular thing amongst teenagers to have a “spam” Instagram account to vent their feelings about a subject, post memes, or basically whatever. 

I pretty much instantaneously in a fit of tears posted a screenshot of 2/3 texts: me asking if everything was okay between me and C, and C’s text telling me we’re over. It was spontaneous, and i didn’t think it mattered anyways since my account was private and only my close friends follow me to cheer me up or laugh at my bad jokes. 

What I didn’t know when I clicked post, was that one of my followers would accidentally show an old friend a screenshot of MY post about C, which was followed by the old friend telling C. C texted me just a few hours ago, calling me out for ignoring her privacy and not handling everything more maturely. I didn’t mention her by name, nor did I think there was enough context for anyone to put two and two together besides C herself and her friends. I deleted the post and apologized to her in text (but also mentioned I never said her name), and was met with no response.

I am on mobile. 
I dont write so good.1a And this is a 30 year long issue, so I'll try to reply to any comments for clarification. 

My mother is a drug addict, from a long line of addicts, who had kids who became addicts. 
My mother is in prison currently, set to be released thursday.

I'm not free of this issue completely. I have a drinking problem, but my 2 sisters have kids and one is in prison with my mother. 

I was sent to live with my sober father when I was 3. It was the best day of my life. And it was hard being raised as a single daughter to a single father. We had a lot of issues. I have a lot of issues. I struggle hard with chronic depression and generalized anxiety. 

My mother is supposed to get out of prison for the 600th (obvs /s but shes been in and out my entire life) time on thurs. 
She broke me down a lil over a month ago, saying my town was the only town she could stay sober in and I tend to agree, she has the best opportunity here. 

But i feel like i was manipulated into agreeing to let her stay, and now that its days away I'm having a total break down and want to tell her she cant stay with me. 

.This would devastate her plans.
.Shes a crack head / meth head and im scared.
.SUPPOSEDLY this would last for less than a week. 
.I'm scared

I didnt know where to post this, except I'm about to totally tell her, days before her release, that shes not welcome here, and maybe I should post this in relationship advice?

Edit: she has to stay at my apartment for a bit because the halfway house requires a deposit she couldnt make without losing because of other circumstances. So it will be a few days and then supposedly she will be going to the halfway house

So I did.
And it turns out her “emergency” was that she won something from Disney, and that she thinks we should change the olives at the restaurant we work at. I repeatedly tried to point out that I was tired, and that couldn’t we discuss this tomorrow? She kept pushing forward, insisting she wouldn’t be able to sleep b/c of this. I responded that if she couldn’t work tomorrow morning, I could pick up her shift. Eventually, she asked me what my favorite food was, and promised to make it. Finally, I was able to say “Look, name, I like you, but I’m trying to sleep, and I’m going to hang up now.” To which she insisted that she won’t be able to sleep because of this, but then said that she loved me.

So I don't know where to ask this, but I'm really feeling bad.

For a bit of a context: my mother has always been the type of person that if you can't do something right, she will do it herself. And it applies to almost everything in our lives. Can't cook? She'll do it. Mess up the laundry? She'll take over and ban you from it forever. Takes you a long while to enroll in school because of reasons that are out of your control? Don't bother anymore, she'll do the enrolling for you by ignoring all the queue and go inside the office to talk to the staff directly.

It has always been like this, and even though I try to explain that I can do it, or that to give me another chance, she'll just shake her head and say something like, ""It's faster this way"", ""they don't listen to kids"" or ""you might mess it up again"".

So today, this happened again, I've been struggling to find a stable job ever since I graduated 5 years ago. I'm 25 now and have only been able to stay at work for a few months before quitting due to health and family matters. It's not like I have given up. The companies I applied for hasn't responded yet, or that the screenings for the applicants won't be happening until the first week of July. 

I already submitted my resume for this certain company since my cousin works there, and she told me that there hasn't been any news yet about the job hiring because HR management are still processing all the vacant positions they have so they can officially post the news and call the potential applicants.

My mother also knows someone who works there (though they are not close at all, just acquaintances) and even though I told her what my cousin said, she still insists on going there herself to talk to them and pass my credentials. 

We're currently at the office, waiting for the person she's going to talk to. And I just... feel embarrassed. 

I'm embarrassed that 25 year old me has to bring mom at a company just to apply for work. This is how I see it. This is what I feel. And I feel helpless and ashamed since I see other people like me applying and trying to do this by themselves while here I am with my mother doing ""shortcuts"" again.

At the same time, I feel bad for feeling this. Like I'm some ungrateful ass for not appreciating what my mother does for me.

c50w7s	2019-06-25 02:28:43		AITA for blowing up at my mom after she shared medical information about me?	"My mom is bipolar and currently in a manic state, and I haven't really talked to her directly for a couple of months because I have PTSD and she ended up telling her friends what my flashback episodes look like, including things like me sometimes having bladder incompetence. I can't really 100% control seeing her because my siblings have her over when we're doing family dinners and whatnot.   


So my mom generally likes to get wrapped up in other people's drama and spreads gossip like wildfire. I have autism and uncontrolled epilepsy, and have recently learned through therapy that I like ""mirroring"" her, so I end up oversharing with her sometimes because that's what she always encouraged me to do. If I didn't fully speak up about something she would end up being a wreck for days.   


Anywho my husband and I want to get pregnant in about a year. Because of said epilepsy, I wanted a referral to a parinatologist to find out if I should be pregnant at all and what the risks involved would be. My husband's  only other concern beyond the seizures is if I develop postpartum depression. This has been a very, very emotionally charged topic for my husband and I because I desperately want to have children. Side note: my mom is obsessed with me getting pregnant and has been since I was a teenager because ""I won't be fulfilled as a woman"" if I can't have my own biological children.   


I had an appointment with my GP to ask for a referral last Wednesday and she told me she wouldn't give me one because ""it's not like they're going to know anything at the end of the day."" (she also said a bunch of weird stuff like that I should just ask my SIL to be a surrogate). This was really uncharacteristic of my GP and I called my dad up after quite shaken from the appointment. I guess my dad was busy cooking and had put me on speaker phone, so my mom ended up hearing bits and pieces and got on the phone. She asked me what my husband thought and I said he was fine with me being pregnant or not pregnant but was just a bit concerned about PPD.   


My mom saw her therapist today and texted me. I guess she told her therapist all about my doctor's appointment and her therapist told her she could refer me to some psychiatrist that would treat the PPD that I'm inevitably going to get (???) because ""autism is a mental illness.""  I exploded at her for yet again sharing medical information that I wanted to be kept private and  told her that this had zero relevance to her treatment, and yet again told her I was cutting contact. But I feel kind of guilty for doing this again because maybe she was trying to help? I don't know who is in the wrong here and whether me cutting contact for certain periods of time is appropriate. I've tried having rational conversations about boundaries with her in the past but she denies all wrongdoing because she always has good intentions. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

c50s4i	2019-06-25 02:21:09	thrwayAmIReally	AITA for refusing to pay for my step-daughter's expenses after she got pregnant?	"My husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as An. An's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. An is now 16 years old, and pregnant.

An stays mostly with us because I am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition. It had always been my husband who pays for An's expenses.

When An turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(HS) in the big city we live in. We checked on HS and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private HS. She has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream. I have been separating some money for this purpose, too.

My husband and I came to an agreement that I would also help her dream to come true, but I would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (An did NOT know this) and he agreed. This conversation took place two years ago... And now, An is pregnant as soon as she finished her first year.

I laid some facts down to An, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. I recommended she terminated the pregnancy.

An's mom is ECSTATIC and so is her grandma. They have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". I think they're absolute loonies; I bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. I believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

I am dead serious about stopping tuition and using the money I've been saving in other stuff if An decides to carry on with the pregnancy. I have NOT and will NOT make the ultimatum of ""terminate or I'll stop paying your tuition"", but I will tell her that I won't pay for her nice school and her child's expenses if she decides she wants to keep it. I don't even want to become one of those grandmas who take care of the child. I firmly believe a normal teen life has to be child-free. Money will go to some of the child's expenses and I will give no more. An can either enroll in a public high school (or one within her dad's budget) and set herself for a uni scholarship under dad's budget.

My husband is telling me I need to understand the situation. I do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill I will die on. I can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and  some of the future child's expenses too, but I feel like I'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something I shouldn't. Husband firmly believes I am doing this to punish An and I am being an ass for compromising her future over this matter. AITA?

&#x200B;

**Edit/Commonly asked questions:** Ann will NOT stop attending high school- she will just stop attending the fancy private school. I will use that same money to finance some of the child's caring, but I also feel this is not my baggage and has to be something bio mom and dad have to solve themselves (I still need to make a budget, but I don't think I will pay the full $1000 equivalent of tuition a month on child support, bio mom has to pay at least something once in her life).

No, I will NOT make an ultimatum. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ANN ABOUT THIS SITUATION. I plan on telling her I can't support fancy high school + child support, but not both. She STILL will be able to attend a less prestigious school, not a bad one but not the best, that her father would finance. If father and bio mom want fancy high school, they should pay them themselves.

I will definitely NOT pay for the private university. The country's private universities tend to give scholarships, she could apply for one. I AM NOT CLOSING HER EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS. I may not be giving her the best (the money for her to go to LSE, for example) but I am not giving her the worst.

Finally, the father of the upcoming child is a young man she met in some of her extra activities outside of school. Parents said they would pay for child support, but unless this teen gets a part time job (part time jobs here to high school students pay around 200 a month), the parents will only be able to give $300 a month. That would cover a month of 5hour/5days a week daycare.

**Another edit because forgot to add:** Ann was supposed to be on the pill. Gyn recommended the pill instead of an implant because of some reproductive issues bio mom has. She stopped taking the pill because mom told her she would get fat and then proceeded to *educate her* on the ""natural"" way, as in having sex before, during, and some days after her period. Husband and I have been teaching her sex-ed since she got her first period when she was 11, but I'm fearing of bio mom's teachings, and at this point I just want to fist fight bio mom."

Last weekend Roommate 1 sent a text to the group chat saying that the freezer wasn't working and that she was calling our landlord to come out and fix it. It was after business hours though so she let us know the landlord was being disagreeable and might send someone out the next day instead.

Shortly after Roommate 1 sends another text saying the landlord agreed to send someone out to fix the freezer and that he will be here in twenty minutes. Roommate 2 clarified if it was just the freezer as that's all that was mentioned.

&#x200B;

She sent both texts about thirty minutes before I'm awake and functioning so once I'm good to go, I go to check it out and see if maybe someone just changed a setting. I found both the freezer and the fridge working perfectly - the freezer's motor was so loud you could both see it/hear it and the fridge light was on & everything was cold. I let the group chat know what I found before the repairman arrived.

Roommate 1 said that when she came downstairs an hour prior that the fridge light was on as well, but that neither the fridge, nor the freezer was cold. I reiterated that it was working well at the moment, but that if it kept going on & off it sounded like a good idea to have someone look at it. 

The repair person came 20 minutes afterwards and Roommate 1 told the group chat that he said that it was probably just on a defrost cycle and we all went along our merry ways & it hasn't been brought up again until today.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. I am checking the mail and there is a torn up envelope inside. I put it and the rest of the mail on top of some other open mail that was on the table. I probably could've thrown the envelope in the trash, but I assumed it was important because I've never experienced someone putting an empty, open envelope back in the mailbox so even if I didn't get the reason I assumed it was valid.

A few hours later Roommate 2 asks about the opened bill for the freezer that was sitting on the table with the rest of the mail and if it had already been taken care of? Roomie 1 responds and says that she was hoping we would all chip in. Roommate 2 says it's Roommate 1's responsibility as she didn't ask for the landlord to be called, I said that everything was working, and that she knowingly opened the bill, left the torn up envelope in the mailbox, and then waited until days later (2 days until we accrue a late fee) to voice that she was hoping we would all chip in.

I go downstairs to read the bill and it says that the repair person suspected that the freezer door just wasn't closed and all the food had thawed. There was no note for the fridge.

I'm guessing it was an honest enough mistake, but it was not the house's mistake. So WIBTA for siding with Roommate 2 and leaving Roommate 1 to foot this bill?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

A friend of mine had four cats and a dog and was desperately attempting to re-home two of her five year old cats due to her impending relocation. I offered to take them because it was lonely in my place by myself, I wanted a cat, plus I already knew hers. She had two rules: 1. Never declaw and 2. If I have to re-home, they come back to her. I adopted them and kept one for 9 years (he wound up passing away from kidney failure after a lifetime struggle with struvite crystals) and the other for 11 years. I moved apartments 8+ times with the cats, including taking them with me from West to East coast. When I was relocating back to the West coast, I would be crashing on a friend's couch who had two indoor/outdoor cats and mine had been indoor only for 16 years at that point (she was also very tiny when born and weighed about 7 lbs, failing eyesight  and possible hearing loss - it would've been bad to start letting her go outside at that point but I wouldn't have had control). I chose to rehome her back with my friend, driving to Kansas to drop her off before continuing to CA alone. She passed away less than two years later. 

&#x200B;

It's been five years since I had a pet, three of them I've been set up comfortably in my own apartment. I've declined mostly because I felt guilty about rehoming my pet instead of keeping her and have been pretty open about that. Over the weekend, I sat with a friend's foster kitten sleeping on me for a little over an hour. I'm down to take this cat and I told her so. She's been a bit elusive, so I met her for lunch today to see if I could figure out why. She told me I'm not a good candidate because I've already given away a cat, so I should exclusively foster only instead of looking to adopt. AITA for rehoming my cat?

Girlfriend works 12h shifts from 6am to 6pm and then 6pm to 6am. She wants to be driven to and from work because she is too tired and is worried about falling asleep while driving. My answer to that is that shes in her prime/youth 24, and she should be able to drive the 30minutes to and from work rather than me spending 2 hours of my day driving back and forth. Also we use twice the gas by dropping her off, the car is only insured for 3rd party so ideally the less its driven the less chance we have an accident - though that is countered by her saying shes tired I guess. Then again I'm tired at 0500 when she wants me to drive her... she has a parking lot at work she can park in that's gated so the vehicle is secure. Bare in mind I work 32/40h weeks myself usually finishing a shift at 11pm. Today was my day off, and I refused to drive her and am refusing for the rest of her shift block.

Am I the asshole for telling her to drive herself?

I offered up my couch and told her to stay as long as she needed too, she was planning to go to live with her fiancé in his country (plans feel through)and that’s all well and good 

Now her family is incredibly emotionally abusive and physically at times. She tried to patch things up with her mum and each time it would go badly and I would rush and drop everything I was doing to go and get her because I worried about her safety. Her family lived on the total opposite side of the city to where I do - 20/30kms not a huge distance but in peak hour can take over an hour. 
That’s all well and good, I don’t mind at ALL about getting her out of that situation. 


Fast forward a couple of weeks and she’s moved back in with them and everything’s all dandy (spoiler alert it’s not) anyway we work together right, it’s been two almost three weeks now and I haven’t gotten a single hello, how are you thanks for that.

c50ku6	2019-06-25 02:07:51		AITA for giving a brother an ultimatum for being in my life	"A little bit of background. My family consists of my mom, dad, and my brother. We’ve been through a lot together, my mom dad and I being treated for and triumphing over our mental illnesses and problems with other family members. When I was 16 I had an attempt at my life, and since I’ve been medicated, in therapy, and healthier than ever. This Friday I graduate from college, a feat I never thought I would accomplish.
I have always butted heads with my brother. When I was younger he would take his anger out on me. When my parents weren’t home we would physically fight and he would beat me. I didn’t realize how messed up it was until now. He hasn’t physically abused me much in years, but on Christmas he got angry and shoved me into a glass door.
He is consistently angry and expresses to my mom that he doesn’t feel like he is enough for us. Yet he treats me and my parents with disrespect, raising is voice and getting angry if we ask even a simple question. He acts nastily to others and says hurtful things but when confronted refuses to acknowledge his behavior. Because of his attitude, he doesn’t have a social life at all or any relationships at 24.
My parents have fought with him but tolerated it because he is their blood, fighting through being miserable even through how he treats them. He refuses to be confronted about how he acts.
Recently, the last straw for me is when I found out he asked my childhood friend on Facebook if he could give her oral sex. They don’t know each-other and it was completely unsolicited. I discovered he has done this to several of my friends. Now that his actions are affecting my relationships outside of the family I finally had enough. I told him that he either needs to apologize to my friend and to me, and promise to get help and hold himself accountable if he wants to have a relationship with me and be a part of big events like my graduation. He refused, and I told him he was not welcome at this event.
My mom found out what I said and came home screaming and crying. I felt guilty and I am sleeping on a friends couch. It feels dangerous for my mental health to be home. I don’t want to not have a relationship with my brother but I feel like he needs to be held accountable for his actions.

TLDR; AITA for telling my brother he can’t come to my graduation if he treats me like shit and refuses to apologize? Am I being biased and seeing this in only one way? I am at my wits end. He is my brother and my blood and it breaks my heart to not have a relationship with him but I have major depression s disorder and this is taking a huge toll on my mental health. My heart is really breaking and I am at my rock bottom. We’ve tried to get him to go to therapy and get help but he insists nothing is wrong. Yet he is verbally abusive to my family and sees nothing wrong with asking my childhood friend he doesn’t know for oral sex on the internet. Please give honest advice"		1	0

"So my friend moved in with me and my partner at the beginning of May (though we let her move all of her stuff in a week and a bit early and stored it all in our office while our other roommate was still here as they didnt move out until the day new roommate moved in). 13 days into the month she messages me (while were on vacation) and tells us shes moving out July 1st as she found a bachelor apt she couldnt pass up on. Being kinda frustrated with how that's less than 60 days notice and our sub tenant lease says 60 day notice needed, we came to an agreement that she would pay half a months rent since we didnt want to be total assholes as she was my friend and knew she didnt deliberately plan to find a place so soon. 


Flash forward til nearing the end of may. We had some family emergency type deal come up and a family member had to come stay with us for a while. Before even agreeing to them coming to stay we talked with our roommate and explained the whole situation and told them if they really weren't okay with it wed figure something else out, but that if they were we would make sure they stayed in our office so as to not be ""in the way"" (mind you our roommate was very rarely even at the house throughout most of may and a bit of June too). They said they were okay with it as family is family and we were very grateful. 


Flash forward to today when I tried having a convo with my roommate about if they were just going to etransfer the half months rent on the 1st or when type of deal. They turn around saying that they dont think they should have to pay it at all anymore as ""we both broke the lease"" since she didnt give notice and we had the family member staying with us for the time being (the lease said the 3 of us would be living in the house). Yet every night except for 2 that they have been here, their boyfriend has been over with them too. Besides the point, I try to explain to them that we made an agreement and that they said that they were okay with the family member staying here and that they are staying as a ""guest"" and it was agreed to so it's not like we didn't get their approval on our guest staying (mind you they never once made a comment about this being an issue until I mentioned the final rent).


They ended up saying ""whatever though I dont want to argue so I'll just pay it"" and I'm like thinking okay great. But now I feel like I'm being an a asshole for making her still pay, but at the same time like ugh. I dont want to hurt a friendship over this but it just feels like they're trying to use our family emergency situation to get out of paying the rent they agreed to (even after we let them move all their stuff in early, helped them move all their stuff in, and helped them move their stuff again into their room once they officially moved in). Like idk. I feel bad, but I dont know if I should.. so am I the asshole or no? Thoughts?

c50eee	2019-06-25 01:56:24	UnderCoverSteveWills	WIBTA if I told a woman that her fiancé/daughter’s father came into my fiancées Instagram DM’s?	"My fiancée and I have a VERY honest relationship.  We talk to each other about EVERYTHING.  Also, I am punching above my weight.  My fiancée is MUCH more attractive than I am....but she loves me all the same and thinks I’m the bees knees.   We sometimes also bring others into the bedroom.   I think that’s important to note.   

So, about a week ago, my fiancée started getting DMs on IG from some guy with an obviously throwaway IG.   He basically started by telling my fiancée that he missed her and he missed them sleeping together.   She asked who he was and he refused to say.  

She brought this to my attention and told me she’d like to know who it was and asked if I was comfortable with her conversing with him.  I was, so I told her I didn’t have an issue.  He escalated quickly into sending not only d*ck pics, but pics of himself masturbating.   

It’s important to note that she never told him to stop and that she showed me all of the messages every day.   She kept nothing from me.  She told him she has a fiancé and he said that he had a fiancée, too, but they could keep it on the side.

So, the curiosity grew.   She said she couldn’t recognize that penis as being one she’s ever seen.   So, she finally demanded a face pic and he sent one.  She showed me the pic and I recognized him INSTANTLY as the fiancé of someone I went to school with and am friends with on IG.  

Now, a little back story that is important.   Last year for April Fools, they played a joke where one of them tried to convince the other that they were cheating.  I don’t remember who played the “prank”, but I commented that I thought it was a shitty “prank”.   They hurled some insults my way but we moved on.

Now, back to today.  After he sent the face pic, I encouraged my fiancée to say (and she did), “Does (fiancée’s name) know you’re here in my DMs and sending me d*ck pics and vids??”

He responded with, “I’m sorry, I’ll stop.   Please don’t ruin a life over a stupid mistake.”  After told him that I was the one who figured out who he was, he came back a few minutes later (clearly doing some research to see who I was) and then tried to say, “I’m just trying to prank that MF.”

My fiancée responded with “Ok, so if you’re just trying to prank him, we’re sure (fiancé) is in on the prank too, so he’ll check with her.”

He repeated that there was no need to ruin a life over this and that he’d go away.

My fiancée has sent me all of the screenshots of the messages and pics/videos.

WIBTA if I let his fiancée and mother of his child that he was clearly in my fiancee’s DM’s??

And in case anyone is going to say I shouldn’t get involved in someone else’s relationship, he clearly tried to get involved in mine.   Just because he didn’t succeed doesn’t make it right.   

So, WIBTA?

It’s been difficult to determine if this was actually about some sort of revenge prank on me for me commenting negatively on their “cheating prank”,  but it’s become so much clear that a revenge prank of him sending videos of him masturbating and then begging my fiancée not to say anything is clearly just him trying to sleaze his way around.   

I HAVE MADE A DECISION on what I am going to do.   We’ve ALL done something wrong.   Whether it be as a child or an adult, we have all done something wrong, knew we did something wrong, got caught, and then just WAITED for it to come to light.   It’s one of the worst fears a human can have.   So, I think the best way to handle this is to let him stew for a few days while nothing happens so he can think it’s going to go away.   I am actually going to see his fiancée this weekend at a children’s event.   He will most likely be there.   It’s the ONE day of the year I EVER see her.   I will let him see me.  I will say nothing.   I will wait a few more days.   THEN, I will tell her and send her the screenshots.   She deserves to know what she’s getting into.   Thank you all for letting me know that I’d be doing the right thing.

EDIT:  I just messaged her to let her know.  I did, in fact, see her this weekend at that children’s event, but she didn’t see me, nor was he there.   I’ll updated again if/when she responds.

UPDATE:    Instead of hearing from her, HE, who had blocked both of us, messaged me to tell me that me messaging her is harassment and that if I contacted either one of them again, he would contact his lawyer.   He also denied again that it was him, even after begging and pleading with my fiancée not to say anything and ruin his life.   

I happen to work in a building with a law office and I’m friends with a few of the lawyers there, so I asked them about the situation from a legal standpoint and then........

I reminded him that he sent unsolicited pictures and videos of his genitalia to a woman who did no ask for or consent to receiving them, which is sexual harassment and also 3rd degree obscenity, a crime that could potentially result in jail time.

I also advised him that his unsolicited messages also voided any claim to his expectation of privacy considering the recipient nor the nature of the messages ever implied such an expectation, so that I am within my rights to do whatever I choose to with the photos he offered to us.  

I then told him that my only intent was to make sure she was informed of what went on because I believe that every person deserves to know if someone is doing something terrible behind their  back.  

He also asked me to meet him in person to settle this “as men”, so I informed him that he wasn’t a man, that his wife is a person whom I have respected for 20 years, and that he now needs to lie in the bed he made.  I advised that I would never contact them again and I signed off with “Keep your dick where it belongs.  Ciao.”

I have not blocked him and it has now been 6 hours with no response.  I expect that his response will either be nothing or be something threatening or harmful....most likely some sort of destruction of property.   From what I know about him, I would expect nothing less.  It’s evident that he knows my name and can easily find out where I live,  but I have enough security devices inside and out of my house that I’m not worried.  I have also notified the local police of the situation just in case of any sort of retaliation.  

Thank you all for coming on this journey with me.  :)"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I recently decided to ask my Mum about her parents as they both died when I was younger and I only have relationships with my Dads parents, who are both still living. 
To my shock, my Mum told me her Mother is my Dads Dads sister. So my Mum and Dad are cousins. My Gandma on my Mums side is my Grandads on my Dads side sister.
This is appaently legal in the UK for 1st cousins to be romantically involved, but I personally feel insanely grossed out by the incestuousness of this relationship, and the fact that I am a product of it, as well as my 18yo sister. I do not know how to discuss this with my Mum as, lets face it, it's too late to change anything. I just do not know how to process the fact that my Grandma is also my Great Aunt, and my Grandad is also my Great Uncle. I'm sure my Mum and Dad aren't just my Mum and Dad anymore either -  some other messed up relation link in there somewhere. Incest is something I have always been revolted by, and now like I said, I am a product of it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c50bki	2019-06-25 01:51:16	teeerrracy	AITA for not wanting to hang out with my friends’ kids?	"This is my first time positing an original post. I don’t feel like I can talk about this with any other friends because it will eventually make its way back to my core group of friends. I have three friends from college whom I used to consider my best friends. They are all in relationships/married and two of them have kids. Some people may see this as jealousy on my part. I guarantee that’s not the case. I have no real desire to have kids and I am focused on a lot of other aspects of my life and don’t really want a relationship right now. Anyway, we try to get together about once a month for lunch or whatever. It’s not a lot, but we keep in touch via text. The problem is that ALL the want to talk about is their kids. Two of them are sisters so even though one doesn’t have a kid, she talks about her nephew nonstop. We went to lunch today and I barely said anything. I just didn’t have anything to add to the conversations about kid toys that they’ve purchased and what milestones the kids have hit and how “funny” they are. They are both babies and they act like, well, babies. It’s not that extraordinary. I get these kids are the light of their lives and I want the kids to grow up happy and healthy, but I don’t think I would have been missed had I cancelled like I wanted to. I’m already dreading our next outing. I have a ton of stuff going on in my life and when I try to talk about it, it doesn’t really get acknowledged or we talk about it briefly and it’s right back to the babies. I really want to ask them if next time we hang out, can it be adults only, but I feel like a jerk. The one time it happened to be just adults, it was because one of them had work right after and the other friend didn’t want to bring her kid with because he was sick. Am I the asshole for wanting to ask this of them or do I just have to accept that this is how our get togethers are going to be from now on?

Edit: Because it’s been asked: it’s the fact that the kids are there and the topic of conversation always becomes the kids right away. I guess I am hoping that by having it just be adults, that the kids won’t be a topic of conversation as much.

Edit 2: Thank you, everyone for the feedback. It’s a new situation to be in for me, obviously. I think i felt if I said anything they would be offended and I’ve tried to be honest about other bings and it hasn’t been taken well. I honestly feel, at this point, it’s best for me to just let them be and move on. I know them well enough to know how they will react to me asking them to take a step back on the kid talk and asking for an adult only night. It will turn into a huge bitch feat behind my back. In all honesty,  they’ve been pretty shitty friends, even before kids. I didn’t really have any friends at work, but I’ve started a new job and have met some wonderful people. I feel like maybe it’s time to remove myself from the group, at least for now. Thank you, again!"	No A-holes here	0	0

c50aon	2019-06-25 01:49:39	im_hitman	AITA for going to work on my wife’s first birthday since we’ve been married?	"It was my wife’s first birthday last weekend since we’ve been married. I had planned for us to spend time together in the evening to take her out for dinner and other fun activities. But I picked up an eight hour shift from 6 AM to 2 PM on that day.

I admit that I did not give her any surprises at midnight and also went to work like any other day leaving her nothing to wake up to. But on my way back from work, I bought her some flowers and chocolates. When I reached home, I could see that she was really upset that I left her alone and started accusing that I had spoiled her special day.

I told her that I picked up the shift with the intention that whatever I had planned was for the evening and the day hasn’t been ruined because we could still do plenty of stuff together. But she kept crying and said that I should have not gone to work because I give away shifts to go and pickup friends from the airport and other occasions. I admit that I have given away small shifts in the past for doing things for my friends but this was an 8 hour full shift and I wanted to take advantage of the penalty rates.

I kept on apologising to her and finally was able to convince her to go out for dinner but she refused to do any other activities. Even after coming back from dinner, she kept on crying that I ruined her day. I was sitting next to her on the couch and unfortunately dozed off a bit (because I had to wake up at 4:30 AM to go to work and also my neighbours were partying so hard the previous night I had to call the cops in the middle of the night to make a noise complaint). She saw me dozing off, screamed 
at me and broke a picture of us together.

The thing is two of my friends were jokingly twisting and hitting each other when suddenly the wooden arm brake and the wall was scratched as well.

 At first, it wasn't a big deal because we ""fixed it"", but their parents found out soon and now my grounded friend is telling me to pay it, but my other friends and I didn't have nothing to do with it. Their parents blame all of us because we were all in his house.

We talked with my friends who broke the sofa, but they are not willing to pay the damage that they've done. Consequently, that would make their parents more angrier and make us all pay.

c5095k	2019-06-25 01:46:53	Cheko2015	AITA for wanting priority on use of MY living room TV compared to my roommate?	"So long story short, a devastating hurricane came into my town. Destroyed mine and my fiancees apartment and most of the housing in the area. Housing right now is super scarce and the rent/costs are super inflated. Due to the situation we ended up moving in with a roommate that was recommended to us by a coworker. The advantage is she had a pre-storm lease (with pre-storm pricing) and a nice apartment to boot. We took it. 

So all living room furniture is ours. Most importantly I replaced my TV I lost in the hurricane with a new $1000 55 inch tv. I have all my games hooked up to it. My fiancee did not help out a cent with the purchase. Our roommate certainly did not.  We all chip in on cable but our roommate pays an extra 10$  a month to have a cable box in her room. We dont have cable in our room and we use my fiances older 32 inch set. With all that being I give my fiancee equal use to our TV and I have no prob with our roommate using it when we arent there or even with all 3 of us are watching the same thing. Its in the joint living room after all. 

But now my fiancee and I got in a huge fight because I wanted to take over the TV when we got home recently. She wanted the roommate to keep using it and thought I was an asshole. We didnt talk to the roommate. She ended up going to her room to watch her own TV anyways so no issues. But I can telk my roommate likes my fiancee more than me which is fine. Things are just awkward at times. 

For more info, its a 3 bedroom place. Our roommate pays 1/3 of the rent. We get the Master bedroom and bath. She gets her own room and exclusive use of the guest bathroom. We all just kind of share the guest room. So yeah, I do think I should get priority on my TV over my roommate even though its in the shared living area. Everything my roommate can do the living room, she can do in her room with her own cable box and nice tv. My games and our cable is not hooked up to our crappy tv in our room.

My wife works in ABA and knows all about shaping behavior and rearing kids. We don't have kids yet, but when we do, I'll defer to her judgement during the tougher spots of handling them. Generally we agree on how to handle shit with them except one:

Monster Spray.

She thinks it's validating whiny behavior and will make them weaker adults, I see it as a simple thing you can do to give them a ""ritual"" before bed so they can go to sleep, and later in life have fond memories of. 

I wanted to bring this to reddit to answer.

1. I'm not just going to introduce this to my kids without some kind of event regarding a fear of monsters

I don't own Skyrim SE, although I know moving classic modifications is to Special Edition is simple. I just don't see the value in doing something like that.

I do own Fallout 4, however the game has some serious performance problems on xBox One even without modifications and the quality settings on consoles are questionable at best.

The primary motivator behind not publishing my modifications to console users is that consoles have degraded texture quality due to limited GPU power. This makes mods with high quality textures look very, very bad and then I get a lot of complaints.

I don't have the resources to test my mods on console which is another reason to not publish them there.

"Backstory: I'm acquaintances with this person selling her stuff on her Instagram story due to being introduced to each other by our mutual friend at a convention last year and ever since then we see each other every now and then at various other cons in the area.


Anyway she has a lot of various anime merchandise she is trying to sell so she could get rid of them. Two weeks ago I messaged her inquiring about the Aquors hat (from Love Live Sunshine) she was selling because I wanted to buy it off of her. She never responded, let alone read my message. Instagram lets you know if the person has read your message by displaying ""seen"" on the bottom right corner of the chat log. I know she hasn't read it because it doesn't show ""seen"" when I look at the chat log between us. I let it go since she probably sold it to someone else already. No big deal. This time around she has a small batch of pins for sale for $10 (not sure if it's $10 each or for the whole batch). I told her that I only want the Kanade pin but I would still be willing to pay $10 for that one pin. If she really wants the whole batch gone for $10 then that's okay with me too. It's only been an hour since I messaged her so I don't expect her to respond immediately.


Here's my problem though: she never responded to my previous inquiry so now I'm afraid that she won't respond this time either. I get that people are busy and won't immediately respond but at the same time not getting any response at all feels a little disheartening. And honestly I think it's a little rude to just not respond at all. If she never responds then I'll probably just stop trying to message her again.

When I read these messages, my anxiety skyrockets and I automatically assume the worst thing has happened and that he or my husband is in danger and/or harmed in some way. It’s not really something I can prevent from thinking and I’m already on meds and doing the necessary things to be better about this, and not allow my anxiety to take over, but it really frustrates me that he does this even after I’ve nicely reminded him in the past that it upsets me. 

He typically does it while I’m at work as well, which makes it even worse because I get to the point of pre anxiety attack when he sends this kind of shit and it’s hard to deal with while trying to be professional and do my best work at my job.

c505jk	2019-06-25 01:40:33	DeLandrey	WIBTA If I asked my brother for money even though I barely know him ?	"Very quick background, we have the same mother but different fathers, both of our fathers are dead. My brother is 44 and has two children, I'm 19. My mother absolutely hates the fact that I like to draw, she would tear up my art and scream at the sight of me drawing, however I want to enter an art school.

I did one year of med school that I absolutely hated, I'm deep into depression since high school but my mother doesn't believe that depression exists and last time I told her that I felt so bad I wanted to end she simply said ""Then go ahead"". Can't rely much on her unfortunately. So after this terrible year, she understood that med school is not my thing so she wants me to work in a bank instead. I have 0 interest in this and at the very moment I'll sign up for this, I'll be stuck for 4 years. Needless to say I'm not sure I'll survive. But she won't hear anything else.

I only met my brother twice, the first time was just a dinner, the second time was a whole day spent together. He's amazing, likes comics, discuss philosophy, he has a lot of life experiences and is very understanding. He may be way older than I but we still screamed like best friends when we noticed that we liked similar things.

He lives far far away though, so he insisted that I get WhatsApp so we can talk together, I showed him my art and he loves it, we send each other cool videos and if I don't respond for a few days he hits me up with some nice messages. He has a stable job and owns a very successful business where he is.

The thing is: I don't want to work in a bank, at all. I want to go in art school and the one I have in mind is 50k for a full cursus. I'd like to leave everyone but me out of this but the state will only loan me 15k without warrant and if I want 50k I need a warrant, and my mother spit on me last (and only time) I asked. So would I be the asshole if I asked my brother to be the warrant? Or to loan me 50k?

We became friends via an adaptive sports program. A bit after we met, he decided to get a service dog after seeing how much mine helped me. He got a pitbull puppy from the shelter. He raised this dog to be a service dog, against my advice. I advised against it for 2 reasons: I always reccomend a well bred dog for SD work because of health reasons, and I hate pit bulls. For a while, the dog did well. Then it developed food aggression. He got another dog, a well bred lab, and trained her to be his service dog. Well, then the pit got hip dysplasia. Then got bloat and needed surgery. Then got 2 benign tumors. Then ripped an ACL, and had scar tissue swelling in his ankle. Now he has cancer. This dog is 2 years old and it is very apparent that his genetics are just awful. But my friend adores him. 

A few months ago my buddy asked if he could move in with me. I said yes but not with the pit and he agreed to leave him with his mom (who he lives with currently). He is moving in this fall with 2 of his other dogs.

So the dog was diagnosed with cancer yesterday. It looks like it will be extremely expensive to fix, but the dog will hopefully survive. My buddy immediately said okay I will do whatever I have to do. To the point he is considering selling his computerized prosthetic legs. That would put him into mechanical legs, which hurt his back and impede his walking. It could ruin his back in the long term, because mechanical knees dont work as well as computerized knees. But he is insisting that god will save the dog and this is what he has to do and he has such a connection to this dog. And I'm like man, you have such a connection but agreed to leave him with your mom permanently without a second thought? And you would wreck your future body for him? He's 2 years old and all this has happened, his genetics are crap and if you beat this issue another is just gonna happen in a month. 

I told him that I think he should let the dog live as long as he is comfortable. Treat for pain. And once the cancer starts actually wrecking the dog, put him down. Don't spend thousands to save a dog that will likely get sick again, a dog he's leaving in 4 months anyways. Obviously, dont let the dog hurt or have a bad life. But dont try and extend it. 

My buddy doesnt think I'm an asshole, or he isnt saying it at least. But I'm wondering if I am.

The slight issue is that I’m a 21F. My parents made sure I’d never work a min wage job so I can study all day and go to a prestigious university.

So while I appreciate what my dad does for me, I’m too fucking old. I’ve suggested doing these things myself which bothers him. One time when he was about to go put gas in my car, I gently said, “no thanks I’ll do it myself when I run low”, and he kept insisting.

&#x200B;

Okay so im going to give a little bit of context.

My best friend, lets call him Boy, and I met when we both became hired at the college we both attend and we had to those job icebreakers at training. We got hired for the same position, but he got demoted because his attendance was low (we were basically mini teachers and held class sessions). When we met I was 17 and I think he was 21. We became friends over time and have been constantly texting each other almost everyday. We have been friends through a lot! Recently my ex and I just broke up after 9 months of dating about 3 weeks ago and it was pretty hard on me. I was heartbroken. Boy was really there for me. A couple weeks ago, almost a week after the breakup, I made a comment that I would prob need a month of two before I put myself back out there. He then takes this as the opportunity to tell me that he and a mutual friend of ours, R who is also a guy, had a conversation and that Boy was going to wait until I healed to ask me out. I immediately said ""why? I've told you before that we'll always be friends and I just don't see you that way."" He got super butthurt about it and later told me he cried about it. I then messaged R telling him that Boy knows I don't like him back and that I like (crush), since R is in our friend group and I wanted him to know the situation. Im done with the encouragement from guys for Boy to keep persisting.

Before that scenario, he's gotten drunk and told me how he's in love with me and how he wants to marry me and all that, and I just laugh it off and tell him ""lol you're such a nice friend"". Its just been since the break up that he's been very forward and kisses my head and hugs me when I see him and now he's telling everybody in the friend group of ours that he's in love with me, WHICH IS WHY IM UPSET! I actually kinda like another guy in the friend group and he knows this, and I feel like he's doing this to ruin my chances with my crush.

To make matters worse, throughout our friendship he's talked a lot about having sex with women, his roster of girls, his several other crushes in passing, but he says it hurts his feelings and makes him uncomfortable when I talk about guys. Earlier this week I finally had it and told him to stop acting possessive of me because we're not dating, and im allowed to flirt with whoever I want even if I hurt his feelings because im not his property. He reacted by calling me shallow because my crush is more attractive than him, and that my crush doesn't even like me.

In the last month I started a new job which the hours aren't crazy but require me to wake up at 6:00AM or earlier so I can be to work on time. I've never been an early riser but the job is been great enough so far that I've been able to deal with it pretty well. Unfortunately I cannot stay up past 10PM or graciously 10:30 at the latest since I haven't had to wake up this early since highschool and never had an extremely early class. 

Our group has decided on a large amount of movie nights recently and I have declined to watch a majority of them but will watch if the time doesn't overlap when I would like to be in bed for the night. One night I regretfully said I would watch a movie but not realizing what time it was and that at that point the movie would eclipse my sleep time. So I said I wasn't going to watch and got off for the night. 

Now I've been getting alot of unecessary insults and other ridicule since I don't want to kill my sleep schedule by staying up till 11:30 watching a movie and getting 6 hours of sleep and hating myself the next day. My question is AITA for not wanting to stay up and kill my sleep schedule?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c4zywj	2019-06-25 01:28:36	YankeeKilo	AITA for not wanting to spend time with my dad	"So my father has done the best he could in raising my brother and me. We have had everything we have ever needed there for us. And I can tell my dad has done the best he could, but he is the reason I struggle with anxiety and depression.

Ever since I could talk he has criticized everything I do. And I mean EVERYTHING. He used to hit us if we got a C in school. He always compared himself to us just to boast about himself. And he never let us speak our minds if it meant contradicting him.

This lead to me developing anxiety and depression (both diagnosed). I even had to see a therapist when I was 14. And in the 6 months of sessions she immediately saw that my dad was the problem. Whenever I had a meltdown he would always just yell and call me a baby, and make up half ass excuses of why I don’t have mental disorders and make his own diagnosis and ignore the therapist. This lead to me having meltdown near him a lot more. 

I then started to try and kinda avoid him when I could, and sometimes I would need to leave the room when he is there. He tried to change (to no avail) so that I would like him, but I just couldn’t look past the 15 of mental torment he put me through. I still have to avoid him sometimes, but his affect changed my life and now even when he isn’t around I still have major anxiety.

c4zyb9	2019-06-25 01:27:38		WIBTA for writing a fake yelp review about a co worker who keeps micro managing me?	21F. Just started a new job. I’tll be a month I was there in a week, so of course I’m still getting used to things. There’s this co worker that I have that is really rude. He’ll say things to me that are literally irrelevant. For example, just the other day he said I’m ‘going too fast on the register’. So, I can see if maybe I was going too fast and messing up, but I wasn’t messing up and what’s wrong with going fast if it makes the line go shorter? He even told my manager I was putting clothes the wrong way the first 2 weeks I was there, which, yes I was, but I was new and they have a certain way of doing things. Would I be the asshole if I wrote a fake yelp review pretending to be a customer and writing his name on it and saying he was being rude or something? I really like my job, my ‘co worker’ does not need to micro manage me UNLESS he’s my manager, and I basically want revenge if he’s trying to make me look bad for no reason.		1	0
c4zxrd	2019-06-25 01:26:34		AITA for making a joke about people breaking up?	"Little backstory: There’s this guy in my school who i annoy that he’s gonna date his girl best friend. We’ll call her Fiona and we’ll call the guy Shrek. Recently he got a girlfriend, who we’ll call Donkey. at the same time, Fiona gave me Shreks phone number

I texted him, and here’s what happened

Me: just wanted to say have a good summer and that if you break up with your gf (i didn’t know who it was at the time but i knew he had one) you always have Fiona to bounce back on

Shrek: Shut up and who gave u my number

Me: Fiona. She’s super nice

Shrek: actually

Me: Yeah, she’s really nice

Shrek: And ur annoying 

Me: you gotta pick Fiona up while you can

Shrek: Get [my friend who’s a girl] while you can

Me: i can’t she’s still dating [other guy] and i don’t like her

Shrek: no they broke up. you should get her before they get back together 

Me: i’m good. but you seriously need to try to get shay cause she’s not gonna be single for to long

Shrek: who does she like

Me: you (i was guessing) but someone probably gonna ask her out soon

Shrek: like who

Me: idk but a girl like her doesn’t stay single for long 

Blah blah nothing else really that important, just wanted to show that this seemed like a normal conversation at first that wouldn’t even brought up again

Boy was i wrong

Later, his girlfriend (this is when i found out she was “donkey”) says some pretty weird stuff. this was on snapchat so i don’t have it saved but it was something like

“stop trying to break up me and Shrek you’re just jealous cause you can’t get a girlfriend!!!! you’re never gonna get a gf so stop trying to break up people you can’t separate us!!!” among other very rude things

i then said “ it was a joke”

she replied “sure it was asshole 🖕”

now keep in mind i’m a mild mannered person, and i tend to be as calm as possible and explain the situation. most people don’t like fighting with me because i look like i’m under reacting. this gets them more mad

me: i didn’t even know you were dating him. i still don’t, we have a couple Donkeys in our grade

her: IM THE ONLY ONE! ARE YOU DUMB?!?!?

me: YES

me: i always thought we had other Donkeys, i hear people talking about someone named Donkey. might be in a different grade though. 

her: stop lying and just back the fuck off

me: ok whatever you say

i feel like she was really over reacting, but she’s gonna end up telling everyone i’m trying to split them and i’m gonna get oofed"		1	0
c4zwy9	2019-06-25 01:25:04	flawlesszero	AITA for being too feminine?	"It’s my first time writing something on reddit, and sorry in advance for my broken English. 

(Tl;dr at at the bottom)

I (F, 15, Br) had an argument with a 'friend' (we talk every day, but only because we walk in the same group at school) yesterday.  We met in 2017, in the eighth grade when I moved from the school I studied my entire life to one that would be harder and better, according to my mother.  I was desperate because I was antisocial (kinda, but I worked at it) and could not start a conversation.  
I was very ashamed, to the point that In restaurants never ordered my food because I thought the waiter was judging me (always asked for the others at the table).  btw the group that I walk was very welcoming and we got along right away.

My friend (let's call her Alex) from the beginning she said that I was strange and ""too feminine"" based on the way I act.  I quite like wearing dresses, skirts , cropped, makeup etc (things that Alex considers too feminine) but never wear it at school because the uniform is jeans, legging or shorts on the knee and school shirt and we can’t wear makeup, so Alex only saw what I really liked to wear the first time we met in group out of school, when we went to the movies and honestly I regretted.  When we were at the cinema door she started to talk things like

“You shouldn’t wear this kind of clothes, you look like a fu***ng kid”

“You would look better in men's clothing.”

“You would look so prettier / sexier if you wore sl*t clothes”

“Why tf you are with a purse?”

And I cry very easily (improving on that too) and I remember pretending to go buy popcorn in the way to wipe my eye so the tears do not ruin my makeup(mascara is expensive wtf).  I know, she should be on a bad day, I don’t blame her.  A boy in the group said after that Alex was only joking.

Things like this happened until this year, when I was without patience and started saying that I wasn’t in the mood to listen to her bs.  She even said that after I admitted that I had an interest in men and women I would take care of myself and dress right, and that women are seen as more fragile sex because of people like me.
She was extremely angry when I asked some boy to open a package and said that it make me fragile and stupid because I would obviously be able to open it if I kept trying.

I keep thinking that if it really bothers people I should stay quieter I don’t know, start wearing jeans and basic a** black shirts when I leave the house.
By the way, I decided to use reddit because I hate to make decisions for myself, I know I'm dependent but the person who used to help me, won’t do it anymore.  Maybe different opinions will help me idk what I am expecting. I do not want to be disrespectful to other people, and I do not want people to bother with my appearance.




TL;DR • Friend keeps repeating that I should be less feminine and wearing men or bi**c clothes would match me more.

c4zwm8	2019-06-25 01:24:28		AITA For Dating My Sisters Roommate?	"My sister is 3 1/2 years younger than me (she's 22, I'm 25), and her roommate is a year older than her. We'll call them Ashley (sister) and Molly (roommate). A little background info first: My neighborhood is super tight nit, and Molly's family lived a few miles away, but were always close to the families on my street, so I've known Molly for many years, though we never really were close. As we got older, we always connected at neighborhood parties (which are very frequent on my street), and always ended up having a good time together. I had wanted to ask her out for a couple of years, though for one reason or another, had never gotten around to it. 

&#x200B;

About a year ago, Ashley and Molly moved in together. They had never been super close, but were always friendly and got a bit closer as they got older. They decided to move in together and things are going well for both of them. At a mutual friends going away party a few weeks ago, Molly and I basically hung out the entire time, and ended up hooking up and exchanging numbers at the end. She said she was happy I had finally asked her, because she had been thinking about it for a while. 

&#x200B;

Now, I had talked to my sister about asking Molly out before, and I had been told no each time, with increasing firmness. She was not for it. The reason though? That I won't like Molly. She keeps listing things Molly does or says or reasons why I wouldn't like her, which I don't think is fair. She keeps insisting that if I meet anyone else, I wouldn't want to see Molly again, however, I have gone on dates with girls very casually, I just don't tell my little sister about (why would I?), and nothing has ever clicked. 

&#x200B;

Well I took Molly out last weekend and had a great time, she ended up coming back to my place and spending the night. We seem to have a lot in common and she is entirely different from any girl I have ever dated or been with in the past. Ashley is pissed. She thinks I am a fool and should take her advice whole heartedly, and stop seeing Molly altogether. She keeps asking me what dating websites I've joined and how I wouldn't like it if she started dating one of my friends, how I shouldn't put all of my eggs in one basket. I love my sister, we are super close, but I think she's infringing on my personal life, and her reasoning isn't even sound. I shouldn't take Molly out because Ashley knows I won't like her? For reason's x, y & z? I understand if she doesn't want things to be weird between her and Molly, but it's not like I hang out with them together or go over their apartment. It doesn't seem like this is as big a deal as she's making it out to be, but nevertheless, I'm torn inside and feeling really shitty about something that I should be feeling happy about. I like Molly and want to take her out again, but I don't want to upset my sister.

c4zwf9	2019-06-25 01:24:07		AITA for starting to resent my boyfriend?	"He doesn't live with me but he rarely goes back to his parents house anymore where he actually lives. He only goes back there for more clothes, or... Not really sure what else at this point. I say he doesn't live with me because I've made it a point to say that my condo is MY space and it needs to remain that way to keep my sanity. My solitude is an important aspect of my life that I use to be in my own mind. Since he is over so much I started to go ""crazy"" and he offered to give me space, which was very nice and I reallyyy appreciated that gesture. 

However, it is starting to get to me just how much of his space that it's becoming- especially since he doesn't pay any bills. He is there when I'm not there and uses my electricity (not much, but more than what would be used if no one was there) and he doesn't help pay my SRP bill. He will pitch in for groceries but he's never the one to cook. I feel like a housewife who comes home and cooks otherwise we aren't eating. He doesn't pay rent even though he's there more than I ever am due to our work schedules. He doesn't help pay my internet bill, even though he is using my wifi the entire time he's there. It's just... frustrating. Am I supposed to let it go because he's my boyfriend and I enjoy having him around? He is always always always making comments about how he just made money from a Depop sale, or how he's going to make money off a video he makes. I just don't understand how I'm supposed to feel. He doesn't go home because his parents are kind of stiff and annoying. I get it.. but can my space just be mine? I'm starting to resent him, I feel smothered and I want \*my\* condo to feel like \*my\* place again. Not ours. (I made it a point, and continue to, that this isn't our place but mine)."		1	0
c4zuu4	2019-06-25 01:21:15	GuerillaTactics96	AITA Cut off a friend for toxic behavior.	"So a little background, I've been friends with the same 5 guys since before highschool more or less. Point is we've all been friends for plus 5 years at least. We all decided to move up to a big city together since we are from a small town. We all came up with pretty good jobs, transferring from the small town. We are in a group chat along with other friends who are not as close to the 5 but still friends. 

When I moved up, after half a year I decided to buy myself a motorcycle. It's important later. All my friends were split among consoles, I played Xbox along with two other friends and the last two played on PlayStation. We started moving towards PlayStation except for me, didn't have the money and I hate the console personally. Well one friend at a point offered to buy it for me. I told him he didn't have to but he is one of those friends that likes playing everything together. I told him I would pay him back but it would take some time as I was starting school and bike payments and insurance. He said it was fine as long as I pay for the games and subscription. 

After initially paying off 200 of the 300 he starts getting hostile about the last hundred. I ofc understand and tell him I'll pay as soon as I can. I make it a priority, because you know he probably has an emergency or something. Well a week after instead of messaging me or talking to me in person since we live in the same house, or even the roommate group, he broadcasts to the whole group about the 100 I still owe him. Group had about 16 people. Personally I think financial stuff and personal stuff should stay in between the intended people, and that lack of respect pushed me to realize how toxic he had become over the 100. 

I sold some of the things I didn't need and gave him the hundred and decided not to talk to him anymore. Now personally I don't mind if my other friends hang out with him, but recently my closest friend tells me that he regrets the whole thing and wants to be friends again. From probably trauma and life events I don't like giving people second chances, before my first friend in 8th grade I've always been alone. Bullying was a constant and ""friends"" usually would end up ditching me, so I've always been careful on making sure I cherish all of my friends. 

The only thing that can break my view of friendship is lack of respect, mainly from growing up in a house with an abusive alcoholic father who demanded it just because he was my father."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I am all about scheduling and making sure everything lines up/goes smoothly. My roommate however is a chronic procrastinator. He doesn’t do anything in time, or really in general. He lets dishes pile up for days, has missed several assignments, been late for class weekly, has killed like 10 fish because he’s neglectful and has failed an entire semester (internship/co-op placement) because he was too lazy to apply for jobs.

Every time he is late for class he gets angry at me for not waking him up. I’m not his fucking mother, he’s an adult and I feel like he should have his schedule figured out.

Well, we started on our third year of university a few months ago and tuition was due two weeks after the semester started. I knew this, so paid it well ahead of time to get it out of the way. I decided not to notify my roommate of the tuition deadline, since the school does a great job of stressing when tuition is due through emails and social media. 

It’s been two months since the tuition deadline and my roommate came down to complain about the massive late fee he received for not paying. He went on for hours about how much money he needs to pay and how he has to drain his savings. He got all upset and asked me why I wouldn’t tell him when tuition was due. But this guy is 21 and three years into university, he should know this on his own by now...

So, AITA for not telling my roommate when the tuition deadline was? I feel like I’m not, but he keeps bringing it up and continues to try and blame me for this."		1	0

"Alright so I have worked super hard to get where i am and as a result, my kids (one girl, 16, and one boy, 13) don't want/need anything. We live in a multi-million dollar home and they have every opportunity practically handed to them.

For my daughter's 16th birthday, I bought her a (albeit, used) 2017 Mercedes. First of all, she didn't even thank me, and was upset because her friend got a new car for her 16th. Not only was she  ungrateful, but she totaled the car within two months of owning it and thought that since she crashed it I would just get her the car she wanted. Instead I told her that if she wanted another car she would have to get a job. This didn't go over well.

My weed smoking delinquent of a son isn't much better and I worried that he'd go down the same path as his sister if I didn't do something.

I did my best to reinforce the rules, they've both been grounded from all video games and electronics, including their phones, but it only seemed to make things worse.

In order to teach my kids a lesson, I rented a trailerhome, convinced them our home and items have been repossessed and had them move into a trailer park with me for a couple weeks. It was ONLY a couple of weeks, and I thought it would teach them a lesson.

Instead, my ex wife is now suing for sole custody citing ""emotional abuse"" and my kids and parents are not speaking to me. 

I think I had to take drastic measures to discipline my kids. AITA?

TL;DR My kids are ungrateful brats so I convinced them we lost everything and moved our family to a trailerhome to teach them a lesson."	Asshole	0	0

It has been over a year since my college friend group has got together. I decided to start a group chat with everyone inviting them to my place. I live relatively close to a beach so i said about taking a long weekend and making a day trip to the beach. I made a few polls in the chat to try and get the best dates for everyone. After about a week of what felt like pulling teeth I finally set the dates two months away so there would be plenty of time for people to get off work. A few people said right away they were busy even though they didn't vote in the polls for what weekend was best for them.  Even more never confirmed if they could go or not ( it's this coming weekend) There has been some drama between a few people in the group (none with me that I'm aware of) but I didn't think it was that bad that we wouldn't get together.

The most I had from him was a picture of me eating eggs with him smiling as he feeds me. I’m told I’m no older than 2 in that picture but I personally think I look younger. That’s all the context I’ve had from my dad in 21 years. That I have some record of anyway. 

The issue comes when I speak about my dad if it ever pops up when me and friends, as well as new people I meet at a party or gathering, talk about our families I call my dad the Worlds Greatest Magician”, because of his trick disappearing from my life. People I make this joke about who also didn’t grow up with their fathers tend to laugh and make their own jokes but others who had theirs say that it’s too much and not really funny since it’s not good to joke about that kind of thing. 

For context, I don’t say it in a way to put my father down because I hate him. I have no negative feelings against him. He has his own thing going on which I understand. I just say it as a joke since that honestly makes me feel better about it. It hurt when I was younger but self deprecation has been a good ally. I would actually like to speak with him and have a really easy way of doing so but I have no own fears when it comes to that which prevent me from doing so.

While Ella was pregnant, she mentioned to my friend that she wasn't entirely sure who the father was, and that it was a toss up between two people. Now, through some not so difficult social media sleuthing I was able to find to facebook account of the guy raising the kid, who now after these 8 months, looks really nothing like the guy who's raising him. Now, would I be an asshole for \*anonymously\* reaching out to the guy and suggesting a paternity test?

I am a brother to a pretty awesome little sister (24) and also a dad of three beautiful little girls (2, 5, 9). My sister dated men throughout her teenage years and I’d always assumed that’s how it’d stay. However she is now engaged to be married to a woman. Her soon to be wife is a really cool person and my own wife and I have enjoyed having her over and the kids enjoy her company. We haven’t told them they are dating.           
My sister came to me recently as the wedding planning has begun and she wants my wife and I in the wedding party and also wants our oldest daughter as a bridesmaid with the two younger ones as flower girls.       
Here is my dilemma.. I have a very Christian family. My wife and I take our girls to church every Sunday and to me, homosexuality isn’t in gods word. I feel that having my daughters go to church and then be a part of a gay wedding is only going to create confusion and questions for them. I have yet to discuss this with my wife. It’s not that I intended for any of our family to miss my sisters wedding, but I hadn’t even thought that far up until she told me she wants us to be a part of it.         
I spoke with our mother who is completely against the wedding happening at all. She says I should tell her no, in hopes she won’t go through with the wedding. That’s fucked up and I told her absolutely not. Like I said previously, I never made plans to not attend the wedding. I was hoping to maybe have the girls be babysat but I also struggle with that as they adore their aunt. Now that she wants them in the wedding, I can’t get a babysitter and decline her offer. That would break her heart.                  
But again this wasn’t a conversation I wanted to have with my girls. I don’t want to give them the wrong idea.           
I’m so torn here. WIBTA to tell my sister I don’t want the trouble of small kids at her wedding even though it’s a lie?                 
     
TLDR: sister is marrying a woman and wants my whole family involved in the wedding but I don’t want to have the conversation about homosexuality with the daughters I’ve raised Christian.

Sister: 18f

In the past 6 months, I have experienced a soul-crushing bout of anxiety and depression. It severely impacted my performance in school, and for the first time in my life, I failed a class. (I am usually a straight-A student.) So, on top of having all of these new emotions suddenly overtaking my life, getting into a good college, something I've never really worried about before, is the first thing on my mind 24/7. While school ending has been good for my stress levels and health as a whole, I started attending therapy to make sure I can get my grades back on track again and, oh yeah, feel better. (Strange how that isn't really my #1 priority these days.)

Anyways, today I was having an argument with my older sister about something random, not really a big deal, when she suddenly and without warning struck a really low blow and mocked me about going to therapy, saying that I was crazy and a problem child, etc. It was honestly some really hurtful shit and I was shocked that she would say that (mostly) unprovoked. I am a very proud, type-A person so it was really hard for me in the first place to A) admit that I needed help, B) seek out said help, and C) get over my self-consciousness of actually going to the meetings. So, I said what I thought of her in the moment. Which was something to the effect of:

""You are a terrible person. These past few weeks are the first time in months where I haven't been acting like a fucking zombie, only ever coming out of my room for food, and not conversing with anyone. The thought that you would try to make me feel bad for actually getting help for my issues and treating myself for an illness I have is disgusting. We are done.""

I then told her in a slightly more polite way to fuck off and walked away. She got very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. The part where I may be an asshole is that I now pretend that she doesn't exist, and don't plan to until she gives me a real, heartfelt apology, instead of one forced on her by our parents/out of guilt. I was talking to friends about this and a few of them said it was a bit childish to give the silent treatment, but the way I look at it, if she were one of my friends, I would cut them off completely until they gave me a true apology. Why should my sister be any different?

c4zk5n	2019-06-25 01:02:05	Mary268	WIBTA for asking my mom to remove me from her Find My Friends?	"&#x200B;

For some background context, I actually like Find My Friends. I currently share my location with my parents, brother, girlfriend, and best friend. The understanding is that it is mostly for emergencies, i.e. someone isn't answering their phone for an unusual period of time and isn't where they should be. The option of being able to know where someones phone is has been a pretty good safety measure, especially when I was in high school. However, I am now 18 and living apart from my parents. We are still on very good terms and see each other quite often, but I do my own thing unless we have plans.

The other morning, I woke up at around 8:30 AM to a series of confused/alarmed texts and missed calls from both of my parents asking where I was. I texted them asking what was going on as soon as I saw the messages, and received a reply of (paraphrasing) ""oh it's okay we were worried but it's silly"". I was a bit confused but since they had assured me that everything was alright I didn't worry too much about it in the moment.

I found out later what had happened: my mom looked on Find My Friends very early in the morning and saw that my phones location was in a park in the city that we live in. Because this was odd, she drove by the area and saw my car parked on the side of the road with my keychain inside of it and panicked.

I was at a friends apartment directly across the street from the park in question, had crashed there for the night, and had only brought my car key inside because I didn't need the rest of them. 

The miscommunication/assumption is obvious, and I don't fault her for that. However, I can't help but feel a little weird that it happened in the first place. I didn't tell my parents my plans for the night because I didn't think I needed to - I never have since moving out unless it involves a long trip or is otherwise necessary. So the fact that she randomly checked my location that morning makes me feel a little bit like a boundary has been crossed. She had no reason to need to know where I was and none of us have ever used Find My Friends without reason before.

I also don't want her to panic again.  She wouldn't have if she didn't check my location and I don't want to have to tell her my plans all the time to prevent it.

On the other hand,, I feel bad doing it. I know she just wants to make sure I'm safe. This is my first apartment, the first time I've really lived on my own, and I  she's going to worry about it. Also, this is the first time anything like this has ever happened. I have friends with helicopter moms and she has never been anything close to that.  I don't want to hurt her feelings over one incident.

c4zi2a	2019-06-25 00:58:16	nicknamefiasco	AITA for using a nickname for 2 years?	"For background, I joined an online forum a few years back and made friends. After a while we exchanged names and I gave my nickname, which is the preferred name I give for work, school, and how I introduce myself IRL. There was some comments on it when I said it, where people asked if it was short for something, and yeah, I did say no it wasn't, it was my name. Basically everyone uses it except for family members who grew up with my legal name, or assholes who insist on using it once they learn it. I was also wary of giving out my unique first name online. Stranger danger and all.

&#x200B;

From there, we became friends on social media (where I use my nickname) and eventually met up in person with some of us now living in the same city.

&#x200B;

Last week, some of us went out for drinks and ran into my cousin, who greeted me with my legal name. Everyone seemed a little surprised but I didn't think it was a big deal. Apparently it was, and several people afterwards gossiped about how I had lied about who I was and should have mentioned it before. I don't feel like I needed to. My nickname is the name I use for everything and many people in my real life don't even know my legal name. Everyone has been cold towards me since, and one friend straight up said that it felt like I was catfishing them?? which I dont get.

&#x200B;

So I thought I'd ask the internet, am I the asshole for using a nickname and not explicitly saying it wasn't my legal first name?

EDIT: my nickname has absolutely nothing to do with my legal name and I think thats part of their reasoning? not sure."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4zhif	2019-06-25 00:57:16	juiceisgoodforyou	WIBTA; Not allowing daughter to go over to her father's house because of his girlfriend's attitude.	"My sister was in a non-committed situationship with a coworker (Brian) for about a year in 2017. They stopped seeing each other and the coworker got back together with his on again off again girlfriend (Courtney) of 10 years. My sister found out she was pregnant shortly after. Courtney has two children that were not fathered by Brian. This is his first and only biological child to date. 


The three have struggled to get along since my niece was born. My sister has heard bad things about Courtney from Brian's mother, sister and co-workers (all of whom she has a good relationship with) and doesn't trust her to care for her daughter when she's in Brian's custody because he himself described her as ""spiteful and vindictive."" 


For this reason, my sister has been trying to meet with her so that she can establish a relationship (not a friendship) and set certain boundaries, expectations, etc. So far Courtney has refused to talk to or see her. 


My sister doesn't want to prevent Brian from seeing his child, so to ease her comfort she  puts a recording device (audio only) in her car seat when she goes to their house. 


Recently she overheard Courtney coaching her daughter to call her ""mama Courtney"" and has noticed that she has started posting pictures of herself with Brian and the baby, sometimes with her other children too, referring to them as a family. 


My sister was uncomfortable with all of this and basically insisted they talk immediately before the baby's first birthday party. 


My sister told her that she wants to speak to her directly if she's going to be looking after her daughter, that she doesn't want her posting her daughter on social media, and that she doesn't want her daughter to call her mama.


Courtney essentially said: I don't see why we have to talk to one another. I don't see a problem with posting her on social media. She can call me mama if she wants to, there's a certain way that she's going to run things in *her* house when the baby is there. 


My sister said this makes her uncomfortable with her being around her. That plus the fact that Courtney and Brian fight a lot and she recently ran him over by accident (?) after an argument. 


She's pretty much considering not allowing her daughter to be at Brian and Courtney's house until she can think of a better arrangement. 


Courtney and Brian are essentially acting as if my sister is being petty, jealous and standoffish. 


My family and I side with my sister, but I don't know if that's familial bias coming out. 


What say y'all? 

Tl;Dr: Sister is considering not allowing her daughter over to her father and his girlfriend's house because of the girlfriend's attitude and behavior."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"So here's some context, I'm in a group chat with a few girls that I'm pretty close with (I'm the only male) and it's been going well until tonight when one of the girls asked if she could add one of her friends into their group chat. 

You see~ my problem with this is that I'm not super close with this person, and I really don't know if we would click. And if they get added, I'm paranoid of this chat losing a bit of the tightness that it has right now. 

One more thing I should add though~ this person is honestly kind of a loner and they just want some friends, I was in a theatre program with them and the rest of these girls, but this person dropped out of the program halfway through, so I didn't have the opportunity to bond with them.

&#x200B;

So I was just going on a bike ride and I got to a traffic light. Another group walks up, two guys, a small child, and a baby. I cross the street and they are crossing the same way. When I got to the other side I set my bike up so it was facing the same way as the second crosswalk. There is plenty of room to walk by as the first guy got by no problem, but since the baby was in a rather large stroller I guess I didn't notice that there wouldn't be enough space. So the other guy who didn't walk past yet say ""Hey pal"". At the time I heard it as 'Hey Bill' so I thought he was talking to the guy who already walked past. He said it again then said to me ""Are you f\*\*king stupid"". This was when I realized that he was actually talking to me and not the other guy. So he walks up and kicks my bike out of the way, and it wasn't like a little tap, it was a pretty decent kick. He pushes the stroller by and gets right up to my face and says ""I tried to get your attention 3 f\*\*king times"". Then he walked off and I just kinda sat there. I just thought 'that guy could have just said excuse me'. Something like this has never happened to me before and I'm just 14 so I didn't really know what to do, and just in case any one is wondering, the guy was at least in his 40's.

She also comes from a very affluent family that has three houses and both she and her sister received cars as gifts when they turned 16. Her parents pay her car insurance (which is really generous imo) but expect her to pay for gas.

I'm old enough to have my license but I only have the first step of it (there's two levels around here) because a) if I had my license I still wouldn't be able to afford a car and b) I bike everywhere. I come from a lower middle class family where we have one car for the whole household and I'm expected to cover all my own costs besides food, which I think is reasonable enough. 

I have a job and she doesn't. (I bike to my job) And because of this, whenever we go anywhere together, I pay (we're both girls so there's not any sort of gender thing). I pay for our dates and if we go see a movie and if we get a coffee on the way somewhere.

She drives us when we go places and I pay for what we do at those places. We never really had any sort of discussion about it and I've never expected her to pay for dates or anything. 

But I've been learning Spanish for a couple years now (which she speaks in her family) and I heard her complaining in Spanish on the phone to her sister about me not paying for gas, given that I have a job. She and I were on a double date with some friends and her sister called her. From there she had a convo in Spanish (which our friends don't know but I do). She's never brought this up to me but from what I heard she seemed ticked off about it.

(and yes she knows I understand Spanish and was quite loudly complaining about it while I was over at her house and in the same room - just not directly to me). If I do any quick math, the amount she'd spend on gas driving just with me is less than half of what I spend on our dates monthly.

Am I doing something wrong here? Do I bring this up? Should I pay for gas as well?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

We will call him Zack) in my college and we take the same classes. I know him for a good 8 years now and we are pretty good friends all in all. Today we had an exam preparation lesson with our teacher and she's not that great with keeping our class quiet so every once in a while there's noise in the class and the serious students try to calm everybody. It's a situation that was hard and exhausting for everyone. After like two hours out of three Zack decided with other friends that he has, to go to a coffeeshop and learn there by themselves because it was hard for them to stay there and keep concentrating and listening and he offered me to join them. Although it was hard listening in the class, I declined and decided to stay in case the teacher will say something important about the exam. And now comes the part that got me mad. He said fine and asked me to tell him if she said something important about the exam. It got me mad because although it was hard there, I decided to stay because of this exact thing he asked from me so why should I ""suffer"" there while he goes to a coffeeshop with his friends to study. If he would care enough he would have bite the bullet and stayed. Anyway I said to him what the fuck and he said to me that I was staying there anyway so what's the problem. I didn't want to keep arguing so I said fine.

Later today, he sent me a message and asked if the teacher said something important and I said that I don't wish to tell him because what he did was not fair and we had a long arguement about it.

Usually we do take care of each other. If someone missed something the other would make an effort to fill him in. But something with this situation just felt wrong for me. It felt like being used although when we argued he said he didn't have any intention of using me. He said he planned to leave anyway and he asked me just because I decided to stay. He said if I would ask him the same thing he would do it without saying a word and I believe him but still I think there's a way to do things without hurting a friend even if it wasn't on purpose. He just was tactless you know what I mean? I don't know maybe exaggerating... Would like to hear your opinion :)"	Asshole	0	0

My usual group of friends who I normally party with has been planning one for a long time and the host really wants me to come because we're close friends and ""everyone is counting on [me] being at [host's]"". The only problem is, at our parties, if only the usual crowd shows up, I often end up more or less alone by the end of the night having to watch other people (including the host) go off in their couples. On the other hand I relish parties where I can meet new people and enjoy anyone's company whenever, not just the people I spend most of my time with anyway (as much as I love them). What's more, the host has said no to all the +1's I wanted to invite because he was scared they'd trash his house or because he had previously fallen out with them. Now obviously I'm not saying the only reason I go to parties is to get with people but if I go to the smaller party there's 0 chance of that happening because I'm such close friends with everyone there and I just don't see them in that way.

Essentially I've got massive FOMO and I want to go to another afterprom, a much larger one with more people including a healthy mix of friends and strangers. I've already got the invite and though I can't have any +1's either (bc it's already so full), at least I can guarantee I won't be lonely and jealous of everyone by the end of the night.

My best friend (Meg) and her husband (Ethan) have been together for 3 years, married for almost 1. They have a...not exactly toxic but not really healthy relationship. There are 2 kids involved, toddlers, one is Meg's the other is Ethan's (both from previous relationships, they don't have kids together). The kids are less than a year apart in age.

Small background info: both Meg and Ethan have been in the foster care system and both were abused as kids. Both were also in abusive relationships prior to their current relationship (they got together a couple months after they both left their abusers). 

Onto the situation:
Ethan's kid has been with them off and on since the fall of last year, and permanently for about 2 months. Ever since Meg and Ethan have started the custody battle for his kid, he has totally changed. He can have so much patience for Meg's kid, but absolutely none for his own. He has resorted to yelling in his kid's face and spanking them (as far as I was told, the court agreement says physical reprimand is prohibited) for the smallest things like having nightmares or not listening. He can't even watch the kids on his own, he ends up just shutting them in their room while he plays video games (I know 2 of their previous roommates who can confirm this). His temper is out of control and he has even physically threatened his wife.

Meg has confided in me that she is scared of her husband and what he would do to his kid if she left him. If she did leave, she cannot legally take his kid with her as in our state that would be considered kidnapping. And all of this is because his kid is the spitting image of his abusive ex.

Meg has told him that what he is doing is not okay and that he needs therapy, but he fights it at every turn. He agreed to family therapy, but doesn't participate and just sits on his phone the whole time. He will agree to individual therapy to get Meg off his back, but never follows through with it.

Meg has begged me and her previous roommate for advice and we tell her the same thing every time, that she and the kids are not safe and she needs to come up with a plan to leave. Every time she says okay, but then comes to us saying he's going to do this and that and it'll get better, but it doesn't. He's even told her that she's not supposed to see/talk to me or the roommate, because we're ""not good for his family"" and he doesn't trust us.

The thing is, I know she won't do anything because she's scared. But I am so worried about her and the kids, I'm at my wits end here. There is no way he's going to understand that he's abusive unless someone makes a call, but I know they're going to figure out it was me and it's going to tear my relationship with Meg apart and I can't help her or the kids if that happens."

Sam also has planned on taking advantage of free airfare to Europe and has a vacation planned for before the meetings start.

&#x200B;

The thing that *does* bother me is that the way they clean the pee is just by putting a paper towel on the pee spot and letting it soak. They don’t use any kind of cleaner on the carpet and because of this, their carpet smells like pee. It’s very noticeable when sitting on the floor (which I try to avoid doing but sometimes they throw get-togethers and we end up playing card games on the floor) and sometimes even when you’re just walking through the house. I figure they just don’t notice because people tend to grow accustomed to the smell of their own house.

I tried to start at 15, but I overturned the first time my dad took me out and went onto one of our neighbors lawns. No one was hurt and there was no damage to the yard, but it freaked me out a lot and I didn't feel ready to start driving again until now. Last week, my mom took me to an empty parking lot and I practiced for an hour or so. I was nervous, but I felt more comfortable than I had three years ago. My mom and I went again today, and I spent the hour going in a loop learning how to turn properly. I felt confident and I didn't think my driving was too bad, until I tried parking. When I was about to park, I pushed the accelerator instead of the brake and drove the car into a bush. I was able to reverse out, but the bush and a small pole nearby were damaged. We called the owner of the parking lot, etc., and afterwards, as I didn't want to let myself be deterred like I had when I was younger, so I drove around for another 10-20 minutes.

When I got home, my mom and I realized that there was some damage to the front of the car. Nothing massive, but it will have to be fixed. Later on, my parents told me that they wouldn't let me drive in their car again until I have proper lessons. I don't mind getting lessons, in fact I want lessons from professionals before I drive on the road, but there isn't any availability until the third week of July. I live in an area where it takes a 45 minute walk or 20 minute bike ride to get to the nearest anything, and I feel bad being 18 and still asking my parents and sister (who is 16 and got her license already) to take me places. None of them mind driving me around, but I feel guilty about being technically a full-grown adult to can't drive. I leave for college mid-September and won't be driving while there, but I wanted to be able to get my license before I go.

I understand if my parents don't want me driving on roads yet, but they've said they won't even take me to the parking lot or anywhere else until I have a few official lessons, which I can't start for nearly a month. For the short time I've practiced, I don't feel like I'm a particularly reckless or clumsy driver, and driving today (other than hitting the bush) I felt fairly comfortable behind the wheel, when in the past I've been incredibly anxious.

She asks about him all the time, and I struggle to come up with anything so I agressively change the subject. My fiancée thinks I'm being cruel but I'm not. I just...have nothing to say. 

She wants to see pictures but honestly there aren't any. Of our entire relationship there are only 2 pictures I had of him that aren't pornographic. One was kind of long range (private civil wedding) and the other was distorted and more focused on me. He didn't like being photographed. I destroyed them both and other family photos years ago in a rage.

I can't really remember what he was like or why we got together. That whole relationship was honestly a fog of mental illness. I was deeply unwell for most of the pregnancy up to his death. I remember general things, but they're so vague it could be about anyone. 

I'm not an angel, but he was deeply mentally ill. Between the two of us, I worry daily that genetics will come for her. 
I don't want to go on endlessly about his flaws, but it's all I can really remember. I'm treated now and she doesn't recall anything ever being wrong.

Speaking to his family is impossible. They were so horrible that I was granted a restraining order until daughter was 18. They were saying vile things and had been making credible death threats (calling me a wh*re, daughter a b*stard, saying she should be smothered in her cradle, etc).

Should I start lying so I have something to say? Pull up pictures of an unknown actor so she has something to look at?"		1	0
c4ypsg	2019-06-25 00:07:24	thesixofspades	WIBTA if I refuse to give this cat back to his owners?	"**TL;DR** \- six months ago found a lost cat, now the original owner’s mother wants it back.

In January I found a lost cat in my apartment complex. I took him to the vet to check for a chip and they found one and put me in touch with the owners. After a weird week of back-and-forth regarding the cat, the owner confessed to me that she is currently homeless. She bought the cat as a kitten (he is now around 3) with her college roommate, and took the cat with her when she moved out to California to help out her mom. She fell on hard times and is now living out of her car. She gave her last $200 to a friend to watch the cat, and that guy turned out to be a huge asshole because he just set the cat outside and left him there (this is a strictly indoor cat) without doing anything to actually watch over him. I offered to help the owner out, raised about $900 online and also pitched in a couple hundred of my own money (the latter of which she promised to pay back, though I don’t expect her to and would be fine if she didn’t). Unfortunately, six months later she still doesn’t have a stable living environment and so the cat remains with me. 

Today I received a call from said owners mother. She’s also been dealing with homelessness, in and out of long-term-stay motels, and hospital visits. She mentioned to me that she’s finally in a bit more a stable environment (seems to be some sort of senior living care center? Couldn’t get enough details on that), and after her doctor asked her if she had any pets to act as therapeutic help, she wanted to know how I felt about returning the cat. Her daughter (original owner) still seems to be in the same situation as before, but mentioned they might be able to find an apartment soon, which would mean her leaving the senior care facility and moving in with her daughter.

**So the kicker is as follows**: At the start of this ordeal, I mentioned that should they find a stable place to live long-term, I was happy to return the cat to them. Having cats growing up I was sympathetic to them wanting to have him back. As you can probably guess, I’ve definitely grown attached to this cat. I’ve been trying to come to terms with the fact that at some point, they would likely ask for the cat back, but a few things are giving me pause. The first is that it’s the mother asking for the cat back, not her daughter, who is the one who bought and raised the cat. The second is that I don’t really get the feeling that either persons situation is a stable one, and I would hate for the cat to end up living in their car with them again (which was their situation for about 6 months before she gave the cat to her friend to watch).

I’ve been trying to contact the daughter but haven’t been able to reach her yet, but in the meantime, I figured I would see if you all think I’d be the asshole for not giving the cat back."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4yonj	2019-06-25 00:05:12	KaylamityJane	AITA For Yelling in a Family Argument	"(Family issues-please don't read this if it will make you sad or bring back bad memories for you! I don't want anyone to feel bad because of me.)

For context, my home life has always been a bit tumultuous. My dad is usually a great guy, but then he'll suddenly have these episodes where he goes on a screaming rampage that might last only a few hours or it might last a week. I put up with it for 18 years, defending my mom where I could, but mostly just trying to stay out of the way and not make things worse. When it came time to choose a college, I went to one over 600 miles away from home, despite the added expense (my dad, of course, wouldn't pay for my education), just so I could be as far away from him as possible. Last summer, I came home because my mom basically begged me to and I didn't have any other plans, and I felt bad because I knew she'd be more hurt than him if I didn't come home. He managed to control himself all the way up until the last week or two, at which point I just packed my stuff and went to visit family near my university. This summer, I had plans for most of July and August, and once more, my mom begged me to come home, so I did.

He was pretty good... until yesterday. He was snarling and snapping a little, making a big show of going out to feed goats and catch some for market by himself, and when my mom shut the gate the rest of the way, he started screaming at her for it. He was looking for a fight, admittedly, and had been for most of the day. I was out there to help them with chores, just as I am pretty much every night. He wouldn't tell my mom and I how he wanted to catch goats and who he wanted to feed first, so he had already been growling over some things, and then he just started screaming at her. I've put up with it for 18 years... and I just couldn't, or rather wouldn't, put up with it any longer. I yelled back at him in defense of her, yelling that he wouldn't tell anyone what he wanted done and how he wanted to do things. He yelled that women like me are the reason the world is going downhill and that I'm a rebellious child and how he'll be condemned by God for my behavior. He kept on screaming at me, and so I finally screamed back, ""Fine! Do it yourself!"" With that, I stormed back to the house, grabbed my stuff, moved his stick-shift car out of the way (no easy task, mind you, but I managed; he was quite pissed about that one), and then got in my car and left.

But for the Am I the Asshole part, am I the asshole for yelling back at him and moving his car? Should I have just kept my mouth shut? A little part of me is worried that it's my fault that it got so bad and that he screamed at my mom. He has basically said that it's my fault, and even my mom said that I should respect him and shouldn't have yelled back at him because he's my dad and my elder. I just couldn't take it anymore..."

c4ymb9	2019-06-25 00:00:45		AITA for asking my partner not to get super drunk around his ex?	"Backstory: My partner, A, was poly when we met, and started dating myself and a woman, B, around the same time. I am a nerdy, quiet person; she is, to my knowledge, an extroverted, extremely attractive burlesque dancer/model. A few months after we started dating, A broke up with B and told me he didn't want to date anyone else, and we've been exclusive since. We now live together. A and B have remained friends, though, and despite my better logic, I continue to have some pretty severe anxiety about their relationship. I know it's irrational, I try to deal with it whenever B comes up in conversation or A tells me he's going to see her, but frequently, it ends up being a huge, dramatic discussion because I just shut down every time. This is in part because B embodies, at least superficially, pretty much everything I have ever been insecure about in myself, and also there have been a couple of incidents in the past were my and A's understanding of what is OK by monogamous standards differ (physical affection, nudity, etc).

We've discussed all these issues at length, and basically agree we're at an impasse, because despite my best efforts, I can't ""get over"" my insecurity regarding A's relationship with B, and A does not want to stop being friends with B, which I respect, even if I don't understand it.

Here is the ""AITA?"" part: This morning we ended up in a bit of a blowout because A told me he made plans with B to go do karaoke next week. As we all expected, I felt a bit suckerpunched (partly because it's a rare day that both A and I have off together, so the fact he'd be spending it with B instead is... a bit of a sore point). I made the request that if he was going to go do this, could he please try not to get totally smashed while they were out (A and B have a history of basically just drinking and smoking heavily when they're together), for my own piece of mind. 

A took it extremely badly, saying he felt I was essentially saying I didn't trust him, because if I did, it shouldn't matter how drunk he got while he was with B. I said that it wasn't that I didn't trust him, but that in my experience with myself and past exes, being intoxicated can lead to bad situations even with the most trustworthy of people, and in this particular context, with this particular person, it would REALLY help my mental state to know he'd keep it a bit less crazy. Things escalated from there, my partner ended up having an anxiety attack and feeling like a piece of shit, and now I feel like a piece of shit for still having a problem with B being in the picture. 

We're okay now, but I'm left feeling really confused about whether my request deserved the response it got, all things considered."		1	0

So, I have this online friend who's birthday was coming up. A week back, she sent me some DMs regarding some of the art I did earlier in the week.

Her: Hey OP, I liked your art a lot. Is it available for purchase?

Me: No, I don't sell my art, per se.

Her: Thank the starssssss

Her: My birthday is coming up this weekend and I was wondering if you could draw me a piece?

Me: Ok, what do you want?

Her: Oooooh, maybe a tiger or a panda!

Me: Alrighty, I will do it if I have the time!

So as I was doing the artwork, she kept messaging me about the art. It grew more annoying and annoying and decided to call it quits and leave the picture unfinished. Finally, it was the day before her birthday. I got yet another message from her.

Her: Soooo, did you finish that picture? I got so annoyed at that point, that I decided to spill the beans.

Me: I never got to finish it because you kept nagging me to finish it. If only you haven't pushed me to finish it faster, then you would've had your birthday gift.

Her: ...It was dead radio silence after that. Eventually, I did finish it and sent the file to her, but I think she blocked me (???). As I'm an empathetic person, I felt so bad doing that. I tried calling her, but no response. I ended up never giving her a birthday gift. I might've disappointed her severely.  So, AITA?

Edit: Little backstory 

We met online about a year ago. We quickly became friends over our love of CS:GO and Daft Punk. She was kind to other people, respects them, and even adds them as a friend if they wish to do so.

Alright so this happened a while ago, way back when I was 8, but my mom seems to love to bring it up, so I’m looking for some people to tell me if I was wrong.

While I was at summer camp, I met a friend who shared similar interests to me, and we hit it off immediately. He eventually came over to my house with his mom for a play date. I loaded up a Minecraft world with a bunch of rollercoasters that I had spent many hours building to show him, which he seemed to like. I was showing a rollercoaster that cut into a mountain when my mom called me into the kitchen, and I gave him my iPad for the time being.

Whatever the conversation was, I came back into my room to see my friend on my iPad who had taken the time to burn down one of my rollercoasters (of which I was particularly proud of) and was in the process of destroying my tallest one yet.
“Next time you shouldn’t build your rollercoasters out of flammable materials!” Is what he said.

I got really mad at him, mad enough that I started crying and both of the parents saw what was going on, and heard my explanation of what happened. Eventually, we got over it, and I thought that was that.
However, my mom came to me that night and totally ripped into me. How I embarassed the guests, how I was a horrible child, and how I shouldn’t have gotten so worked up.

For their part, their Mom didn’t seem particularly concerned and even asked for another play date later, but my mom seemingly didn’t say yes or respond because it never happened. Am I the asshole for getting angry about something immaterial yet close to me, or is my mom the one in the wrong for punishing me?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So for context, me and my 2 friends play the Bakugan Battle Planet TCG, and it's a lot of fun. I always lose against both my friends, but there's one specific one, who we'll call D in this story, that got me a bit suspicious. For those who don't know, there are is a type of ability card in the game known as a Flip card, where if it gets sent from the top of your Deck to the discard pile due to damage, you can pay the required energy to stop the rest of the damage. It felt like it was just me before, but whenever I did win a battle and would do damage, I would catch D putting a card onto the top of his Deck, and after that would get a Flip Card immediately. I thought it was just me seeing things at first, but the thought still lingered. During the day I posted this, when I had D and my other friend over, I decided to test this to see if it were true, so while we were shuffling, I secretly put 2 of his 3 Flip cards on the top of his Deck so they would be in his starting hand, since they were useless while in his hand so I could test if he really was putting them at the top. In the middle of the game, his 3rd Flip was sent to the discard pile, so I knew for a fact all his Flip cards were out of the Deck. Then all of a sudden in the next turn, when it was time for him to take damage, take a wild guess what the top card of his Deck just so happened to be. A Flip card, which basically confirmed for me that he was cheating. I called him out on this and told him what I did to test him, and he pretended to not know what I'm talking about and look at me like I was insane. We continued hanging out harmlessly for the rest of the day but from now on I'm keeping a sharp eye on his Deck when he's about to take damage in the future.

c4yfd6	2019-06-24 23:48:29	dharmachapeau	WIBTA if I reported my mom to the DMV for driving with impaired vision?	"My 75 year old mother has always had trouble driving at night. Over the past several years, this has worsened considerably, and her daytime vision has gotten worse as well, due to cataracts. She tries to avoid driving at night, but she sometimes does, in an emergency or if she wants to go somewhere in her own small town without getting on the highway ‘because I know where I’m going here.’ Arguments that while she may know the surface roads by heart, traffic is ever changing, and that driving by memory is unacceptable, are brushed off - as in, verbatim, ‘Pish tosh.’ A few years ago my father had a medical emergency in a distant city (where I already was) and she had no choice but to drive at night to the hospital. She got completely lost, and called me as my father was leaving surgery hysterically sobbing while driving claiming ‘There are no street signs and there’s no way for me to find out where I am!’ It took hours, some serious detective work, help from friendly locals, and essentially chasing her down as she drove aimlessly through the city, sobbing incoherently into her phone the whole time, to find and collect her. 
She knows that she needs surgery but she is terrified of needles/surgeries/hospitals, though she loves going to the doctor. She alternately says ‘I’m going blind!’ and ‘It’s not that bad! Don’t be ridiculous.’  She argues that there is no point to surgery as ‘it’s not an instant fix’ (as in, full recovery can take a few weeks before seeing well again). 
Mitigating factors which could make me TA: she does avoid driving at night if she can possibly avoid it. Driving, in their small town, is the only reasonable mode of conveyance from one place to another, and without her license she would be housebound without my father who travels frequently (or, she is actually pretty likely to just drive with a suspended). She has not been in any accidents at ALL, remarkably! She does say that she’ll get the surgery ‘sometime.’ And of course, both my parents would probably say I am overreacting, and my mother would never forgive me or even speak to me again. And if I’m being honest, I’m not holding out hope that the DMV is exactly going to jump all over this anyway."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So about a week or so ago, I was having an absolutely terrible day at work and I was angry and frustrated. So I went out to my car at lunch to find myself boxed in and unable to get out. So in my angry state, instead of do the rational thing and ask a co-worker to mover their car so I could get out; I decided to shoot gap. There was a narrow space of between my bosses truck and square concrete step ( about 6-8 inches high) also there was another car ( about a mid-size sedan's width away ( to the left from my bosses truck  between where I could get my car through if I was very careful. 

So I got a very small bit of speed up and got two wheels on the concrete block so that I could turn and get through the space between the two vehicles. 

In doing this I chipped off a small bit of paint on my bosses truck about 3/4 inches long and 1/4 of a man's pointer finger - finger nail's width. 

Eventually I got out and raced off to lunch to cool down. 

Today my boss came out and said ""Hey what's up with your car?""  As a result of my maneuvering I put a square dent in my car and two scratches. I initially said I don't want to talk about it, but I came clean and told my boss what I had done and he went over to his truck and checked out the truck and noticed the damage. He asked why didn't you tell me and I said because I was embarrassed and then said ""nothing I can say right now will justify my actions"". He said ""Welp, that's going to have to be touched up"" and walked off. I later volunteered to cover the full cost of the repair.  I think I am the asshole because although I did tell the him the truth and I am paying for the damage to be repaired, though I still did not tell him immediately. :( 

I would love to hear your feedback on how I could have handled this better and comments in general. 

I should clarify that I like my boss a lot, but I do one of the most important jobs at my work, work more hours than everyone else and I believe I get paid less than most other employees. Also the company insurance is not covering my adhd prescriptions and medical costs and I don't have the time to fight the insurance company to get them to do their part. None of that justifies at all what I did, it's just the current way things are for me at work right now. 

T.L.D.R - I was angry and frustrated, my car was boxed in and in getting out, I put a minor scratch in my bosses truck's bumper and my car took a big dent and two scratches. Then, I didn't tell my boss about it till today, about 1 1/2 weeks later. I am paying for full cost of repair and told my boss about it, myself."	Asshole	0	0

She has two children—a 3 year old boy and a 6 year old boy. They are definitely momma’s boys.

We have just moved in together to her house—because I was renting an apartment. We obviously sleep in the same bed.

Almost every night, almost every single night, one of the two boys—but often both of them—get out of their beds and come to our bed and crawl into bed.

I’m a light sleeper and I’d say 4/5 times it wakes me up, because they don’t just come in, crawl into bed, they come in, shake her awake and announce that they can’t sleep so she scoots over to make room for them.

I told her a few days ago: “I think they should start sleeping in their own bed. I think it’s good for them to sleep in their own bed, because this may cause dependency issues later on.”

But she’s adamant it’s just because our bed is more comfortable than theirs and they just get lonely in the night and of course I’m a monster for even thinking about telling them they can’t come in and sleep in our bed."		1	0

Okay, let me tell you all what’s been going down.
A few days ago I invited one of my best friends to my Minecraft server because he’s great and would fit in the server perfectly.
Unfortunately he’s the WORST builder I’ve ever seen in any Minecraft setting ever, and I mean WORST.
On day one he builds a really ugly floating base far away from the main town area, no problem since it’s far away.
He adds onto the ugly base, making it more putrid—still nothing wrong.
Then on day 3 he builds a floating stone-brick pathway all the way to the main shopping town thing, mind you this is 200+ blocks of the most ugly, put-together-with-tape-and-bubblegum looking build imaginable.
The bridge itself stretched over several other bases and over reserved land, which has been clearly reserved with wool.
In addition, he’s been supplied with Elytra and rockets, which if you don’t know know, let you fly really fast and easy—making no reason to have a bridge thing to the town.

And today, he built a giant mobfarm, get this, in someone else’s base.
The players base he’s built it in has gotten so discouraged with his ugly buildings, she’s temporarily quit.
And again today, he literally dug a huge mountain away in the ugliest fashion possible, right in front of the town—making a huge ugly pile of cobblestone and dirt, sand, and gravel.

I don’t want to ban him or tell him he’s terrible 
at building, that would be rude, but I’m at my wits-end with this nonesense.

c4y8cm	2019-06-24 23:36:27	cashewnutmilk	WIBTA for telling the person playing loud music for 5-9 seconds at a time to stop bc it is super annoying to me?	"Hi everyone! I’ve been an avid reader on AITA for  the last few months and figured I would make my first post.

I’m currently on a bus from one city in Texas to another city in Texas (about 3.5 hours of driving).

The person sitting behind me keeps playing loud rap music, videos, snapchat videos, etc, but only for about 5-10 seconds at a time. This has happened maybe 15 times. It is driving me crazy. Every time I think I’m gonna lose it and am about to turn around and tell them to stop, they suddenly stop playing the music. This person is about my age (college student) not a child.

The bus has 2 levels but both are relatively full so I cannot move to a seat far away (plus we are already on the road and the drivers usually don’t want people moving around since it is unsafe).

I (and I assume this person) both paid for general seating on this bus. No one else around me seems bothered by these spurts of loud music, which baffles me. I am using headphones to listen to my own music, but I can still hear the other person’s music because it is that loud.

So AITA, or WIBTA for telling this person to either stop playing things out loud or use headphones because I am annoyed? Regardless of my judgement, there is less than an hour of this trip left so I will probably suck it up and not say anything, although I am losing my mind. I’m genuinely curious about what you guys think and what proper etiquette is for playing stuff out loud in public. Even as I type this out, the person is playing things louder and more frequently.

Side note: It is my biggest pet peeve when people play things out loud, even in private. Like if my friends start playing a Snapchat story loudly when we hang out in my apartment. Nothing happening on a Snapchat story is so important that they need to listen to it loudly while we spend time together in my opinion (I know that sounds assholey). Does anyone else feel this way?"

c4y797	2019-06-24 23:34:24		AITA for how I responded to this guy’s question?	"My wife and I are in the process of buying a house. We’ve been to multiple open houses. This past Saturday we went to an open house and were greeted by a realtor. I’ll call him Al. We started talking with Al about what we were looking for in a house and he handed me a business card and kept going with some small talk. 

Some background: I have a pretty large scar across my face that I got in an accident at work. It’s not crazy noticeable, but it’s definitely there. I don’t really like talking about it, it was a pretty shitty time because my face was the least of the injuries. I needed back surgery, reconstructive surgery on my nose, epidural shots, etc. 

This dude out of nowhere just goes “so, OP, what happened to your face? That looks fucked up, man”. 

I replied: “ya motha likes it rough, I don’t know what to tell ya. Nah, man it was an accident at my job a few years ago.” 

Al: That’s terrible. ::walks away::

I was kidding! If you could hear my tone you’d know it’s one of those knee jerk snide remarks. He just immediately changed his outward behavior and walked away from us. My wife said I’m an asshole. Honestly I don’t care if I am, I felt like he was too familiar and forward and I didn’t like his prying into my personal life. But please, judge me, am I the asshole?"		1	0

c4y53d	2019-06-24 23:30:34	rsr42	AITA for despising and snapping at my chronically ill coworker?	"I (F29) have a coworker (F29) that is making my already stressful job extra difficult. Besides not being a great professional and saying all kinds of inadequate and idiotic things throughout the day, she. Just. Never. Shuts. Up.

She constantly talks about everything in the office, and when she is not she is talking on the phone (both work AND personal conversations). I have witnessed conversations with her boyfriend, her mom, her brother, etc. She laughs LOUDLY and is always talking in an over enthusiastic, almost cartoon like voice. We work in an open space so I cannot get away. I have invested in a good pair of noise cancelling headphones but they can only do so much. 

Additionally, she constantly asks questions about everything in a waaay too interested manner, and offers the kind of unsolicited help which becomes really tiring. For example, I cannot mention that I am hungry without her flying off her desk and coming over to mine with cookies, and ask me “do you want a yoghurt? Do you want to eat my lunch? Do you want me to go downstairs and get you a sandwich? I can go to the supermarket if you want! Did you not have breakfast?” She is constantly IN MY FACE talking and sometimes I just want to go about my work day without this.

So basically I have gotten to a point where I can no longer tolerate the sound of her voice. She breathes and I’m annoyed. And the worst part is, some months ago she confessed to me that she has a chronic serious genetic illness that will ultimately kill her before she gets to be old and I felt like the worst person in the world for despising her. I gave her a hug, told her I was so sorry and offered to help in anything she needed. 

However, the constant talking annoys me so much and overpowers any empathy that I may feel for her situation on a daily basis. I try really hard to fight this feeling and I feel like a horrible person but even if she sneezes I am filled with this uncontrollable rage that just makes me want to scream for her to shut up.

Last week we were having lunch in the office and she is GOING AT IT. Here is the interesting detail: I am getting married this year, and about 6 months after I set the date for my wedding and let everyone know the date, she got engaged and decided to get married on the same fucking day. This annoys me as well but what the hell, I do not own the day. So she is in talking on and on about her wedding and I am sitting there eating my food, trying to manage my anger while listening to her talk continuously. Until finally she says “so, let me know all about your first dance in you wedding!” in that cartoon voice. So I snapped and I told her, as calmly as I could, that I really did not want to provide details about my wedding since it is private. She flipped and was really angry and has barely said anything to me since. I appreciate the silence, but am I a horrible human being?"	No A-holes here	0	0

Ok soI (17M) have a condition called Irritated Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Basically this condition makes shitting painfull, I cant eat fast food, pizza, spice ect (Well I can but not too frequently).Its really an annoying and painfull condition that I dont wish anyone would have. 

Ok so my dilemma is that I tend to prefer using handicapped bathrooms cause they are more comfortable and have more space while I deal with my pain. (Sometimes ill be upwards of 1 hours or on bad cases 2 in a bathroom.) Cause when I use normal public bathrooms which are smaller I get anxious and cant breath well or cannot stretch. But when I use handicapped bathrooms I get anxious too that someone handicapped comes and needs the bathroom.

AITA fellow redditors?

Edit: I sadly left a point out: The pain sometimes LAST 1-2 hours, or the shitting sessions themselves. Not because I want to, but because im stuck there till the pain stops or im done. IBS is a really painfull condition and it affects every person very different."	No A-holes here	0	0

c4y2e9	2019-06-24 23:25:49	PrincessMarvel	AITA for cutting out a friend I felt wasn’t there for me during a stressful time?	"I have a few friends that I met on Twitch. I’ll call them K, T, and S. We have a group chat that we message each other in everyday. 

One night, I was closing my pizza delivery store with my manager who has Crohn’s disease. He had tried calling out because he felt really sick but no one could cover for him. He came into his shift looking like a ghost. During the night it got progressively worse. He wouldn’t leave the office for a good while and the later left to go to the bathroom. His mother ended up calling me begging to get an ambulance for her son because he was throwing up white. 

I began panicking and immediately called 911 to get and ambulance here ASAP. My hands started shaking and I began pounding on the bathroom door for him to let me in because he wasn’t answering me. I finally got the door open and he was hunched over the toilet and throwing up. The ambulance arrive pretty quickly and took him away.

All while this is happening my group chat has been buzzing. I finally open it and tell my friends what happened. I tell them that I’m worried and have really bad anxiety about whether my manager will be ok or not. K was very helpful and kept trying to calm me down best they could. S on the other hand asked if he was ok and when I replied no, they switched to topic to their math homework. S basically complained about how difficult the math tests were. 

I felt like they had blew me off and I left the group chat to talk with K privately since they were the only one helping me calm down. 

A few days later, S texts me asking why I left the group chat and I tell them that I felt like they had blew me off. I feel like they weren’t a friend when I needed them to be. S then texts K that I was still bitching about my manager issue. K obviously tells me this and I went from upset to angry. I tell them that I can’t have a friend like this and talking about me behind my back isn’t helping. 

S then tries telling T lies to get him to turn on me. I show him the messages of where she blew up on me, as well as the sh*t talking. T gets very angry and pretty much ignores the messages from S for awhile. I decided to cut S off completely as I couldn’t deal with the stress.

My friends think I should make up with S since we share the same group of friends. I don’t really want to because my life has been happier and the friends I have now are pretty great. One of them says that not giving her a chance would make me kind of an asshole.

c4y2cp	2019-06-24 23:25:45	beee_ry	WIBTA for not going to my grandmother's funeral?	"GM= Grandma GPs= Grandparents Ps= Parents

&#x200B;

As a pretense, I am a gay male living as a first generation born citizen in the United States to a very conservative European born family. I've been out with my family except my GPs. About seven years ago I had been in a relationship with my BF for about four years. My Ps liked him and my relatives had wanted to meet him. I always felt a little weird because I never discussed my homosexuality with my GPs as I knew how conservative they are. I eventually got tired of always showing up alone to family functions and came out to my GPs prior to Thanksgiving. They were understandably not ready and asked that my boyfriend not come to Thanksgiving.  I complied and went solo to Thanksgiving. One of my uncles came up to me and told me to bring my BF to New Year's Eve as it was always at his house

Skip to New Year's Eve and I show up with my BF to the party. My relatives were welcoming and we had a good time. My Ps were not in attendance as they were overseas in Europe. Things were going well for the most part, but I noticed GM hadn't spoken to me yet. So trying to be the bigger person I went to go say hello to her. We always greeted with a kiss, but she turned away from me and ignored me the entire night. I was a little hurt but understood that she may need time. I mentioned what happened to my mother, but let it go. 

&#x200B;

Three months later the same uncle was having a birthday party for his daughter. I did not go as I lived hours away and only tried to make bigger family functions. My Ps were back stateside and went to the party. My mom not wanting to start anything, decided to be civil but not overly warm with GM. My Ps are mingling with family at the party and GM comes up behind her taps her shoulder and says ""Are you mad at me?"" My mom responded, ""Don't I have a reason to be?"". 

This causes my GM to go into a rage. My Ps and GPs went to a private place to talk where GM apparently said, ""Do you think I want a kiss from a faggot?"" and ""Do you think I want a faggot in the family?"" My dad apparently went white and yelled back that I am a good kid and they are not to speak ill of me. GM continued on, but my dad stopped her and told them that they were not his parents and walked out. They did not speak for a couple of years.  Shortly after my relatives were bombarding me with emails telling me to be the bigger person. I did not want to deal with the constant stress and asked everyone to not contact me again and progressed to cut ties with my family. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward another four years and my GM has been on a very rapid decline due to vascular dementia. She has gotten to the point where she does not even recognize my grandfather who she has been married to for over 60 years. I have maintained separation of contact for almost seven years now and I really have no desire to see anyone.

c4xym2	2019-06-24 23:18:56	Luckythepunk	AITA For treating boys and girls differently when they needed the bathroom?	"I used to be a sub for about a year. I taught a fair amount of middle school and high school. I didn’t always agree with how the bathroom rules were set up but I made sure I stuck to whatever the school or teacher wanted for the most part. 

Most of the time teachers would have a one person at a time rule. So if someone was already gone the other had to wait. I got around this by telling the students (if another was gone) if they had to go that bad they can risk getting caught in the hall and had to accept whatever consequence came their way. 

The way I differed was I would always ask something along the lines of “can it wait?”  Most responses even from girls would usually be yes or the pee dance and “I have to go really bad.” Then they had the option to go without a pass. 

Now the difference. If a girl gave me a definitive “NO” like this can’t fucking wait kind of context I just told them “go and don’t worry about security.” Now the reason was I am a man and I wasn’t going to ask a girl why or push the issue because they are old enough that they are getting their periods. It was not a battle that was worth fighting. Some boys complained and if they got more upset I only told them that they took health class and should know why. 

I told this story to some male friends and some of them said I should have treated them all the same. My argument was there is no way I can reasonably do that without getting in trouble because men don’t have the same issues.

Edit: sorry maybe I didn’t make it clear but I did let them go if they told me no they couldn’t wait. They just had to go without a pass and if they were caught then they got whatever consequence came.

Edit 2: hopefully I will make much clearer here what I did and why. This never came up but if a girl had to leave for what I suspected was her period and got caught I would have tried to get her out of trouble. It was to hedge my bets from getting complaints over this. Where I live if a sub gets two or three complaints they are done. I wanted to enforce rules so I wouldn’t get complaints but I also didn’t want to get complaints for enforcing stupid rules either. So I tried to find a middle ground that kept them to what I hoped was nothing. I really hope this clarifies things."	Asshole	0	0
c4xyh7	2019-06-24 23:18:40		AITA for asking my sister for a birthday present?	"It's my 18th birthday in a week, not sure what it's like in other areas but you're 18th birthday considered your most important birthday, like the BEST birthday of any birthdays, I suppose the same as a 'Sweet sixteen'. So everyone's in my family of course like traditionally giving me a birthday present

So to cut the back story short, I live with my mum & dad, my middle sister move out, my oldest sister lives in a different city I asked my mother, father & middle sister for presents, they were okay with that because otherwise they wouldn't of known what to get me, then I asked my oldest sister what present I wanted

She replied to my message ""Hello \[My name\], I'm good thanks for asking."" what the fuck?

Let me tell you WHY that made me so angry, my sister is 15 years older, moved out the house when I was roughly 5 so I seen her next to never growing up so I was never used to being around her, but a simple message or a simple phone call that takes 2-5 minutes of your time would of at least been appreciated, as I got older still nothing, got older to the point I had a phone with no credit so I couldn't phone anyone myself mind maybe when I'm 11, got older to the point I had a facebook account with her on it, a simple message to say ""Hi"" doesn't take a long time, but quite recently (while I was/am 16-17) we've known for a year my father has been having a affair with my mother, you could argue it's okay, others have it worse, but my life is literally falling apart right in front of my fucking eyes & she hasn't once asked ME if I'm okay, she knows it's happening but she's not even been their for even my mother she doesn't SEE what the fucks going on in my house, it's a huge weight on any one of any ages shoulders, but don't you think as a older sister you would want to help your 17 year old sister CARRY THE WEIGHT, it's hard for me to even have a 18th birthday from the sheer stress since I found out (my parents still live together which makes it worse!). Everything is literally falling apart **AND** ***SHE*** **HAS THE AUDACITY TO BE PISSED AT ME BECAUSE I NEVER ASKED** ***HER*** **IF SHE WAS ALRIGHT**

I'm sorry if I'm the asshole but I'm pissed I replied to her message saying ""Sorry"" she ignored it, truthfully if she replied I would of started the argument on how she never asked if I'm alright neither, I also want to make it clear it's not about the presents if anyone said ""Sorry I can't"" I really would of been fine with it, I don't expect presents & I know very well that some people can't afford things sometimes, my mother understands my point but told me I should of asked how she was first saying we're both as bad as each other, but my boyfriend tells me I'm in the right 100% it's my 18th birthday I should be spoiled because I've never actually had a good birthday before"		1	0

One person picks the other person up from their house and we drive to our destination. One of my friends is 15 min away and we do this. We only have one friend we don't do this with and it's because she lives 30min away.

Except R. Also funnily enough, R happens to be the one closest to me. She lives 2 streets away from me, 1-2min away by car, and like 5-10min walking.

Whenever me and R are going and she's the one driving she asks me to meet her up at her house and from there we can go. I always complain about it and sometimes I get my way and sometimes she does.

For example today she's picking me up to go out to eat. She told me she's stopping at target first and that I should go to her house and wait for her on the porch (she wants ME to wait for HER, let's not waste a single minute of her precious time!). I told her there's no way in hell I'm waiting alone on a porch in a neighborhood where I don't know anyone. She said fine and that she'll tell me when to be there. (If I had listened to her btw, I would be sitting on her porch right now waiting for her and typing this out. She told me to go to her house 30MIN ago!)  I asked her why she can't just pick me up and she says 'it's an extra 2 minutes to ur house and 2 minutes back, it's a waste of time.' I asked her how she has time to go to target (we were supposed to be out already but she decided to go there first) but not pick me up and that what she's doing is stupid. She said it's not and to just meet her there. (Mind you, 4 extra min out of her day is too much but she had no problem making me wait 30+minutes on her porch)

I'm tempted to do this to her next time I'm picking her up so she knows how it feels but my house is more inside the suburbs and hers is outside, so her house on my way to anywhere I'm going and i don't really have a valid excuse for why I can't pick her up and it will just come off as pettyness.

"I (19F) do some A level tutoring on the side of university and I was due to meet a new student today so this would have been our first meeting. About 30 minutes before I was due to head out to the session (she was travelling about 15/20 minutes on a bus to meet me at a library) I got an immense headache with dizziness and nausea. I gave it 10 minutes to see if it passed but I was really in no state to leave my flat, let alone try and teach someone a concept so I cancelled.  The headache lasted almost 2 hours so I feel I made the right decision in doing this. 

I expressed my apologies very clearly when I cancelled as I knew the student would be on her way and I offered to give her the next session for free to make up for this, and to write and email her some notes in the mean time so she wasn’t completely empty-handed, and I felt awful for giving such short notice. 

I then got a text from the girl’s mum saying that they would no longer like to book any lessons with me due to my too short notice and they didn’t want an unreliable tutor. I did my best to explain the situation (came on very suddenly, isn’t a regular thing so it shouldn’t happen again etc) but in the end I respected her wishes and left it at that.

Sal and I belong to a group of close knit friends that have been together since elementary school. We are now in our mid 30’s.

Over the past year, Sal got engaged and recently married a woman named Tina. The wedding happened two months ago and no one in our social circle was aware of it. None of Sal’s friends were invited unless their spouse was friends with Tina. I was extremely hurt and upset about not being included. If it were a small occasion with family only, I would understand but all of Tina’s friends were invited and live-streaming and posting pictures of the wedding. 

I decided this was the last straw with Sal. There have been small things over the years that I have forgotten and forgiven such as him talking to an ex of mine while we were dating and asked her out after we broke up. Rumor from his brother is he pursuaded an employer to not hire me because I would have been Sal’s boss. We made amends on this stuff, it happened a decade ago and we see each other frequently when we hang out for card games, drinking at the bar, etc. 

Fast forward to a week ago, my spouse and I get a reference letter in the mail because Sal and Tina are going through the adoption process. Sal left me a voicemail about it but I haven’t talked to him over the phone or in person about it because he hasn’t returned my call. A mutual friend told me that we were asked to write the letter because of my career and my spouse’s prominence in the community with her career. 

I told my wife to throw the reference letter out. If Sal couldn’t be bothered to invite me to his wedding or at least call and explain why his friends weren’t invited, then I don’t even feel the need to let him know we aren’t filling out a reference letter. My spouse says I’m being an asshole because people should be able to invite who they want to their wedding.

c4xsbs	2019-06-24 23:08:06	turnerxyz	AITA for walking out of a restaurant without paying	"I went out with my family for a meal and my daughter got quite unwell near the end (nothing related to the meal) so my wife took her to to the car so that she could get some fresh air and hopefully feel a bit better.


I asked for the bill and waited at the table with my other daughter for it to come. No bill. 5mins later I ask another waitress. 5 mins later no bill.


Receive a text from my wife saying we need to go, what’s taking so long. I went to the bar and asked for the bill. The girl on the bar tried to print me a bill but the machine ran out of paper so she disappeared to go find some. I explain to another barman that I have no cash but am happy to pay on card without a receipt and he says it’s policy they have to give one. 5 mins pass and this 3rd person still hasn’t got back with my bill nor the paper.

I move to the exit and ask the person on concierge to find her, or a manager. They go off looking and return saying she’s ended her shift, but to ask the manager at the bar. This is another 5mins now so we’re around the 20min mark.


I find the manager working behind the bar who is talking to another member of staff, and he tells me to wait by the cash register near the exit and someone will see me shortly. I tell him no, they need to take my payment now or I have to leave, explaining about my poorly child and wife waiting. No problem Sir I’ll get someone right on it.


My wife is absolutely blowing up my phone now and I wait for another 2 mins then tell my daughter (aged 8) it’s time to go, I’ll pay them later. We leave and get in the car explaining to my wife what just happened: she tells me I’m TA for not paying and setting a bad example to my daughter, but I’m so mad now that I just want to get the kids to bed, and drive home.


I do intend on calling the restaurant tomorrow to pay, but as things stand am I TA?


Edit & update: 
just called the restaurant general manager and told them what happened, she was very worried that my daughter had eaten something and gotten ill from this. I assured them this was almost certainly not the case but they took the details of everything she ate and drank just in case. 

She then said that waiting that long was ridiculous and they wondered what had happened to that bill as nobody (!!!?!???????) could remember. That got me pretty mad but thankfully she felt the same haha. She said as way of an apology the meal was on them, no charge, and hoped it wouldn’t deter us from visiting again. She also said that not many people would have called back the next day and thanked me for being honest. I thanked her and closed the book on that.


With regards to my wife as someone mentioned below I am going to give her a pass for that. She had spent something like 25mins in the car with a kid throwing up out of the window in the rain, and I didn’t communicate properly so she didn’t know what was going on. I understand she snapped which upset me at the time, but on reflection it makes sense. I think she’ll apologise once she’s calmed down and I tell her what happened with the bill.


My daughter if fine yes, but she’s off sick today. Just a normal sickness and diarrhoea but I think.

c4xsbn	2019-06-24 23:08:06	Shortcutto_mushrooms	AITA for not buying our dog a shock collar like our neighbor wants	"So my fiancé and I just bought a house and adopted a dog together. It’s a row home, so we share one wall with a neighbor who we’ll call Frank. We’re pretty sure Frank is retired as he’s always home and he’s frequently sitting on his front porch smoking. Things started out friendly and we’d say hi as we came in and out while moving.

We got the dog the 2nd day we moved in and as we were walking him home we bumped into Frank and (perhaps somewhat too excitedly) told him we just adopted our dog. He seemed pretty unhappy about it and, seeing this, we told him to please let us know if the dog starts getting on his nerves and being loud.
Everything seemed okay for the first couple days, but the past week Frank has been telling us that our dog has been very loud and ‘barking and hollering all day’. I think he’s made a point to be sitting on his front porch when we’re coming home to tell us. He wasn’t very friendly about it to begin with and he’s getting a bit more hostile every time we see him.

At first we were really apologetic and told him we were working on it. We’ve made a point to train the dog he’s not allowed to bark and the dog has stopped for the most part at least while we’re home. Because my fiancé and I work 9-5s and we have to put the dog in the basement while we’re gone, we’ve started taking him for two walks a day, one before we go to work and one when we get home, and we leave him toys and things to occupy his time in order to try to keep the dog quiet.

After Franks first complaint we recorded our dog for a couple hours while we were gone to see how bad it is and didn’t actually see him barking. He definitely whines a bit and grumbles, so I’m not sure if that’s what frank is referring to. It’s not terribly loud. When we told frank we recorded him (Frank told us he had this problem with another neighbor and she recorded her dog and then bought it a shock collar) and didn’t see any barking, but we’ll continue to work with the dog to keep him quiet, frank just said ‘well did you record him today?’ And when we said ‘no’ he said ‘well you should have’. I know he fully expects us to buy our dog a shock collar but I really don’t like the idea of shocking our dog.

So my fiancé and I are wondering if it’s the other neighbors dogs whose house is also connected to franks. There are quite a few dogs in the neighborhood that we can hear barking at least when the windows are open.

We’re kind of upset with him ourselves for a number of reasons (he took a package off our porch without asking if we were comfortable with him doing that, told us to remove some bushes from our front lawn that he’s worried will attract birds, and his smoking smell carries up into our bedroom windows late at night). We’re kind of feeling like we live here too and we put up with issues from him as well. But at the same time we told him to tell us if he had any issues with the dog.

Are we the assholes for not just believing frank and getting a shock collar?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4xrdq	2019-06-24 23:06:22	mooseycap	WIBTA if I refused to take medicine that would make my mom more comfortable?	"I’m 17 and haven’t had any vaccinations since I was a baby, so I’m about to get my shots in a week. My mom isn’t necessarily anti-vaccine, she’s “vaccine cautious” as she calls it, mainly because she claims I had a serious allergic reaction to the vaccines as a baby and because she’s influenced by people around her who say vaccines are dangerous. I’ve finally convinced her to let me get my shots, but she’s scared to death I will have a reaction and she insists that I take her homeopathic medicine as a precaution. I’ve told her I won’t take the medicine because it doesn’t work and then we got into a serious argument about the effectiveness of homeopathy. She gets very defensive about the subject and will argue with me until I either give up or until she sends me to my room. One of the other reasons why I don’t want to take this medicine is because it will enable her to use it in the future, and she’ll use this moment as an argument in that “you didn’t get an allergic reaction which means they worked.” I honestly don’t care if she uses the medicine for herself, but recently our dog was limping pretty badly and she gave our dog homeopathic medicine instead of taking her to the vet. I feel that taking the medicine is justifying her use of it for things that require actual medical attention. 

On the other hand my dad said he knows it doesn’t work, but I should just take the medicine to make her happy and I would be a major asshole if I didn’t. I feel obligated to take the medicine because it will keep the peace.


Would I be the asshole if I didn’t take my mother’s homeopathic medicine to make her feel better about me getting my vaccines?

EDIT: I looked at the medicine she wants me to take, and it’s actually harmless. Now, I’m not an expert in homeopathy, but if it smells like sugar, if it tastes like sugar, and if it looks like sugar, it’s probably sugar. They’re sugar pills that have been diluted to the point that whatever nonsense was in the solution beforehand has no remaining traces. The bottle says 30x, and I looked it up, and  [“A 30x dilution means that the original substance has been diluted 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times.” ](https://www.homeowatch.org/basic/infinitesimals.html)

c4xqw0	2019-06-24 23:05:32		AITA for telling my roommate what I knew about his new GF?	"Not an altercation with him but after thinking about it for a while I thought I should consider it from his (other peoples) point of view or maybe see if I was wrong in telling him. 

So, my roommate got a new GF. We’re in MOS School. He’s in MAT(marines awaiting training) and I’m in MIT (marines in training) she (the GF) came here about 1 week ago. 

Today I was in class and a bunch of people started talking about how “(insert name) has kissed x amount of people since she came, she’s hoeing around” And in my mind I’m like “uhh.. my roommate just mentioned he started talking to someone..” so I let it go and when we come back from lunch they like “I saw (her name) kiss x” and I’m like “ok..” so we go to dinner chow and I saw a girl with the name “(same name) X” and I’m like “oh boy... “ because I saw my roommate near her. So I got back to the barracks and I’m like “what’s her name?” And he’s like “X” and I’m like “Ohhhh no.......” and he’s like “what?” And I’m like “dude apparently she just kissed some dude during lunch chow and she’s been hoeing around since she came here “ (I had know he had been talking to a girl so they were already talking) 

And he’s like “I know for a fact those are just lies” I’m like “alright, hope they are.” He’s like “imma ask her” in my head I’m like “b if she is do you think she’d tell you? She ain’t dumb” but I just said “alright” 

Reasons I should have told him: 
- ever since I met the guy he’s been looking out for me so thought I should return the favor

- it’s happened to me so I know how it feels. 

Reasons I should not have told him: 
- he does this shit where he “falls in love” with a new girl every 2 weeks. If I would’ve let it be it would’ve prob be done with anyway and maybe he wouldn’t have found you or, would’ve found out, got hurt and same ending.

"Granted we live in different countries at the moment but with the power of social media she absolutely should have checked in on me, right? She messages every now and then saying “I’m in town, let’s catch up!” or “will you be in my hometown in June??” or “you’re so bad at responding to messages!”. I’ve replied a couple of times with things like “I’m going through things right now so not sure where I’ll be in June...”  but she’s never once gotten the hint that maybe she should say some kind words to me. 

I feel terrible if I don’t invite her to the wedding because we used to be really close friends, growing apart only because of distance (and because she’s a bit flaky at times).

c4xnw2	2019-06-24 23:00:26		AITA for telling my sister that my BF and I deserve the bedroom in our beach house rental with the bigger bed because she had the room last year?	"Alright, so my sister and I recently had a disagreement about our summer plans. Every summer, my family stays in a beach house in San Diego. It’s usually my parents and little sister in one room, my sister and her boyfriend in another, and finally my boyfriend and I in the last room. Last year, my sister and her boyfriend claimed the second master - including a queen bed, a kitchenette, and a tv. My boyfriend and I got the other room - essentially just a small room with bunk beds. But fair is fair and they called it first, so we were cool with it. We had a great time and the bunk beds were comfortable and we were literally only in the room when we were asleep. 

This past week, we all started talking about how excited we were about our upcoming trip. We were talking about what we’re planning on doing and eating. I mention in passing something along the lines of my boyfriend and I getting the nice room this time. My sister’s demeanor immediately changed and she demanded to know why. I told her that it was only fair since her and her boyfriend got it last time, it should be ours this time. She got very pissy and argued that we shouldn’t get the room because 1) I “wouldn’t even be there the whole time” - they leave the beach house Sunday morning and since I live further away, I fly out Saturday afternoon; and 2) her and her boyfriend meal prep and need somewhere to put their meals. 

I reminded her that I would be leaving one night before, so she could totally have the room Saturday night if she wanted to and that her and her boyfriend could still store the food there (the room is literally next door). She rolled her eyes and said that if I didn’t care last time about where we slept, I shouldn’t care this time, and that I’m being dramatic about wanting the room “so badly” in her opinion. 

Am I the asshole for thinking that I automatically get the room this time?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c4xnpi	2019-06-24 23:00:09	rickred09	AITA for sleeping with the girl I knew my best friend/roommate liked?	"Bit of backstory here, sorry for the length.

My friend, we’ll call him A, had feelings for this girl we both mutually knew through another friend. This girl, B, and him were together for a brief while before she ended things for reasons that were neither disclosed then or now. She told us it was because of her feelings for her ex boyfriend; although we suspect otherwise, but it’s not important.

Over the next few months, B acts increasingly more mean to A, for reasons we still aren’t aware of. Her behavior came to a climax when she told him to never speak to her again (after a ridiculous argument started by her) and basically accused him of stalking her (he, by all accounts, was not) A was extremely hurt by this, as he had been and still was going through a fairly hurtful bout of depression. I did not sever ties with B, mainly because I enjoyed her company, and continued to talk and hang out with her behind A’s back. He found out some time later that we still talked, and was very understanding of the situation, saying I was free to be friends with her if I wished.

A and B made up after he came back to our apartment early one day, and found that we were hanging out together without his knowledge. I had attempted to keep our hang out between us, and hadn’t intended in coming back so early.  He made up with her because he wanted us to be friends all again, and missed the times we all were chill with each other. 

A kept his crush on B, mainly because he’d never had a steady, healthy relationship and had felt that B was the closest he could get to one. I noticed after hanging out with B one day that I had feelings for her, and made these feelings clear to A. A told me that he had them as well, and we opted to tell B, and allow her to make the choice. B chose me, and we started dating, even making him leave the apartment sometimes so she and I could have sex.

About two weeks after me and B started dating, I realized that I had feelings for my ex girlfriend, C, and promptly dumped B. A felt hurt that I’d cared so little for the girl he’d liked while knowing it would hurt him, used her as a rebound, and dumped her for my ex. I’m kind of conflicted here, AITA?

Afterwards I see she has put some pretty offensive stuff on her social media. Talking about my mild acne and braces and clothes, calling me a disgrace etc. I messaged her to apologise because I didn't mean for it to have such an effect because she was obviously taking it extremely personally. She still continues to keep spouting on social media to people including my friends about how much of a dick I am, over a comment I made whilst drunk at a party, despite my best apologies after.

c4xl40	2019-06-24 22:55:37	lavendertown814	AITA for exposing my best friend’s cheating to her s/o?	"For confidentiality, I’ll be referring to my best friend as Girl, and her (now ex) boyfriend as Boy.
For some background, Girl and I have been friends for the last six years, and we have done our fair share of dumb things together. We’ve hidden each other’s secrets, picked each other up from bad situations, stayed up all night talking through anything and everything; we were each other’s protectors.
Over the last two years, Girl was dating this guy, Boy, on the east coast (we live on the west coast), and for the last few months, she’s been cheating on him. Not with just one person, but with many people from (insert popular dating app) or people she knew in the past. This wasn’t new to me, and I’d be dumb to say I hadn’t done similar things in the past. 
Since Girl and I did everything together, naturally Boy and I also became really good friends. I became a neutral party to them when they needed advice; I was like Switzerland. Boy had suspicions that Girl wasn’t being faithful, and he made me promise to tell him if that was ever the case. This put me in a tough spot: Do I stay loyal to my best friend and hide her cheating? Or do I keep a promise to my other best friend and risk everything?
Over those months I never said a word to Boy, knowing that I was breaking a promise by hiding her infidelity. 
One night, I was freaking out over this. The guilt of keeping a secret so long from Boy was painful to me, but the thought of betraying Girl also hurt, bad. Well, boy happened to ask what was wrong (we talk regularly on a certain social media app with a ghost logo, you know the one), and I told him that I couldn’t tell him. I refused. He said that no matter how bad it is that he’d be there for me, and I told him he was going to regret being nice to me. After twenty minutes of me avoiding his questions and him persisting, he asked if it had anything to do with Girl. I said yes. He put the pieces together himself, and he went off on her. Girl texts me asking what the hell is wrong with me, how could I do this to her, etc. and I honestly don’t know. I still don’t know. 
Now, I thought we had made up recently, but today I discovered she’s been talking behind my back, saying I ruined her life and that I’m a horrible friend, when all I’ve done is try my hardest to fix what I did. Now our mutual friends also hate me.

Tl;dr: I exposed my best friend’s cheating to her boyfriend, and now she and our mutual friends hate me.

I decided that I had to move on, but she started telling me that if I didn’t re-date her she was going to sui****, but she just developed a cut**** habit.

I then met my current girlfriend (F 20) and she was coincidentally one of my ex’s “bullies” I couldn’t do anything to help my ex because I didn’t know anything since she didn’t told me, but later on one of her friends told me that. 

I asked my girlfriend about it and she told me she didn’t ever do anything to her, that she knew she hated her and it was probably just that. 

Last Wednesday I somehow ended up talking to her on a coffee shop, after a good 10 minutes she asked me about my girlfriend and I didn’t say anything since I was in shock that she knew since I had cut any communication with her, and then she started complaining about me dating her “bully” and I got so mad because she was complaining about something that wasn’t her business, and I told her that sincerely I was happier with my current girlfriend than I was with her.

She then started screaming that I was an absolute asshole, but I just walked away. I told my girlfriend about this and she told me that I had to apologise because I was too harsh.

My older brother (J) and I have a cat. I love her, she’s my baby, and we buy the food for her. Usually, my brother pays but we got into an argument on our way to pick it up this time. 

Here’s some background info before we start: He claims we initially agreed to go 50/50 on the food, though I don’t remember this. I do have terrible memory though I’m pretty certain about this. 

He has a job, he goes to every day for two weeks and is going to make about 400 for it overall. I am a babysitter, who makes 11 an hour and haven’t been asked to do so at all so far this summer, and don’t know the next time I’ll be able to. 

I have 80 dollars right now and he has 110. 


Also my mom usually reimburses my brother on my behalf because of all this. In return, I rarely ask for money from my mom, I use my own money. 

I have not been able to get a summer job due to personal reason. 

The argument was about how I should pay this time. 

After back and forth, I told my brother I’d pay this time, but that he should the majority of the time because he has a summer job for two weeks and usually works in the cafeteria at our school during the school year, and it pays decently. He says this isn’t fair and I should just always pay my half.

AITA for not wanting to? 

This post was read and approved by J himself.

edit: removed a fragment sentence.

edit 2: Supply runs can be anywhere from 8 bucks to above 30.

edit 3: I was not expecting to have to pay for the cat when I asked for it when I was under the age of 10. Then all of a sudden my parents shifted the pay onto me and my brother, knowing fully that I can’t get a job or anymore babysitting gigs. The first time I babysat, I was two years younger than when my brother got his first job. I’ve been trying to make money, but I simply can’t. Also when he was my age and unemployed he never had to pitch in any pay for the animal."	Asshole	0	0

"Me and my boyfriend are going on a trip soon for the summer and he can’t afford a hotel so he’s making me stay at his sisters studio apartment on an air mattress.

c4xew4	2019-06-24 22:45:09	twosecondsfromfucked	AITA For wanting to tell my mom to not lean on me so much?	"Background before getting into what I am dealing with today:

My mom (F41) has been divorced twice, and 3 years ago she began dating a new guy let's call him Alex. Alex has a really good job and his own house, my mom has a good job and a nice home as well except we rented. After about 4-5months of dating my mom moved in with him and dragged my two younger brothers as well (8 and 13). She tried to make me move in as well but I didn't feel comfortable so I stayed at my grandmother's. Finally, after a year of knowing him, I moved in as well. Then after about 3 years, it didn't work out so we all had to move to my grandmothers which was a bit cramped since it was a family of four moving into two small bedrooms. But we were happy because Alex never really liked my brothers and I, never lifted a finger and had my mom do all the cleaning and housework, and he could be a bit bipolar at times.

Then about 6 months later I was already away from home at college for my last year when I found out from my grandmother that my mom is back with Alex and pregnant with his child. I was soooooo pissed and didn't talk to my mom for a while. Not only because this baby was planned (she stopped her birth control to conceive) but because Alex was rude, mean, and so entitled and she even declared all those things about him when we moved out the first time. I couldn't believe how weak my mom was for again repeating her past mistakes but to an even larger scale because now a child was involved.

But once Christmas came around I couldn't shut my mom out and I decided to be apart of the family again and everything was okay for the next year and 1/2. But now again their relationship isn't working out (shocker) and we have to move out of his house again. I just moved home from college in hopes of saving money, getting a part-time job, and saving for graduate school. But now I have to watch my new little brother 8am-4pm Mon-Friday because he (Alex) is staying at his mom's and they both refuse to come and help my mom with the baby. I just feel like none of this is my fault and I am not entitled to watch my brother for what feels like a full-time job with no pay.

I feel like an asshole for feeling this way because I love my little brother but I told her not to get back with him because he wouldn't change but she swore that everything was going to be okay this time around. But clearly, it is not smooth sailing at the moment. I feel like just moving out and living with my grandparents so I can work and save for graduate school. I don't want to help my mom clean up her mess again for the 4th time (my father, my second stepfather, Alex, and Alex Chapter 2 now).

What do I do? Should I stay and help? Am I overreacting and being inconsiderate?

c4xeqn	2019-06-24 22:44:53		WIBTA for quitting my job during the busiest part of the season?	"I work at a pool store for 40-45 hrs a week. As I'm sure many of you can guess, spring and summer are our busiest months out of the year. My store in particular is one of a very few for a few hundred miles, so that's fun. I'm also a student, one that had to drop two summer classes due to the overloaded work schedule I was put on.

I was planning on leaving the company, but two (of the 4) employees quit without notice. We've got more now, but they're at most 3 months trained (I've been with the company for 5 years). This ties into the other reason I stayed; my manager and I are friends, his father has cancer and hes been trying to leave the store for a while now. He was planning on leaving much earlier, but wasnt able to when we were so understaffed.

I hate this job. People who own pools are angry, short tempered, demanding, vindictive assholes. I have saved up enough so that I can choose to not work and just focus on school for ~ 1 year (my senior year, I've never had the chance to not work and go to school). On top of all of that I've had to drop both the summer classes I was taking because the workload was just too much.

However, besides me there isnt anyone my manager can really expect to have everything down pat. I'm apprehensive of leaving because I don't want my manager to get stuck in the same situation as before.

"As the title states, I have a family vacation leaving Thursday morning and coming back Monday night, to New Orleans with 12 of my family members. I live in Maryland and 4 of my family members live in California and I have not seen them in a couple years. The trip has been planned for a couple months now.  Flight, hotel etc is booked and it would cost $1,000+ to change. 

My fiance's uncle, who she is fairly close too, unexpectedly passed away this past weekend and the funeral is this Saturday. My fiance planned on going to New Orleans but now is not so she can attend the funeral. 

I have made the decision that I will still go on the vacation without her because I don't see all these family members that often.

c4xano	2019-06-24 22:38:04	sadly_a_mess_em1	AITA bringing up the past	"This one is a bit of a doozy. 
So when I was in middle school I had finally had enough of my dad. My parents are divorced and my dad got divorced twice, the second marriage being much shorter, way more messy, and being the creation of two boys. My dad was completely wrecked. Mind you I was 8 when this happened, my youngest brother had just been born the year before. My former stepmother ,we'll call her Jen, took EVERYTHING. The house included which was not in her name. It took 3 months for the system to help my dad out. Jen took the table, the TV, MY bed, and all the boys belongings and moved in with the other man she had. The next 3 years of my life was a disaster. My dad took his anger out on us a lot, mostly me though. During our visits he made me the motherly figure of the house and yelled at me a lot. He blamed me for everything. Forgetting things, losing things, getting lost, not having meals ready on time, ect. He would throw things and scream out of know where. After calls with his lawyer he would basically shut down and forget about us three. Evtnually I devolped horrible anxiety and would shut down when I had to visit him. I would cry until I couldn't breathe, I have asthma, and I would start to violently shake cause I could get oxygen. And that's just the violentish stuff.
Before Jen, my dad would constantly tell me I had to live with him and that he needed me. After Jen, it only got worse. Eventually when I was 9 I finally said okay...worse mistake ever. He told my mom I said okay to it and that he was taking me. My mom and step dad freaked out on me. The blew up on me, which is its own horrible story. I told my dad that I changed my mind. 
Side note, every Wednesday my dad picked me up to have dinner with me. It was our thing. Now back to the story, after that whole living situation ordeal my dad picked me up for our dinner. Instead he took me to a near by park to yell at me  for an hour calling me a coward and saying ""I should just leave to Arizona, I'll make more money there. That's what you're making me do, I'll miss out on the boys because of you."" The park was so close to my house I remember just wishing I had the guts to get out and walk home. I remember the fear I had when he forced a hug on me. Soon after that I stopped coming around until my 9th grade year in highschool.

Now, years later, I live with him. Due to even worse circumstances at my mother's home I had to live with him. And he sometimes takes the time  to remind me how much I hurt him by not coming around. I really started to realize now, as a young adult, my mom and I were unfair. He was broken and he was dirt poor due to the divorces. Maybe I should have come around anyways? I missed so much time with my brothers and the older one is so big now. I feel guilty but I know I have PTSD from my dad and major anxiety issues. I just need help y'all, I feel so conflicted.

My friend is trying to cut down weight, and I figured to motivate him and to help him out I would do whatever he does to like support him. He decided he would do intermittent fasting, and I went a long with it. We go to the same school, and we only drank water all day. I wasn’t really that hungry for that while but tbh when I got home my mom brought a sub and I got so fucking hungry in that moment I decided to just eat it. It was my fault, I should’ve fought off the craving. But now I’m wondering should I tell him? If I told him he would be very demotivated and I want to help him out.

c4x980	2019-06-24 22:35:46	throwawayspay	AITA for not donating to my friend’s GoFundMe for her dead mentally handicapped brother?	Throwaway because i have friends on my personal reddit. Okay, before everyone jumps on me hear me out. Said friend’s 22 y/o mentally handicapped brother recently passed away kinda suddenly. Not like it’s been downhill for years, but more the last few weeks he’s been sick, was then diagnosed with pneumonia which turned into sepsis. Anyways, said friend is very well known in our small town, as her parents were very involved in our community, she’s very nice in the public eye, but behind closed doors she’s very.. entitled. Acts like she’s above everyone and everything is everyone else’s fault SAHM who’s kid can do no wrong can I speak to the manager type. Anyways, everything she does goes on FB. Dinner? FB. Flat tire? FB. Husband mowing the lawn? FB. Everything of her “lavish” lifestyle is posted so she can get comments about how lucky she is. I mean literally everything she does gets uploaded. But like I said she’s and alright person and as long as I’m not alone with her I don’t usually mind her. Throughout the last few weeks of her brother being sick, everything went on FB. Pictures of him barely holding on in the hospital were posted everyday. Now that he’s passed, she’s made a GoFundMe. But, when I went on, it’s for an outrageous amount 25k which I find ridiculous. Every single day it is posted with a long sob story with how close her and her brother were and how he deserves nothing but the absolute best. Apparently said friend is now complaining about how i’m not a true friend as I haven’t donated anything as I have the means. Now, she’s not wrong. I absolutely do have the means and normally would but I think it’s ridiculous how much she’s asking for and how much she’s using her brothers death as a ploy for attention on FB. A funeral doesn’t cost that much and I really don’t think his medical bills piled up to that much as he went into the hospital per her posts 5 days before he passed. I don’t like to think she’d pocket what was left after the funeral but I wouldn’t put it past her. Some of our mutual friends are calling me an asshole saying if I was a decent person and friend i’d contribute what I could regardless of the goal and that she probably won’t even get that much, I on the other hand don’t want to contribute to her next lavish purchase that could be funded in the name of her brothers death.

c4x7er	2019-06-24 22:32:39	angel-a-marie	AITA got telling my daughter I don’t want to talk about her father anymore?	"Not quite three years ago, my husband left me. At the time our oldest daughter was going into her senior year of high school. She was devastated. The girl (she is practically 20 yrs younger than him) he was dating was/is a real wedge between him and our daughter. He has virtually no contact with either of our daughters.    I have begged and pleaded with him to repair his relationships with our children- he just doesn’t seem to care. Anyway, a thing my daughter does is constantly ask me what I think her dad would think of something. It’s usually everyday things like what he would think of a restaurant or a song or stuff like that. I hate these conversations because I think they are unhealthy for her and because I am trying to move on. Recently I told her I don’t want to talk about her dad anymore. She said she understood. She hasn’t brought him up since. The thing is, she was visibly upset when I told her and I’m wondering if I am being TA.

Edit: Thank you all for the insights and the suggestions. I have on several occasions talked to her about if she wanted to go to therapy. She has always declined, but I’ve never approached it as her and I both going to therapy- so possibly I can try that. 

Someone asked about my younger daughter. She is severely autistic and attends a residential school. I see her regularly, her father has seen her twice since he and I split. It’s hard to tell what her understanding of this situation is. I can say- she never indicates she wants to see him (she’s non verbal, but very good at letting us know her wants/needs)."

c4x7eb	2019-06-24 22:32:37		AITA for breaking a door and leaving it	"Okay—so the title makes me seem like an asshole. But let me tell the story. I rented a small apartment from this woman that knows my family. She’s 95, Russian and kind of crazy. When I first met her, she complained to me about another renter she had who had her nipples pierced and said to my boyfriend “Don’t put diamonds on her titties, put them on her finger”. Even though we knew she was kind of out there, we really needed this apartment because we were, at that time, living in a studio apartment with two of our friends. Essentially it was four grown adults living in an apartment that at max could hold 2 people and it was only a temporary place to live. 

We moved into the new apartment in November. The heat didn’t work and when we asked the landlord to fix the furnace, she sent over another one of her tenants who said it was broken and then gave us a small space heater to heat up the entire apartment. This led us to only being able to live in our actual bedroom at all times so we didn’t freeze. The sink didn’t work in the kitchen so we couldn’t do the dishes because it came out in a trickle. The refrigerator had a large chunk of ice growing. There was mold. 

We had neighbors who told lies to the landlord (that we had parties all the time, had another couple living there, that we dug up flowers they had planted, that we were going there after we moved out). The landlord took these for face value and started to believe we really did these things and would question us via my grandmother whenever something happened. She also believes my little brother is a woman beater and fired him for doing jobs for her even though she had no proof to go off of. Basically, although we had a place to live it was the worst possible place for us to live. 

My parents in April asked us to watch their animals while they were gone at a job in a different state and we would be able to live in their home for free while they were gone. Of course we agreed and we left the apartment. During this time, however, the back door broke. It was actually broken to begin with—it would randomly open in the middle of the winter letting freezing air in, but my boyfriend accidentally broke a part of it off one time as he was locked out. When he did it, I was pissed but once I thought about it I didn’t really care because the apartment had been trashed to begin with. Well recently, my family went it to change the locks on the apartment because the neighbor was convinced we were still there (we weren’t). They found the door (which to be honest I had forgotten about) and now they think I’m an asshole for leaving it. 

However, I don’t think I am because the door was BROKEN to begin with. Given how badly the apartment is to begin with, I’m considering making a formal complaint about the place as I don’t see it as safe to live in and I believe there are certain standards that need to be held when renting any place to live. But AITA for leaving the door broken instead of replacing it?"		1	0

I've been majorly depressed and such the past few years due to school and the pressures to graduate (first in my immediate family to do so) and it was a lot riding on my back. I didnt work my senior year, but I did all Junior year. The reason is because there was a full on 2 hour dofference in school schedules (I had to wake at 5). I just needed to get used to the new school, schedule, and just try and bump up my GPA as much as possible.


 I just need some time to relax and just enjoy some freedom for once. I've applied to some places to work and I'm trying to find a place suitable for my strengths and weaknesses because I dont wanna be fired for stupid shit. My step dad has recently gotten really really pissed at me for apparently ""taking too much time"" and ""just not giving a fuck"". We recently had an argument and I told him that I thought he'd at least be happy with me making the effort to find a place to work, and he said ""well you should just be happy we didnt make you work senior year, we should've."" I'm just kinda pissed he's not really giving me any chance at the moment when I have been looking, I've called to a few places, and have been told to wait a few days because of the managers availability. 



I just wanna know if I'm being selfish or wrong in any way. I'm not sure if I am and I just don't want things to escalate. I wanna work at a place I'm comfortable at but it seems like he just wants me to work literally anywhere, as long as I'm making money. I just don't wanna work at a place where I know for a fact I'm either gonna bomb or just not work to the best of my abilities.

Her best friend knew that I had a bad time and about my feelings for her. He and I know eachother almost as long as they do but we were never really close, we hung out in a group but not much more. 

Fast forward a year. 

Me and him are hitting it of. Not very close but I would consider him as a friend. We do stuff together although he is still the best friend of my ex. So for the last 5 months we do something at least once or twice a week but he was never the guy who initiated things or asked about my day. 
One day me and her have a talk about our relationship and I casually ask about them. If there was anything going on. She says yes. They slept together. 5 or 6 times. Just a few days after we broke up. 
A follow up question reveals that he tried it before. Just a few days before we broke up. 
He says he is sorry. So basically he was playing along for 5 months. 

I am super pissed and disappointed. I want to cut him out of my life but a lot of friends tell me that I should forgive him. 

Just to clarify: I am pissed they slept together. I could overlook that, maybe. But what really makes my blood boil is the fach that he made a move although we were still a couple.

c4x0ze	2019-06-24 22:21:54	molliethemonkey	AITA for leaving my friend at a party?	"My friend is currently refusing to talk to me over something that happened on Saturday.

A mutual friend of ours had a fairly large barbecue at her house on Saturday from 5:00 to 8:00 pm, open-house style. I feel like it's important to mention that there was no drinking whatsoever except for some of the adults that came (my friends and I are college students; the bbq was hosted by her parents, some of the parents had beers but didn't allow any of us to drink as we're not all over 21).

Just over a week before the party, I got viral meningitis, so I had no idea if I would feel well enough to attend until the actual day of. I told the host I'd try to stop by if I felt better but to not expect me to be there. I never once talked to my friend about whether or not she would be going. I had assumed she'd be at the party but I didn't know for sure and she had no idea if I'd be there or not; she knew I was sick during the week and we hadn't discussed the bbq at all.

I felt pretty shitty the day of the party, but it had been a solid 9 days since I first got sick so I decided I'd make an appearance for half an hour, see my friends who I hadn't seen in over a week, maybe have some food, and then leave. I showed up around 6, so the party had already been happening for about an hour. When I got there and saw my friends, I told them I still felt sick so I wouldn't stay for long, and everything was good. After 20 minutes or so, I started feeling drained and asked my friend's parents, the hosts, for advil. They gave me one, it didn't help after another 20 minutes I decided to call it a day and head home. 

One of my friends saw me leaving and asked me for a ride home. She told me that her car was broken so her sister drove her to the party, but that her sister had plans that night so she couldn't pick her up. This friend lives 30 minutes away from me and the party was almost exactly halfway between our houses, so I drove 15 minutes to get to the party. I *really* didn't want to drive 15 minutes in the opposite direction and then 30 minutes back when I was sick, so I asked my friend if there was anyone else who could drive her home, and I said that way she also wouldn't have to leave early.

She got really upset and started saying stuff like ""so you're just going to leave me here with no way of getting home?"" and ""friends are supposed to stick together."" She knew I was sick and that I wanted to get home to sleep (I told my friends this as I was leaving, everyone besides this girl told me to feel better), so I reminded her that I really didn't feel well and she kept pushing. I finally caved and told her to go ask some other people if they could drive her later, and if no one else could do it, then I would. This made her really angry, and she said nevermind and stormed off. I went home, had a cup of tea, went to bed at like 9pm, and woke up to an angry text message from her accusing me of abandoning her.

c4wyyv	2019-06-24 22:18:38		AITA for not liking a childhood trend?	"So on Facebook, a friend (now unfriended) made a nostalgia post about 90s things like pogs and I commenting saying I thought pogs were dumb when I was a kid and didn't get into that trend and listed things I was into like video games and sailor moon.

Anyway I didn't mean to offend her but she went off on me saying I'm calling her favourite childhood thing dumb and that I'm always too negative and always talking about myself in her posts. I was upset so I unfriended her, I don't need this kind of stress and it happens often with her. I did say I was sorry anyway. I guess I should have said I wasn't into them, instead of saying I thought they were dumb. But did it warrant such a reaction? I feel bad, maybe I am too negative. Of course I don't think people who liked pogs were dumb, I just didn't like them at the time. 

Other times have been after jokes I made where she got offended, or she sees a public comment I made that's not even directed at her. To be honest I hate how Facebook shows friends where I've commented in public. I'm full of anxiety enough with what to say in person, I hate having to walk on eggshells on the internet too."

"So I ordered a lipstick for my sister as a birthday present, to me it was expensive and I spent over a quarter of my first paycheck on it (20€). I don't have a PayPal account so I gave my mom the money so she could order it. That was 13 days ago and the lipstick hasn't arrived yet (the site said 10 days). I checked if the site and lipstick was legit before deciding on ordering from there and it seemed all good to me. Today I asked my mom if she could give me the order number so I could track it and she told me that the site didn't ask for that information, meaning an email address I guess, and I told her that it did in fact. Then she said that she had deleted it and I requested that she would contact help and ask for the number which apparently didn't fly with her. She the asked why I wanted to know all of a sudden and started to yell at me. She said she would give me back the money and then burn the lipstick when it arrives. She says things like that alot. My stepdad then told me to fuck off and I did. This isn't the first time I my mom has ordered things for me that never arrive and also my mom lies constantly but right now I'm not sure if I'm in the right or not.

c4ws61	2019-06-24 22:07:19	callmebyhername82	WIBTA if I took my neighbor's cat to a shelter?	"My neighbor has a small scrawny cat that they got in the winter, it wasn't adopted from a shelter. She isn't spayed, doesn't have shots, and they don't let her inside. They kept her outside even as a kitten in the winter. I'll feed her when she looks like she hasn't eaten in a while.

She hangs in my yard all day and doesn't look great. She's thin, has fleas, and has scabs all over her and around her eyes. She goes to the bathroom in my yard and it doesn't look like normal cat poop. She definitely isn't healthy. 

I have a cat of my own who goes outside when I'm outside and is inside the rest of the time. When my cat is out, my neighbor's cat follows him around and they play. The issue is that I don't want my cat getting sick or getting fleas from her. I even put a flea collar on her, but that only lasted a couple of days before it was gone. 

I feel bad for her but I honestly don't want another cat (my neighbors wouldn't care if I took her in, I wouldn't be surprise if they want me to take her off their hands). I adopted my cat from a shelter, he's fixed, up to date on shots, & eats real good (read: spoiled). I don't want the responsibility of a second cat, let alone a sick one. I want to take her to a shelter so at least she'll be fed & indoors. WIBTA if I did this? My neighbors don't treat her as their own and they wouldn't miss her.

Edit: I've told them where to get her spayed and shots for free but they're not interested. They have a small dog they take care of though."	Not the A-hole	0	0

A friend asks me to order something online which costs 40€.

I saw this as an opportunity to order something for myself and save some money.

So i buy something for 20€. Now i pay 60€ (40€+20€) . My friend still gives me the 45€ because he thinks he has to pay the 5€ shipping.

c4wn42	2019-06-24 21:59:31	YikesYikesAndYikes	AITA If I kept my pet bird?	"So, about March I got a pet bird, I struggle to take care of him, but would be embarrassed to give him up.

A lot has changed since March, I got in a fight with my mom and moved out to my dads in the next town over, a big change.

But my mental health is still absolutely fucked, I thought that if I left my bad household I would get better- but now I’m vulnerable to weird “episodes”

I’m not going to explain what one is, but to cut to some relevant points- I end up delusional and thinking that my beloved pet bird has cameras in his eyes to spy on me. This makes me aggressive towards him and hate him for the next few days until the episode ends.

Not only that, I sometimes legitimately cannot force myself to change his food and water, I have no idea what’s wrong with that, I’m not lazy, but it’s like there is something in my brain preventing me from doing basic tasks.

I cannot look after him in this mental state, but I’m too selfish to get him to a better home, and my family refuses to help take care of him... Am I being a dick by putting me being embarrassed to get rid of him or getting help over his care?

Edit: I completely understand.
I think I missed out some context, I absolutely adore this bird- March was really terrible for me, I tried to overdose and was in a horrible place, this bird is the only reason I’m continuing to go on, hence why I’m so hesitant to rehome him.
I think I’ll talk to my dad about this issue to see if he can check on him, I will not let this bird suffer.

Edit: this was worded poorly tbh, I can’t take care of the bird only during an episode. Other than that he is treated well."	Asshole	0	0

c4wm0y	2019-06-24 21:57:43	purplefennec	AITA for getting annoyed at my depressed friend impacting my life?	"This is someone who I have been friends with for years. We've had some great times together and bonded over how we're both a little messed up and weird. Thing is, I've now got a good job and earn decent money, whereas she went back to study another degree and then dropped out. She's also 3 years older than me. She's on and off with this shitty boyfriend and recently she's been saying she's depressed. 

We live together, and about a month ago, she messages the group saying 'can I sublet the room because I can't afford my rent' (which is against our tenancy agreement and she knows how stressful it was when we were subletting before and that I was against ever doing it again). I ask, why? Because she's depressed and can't work for the next few weeks, and is going to go back to her family home to save money.

What annoyed me was there was no ""I'm really sorry"" just an expectation that I would roll over and agree to something that could potentially get us in trouble. I tell her I'm not comfortable with it, and she says that it's the only option otherwise the rent won't be paid. I feel trapped and agree to it. She then says she has found someone to take over the room and she needs me to meet them the next day at 9am on a Saturday, I say I can't do this time, can she do later in the day? No. ""It has to be 9am because I need to start moving my stuff out ASAP"". Again, no awareness that this is her problem and she should be accommodating to me. No politeness.

I finally just agree to it without meeting the girl. She moves out and I distance myself. Then, about 2 weeks later, we (including the new girl who is subletting her room) get a message from her saying ""It's not working out for me up here, is it fine for me to crash on the sofa for a few nights whilst I work in \[city name\] for a bit?"" .....I mean, I think this is such an inappropriate thing to ask considering she's charging someone to stay in her flat. And just generally, again, NO ""I'm so sorry to ask this"", just an expectation. I agree to two nights, saying anymore would be difficult as we need our lounge and it's a small flat. She then messages me separately saying 'I'm annoyed that you won't let me stay longer btw'. Just so blunt as if it's her right. She said she feels like it's her home - I say well it's not, you're not paying for it. Sorry. And then she says ""but I'm your friend. everyone else has offered me somewhere to stay"". I'm just sick of her entitled attitude. There's been other instances as well where she's acted out and said it's because she was ""messed up"" etc. For example, sleeping with my ex boyfriend (who I was kind of over, but still) on two separate occasions, without telling me until several months later. Another time, she couldn't pay her rent and asked if it was ok to prostitute from our flat...

I'm tired of not being able to be annoyed at her because she's ""depressed"". I'd never usually trivialise someone's mental health problems but she is making it very difficult not to."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4wkv7	2019-06-24 21:55:49	Metro000	AITA for demanding the deal I was originally offered?	"I recently had a get-to-gether with some friends after a long day of work, and while I was at work was mulling over pizza places in my head to get and bring to our get-to-gether. I decided on a build-your-own pizza place in my neighborhood I’d never been to before, and during my break placed my order online.

They told me my order would be ready around 6:45, just 15 minutes after my shift ended. At 6:35, just after I’d started towards my car, I received a text from the pizza place. The message said that they have an extremely high volume of orders tonight, and that they had to cancel my order. They told me my \~ $40 order was refunded, apologized, and in return offered me a deal for a free $10 build-your-own pizza.

Needless to say, I was pretty pissed. Since when is it okay to just “bump” orders? Why should those ordering online be treated second-fiddle to those dining in? And now, I’d have to go to the trouble of finding another pizza place, and dinner was going to be very late. In the heat of the moment, I typed an angry message back. “Oh joy! I’m already starving to death, waited all this damn time, and you have the nerve to cancel my order. What a load of fucking bullshit!”

I never received a response. A week later for lunch, I went to the pizza place, specified the toppings for my pizza, and went to the checkout as it was being prepared. I told the person at the checkout I have a deal for a free pizza, and he asked my name and plugged it into the system. He said nothing was coming up and went to ask his supervisor. 

The supervisor, a woman in her 30’s, came out and told me that I’m not getting the deal. I asked why, and she told me that it’s because I was “extremely rude” to their employees via text message when I was told about my order being cancelled. She made clear that “disrespect and foul language towards our employees is not tolerated”, and that they didn’t have to offer me a deal in the first place; if I’m not going to behave gratefully for their deal offer, I’m not entitled to it.

I was greatly angered by this. I questioned the lady why they’re telling me this just now when I’m checking out, instead of when I first sent the message. Seems very shady to me. I argued for a while until I gave up (so other people in line weren’t held up) and paid. 

But after leaving, I called the company’s corporate office (they’re a chain) and complained about how I wasn’t given the deal I was offered, after they cancelled my order. I stressed how this place has a bad habit of making promises and not keeping them; they promise dinner at 6:45 and cancel 10 minutes before; they promise a deal for a free pizza and yank it away right as you’re checking out. This a is a very bad business model and trait in general.

The corporate office apologized profusely, refunded my money, and gave me a deal for **another** free pizza! I’m feeling a lot better about the whole thing and am glad I stuck up for myself. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
c4wjvv	2019-06-24 21:54:14		AITA for deciding not to go to my brothers wedding because of his partner?	"My family really do not get along with my brothers fiancé. She’s manipulative, controlling and is pulling the strings behind my brother’s decisions. I haven’t gotten along with her for years; and she knows this, yet I choose to be civil when visiting to make my brother happy...

I haven’t spoken to my brother in 5 months, I haven’t seen him either. He hasn’t spoken, properly, to the remainder of his family for months too. We’ve all put our hands in to help with the wedding prior to this happening, and yet it’s all getting thrown back into my face.

In the past year I’ve endured a few problems with my brother. I wasn’t his best man, instead a guy was asked to be his best man who he’s only known for 2 years; at the moment I can’t afford to go on the bachelor party due to it being abroad in Mexico, and the costs are sending my bank account into negative figures. I’ve chosen, at the moment, not to fully commit to the payment schedule for the bachelor party as I can’t afford it right this minute, however I’ve no issue in months to come paying more money to go IF I manage to save up enough money. Despite me making this decision and making him fully aware of my financial situation he’s chosen to push me away and his fiancé has filled my brothers head with nothing but toxic thoughts so suddenly I’ve become a bad person. 

When confronting him about the issues he’s recognised he’s been distant, yet blamed it on work. Despite the work, he’s managed to find time for his fiancé’s side of the family; but not his. He’s ignored my last 2 messages where I was curious his mental health could be in jeopardy and offered support and reminded him that I loved him. He chose to ignore them messages and now I’m feeling very unwelcome to the whole wedding whatsoever.

I’m unsure what’s occurred but I’ve now chosen not to attend the wedding as I do not agree with the woman he is marrying; and I fully do not agree with his attitude towards his own blood. IF we rectify everything before the wedding, I’ll attend however I feel like this is an ultimatum, a very extreme one, to try and truly solve this conflict that has occurred out of nowhere.

c4wiu3	2019-06-24 21:52:28	walrus10legend	AITA for not eating my mother's 6 month old frozen food	"A few years ago, my mom got really into ""jarring"", which is (just like it sounds) the act of jarring and preserving foods for a very long time. She's always been incredibly fixated on saving money and hated cleaning out the fridge before it was all eaten, so it kind of makes sense as to why she'd get into this. At first, I was totally on board, after all with these methods we can make food that usually lasts less than 2 weeks last a month or two.

But in the last year or so, we started using the jarred food less and less (most of the jars are filled with vegetable soup, and marinara sauce with sausages and meatballs for pasta, mostly the latter). But she kept jarring it at the same rate as before.

Now, our freezer is absolutely filled to the brim with sauce and soup ranging from 4-12 months old. Today, she made pasta with sauce, sausages and meatballs that were marked from December 2018. Every time I eat it, it gets harder and harder to keep down, and usually I try to avoid the labels because what I don't know can't hurt me, but goddamn its damn near inedible. But neither she nor my step dad ever say a word about it, and they clear their bowls every time.

Today I couldnt get more than a few bites in before I got to the sausage, bit down, and immediately gagged and spit it out. It didn't taste rotten (not that I can tell what rotten sausage tastes like) but still it was just revolting.

Is this just psychological? Am I being an asshole by not finishing this food when they clearly have no qualms with it?

Now I have no problem with this guy. But since I don't live in our parents house anymore and I do a serious work with my computers, I decided after coming back again for summer to check our network security. I checked all the devices and found that one device that wasn't my family's and after asking, my brother told me about our neighbor. I asked him if he trusts him and he said yes. I replied 'then since I don't know him well I'll check on him' and he said ok whatever.

While I have no problem with him piggybacking, I can't just let it slide since I'm very security conscious. I spied on his network traffic for a week to have a complete view for my personal Information Gathering report and afterwards I told my brother about it one morning with coffee. I told him because I don't really care what anyone would think since the guy is piggybacking our network and I can do whatever I want. Since my brother gave him the password and I told him that I'll check, it should be his responsibility to let him know.

After telling him, he got angry and asked me why I did this. I reminded him what we discussed the day I came and asked about that device and he said that he thought I'd do something else, not spy on him for a whole week. Right now he's still a little bit angry and I don't know if the guy knows, but tbh I don't care!

Now some backstory... 

Firstly, we agreed that we wouldn't visit for a while until we could trust his family to be better people. We rescued a dog a couple years back and everything was great but she is very special and allergic to everything and if she eats most foods she has gastro bleeds and has to be rushed to the vets. We explained all of this but had a situation where we thought she wouldn't make it because of them leaving food somewhere when they said they'd be careful but never were. 
It is also extremely uncomfortable for me because I have a severe anxiety and depression problem and we were staying with them when my dad suddenly passed away. I received so much stress and criticism for my anxiety flare up and they made me feel awful. 

Now fast forward to today. On the phone his mum said it would be good for us to stay with her while his anxiety is bad because she understands what it's like having been through this herself. But if she understands why was I so mistreated. 
I will admit I've been standoffish with partner but he can't understand why I've been so frustrated with her extremely rude offer and why I refuse to expose our dog to them again.

I’ve been neglecting my relationship and I feel bad about it, but i just have a difficult time bringing him into my problems when I know he’s dealing with his own, especially since this is a newer relationship(3 months). 

I’ve always been the type of person that deals with my struggles on my own, and I have a difficult time letting people in. So pretty much I’ve been telling him I need space, and that I just need time for family issues. But the other day he spoke to my sister and she told him what’s been going on. 

He called me and told me it was urgent for me to meet with him, so I did. He told me I was extremely selfish for pushing him away, when I know he cares. He also told me it saddened him to see that I didn’t feel like I could come to him with something so serious. He pretty much made me feel really guilty, so much that I cried. 

That’s how that one ended for now. But when I told my sisters about this, they told me I was an asshole, even though they both have relationships that are longer than 3 years, and they both have an easy time talking about their feelings.

c4wbqv	2019-06-24 21:40:36	RonDon98	AITA for distancing myself from a close relative	"Background:

 I'm a pretty frugal person that loves cars. These passion conflict greatly in regards to money, so I daily a cheap older car (I bought it for $900) that I love driving as a compromise to both, and I have a few other cars for my enjoyment. This should give a bit perspective to the kind of person I am.

I have a close relative, I'll call them Jessy to hide their name and gender, that just moved back to my city for a good job opportunity. A car is an essential necessity in my city, and Jessy moved from a city where its an unnecessary luxury. So Jessy had no car. Since I had 4 cars at the time, and do relatively well for myself, I didn't mind selling Jessy one. I decided to sell it to Jessy verses lending it for a few reasons. Jessy has a habit of not respecting things given, but prizes those Jessy bought. Also, I wanted to put the car out of my mind once its gone. We agreed on a price, which was half what I could get selling it, and Jessy end up paying me half of that. I was cool with it because Jessy was getting on there feet and using it to hold a job.

After 1.5 years Jessy has gathered enough funds to get a newer car, which is in Jessy's best interest since Jessy is horrible with cars and wouldn't get far without a manufactures warranty. I went to the dealer with Jessy to help inspect the car and make sure it was a good deal. Jessy trades in the car purchased from me and got 3.5x what he paid towards the down payment from the dealer. Jessy also asked me to help with the down payment for the new car. I didn't mind cause I do well for myself and it was less than $1k. Also, Jessy has helped me out a few times in my younger years and Jessy agreed to pay me back (I was never repaid).

This is the AITA part:

 After having the new car for 3 months Jessy gets fired for an easily avoidable reason, and gets the car repo-ed for not making payments. Jessy had no bill other than gas and car insurance while working, since Jessy lives with Jessy's parents. Between the car that was traded in and the down payment I helped with, I basically bought the car for Jessy. I'm highly upset that Jessy lost the car and made no effort to find a new job or save money in case of this situation. I have been avoiding Jessy because I'm so upset about this, but other close relatives are telling me I'm being to harsh about it.

Hi, I'm (22f) and I have always had a caring a loving family, but a manipulative aunt who always seemed to find some type of way to belittle me. My birthday was two weeks ago on a saturday, but I didn't want to celebrate it at all. I told my whole family that I don't want presents or gifts, or to go anywhere fancy my birthday. I just wanted to keep to myself for my birthday, and not really do anything. My aunt didn't seem too happy about it, and pulled me aside and asked me why I didn't want to do anything for my birthday. I told her that I just really *really* don't want to do anything at all. She still was visibly angered, but agreed. A day after that, I found out my aunt had made reservations for my birthday at a restaurant after I told her I didn't want to do anything. I confronted her and asked why she did it, and at that she said I was being ungrateful and disrespectful that I even get to go to a restaurant at all, and said that I didn't even deserve it. That made me snap on her and I told her to cancel it, and she said she would but never did, and instead invited the whole family to come except me. I was fine with it, but was I wrong to refuse to celebrate my birthday?

c4w575	2019-06-24 21:29:41	DaMRRM	AITA for refusing to go to a cottage with my family?	"To begin with, I have a tense relationship with my mother. It's so difficult to disagree with her on anything that I'm terrified of voicing my opinion. I love her dearly, but she is an... intimidating woman to say the least. Partially due to genetics and partially due to my relationship with my mother, I am on anxiety and depression medication.

Another thing, my cottage is 6 hours north of my hometown in Ontario, which means it's very distant from society. It's lovely, but when I'm up there, I'm bored as all hell and I often feel trapped with family, which can feel uncomfortable.

So for once, I've decided to take a stand and say I'm not going, because it causes me too much anxiety and I would feel very uncomfortable. In response, my mother laughed at me and told me that I don't love the family. Amazingly, we had a fairly civil conversation. Of course, while my parents are gone, I'm expected to care for the house and animals, which I agree to. However, my mother telling me that I don't love the family, and that I will no longer be receiving an inheritance, alongside calling me a spoiled brat, has made me think that maybe I am a real ass for not going on a family vacation that I would be very uncomfortable and unhappy on. I have agreed to go on two other family vacations in the future, it's just this one is very isolating for me.

The more I think about this, the worse I feel. I feel caught in a hard space, where neither option is pleasant. I am either a disappointment to my parents (or at least, more of one now), or I am miserable and grow to further despise my family cottage.

A final note, I love my parents dearly. However, I just can't bring myself to do this. They tell me that I owe them so much that I can't imagine it, and that a measly family trip is nothing for me to bare. I can't argue this, except that I would rather not be forced to 'bare' anything. As you can tell by this disorganized mess, this trifle has occurred just recently.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I admit, I was stupid and ate my mother's bit of cornbread last night, and so was sent out to replace it (understandably) with licorice and a mango lassi. However, I came home to a very special note that read:  ""I \[DaMRRM\], being the artistically messy, thoughtless, mon 'family first', all round colossal ingrate that I am, have decided not to join my parents on vacation. I am willing to endure the impact this will have on my hereafter good relationships with my parents... and their likelihood of including me in their WILL. In compensation, (not that anything i could do could compensate for this act of treason), I promis to: Have the house spotlessly clean Work on my ART Give Renard 'tukkus lingus' to release the built up stink-oil in his anal glands.

c4w2q5	2019-06-24 21:25:38		AITA? How many times can my husband cancel plans before I stop believing him?	"Hi AITA! 

My husband and I have been enrolled in a gym since we got married. I go a lot, because it's fun, but he usually doesn't like to go. We often make plans to go, and then at the last minute he changes his mind or flat-out pretends (as a joke) that he doesn't remember making the plans. This happens frequently enough that I don't even count our planned gym outings into my weekly workout goals because I just assume it won't happen. We've gone together once since the end of March. 

We said we were going to the gym together after an appointment today at about 6:30. I set up a meeting at 6:00, the earliest the other person could do, in the hopes that if he somehow magically wanted to go to the gym, I wouldn't be too late (maybe 15 minutes). He found out and got really upset and said if he had done the same thing to me, I would have not liked it, and he's right.

However, the difference is that he says about 4-5x/week that he will go to the gym with me and then decides not to at the last minute. So I said, I didn't see why this time would be any different? And he got really upset at that. 

To note, I don't think this is any kind of my husband feeling bad about not going to the gym enough emotional sore spot. He is in fantastic shape, way better than me, and feels no obligation to go (he's not from the US and in his country people don't get a sense of virtue from exercising). He just works hard and really likes to chill out at home.

Okay friends, AITA? 

Also, to note, I canceled my meeting and am planning to surprise him after he's done with work with gym clothes and an offer to buy him Chipotle afterwards, so I hope he will be less mad."		1	0

EAK: Entitled Adopted Kid

SB: Sweet Boy

Background: Me, EAK, and SB are all on the same Highschool baseball team. This happened two years ago but EAK has pretty much stayed the same. EAK is a bully, he's an entitled asshole who's parents spoil the everliving shit out of him. But there's one catch, EAK is adopted. SB is the nicest, funniest kid you'll ever meet. But, most people are mean to him because he's different. SB has Tics and that can make him seem weird to outsiders. He also likely has a form of social anxiety (I have the same issue).

Story: This is one of the last days of our freshman year and EAK wants to race us because he thinks he got faster over the course of the year. SB is like ""sure I'll race you"" or something like that. EAK then proceeds to cheat the first time around but we call him out on it and redo the race. SB is a little overweight so when he won the race the second time around everybody was laughing and cheering him on. SB had a nice grin and smile and it was cool seeing EAK finally not get his way. EAK then decides that he is going to call SB a ""retard"". A switch inside my head flipped and I was in ""no holding back"" mode. I quickly respond with a line I will never forget.

""Well at least his parents loved him enough to keep him""

EAK was silent.

SB was silent

Nobody talked until we all got picked up by our parents.

So, did i go to far? Or did EAK get what he deserved?

Edit: I didn't mean for this to be an awfulbrag but I guess I can see how one could view it that way.

Lucia- “girl”

Thomas- “friend”

So me and my friend go back almost 10 years and there isn't anything I wouldn't do to help him and felt that he would do the same, we used to be in the same middle school but ended up going to different schools when we got to high school, recently at the start of my Junior year, I enrolled into the private school that he attended and we still got along perfectly, the same year, his cousin (F) enrolled into the same school (not gonna lie, she’s a strong 9/10), at first I wasn’t attracted to her but the more I got to know her as the year went along, we became partners in biology and we both hit it off immediately with our shared interests in almost everything from favorite foods to our top ten shows. We started hanging out more often but it was nothing more then friends, at this point I started developing feelings for her but I wasn’t confident that she would feel the same way and I didn’t push anything until I found out from her best friend that she did have feelings for me.

I didn’t want anyone to know about us, especially Thomas since I was afraid of what his reaction would be, I didn’t tell any of my other friends either, but she told her close friends (which I’m cool with), we kept under the blanket for almost 6 months before one of her friends spilled the beans and my friend found out. Now at first, I was unaware that he found out but Lucia did know (she didn’t tell me because she was afraid I would get mad), after finding out, Thomas became increasingly hostile towards me making remarks that we’re hurtful, I tried to confront him about it but he refused to talk to me, eventually a few other friends got involved and calmed him down and he told me that he was sorry and that he reacted like that because of how much he hates Lucia (they both don’t like each other). I would have thought that would be the end of it but he continued to make jokes at the expense of both me and Lucia even though he knew how much it hurt me, especially since he had problems with another girl and I did whatever I could to help him.

After the school year ended, I got a message from Thomas saying that I had to chose between him and Lucia, I got really pissed off at him after that text and went off about how he’s the world shittiest friend and that I would pick Lucia hands down, soon Lucia blocked me on every social media, including my number and now I have no way of contacting her. I found out recently that Thomas played a part in it and told he how I allegedly sold her nudes to a friend for cash, the other dudes name was Vance, and that mother fucker was in on it the whole time and told her that I did. (I don’t know all of the details)

I’m now heartbroken, the worst part is that Vance and Lucia are apparently together now and she hates my guts, and I have no way of telling her since she’s not coming back next year because of me.

c4vyzp	2019-06-24 21:19:12	fatlittleyorkies	AITA For denying birth father's request to spend three weeks over the summer with his daughter	"Actually are ""we"" the asshole. Girlfriend is the birth mother. We have been together three years living together for two. We have custody of her seven year old daughter pretty much 100% of the time. Before six birth saw her maybe half a dozen times a year his choice. He has never lived more then an hour away, the girl visits his parents usually multiple times a month and he has a history of cancelling plans to see her. He now sees her more often but typically less then once a month. Usually she visits him for a weekend. 

Custody agreement doesn't cover visitation. Girlfriend no longer tries to get him to have daughter over. Girlfriend will provide travel and coordination if either one of them wants a visit. We don't force daughter to visit if she doesn't want to. 

Lately daughter hasn't been wanting to visit. She loves her dad but she doesn't like visiting him. Typically they stay in his apartment the entire time usually playing Minecraft or she might get to go with her father and step mom to a babysitting gig and play with those kids. She says it is boring. 
As far as taking care of her goes he is not that great at it. Daughter typically complains about not getting fed dinner when we pick her up. He also has left her alone in the apartment when he went to the store. Due to her age doing this was not legal in our state. He appears like he wants to take care of her but isn't good at it. He has never taken any initiative to buy her things like clothes, books, school supplies or toys. She doesn't have anything at his home and sleeps on a couch. 

Birth father approached us at a family dinner event stating he wanted to take daughter for three weeks during the summer. She has never been with him longer then four days. We said we would think about it and check our plans but in private both agreed it should not happen. The paternal grandparents said the same thing. The grandmother directly said ""You can't do that to her"" when it came up. 
Looking for additional perspective on this. On the one hand it is important for daughter and her father to spend time together but we don't think he can handle that amount of time in pretty much any way. We are considering five days in a row over a week and additional short visits if daughter wants them. Are we being assholes for out of hand denying this request"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Sometimes it seems like he uses the account more than I do. The reason he doesn't like spending money on things like Spotify is because he was raised to be frugal af.

c4vvyv	2019-06-24 21:14:18	truebisch	Aita for 'disciplining' MY cat?	So me and my live-in girlfriend just had a doozy of a fight. Long story short I adopted a kitten about three weeks before she moved in. His name is Kilo and we are the best of friends. He always sleeps on my side of the bed, strongly prefers my scritches, and only comes to me when his name is called. Despite all of this my gf still sees him as 'our' cat. Since I got him I discipline him by squirting him with a squirt bottle when I find him doing something he's not supposed to be doing; i.e. jumping on the kitchen counters, playing with the toilet paper, laying on the coffee table, sitting on my night stand etc. My gf insists cats don't understand discipline so I am just being cruel and that he's just going to do those things when I'm not looking so I'm not accomplishing anything by doing this. Everytime I squirt him she makes me feel like an asshole animal abuser. Today we came home from the grocery store and I was excited to do some baking (I cook alot). When we walked in the front door I see Milo sprawled out on the kitchen counter fast asleep. I grabbed my squirt bottle and gave him a good dousing. As usual my gf berated me for being mean but this time I couldn't just take it. I told her he's MY cat and I'll train him how I see fit and pointed out that he DOES learn because I rarely have to squirt him anymore, and that a large part of why I do this is for his own good as I don't want him eating something he shouldn't like chocolate or weed. Also I don't like the thought of him walking on my cooking surfaces just after scratching in his litter box. Now I'm getting the silent treatment and she won't try one of the brownies I just made and I'm feeling like an asshole again. So tell me Reddit, AITA?	No A-holes here	0	0

"When I found out my SIL was pregnant the first thing I told her is to not worry about her baby shower. I told her that I will throw it at my house and I will pay for everything and to not stress about it. The only thing she had to worry about is set a date and give me a guest list. I kept reminding every other week. “SET A DATE GIVE ME A GUEST LIST. SET A DATE GIVE ME A GUEST LIST.” This went on for months, no date no guest list. Last weekend we were at a girls brunch and one of our friends asked her when her baby shower is, she replied and said “Next week at Dara’s (me) house.” I was not told of this but I just nodded and smiled as to not cause a scene and embarrass her. In private I told her that, this is all very last minute.
I own my own business and work over 10 hours a day! I told her that I have been asking for her to set a date for months in advance and she did not follow through. I refused and said sorry and left it at that. A few days later she starts sending me baby shower ideas and decorations and numbers for bakeries to order her baby shower cake from. She even sent me a guest list and a time of when she wants the baby shower to happen (5 Days from today). I told her again I was not gonna do it because it’s last minute. I don’t operate this way.

We both had ‘visit Japan’ at the top of our bucket lists and talked of going together someday, with or without the kids. His child in particular has an interest in all things Japanese and is 11 years old.
Fast forward 2019 and my partner’s parents are both a bit frail, one has a terminal disease. They decide to gift their son and granddaughter the trip of a lifetime to Japan.  They’re going in August for 10 days for about £4K each and have strict instructions not to tell other family members.
I’m trying to be glad for them but my nose is out of joint. They were originally going at the start of the school holidays when my own children are with their Dad so I’m available. Instead, my partner has moved their dates forward so he can then go on holiday somewhere low-key (read cheap!) with me straight after. He’s thinking a last-minute cheap holiday or camping here in the UK. I’m thinking sod that, I’ll go somewhere exotic on my own, thank you very much. 
He’s trying to play it down by saying he’s only going to be escort for his daughter, we can go on our own another time (really? You’d pay that much to go again? And where’s the joint adventure in that?) and his daughter has had a tough year following his acrimonious divorce.
And, let me get this straight, I could and would have paid for myself as I’ve just sold my campervan.  I get on really well with his daughter and she likes me alot. Going to Japan would be a big deal for me. I’ve not been abroad nor had a decent holiday for over 15 years."		1	0

c4vsnh	2019-06-24 21:09:07		AITA for asking my friends to pay me for my investment advice?	"I work as a portfolio manager for a hedge fund. I did not have a traditional path to this career so the vast majority of my friends and acquaintances are financially illiterate. As a result, I've become their go to person for all finance matters.

In the beginning, it was pretty mild. They would ask me generic questions that you could google the answer for. I didn't mind because it didn't take up too much of my time. My problems began as I climbed the corporate ladder and became seemingly more successful. This success gave them greater confidence in my abilities and their inquiries suddenly shifted from information based to more personal, tailor based investment advice. I was reluctant at first because it required a lot more of my time but I relented and eventually ended up managing their investments. I rationalized that this could be my way of giving back for their support and kindness when I was recovering from opioid addiction (one of them is a nurse, monitored my injections/rehab/relapses in her own home). 

A few weeks ago I went to a party and several of my friends (we're all in our early-mid 30s if that matters) were showing off their new cars and bragging about their recent financial windfall from several smart investments they've made. This might sound egotistical but I expected at least one of them to thank me. Instead they all joked about how they were giving me a run for my money and that I might be out of a job soon since any one of them could do what I do. I confronted them about this because I thought it was disrespectful and showed a lack of gratitude on their part but they blew me off. Some of them even got quite angry and said that I was acting like a ""petulant asshat"". They said I was not entitled to any credit because I didn't work for that money. In their words, all I did was ""move their money around and play with it"". While the actual value is irrelevant IMO, for purposes of providing adequate context, it was not an insignificant injection of wealth (i.e some of them quit their second jobs/had spouses that quit their jobs to give you an idea). I almost lost it when one of them questioned my sobriety. 

So a couple days later, I made up some story about how I got promoted and no longer had the time to help them out with their finances. I also refused to help them during this transitory period since just thinking about it makes me mad. I told them if they still needed help, they could compensate me for my time or I could get them in touch with people who are more equipped to handle non-accredited investors. I've blocked them for the time being because the initial emotional fallout was so toxic I didn't want to deal with it anymore. A few people I've confided to about this have accused me of being ""cold hearted"" and ""sensitive"" which has made me second guess myself.

c4vri5	2019-06-24 21:07:16	MathW	AITA for refusing to split excess pool party costs?	"Another post here reminded me of something that happened to me a few years ago.  I went to a buddy's bachelor party in Las Vegas.  Now, before the trip, the best man had laid out the various costs for activities including a pool party on Saturday.  The deal with the pool party was that you'd rent a covered cabana for $X, which was pricey, but you'd get the same amount of $ credit in drinks and food.  The best man said the cabanas would be $150 per person.   With 10 total people, that would have been $1,500 total to spend on food and drinks for \~6 hours at the pool.

&#x200B;

Now, most people going for the bachelor party were getting there on Thursday and leaving Sunday.  However, since I had a 1 year old, I planned to leave Saturday to help my wife out and save some money (Saturday night hotel rooms and Sunday flights out of Vegas are usually like 2-3x normal rates).  Due to this, I was only going to get to spend 2 hours or so at the pool party before I'd have to leave to catch my flight.  Regardless, I had no problem fronting the entire stated cost of the pool party ($150) knowing I would not be there the entire time.

&#x200B;

The day of it comes and everything goes as planned.  I had a few beers and a mixed drink or two and had a good time before I had to leave for my flight.  The next morning, the best man sends a message to the group chat and says the food and drink tab for the pool party was $750(!) per person and we all needed to venmo him an extra $600 to cover the cost.  Talking to others at the party, as I understand it, things had gotten pretty crazy after I left and there was a lot of food and drinks being ordered -- many (most?) of it going to people who were not even in our party.  Everyone was drunk and anyone could add to the tab, so I don't think anyone cared or was keeping track of how large the bill was getting until the end of the night.  Food/drink prices at the pool were definitely high as would be expected, but $750 would still be the equivalent of a couple of bottles of liquor per person and at least 2 of us didn't stay the entire time.

&#x200B;

Anyway, long story short, I refused to pay the extra amount for a few reasons, but mainly because I wasn't there when the money was spent.  I made it clear to the best man that, had I been there and actually got to enjoy the portion of the party that got wild, I still would have been pretty upset the tab got so out of control, but probably would have paid.  Since I didn't pay, I'm sure the best man got stuck with the bill, and things were pretty awkward between us for a while, but it didn't seem fair at all the way the situation was handled."

Later, I realized that he left behind most of his furniture, his food, and his spare tires. He had no intentions of coming back for these and said I could do whatever I wanted with them. 

It slowly hits me that ontop of getting rid of his stuff, downsizing on my own things, and packing everything else, I had to clean an entire house and yard by myself if we wanted our damage deposit back. 

At first I didn't care, but the longer I cleaned, the more resentful I got. I also had to throw away all of his food because it spoiled before he even left. I advertised his furniture on facebook, but no one wanted it so I had to borrow a truck to bring it to the dump along with those spare tires because they were 18 years old (wtf). He didn't even clean his own bedroom before leaving and we kept finding dried poop from his cat while washing the walls and floors.

I don't think he deserves an equal share. I wouldn't keep the entire damage deposit, but maybe 2/3rds. WIBTA if I did this? How would I even bring it up to him?

Note: the one thing he left behind that I'm actually keeping is his barbecue and propane tank. I'm not sure if this makes up for everything else, since I still had to borrow a truck to move it and I won't even be able to use it this summer.

Now I am left handed, and in my house everything is pretty much set up that way, left handed implements, left handed mouse on my computer, everything set to the left hand side.

so living with my son, I've teached him to use stuff like a knife and fork ""the left handed way"" and he plays baseball and basketball with his left hand. he is basically 100% left handed just like me.

now I had a Parent-Teacher meeting tonight, and the Teacher bought up Toms left handedness and described it to me as ""an issue that keeps arising"" I laughed it off assuming it was a joke and said ""yeah he takes after his dad in that regard"" and waved with my left hand.
After she learnt I was left handed her tone seemed to get a bit more serious and she told me that ""It has become really difficult since Thomas is the only left handed kid in this class, and we think you should teach him to be right handed so it is a lot easier for him in the future"", and apparently some kids have been making fun of his inability to use his right hand, when he eats lunch.

I told her that I would not be teaching my son to use his right hand as I struggle to use it myself for most things, and she told me that if I don't then the school will be removing stuff from his left hand to his right ""for the benefit of his future and the other kids""

I have no intention of teaching my kid to be right hand dominant and I told the teacher that I'd be taking this higher and she started raising her voice and told me I'm selfish for making him be left handed.

c4vnak	2019-06-24 21:00:45	_thebeees_kneees_	AITA for being mad at my friends for not checking up on me?	"So basically my dog died a couple weeks ago. My friends all know how much I loved my dog. After I told them, a couple of them offered condolences and one said they would be there to talk if I needed it. No one else said anything (I told them over text). Since then, I've been kind of struggling. I've had problems with mental illness in the past, which several of them know, and my dog was really the only thing that made me happy. I'm kind of pissed off that some of them never said anything about it, and that no one has asked me if I'm okay since then. I know it's kind of selfish, but if our situations were reversed I would check up on them to make sure they were doing okay. I haven't brought this up with them. AITA for being upset that they haven't asked if I'm okay?

Edit: These are people that I see in person quite a bit, and I'm close with all of them. They all know that I loved my dog a lot. My main problem is with the ones who never said anything to me about it. It sort of gives me the impression that they don't really care about me.

c4vlyw	2019-06-24 20:58:43	bunnieantare	AITA for a beach trip fail?	"i (18f) planned to go on a beach trip 3 weeks in advance with my coworker (20f) and our boyfriends [mine(21m) hers (19m)], and mutual friends of my boyfriend (23m and 26m)

a week before the trip she wants to go to X beach, my bfs friend suggests we'd better go to Y beach instead cause parking will be better. i show coworker the text and she says thats fine.

coworker left friday night for her and her bf's airbnb in X beach (that i was unaware of cause she said Y beach was ok) 

saturday morning the four of us (me, bf, and friends) are driving to Y beach when she calls and says ""Heyyy i'm at X beach""

we were kinda annoyed that she agreed to Y beach but went to X beach anyways but said whatever and went to X beach anyways. she also wanted us to get her alcohol so we had to turn around to get it.

we get to X beach and we're having trouble with parking, which is why we chose Y beach instead. coworker calls us.

me: hey we're having trouble finding parking

coworker: why dont you just risk getting towed or a ticket? 

me: nah we'll not do that

coworker: how about you just leave one person to figure that out and the rest just come with us

me: that seems unfair we'll do it together

so the call ends and we're waiting for people to leave for an hour. she sent her boyfriend with the jeep to come get us by a ramp but we were still dealing with parking. 40 minutes in her boyfriend gave up and went back to my coworker. 

the distance from us to her is about 2 miles.

we ended up finding parking and because it was 2 miles away and we had umbrellas, chairs, coolers etc and her jack to tug with us, we gave up and just went to the beach near us and left after 2 hours.

she didnt seek out the jack the day we were at the beach and she knew we were at the beach cause i saw her view my snap story of all of us at the beach.

we went back to my bfs friends house 2 hours away in the city and hung out until i got high with bfs friend and we left, forgetting the jack. 

she is mad that apparently i'm not taking accountability and that i'm irresposibble. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4vlqa	2019-06-24 20:58:20		WIBTA for saying I’m not going to host a party after I said I would probably do something?	"About a week ago my friend and I were talking and saying someone should host before we all leave to go to uni and not see each other for a while. So I said yeh I wouldn’t mind hosting something maybe. I’m pretty sure it came across as “yeh im definitely gonna host now” because now my friend is asking me questions like when am I gonna host, can he plus one these people already. He seemed to be kinda pushy about it which bothered me a little. Also when he told me about the people he wanted to invite as plus ones I was reluctant to say anything because I’m not too close with them and have only met them a couple times. So I’m thinking about putting my foot down and saying no I don’t want to host, but equally I don’t want to be the asshole and don’t want to offend my friend by saying I don’t want his people to come.

WIBTA if I say no to hosting?

TLDR: I offered to host a party but now I’m considering saying I don’t want to host because I’m not 100% comfortable with people coming to my house and I don’t really like the people my friend wants to plus one."	Everyone Sucks	1	0
c4vl5a	2019-06-24 20:57:28	beefmoretti	AITA for breathing loudly	"I work with this woman who's about 50 years old. She said she started smoking when she was 13. About 2 years ago, she finally decided to quit smoking. Good for her. Except she then started packing on the pounds. I myself am an ex smoker so I know what that's like. I've worked very hard to bring my weight back down to my pre-smoking level. But weight is not what this is about. I DGAF how much weight she's put on. My problem is that a lot of her weight gain seems to be in her neck, which I think (*untrained* medical opinion, I admit) is restricting her airways. The end result? She now breathes like Darth Vader. I mean it's constant heeee hooooo heeeeee hoooo. That's all I hear at work all day. Heeee hooooo heeeee hooooo. And she also throws in the occasional snort. Yes snort. Just like when you ask a little kid, ""What noise does the pig make?"" Yeah, that. She gets so loud, I've witness somebody from another department at the other side of the wall come into our area asking, ""Is somebody sleeping in here? I hear snoring.""

I have brought this up with her before. One day the breathing was particularly loud and it was driving me crazy. So after a loud snort, I looked over and in the most sympathetic way I could muster, ""Are you breathing ok?""  

She got defensive and rude, ""Yeah! Why!""

I've also brought this up to my manager. The manager said that he checked with the labour relations department (I work for a large government agency with a large union workforce, so management seems to tiptoe around ""sensitive"" issues) and they told my manager he's not allowed to discuss it as breathing is a human right. Manager's suggestion is I put on headphones to block it out. But I think that's only a short term solution as I don't believe I should have to damage my hearing just so Darth Vader can be as loud as she wants. 

So my solution is to breath loudly like her. I snort too. She doesn't always notice me doing it, but when she does she shoots me a dirty look like *I'm* a disgusting person for breathing loudly. The positive from this is that when she does notice me doing it, she stops for a few minutes. And those few minutes are heavenly for me. We work in an office environment and a lot of times I really need peace and quiet to concentrate on what I'm doing. 

Some co-workers think I'm being mean. I disagree obviously, because I have tried other ways to put a stop to this but nothing else has worked. So, people of Reddit. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
c4vkyi	2019-06-24 20:57:12	InsidiousToilet	WIBTA if I anonymously call HR on behalf of my coworkers to report our boss's behavior?	"My office is a giant cluster fuck, and I'm sorry if this comes off convoluted...but here it goes anyway:

* Office manager (""Bob"")
* Three team leaders, ""Jose"", ""Steve"", and ""Sue"".  
* Three software analysts, ""Amanda"", ""Becky"", and ""Mary"".
* 12 programmers (including myself, and ""Tim"").

A quick note about Bob, is that all of the software analysts he hires are women, and he always has one sit next to him to act as his personal secretary.  They also always leave, because Bob's an asshole.

Last week, Tim got into an argument with Becky. Things got heated, and Becky pulled her team lead, Sue, into the conference room.  Sue walked out, pulled Tim's team lead, Steve into the room, and explained what happened.  Tim got a soft ""talking to"", and went back to his desk...to immediately peep over Becky's shared cube wall to see if she was working.

Sue moved Becky to an empty desk in the office without asking Bob.  New hires are given seats at the team lead's position, so Sue didn't think it was an issue.  Bob threw a fit.  He told Becky to move back, yet she refused to do so unless Tim was moved elsewhere. Tim's the 'golden child' in the office, so that wasn't going to happen.  Sue did her best to kiss Bob's ass and placate him, but he told them that someone BETTER be sitting next to his desk by Friday.

Alternatives were offered: Bob has been vocal about leaving, and Jose will take over, therefore Jose should sit there.  Bob didn't want to move him (because then he'd look ""weak"").  Voice mail is a thing, as is call forwarding.  There's no reason to force a woman to sit near you just so she can  be your secretary if that's not her job title.  

Friday morning comes, and no one is sitting there. Bob brings Sue to the conference room, and removes her from her team lead position.  Monday morning comes, and he disbands the entire QA team; he split them up, giving them to the programmer team leads.  Additionally, the analysts have to submit daily reports to both their new leads AND to Bob, presumably so that Bob can look at what they're doing and start the process of elimination to get rid of the two whom he (now) doesn't like (their work was never in question prior to this).

ALL of this is on top of the fact that, once in a while, Bob will make sexual remarks to the four women, including touching one in appropriately once (to ""look at her tattoo"", without asking). He hasn't done it in a few months, though. They could go above Bob's head, to Gary, but they feel that Gary won't write Bob up, and even if he does, and will just make their situation worse.  There's an ""old boy's club"" mentality here that they aren't a part of.  Bob will just retaliate.   

I want to do something for them, but I'm not directly involved in what's going on, and I can't afford to lose my job if I speak out publicly.  An anonymous HR call is all I can think of.

c4vkvl	2019-06-24 20:57:04		AITA for insisting my boyfriend neuter his dog?	"My boyfriend has two German Shorthaired Pointers, an older, spayed female, and a younger, intact male. 

He has always maintained the male dog could keep his tackle as long as he wasn't aggressive. Rarely, another intact male will get him riled up, but overall, he is the sweetest dog and there isn't a mean bone in his body. He's also far more obedient than the other dog, only humps other dogs, and only marks outside.

The obvious problem is that he likes to hump the spayed female. My boyfriend jokes about it, but it makes me uncomfortable, and by the female's growls, she doesn't seem to like it either. She is a larger, and more dominant dog, so when he gets a little too close for comfort a fight breaks out that ends with her mounting him. Kinda hilarious, but I worry for his safety should this behavior continue.

I've seen him around a female in heat, and there seemed to be quite a bit of sniffing and air humping, he never got around to the act (the female was a giant mastiff), and he behaves respectably when he goes to the park around dogs of questionable intact status.

 But my main concern now is that we've moved onto an unfenced property (15 acres) and our neighbors are unfenced as well. We let the dogs out a few times a day for bathroom and play or when we're working outside. Usually they come back within few minutes, or they come quickly when we call, so we're usually pretty lax about keeping track of them when they're outside. But lately, the male dog has been gone for long periods of time, and only returns after we've called him for 15 minutes. I think he's trawling for dog ass, but boyfriend thinks he's just tracking something. 

I don't know about the status of our far neighbors' dogs, but in addition to those, there's at least one pack of wild dogs in the area, and either way I don't want him getting another dog pregnant and bringing unwanted puppies into the world.

Boyfriend says he doesn't want to neuter. The dog was an expensive pedigreed purebreed, and because of his sweet temperament, he says he wants to breed in the future. While it's entirely possible he could stud out his dog, he's made no efforts toward making this a reality, and I assume there is far more to breeding and studding than just papers and temperament.

While I don't agree with neutering/spaying arbitrarily, and I agreed with his initial premise of keeping the dog intact as long as he didn't misbehave, I think our current circumstances make neutering practically a requirement. But he's not my dog, though I love the both of them very much. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

 A bit of background information. I moved across country to get away from an abusive ex husband. Before I left he shredded all of my legal documentation, including my birth certificate, ID card, and social security card. I am in the process of grtting these things back, and my birth certificate is on its way in the mail. I will be able to get my other documentation as soon as it comes in. 
I started dating this guy (James) while I've been here and he's absolutely wonderful. He's the one that helped me move across country, and he let me move in when i got here. Things developed naturally between us. His mother is a wonderful sweet woman but his dad (we'll call him Steve from here) seems to hate me no matter what I do. 
I have no legal documents, so I can not have a legal job at the moment. A friend of James' offered me a part time job cleaning his house and a nanny to his grandkids. I make 400 a week. Its not the best but it helps. 
This happened today and my head is still reeling from everything.
For the umpteenth time, Steve started yelling at me for not helping enough with bills and how I'm using James for the things he has. He mentioned that I barely work, and James works his ass off.
 Never have I asked James for anything, and I could care less about money. James owns a business but thats not mine. I respect that its not my money. 
I snapped back and told him if I wanted money i wouldn't have gotten with James, and told him to leave me alone, and that I'm doing the best I can with the hand I have been dealt. I went into my room and didn't come out until he left. I did not curse or yell at him. Our friends think Steve's the asshole, but the family thinks I'm the asshole.

When we hang out it's usually at my house because he told me his Mom is always home and she can get extremely annoying at times. I never really thought much of it. A few weeks ago when I was picking him up for school I really needed to use the bathroom and I couldn't use the bathroom at school because we were already running late for class. I asked if I can use the bathroom at his house and he told me it was fine, right when I entered his home I was hit in the face with a terrible stench, it was so bad that I had to breathe in and out from my mouth. I asked him where the bathroom was and he told me down the hall, as I was walking through his house I noticed all the dents in the walls, a bunch of coackroaches running around and dirty rags were everywhere. I didn't want to use his bathroom anymore so I just told him that I didn't want to be anymore late as is. 

&#x200B;

I didn't act different towards him at all after, everything was fine until he asked me if I wanted to chill at his house a few days ago. I didn't want to say no but I definitely didn't want to go back to his house either, I quickly came up with a believable excuse and I don't think he noticed I was lying. When I got home I told older brother who recently came home from college about the situation and he told me I was being a terrible friend and how I wasn't being considerate at all about his situation.

c4vh81	2019-06-24 20:51:09	frankensynth	AITA for wanting to drop a close friend/friends after my birthday party?	"Okay so it was my birthday night out last Saturday and I booked a hotel for me and 7 other girls to stay after our ‘big night out’. 

Worth mentioning I’m on specific medication which means I can’t drink (this will make sense later). 

Also, I’m quite alternative, so I’m a bit of an outsider in this group. However, when I was telling everyone about this night out I said i really really want to go to (goth club) and everyone was really happy to go there.

I basically did everything- booked the hotel, organised the whole thing, booked a meal out for us all. this was a nightmare to do because we’re all school friends and have all moved to separate cities so it was stressful and a lot of effort.

We predrink in the hotel. I want to go out pretty early, but everyone wants to get completely wasted in the hotel room first (apart from like 3 of us). I thought this was a bit inconsiderate as it was my birthday and I couldn’t drink, and I’d explicitly told everyone I couldn’t drink because of my medication.

We go out on the town. The first club, everyone’s happy. After about half an hour, a girl in the group gets REALLY sick (let’s call her A), so obv me and another friend (J) take her back to our hotel. At this point, we message the group chat saying ‘ok we’ve taken A to the hotel bc she’s really ill’. At NO POINT did anyone text us to ask what was wrong with her, or ask us when we’d be back. So after we drop her off at the hotel, we wait outside the club for the rest of them. 
I text the group chat and say ‘okay, we are going to (goth club), anyone who wants to come, meet us down here at half past one’
No response.
Nobody comes down.

My other friend and I go to this goth club and have a good night anyway.

The rest of them stay out without us and I feel so angry with them because I invited them ALL on my birthday night out, and just because we couldn’t go to places they didn’t want to go, they’ve ditched me :( 

The thing is as well, a couple of them consistently do this. One of them invited herself to a night out with A and I a few weeks ago, I told her I couldn’t drink, she kept buying me drinks anyway, then forces us to go into places that we didn’t want to, all because we didn’t want to leave her on her own.

There’s a part of me that thinks I’m majorly over reacting and that everyone had a good time on my birthday so who cares? But another part of me that thinks that if J hadn’t been there, my party would have been ruined.

I’ve been invited to one of them’s birthday party next month and to be honest I don’t want to go after that- but then how do I tell them it’s because of Saturday? I’m so conflicted :(

"Hey, so this happened a few months ago and when I told my best friend what happened he is adamant I was being a complete asshole in the situation and so does another friend. I honestly believe I did nothing wrong so please give me some perspective. 

   In the break room just hanging out, the janitor, William, has high severe autism and him and I are very cordial to eachother. I’m usually very friendly to everybody, but we’ve gone out to eat a few times and I consider us friends at work. He was excited and told me that they were running tests on his brain at a nearby clinic because he has a rare brain (per the doctors). I told him that’s really cool and he then informs me they were giving him amazon gift cards and that he has SO many of them. 

   I obviously wasn’t buying in until he said he had so many he didn’t know what he was going to do with them and maybe buy a drone. Then I raised an eyebrow and told him if he had so many he should give me one. He then says “sure I have so many!” and pulled a 5 dollar gift card out from his wallet and handed it to me. Thinking to myself like holy shit I said “hey man give me another one holy shit!”and he proceeded to give me another one. 

   After I put the two in my own wallet, I ask how many specifically does he have and he told me “they gave me so many they gave me three of them. Now I have one-they gave me so many for my brain can you believe that?”

So then I said thank you and went back to work and got 10 dollars worth of amazon credit. So after telling my two buddies about what happened at work, my friends said I essentially stole from a special needs person and should’ve given the gift cards back when he told me he only had three to start with. That I was a fool to believe him since I know how severe his autism is. But he honestly misled me to thinking he had a goldmine of amazon gift cards. And I didn’t steal them he gave them to me. Being autistic doesn’t mean you can’t give gifts. And if he wanted them back he would’ve asked for them back but he was all smiles and laughs after the whole exchange. So Reddit, AITA?"		1	0
c4vciu	2019-06-24 20:43:42	SarcasticSimon_	AITA for ending a friendship between me and my friend during a hard time for her?	"Beforehand, if I make any grammar mistakes. That's because English isn't my native language. First post so don't quite know if I'm doing it right.

Backstory: This friend (F) and I (M) knew each other for over eight years and had contact on a daily basis. Both of us came from relatively-speaking poor families and that's what bonded us. But around a year ago she began acting very selfish. For example, me and her had plans to go on a vacation together but she didn't want to make plans because other friends of her wanted to go with her too. So she wanted to wait until the actual vacation to make arrangements because maybe she would've regretted her choice (and by doing so made all her friends wait for her to make plans). These selfish actions began stacking up and frustrated me.

About three months ago she told me she was confused about her sexual preference and actually was in a relationship with an other girl, but had a hard time because her brother and parents couldn't really accept the fact she was gay (or bi?). I wanted to be as helpful and loving as possible for her during this hard time. 

We had plans together to go somewhere (we actually had these plans for a couple of months, but she changed three times with who she would go. First me, then this other friend, and then again, me.) Two days before we would go she contacted me saying she wanted to cancel our plans and stay home because of how she felt (she just told her mother about her girlfriend). Me wanting to help her during this hard time accepted that.

But here it is, one day after we would've gone I saw that she did go, but again with this other friend. This crossed the line for me and I told her I was done with her because of her being so selfish for so long and using the situation (coming out) as an excuse to not go with me. So I broke all contact with her during this hard time, and have not made contact with her for almost three months now because I don't need shitty friends.

AITA for ending a friendship with someone whilst this person is going through a hard time?

I (29F) work as a consultant and I’ve been at my current place of employment for about a year. One of the other employees started just before me and he is now twenty years old. 

I believe in hard work and I do not accept free riders or people expecting others to take responsibility for what they’re doing. I work as a project manager and that means I build the teams for my projects. I am responsible for delivering the best possible service to our buyer and it’s my ass on the line if we can’t deliver on time or make mistakes. 

My young colleague is... ...well he’s young. He doesn’t show any desire to accomplish anything. He doesn’t own up to mistakes. He doesn’t do anything above what’s requested, and sometimes he doesn’t even do that. I’ve been patient (I think) but last week I had enough. He didn’t deliver what he was supposed to and I told him that wasn’t acceptable and that he wouldn’t be part of any of my projects going forward. I told him he needed to grow up and learn to take responsibility.

My boss understands why I’m annoyed, but when I don’t give the kid any work his billable hours drop - and the profits go down. My boss is not very excited about this and is telling me to stop and get him back to work. 

I have no intention to do this until he gets his shit together. Am I the asshole for telling him this and not giving him work? 

I work hard to bring in the clients I do, and having this kid on my team is bad business. He could very well go out and get his own clients, or try and get work from another project manager. I.e. I’m not taking away his possibility to work, just the possibility to work for me."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4vbn2	2019-06-24 20:42:16	geralt_wolf	AITA for not letting a colleague come with me	"So, let me preface this by saying, this was not a spur of the moment thing. And she ( let's call her Karen) had it a long time coming.

Karen was an ass to me and honestly to everyone around her, girls boys and all alike, bitched and gossiping, throughout college 4 yrs of it, thought she was better than everyone and generally berated me if I even opened my mouth in her presence. But I would usually just keep quiet because she was dating my good friend.

But now that they've broken up I hardly care and pretend like she's non existent.

So, here's the potential assholery... Since we are in med school we get posted for rural posting and transportation is usually a problem. And I had told me friends that I would taken them with me as I have a car. And when the question came to Karen, I said that under no circumstances will I be taking her with me. I just don't want to have anything to do with her.

It's not like she's completely helpless there are taxis to come there. But to be fair even if there weren't I probably wouldn't take her.

Karen went around my back to ask a few people to let geralt to take her with him, I said no. To all.

So now my friends who said they would come with me, (girls) said they want to go with Karen as they don't feel like she should be left alone as she's a girl and it's not safe. I really don't care if they want to go with her, but Im hurt that they did that, as they admit, that she wouldn't do the same for them. And I've told them so that they hurt me. 

But they're still going with her, but want to come with me when she's not coming. And now I feel like that's unfair, and don't wanna take anyone.

FIRST OFF, this was on the TV.

So a group of us were chilling at my place watching a show. The two transitioned into a scene where two guys were having sex and I let out a sudden 'OOOF,' and grimaced.

There's a guy in our group who is gay, and he didn't like that. He called me a homophobe and I said I don't have anything against gay guys but that doesn't mean I wanna watch two dudes having sex with each other. A girl chimed in and said that makes me a homophobe because I disapprove of what gay people do.

I said, ""I don't care what two gay guys do in private, but that doesn't mean I wanna watch them have sex. So unless you plan on watching two girls have sex just to prove you don't hate lesbians, then shut the f\*\*\* up,""

She started playing lesbian porn on her phone at full blast while the guy did the same but with gay porn. I kicked both of them out of my house. The other people in our group looked awkward as hell, but nobody said anything except my friends who jokingly poked me and called me a homophobic, racist (the two gay actors were black), son of a bitch.

We watched through the rest of the scene with no problems. FWIW, I'm a straight guy if that wasn't clear enough.

AITA for not wanting to watch two gay guys have sex?

EDIT: To provide more detail about why I ""OOF'd"", the drama was in a scene where a group of people were just chatting in a bar, everything seemed pretty relaxed. Then **immediately** the scene transitioned to a guy having rough anal sex with another guy, which caught me by surprise and I let out a brief, and involuntary ""OOF"". The drama had never shown gay sex prior so it came out of nowhere.

HAD I SEEN IT COMING, either because there was lead-up to the sex scene, or because it wasn't the first time the show had this content, I would've just kept watching. We in fact watched the scene again after the two idiots had left because a lot of us weren't paying attention the first time due to the argument.

The scene suddenly shifting from a relaxed gathering at a bar to a guy anally rammed was what prompted my ""OOF""."	Asshole	0	0
c4var1	2019-06-24 20:40:52	throwawaybob223	AITA for not inviting the guy who bullied me to our school reunion?	"A few months ago I was contacted by someone I went to sixth form college with, about helping to organise a 20th anniversary reunion party. 4 of us have been involved in organising the party, including booking a hall and sorting out catering, as well of course as tracking down and inviting as many of our friends from back then as we can find. I have not stayed in touch with many people since college so it was really good to reconnect with so many people and I’ve found the process really fun, despite all the organisational hassle.

Early on we came up with a list of names and divided it four ways between us. The sorting was pretty random, and I just got given the “London” list because I went to university in London, although I don’t live there now. One person on my section of the list was the guy who bullied me when we were at college, call him “Joe”. Joe made my life miserable back then. He made me not want to come to college. I actively changed one of my A-Level subjects so I wouldn’t have to share classes with him, and he was responsible for one of the most humiliating moments of my life, for which he never expressed any remorse or regret. He was a cruel bully and I don’t want him anywhere near a reunion that’s meant to be a fun party. I decided not to contact him as his coming to the reunion would ruin it for me.

A couple of weeks ago we four planners got together and went through the list of people who’d RSVPed either yes or no, as well as those we hadn’t heard from or hadn’t been able to track down. Two of them asked after Joe and said they hoped he would come, and I told them he was not coming as he is now living overseas. This isn’t true: although he did move overseas, he’s now back in London. I know this because we’re mutual friends through social media, although I’ve never contacted him.

The reunion is now approaching and I have received more messages asking if Joe is coming and urging me to see if he could make it. I don’t want him to, and frankly if he does then I think I will just not go to the reunion I’ve spent months of my life planning for. AITA for not asking him to come?"	Asshole	0	0

"I have a feeling I might get dinged for a couple of things but hear me out. I'm not some thoughtless asshole, for one. But here's the deal. My wife started getting kind of fat so we talked about her trying to lose weight. When she met, she was around 125lbs and she has ballooned up to 145lbs, which at her height of just over 5 feet tall, that's pretty large. I agreed she should lose weight, and she set to work.

Except this somehow means that when I cook, I have to follow all of these rules. I have to weigh things on a food scale, write it down, portion it out, pick certain ingredients, not use others, etc. It takes the fun out of cooking and it's honestly obsessive and over the top to me. I don't think that I should have to do that just because she's trying to lose the weight.

In my eyes, she can just see what went into the meal and then properly portion out her serving on her own. But writing it all down and having to stop to measure and weigh things so she can ""track it"" makes it extremely aggravating for me. 

Not just that, but she's also refusing to go out to eat, to the bar to hang out, etc, because she won't know how to log it or track or whatever. So there cuts down on our social life. I told her that she can just skip the alcohol or only drink vodka sodas. She said that wasn't fun and I told her that her time to pick ""fun"" happened before she put on the weight. She said that wasn't very nice of me, and I told her that while I love her, it is a disappointment when someone lets themself go like she has. She agreed to keep working, but told me I should be more supportive and help her out.

After applying for a loan and failed to receive it I began saving up. While doing so I was shopping around. After I saved up I went to buy my neighbors foodcart.

She ignored me and said ""I'm a strong willed person and see evil in people's hearts, if you said you were going to buy my cart why were you still looking around"" and "" I don't do business with people like you""

 I felt so bad because we became so close while I was in business and I've went out if my way to help her, like drive out of my way to jump start her car, let her park in the lot I'm leasing multiple times if she can't find street parking trade food ect. While she hasn't done anything but offer me a decent deal on a old food cart.

c4v3x9	2019-06-24 20:29:40		AITA for asking my neighbors to turn their music down?	"I live in an apartment with neighbors on every side.

Preface: I've had a series of issues with my neighbors that I dont have enough time to get into. A lot of cops called that have led to my next-door neighbor hating me.

My next-door neighbor shares my bedroom wall with me, and my bedroom window is pretty much above her front porch. She started a habit of playing music all day and all night. 

Obviously I dont care about the music during the day, but when it got close to midnight it bothered me. Unfortunately noise travels easily from apartment-to-apartment. 

The music (really the bass) was loud enough to make it impossible to sleep even with a fan blowing at full-blast next to my head and an additional white noise app playing loudly on my phone. For the first couple nights it happened I just tried to tough it out, or slept in my living room on the couch if I couldn't deal with it.

But I got fed up with it around midnight one night and wanted to be able to sleep in my bedroom, so I walked over and knocked on her door and politely asked her to turn down her music. She didn't really say much in response other than ""K"" and then shut the door. I did think she turned it down some but to be honest the music could still he heard.

I think she got annoyed that I asked her to turn her music down a couple times, so she started partying with my upstairs neighbors, who are some kids that I have also had issues with for noise before (they were high as a kite and WWE wrestling at 3 am on a weeknight and slamming each other into the hardwood floors... but at least they're nice when I ask them to quiet down).

One night they were all gathered on my next-door neighbors front porch (the one directly in front of my bedroom window) and they were all talking loudly and having a good time and playing music.  When it got to like 11:30 PM I literally just opened my bedroom window so I was practically face-to-face with these people and asked them to turn the music off so I could sleep. They went and told my neighbor lady and she stormed out and started yelling and calling me a bitch and crazy and  ""where can she be in her own damn apartment without me complaining"".

c4v2ws	2019-06-24 20:28:10	asannt	AITA for not going to my friends' wedding?	"In 2013, I had two friends, and the three of us always hanged out together.

The girl had been my friend for years, but we got a lot closer then, we went out, had sleepovers and all that. I liked her a lot, we were close.

The guy talked to me and sent messages way more than she did, though. He was quite into me, and if I had given him any signs, he'd probably have tried something. I never wanted anything and he never said anything clearly, although he did ask me once if I thought we could ever be a couple (I said no).

 It was early 2015 when things started to get weird. Suddenly, I wasnt invited to hang out that much anymore, but I saw the two of them together without me. At first, I didnt understand what was happening. Had I done something? Were they deliberately excluding me? 

It took 6 months for them to ask me to hang out with them again, after I mentioned to the girl I felt bad about it. By then, I was sure there was something going on between them, but they denied. 

It took 3 more months for them to finally tell me that they were together. 
After I asked about it a bunch of times, after we went out together.

Now, I wouldnt have cared at all if they needed their dating time, I get it, it's fine. 
But when they told me, after taking so long, I was hurt. We were a trio, they only started hanging out more often bc of me, why couldnt they have told me earlier? Why did they have to exclude me altogether? 

Plus, she was 16 and he was 24. It seemed weird and creepy, but I didnt say anything. It's their life.

After that, we kinda drifted apart. When I was with them it felt like they only invited me to hang out with me for pity. I didnt need that. I still talked to them from time to time, but meh.

In 2017, they sent me, out of the blue, an invitation to their engagement party happening within a month. She came to me, after not talking to me for at least 6 months, and asked me to be her bridesmaid.

I couldnt bring myself to accept it. Although we had been close friends, we werent anymore, we made 0 effort to stay in touch. The whole age thing was still weird to me. They didnt really try to reach out and understand what had happened.

She blocked me without saying anything. 
I didnt go to the party.

After that, I did talk to the guy when he told me how upset she was. I said I was open to talk to her, but she didnt unblock me and didnt try to talk.

Now they're getting married and I wasnt invited. I feel bad bc I know she feels it was all my fault, and maybe it was, I didnt try to say anything or work on it after that happened. But they never tried either, yknow? 

I think I should try and talk to her (she finally unblocked me), at least give her my best wishes or something. 

So, after all this... AITA for not going to their engagement party? For not going after them? For not showing interest after that or trying to make amends and go to the wedding?"	No A-holes here	0	0

I realized it was time to chill while we were ahead so now most of the money is in a relatively low-risk fund.  Like 95% of his money I do not touch now.

However I continue to make risky side plays with some of his money...and they don’t always work out.  This is the part I feel bad about.  The other day I convinced him not to get a bucket of soda at the movies, and told him I’d put that $10 into his investment account instead.  Well, with that $10 I bought a long-shot stock option and at the moment it’s not looking too good.

Part of me feels really guilty and sleazy about this.  The other part says hey, I’ve gotten him an insane return on his money and as far as the $10 goes he would have blown it on junk food anyway.  At least this had a *chance* of paying off.

c4v24t	2019-06-24 20:27:01	andersstone	AITA for confronting, lack of a better word, my classmates because of their Christianity?	" 

Hello,  i'm 14. where i live, Denmark, right now most are going to the priest to prepare  for confirmation. This is basically confirming the decision your parents  made when they had you baptized.

many  of my classmates are being confirmed. It is worth mentioning that with  being confirmed comes a big party. It is also the societal norm to be  confirmed. Therefore there is, in my opinion, a sense of pressure to be  confirmed.

i will not be confirmed.  However i do go to priest. They way it is described to me is not so much  a bible study but more an ethical discussion about life, death etc. I  believe that there is problems with what you have to state when you are  confirmed. Among-st other more complicated and philosophical issues, you  have to state, albeit indirectly, that god created earth. I know that  many of the people who are getting confirmed do not believe this, some  of them have said so.

I think that it  is bad and scary that an institution has so much clout that it can get  people to swear on things they actually don't believe in. Also i enjoy  debating which is why i usually confront (lack of a better word) those  who are to be confirmed.

Usually when it comes up in conversation like ""oh which priest do you have?"" or "" have you bought your suit/dress yet?"" etc.

i  will say something like "" you're being confirmed ?"" to which they  answer ""yes"". I will then follow up with something like "" so do you  believe in god"" To be honest I've never really gotten further than this  as people usually avoid the question or get the message and say  something like"" you can't talk me out of being confirmed.

I've come up with a few arguments for and against me being the asshole so you can sense the debate going on within me:

i am the asshole:

maybe they don't believe in god and shouldn't actually be confirmed. But who are you to tell them how to live their life.

they  didn't ask for this and perhaps they aren't prepared for this debate.  You're the asshole for having a debate they never asked for.

i'm not the asshole:

The point of confirmation is to debate and think about what you believe in. So they should be open to talk about these things.

it  is terrible that a organization has this much clout and you should  confront them because they're are a part of the problem because they  blindly say yes to something just because it is expected and maybe  because they like the idea of having a party and drinking for the first  time ( confirmation symbolizes the jump into adulthood, so many parents  allow they're children to drink for the first time here )

if you've read this whole post i am truly thankful.  Am i the asshole?"	Asshole	0	0
c4v1v5	2019-06-24 20:26:36		AITA for telling neighbor kids to play by their house?	"We live in an apartment complex. Been here for several years, and we are looking to buy a house soon. The noise, lack of privacy, and rude neighbors are getting very, very old. But the KIDS. About 10-15 of them, running, screaming, yelling, leaving trash everywhere, their toys and whatever else strewn all over the sidewalks and breezeway so you can’t walk anywhere without trying not to step on stuff. We cannot sit outside and relax at any point in time because there are kids running and screaming everywhere and all around us. Upstairs neighbor has 2 kids that constantly rub, stomp, jump til 11 pm at night and I am tempted to start recording the noise.

We try to ask or tell the kids to go play by their own houses, because we are trying to relax and talk. We have tried being nice about it, because we know kids will be kids. But we also deserve to have a little peace and not be subjected to constantly screaming and kids that aren’t ours surrounding us. There is zero parental supervision. I don’t even know what kid belongs to what neighbor minus the ones that live right next door, and they are probably the best behaved of all. I have stepkids and i like kids. I just wish other people would actually watch theirs.

The kids are all also obsessed with our 2 cats. There is a family that lives on the opposite end of this section of the complex and they have 4 kids, from about 6 to probably 12. They are constantly right outside our living room window, or at our back patio (which is open—no privacy fence/gate etc). They run through my potted plants and strawberries. They chase my cats and come onto our patio to try to pet them as they’re trying to come back inside. This morning they were chasing one of our cats and cornered him behind the hedge right outside our living room window and I opened the blinds and told them to leave him alone. He came out of hiding and ran inside as soon as they left. 10 minutes later they were surrounding my patio again, trying to get to the other cat. This time, i opened the door and said “guys, PLEASE, go play somewhere else, like your own house” and they all ran off. Or at least I thought. They actually went over to the stairs going up to the storage units, which are about 10 feet from our patio, and just sat there hanging out and watching our apartment for the cats. 

I don’t want to complain. I don’t want to ask parents to have a little control over their kids. I’m starting to feel like a crotchety old man yelling “get off my lawn”. I just want a little peace in our shitty apartment we pay a lot of money for. That we want to move out of so badly but can’t quite yet."	TL;DR	1	0

So I'm pretty sure he's an asshole and an irresponsible dog owner overall, but I want to know if I'm overreacting here:

I thought my friends would keep the secret, but just as all secrets do, it eventually spread around. After a year of secretly crushing on Ryan, word that I liked him finally reached him. He was uncomfortable of course, but willing to talk it out with me.

I told him I didn’t have feelings for him, and that felt guilty because my sexuality made me an easy target for gossip and “I should have seen a rumor like this coming” (truthfully, with the number of people I told about my feelings, and with the number of people at my school who simply love to stir the pot, I knew it would get around to him eventually.) I said that if gossip like this made Ryan uncomfortable, then he and I should probably stop being friends, but that in my opinion our friendship wasn’t worth losing over this “rumor.” Ryan, being the perfect guy that he is, said he didn’t care what people said because he values my friendship and wants to be there for me.

I feel pretty terrible about the whole thing. Ryan was so quick to trust me when I said my feelings were just a rumor. I know I lied to him and betrayed his trust by saying I didn’t have feelings, but in my mind I was just doing what was necessary to keep my friendship with him.

c4uzsx	2019-06-24 20:23:16	l3av3m3al0n3	WIBTA if I cut out my addict brother who only talks to me when he needs money?	" I am 23 and brother is 29. He has been in and out of rehab many times. This last bout has landed him in some legal troubles, and he has no choice but to be sober right now, but I can never be sure when to trust him. 

In the past 6+ months, the only time he has reached out to me has been to ask for money or Uber rides. I will always say yes to Ubers, because I don’t want to leave him stranded (he never pays back). I have been about 50/50 on lending actual money. He has paid me back every time I’ve sent him money, but I’m getting sick of being treated as a bank. I live alone, work a serving job to pay my bills, and simply don’t always have the money to spare. But he always has some big elaborate story or sad excuse that makes me feel obligated to help him out. Every interaction leaves me feeling a mixture of guilt, annoyance, and weakness for just giving him what he wants.

&#x200B;

My siblings and I all have a decent amount of investments we inherited from our father’s passing last year. My brother has withdrawn and spent almost half of his share. He does not have a job or income, so even when he’s sober, he’s just pulling from his share of the inherited stocks to live. Whatever, it’s his choice to use as he pleases. But I’m worried that he will use up all of his and then start guilting me to give him money from mine, because I have hardly touched my share. I want to use it to invest in my future (car, school, house, etc.).

&#x200B;

I have told him before that I can’t afford to keep lending him money, but he always ends up asking again. In the moment, it really wrenches my heart and brings up a lot of difficult emotions, so I usually just send him money and play dumb to the fact that he’s using me. My heart sinks every time I see my brother's name appear on my phone, because I know he doesn't want to chat or see how I'm doing or update me on new life events - our relationship has been purely financial for months now. He always says he will follow up with a phone call so we can catch up, but we rarely actually talk. I honestly don’t really want to talk to him because I’m starting to resent him so much.

&#x200B;

I want to tell him that I am absolutely done speaking to him if he's asking for money. We don't have social interactions in the way that some family members do; It's simply a text or phone call every few weeks with a new story about how he needs money ASAP. He is an adult and should be able to figure out his own budget. He has no excuse to ask me for money when he has fallback finances. I don’t EVER borrow money from my parents or other family members - I work for what I have. Plus, the guilt and sadness that come along with each request are just breaking me.

We’ve known eachother for a long time, like 7 years, have had some pretty rough parts but he’s my best friend and always has been. We broke up a year or two ago to figure things out between us and let eachother grow. This summer we attempted to have a break of not talking at all, but called it quits after 3 weeks. It was clear that after the break we would be getting back together, and I’ve been asking him about it.. he’s said he wants to wait until August when he come out to see me. That he wants it to be special and he wants to look into my eyes and ask. I’ve said I don’t want to wait those two months, we should make it official sooner and he said that’s fine you can ask then! So I’ve been trying to figure out a romantic way to ask him out over the phone or Skype. I want it to be special too! But I don’t want to wait.

c4uvt4	2019-06-24 20:17:04	tuxyasintuxedo	AITA for wanting my boyfriend to support my choice of college?	"Me (19F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been dating for almost two years. There's a four hour drive and a state line between the two of us. BF is currently in college, and has been for the past three years. He's intelligent (think 31 on the ACT). Because of personal/financial circumstances, he wasn't able to attend his #1 college, but still got to choose where to go.

I just graduated high school and am going to a very nice university in my state. It was my first choice. The program I'm going to major in is offered in  ten colleges in my state and only one college in the state BF lives in. The other schools that had the program were farther away, less prestigious, and would have been more expensive for me to attend long-term, despite the price tag of the university ($60k+). This is because I've been offered scholarships & grants that almost cover the full cost of attendance. The employment rate for graduates of the university is about 95% within 1 year after graduation because of its partnerships and reputation. However, there will now be a 8-9 hour trip between us. 

The median annual salary for my career choice is about $140k, with a range of $122k-$160k. The job that he intends to pursue has a median salary of $70k, with a range of $57k-$86k. We have talked about marriage, having children, and buying a house together. He's acknowledged that, with my career choice, I will be the main source of income. My frame of mind is that, because of the partnerships, I will literally be guaranteed a job post-graduation, and therefore will be able to support myself and eventually a family that much sooner. By sacrificing the distance between us now, I will potentially enhance the quality of my future, and our future together if we do get married and have a family.

I have moments where I tell him I wish I could see him more often and that the distance sucks, and his response sometimes (not all the time) is to emphasize that there will be even more distance between us soon because I am choosing to attend this college. I feel that he is being critical, unsupportive, and unfair because he chose where he wanted to go to college without anyone else in mind but himself and that I should get to do the same. He feels that he is being supportive by telling me he is proud of my accomplishments, but that he doesn't have to like my decision because of the distance it will put between us, and makes his dissatisfaction very apparent when he feels the need to do so.

c4uv8e	2019-06-24 20:16:07	klibera6	WIBTA if I emailed the tour company and possibly threw their tour guide under the bus?	"*(Posting from my phone, sorry about the formatting)
I know this is long but I tried to just include what I consider relevant information.

I just recently graduated college and my parents gave me a 15-day trip (around Europe) with a tour company as a graduation present.

When I met up with the group at the first stop, the tour guide (let’s call her Kendall) was incredibly welcoming, really knowledgable, very informative and the group meshed really well right from the start. She mentioned that the way this particular company works is that the trip I’m on is actually two trips combined. After 7 days, some of the group will go home (as they only booked from point A to point B) and some of the group will continue on (they booked from point A to point C). I wasn’t really stressed about it because I figured if this is how the company operates then I’m sure they have a smooth transition in place for the people continuing on to the “second” trip. 
I was very wrong. Ever since we have transitioned to our new tour guide (let’s call him Victor), the trip has really fallen apart. He is incredibly disorganized and doesn’t seem to care about the trip going well for everyone (like Kendall clearly did). It’s been two days with the new guide and we have ~7 left on the trip. 
I’m wondering if I would be TA if I emailed the tour company and explained my disappointment with the new tour guide?
I don’t want to be an asshole, I just want there to be more consistency between tour guides and maybe he needs to go back to training?

c4utf4	2019-06-24 20:13:15		AITA for telling my crush that I don’t like him so I can continue being his friend!	"I am a gay teen who has had a crush on his straight friend (we’ll call him Ryan) for an entire year. When I first started catching feelings for Ryan, I made the mistake of telling all my friends. I thought my friends would keep the secret, but just as all secrets do, it eventually spread around. After a year of secretly crushing on Ryan, word that I liked him finally reached him. He was uncomfortable of course, but willing to talk it out with me.

I told him I didn’t have feelings for him, and that felt guilty because my sexuality made me an easy target for gossip and “I should have seen a rumor like this coming” (truthfully, with the number of people I told about my feelings, and with the number of people at my school who simply love to stir the pot, I knew it would get around to him eventually.) I said that if gossip like this made Ryan uncomfortable, then he and I should probably stop being friends, but that in my opinion our friendship wasn’t worth losing over this “rumor.” Ryan, being the perfect guy that he is, said he didn’t care what people said because he values my friendship and wants to be there for me.

I feel pretty terrible about the whole thing. Ryan was so quick to trust me when I said my feelings were just a rumor. I know I lied to him and betrayed his trust by saying I didn’t have feelings, but in my mind I was just doing what was necessary to keep my friendship with him. I may have romantic feelings for him, but I do love him as a friend first and foremost.

So, Reddit? Am I the asshole? Let me know."		1	0

For about 6 years now, I’ve been expressing my dislike to my mom for playing the piano. It stresses me out now, but I continue for my mom. Every time I say that I don’t want to do it, my mom acts like I am personally attacking her.

I had to play for 2 hours today. Since it’s the summer, my mom and teacher were talking about how I should play even more now. This made me very upset because I’m also taking multiple summer classes and studying for the SAT. It’s not impossible for me to play the piano as well under these conditions, but considering the amount of stress it puts me under, I just don’t want to.

Today, after playing, I asked my mom why my brother doesn’t have to play it. I was mad, so I kept asking her this aggressively and even threw my phone on the floor at one point. My mom began talking about how ungrateful I am. She does everything for me, and she said she asks me to do this one thing for her, but I don’t want to. She told me to never talk to her again.

c4ur0q	2019-06-24 20:09:27		WIBTA if I disowned my brother?	"This has literally just happened today.

Ok, so my mum passed away last year. My younger bro was still living with mum, so obviously he had the house to him and his bf after. It's a 3 bed council house, so they would have to downsize cos of the bedroom tax (London, UK). Dad had agreed to help him pay off the arrears for the tax as he claimed he couldn't afford to pay them.

He knew he would have to move since mum passed. He finally got word of a suitable property in March, we went to view it in early April (i went with him) and he signed the tenancy a week or two later. Since, he has been at the family home waiting for the property to be ready. 


A week ago last Wednesday (2 weeks ago this wednesday) he finally got the keys to the new place.So on the Thursday (day after he gets the keys) hubby goes over and let's me know he hasn't even finished packing. I'm pissed. I go over on the Saturday to help and get roped into more than I should have. I take a break, have a smoke, and chat to some of my friends. I then get shouted at to come back in and help. I go and just hope my dad and bro will get there soon.


I check my phone, and in the group chat, my bro has told EVERYONE ELSE to not bother coming as there is enough people here. They all said fine, so I finished up and left thinking, screw this. 


We then discover that my bro has decided to have an extra week in the home so he can get every thing done in time, as he doesnt think he will have enough time. This means he will have to pay an extra weeks rent, which he says he will do.

The weekend comes and he cancels everyone AGAIN and tells me to not come on the Sunday as he has lunch plans with his bfs mum. I plan to go Monday morning instead.


Hubby goes there this morning. The place is absolutely TRASHED. I mean, rubbish everywhere, filth all over the kitchen, rooms full of rubbish bags, stuff that people wanted collecting just thrown about. Bro then turned up to the home, tells hubby that he is willing to pay the charges for cleanup of the property, hubby had a go at him, chucked the keys at him and left. Hes handed the keys back, with stuff we still want inside but now we cant get to any of it. And some of it is really sentimental.


So I drove over to his new place to talk to him. I was raging but we needed to talk and sort it out. He refused to open the door to me. He messaged me a couple of times saying hes upset and angry because hubby chucked the keys in his face.


I found out from my dad that he had messaged saying that I'm no help when I come over, all I do is smoke and chat with friends and take stuff I want. I have a chronic illness, so I shouldn't have been doing anything.

I tell my family I dont want anything to do with him now. This makes me TA cos he might be upset cos of mums passing, as if it hasn't affected anyone else. He doesnt get what hes done wrong. I just think its soo disrespectful."	Everyone Sucks	1	0
c4uqch	2019-06-24 20:08:24		AITA for wanting to go out with my friend?	"Ok so a little preface. I'm 15 and I'm on summer break. My friend watched all the marvel movies up to endgame and invited me to go with him when he went to see it knowing I'm a huge marvel and superhero junkie and advocates for him to watch them all. I've seen endgame three times now though, once with each parent because they are split up and one with another one of my friends who is also pretty into those movies. 

So now to AITA, when I asked my mom to go she  said she couldn't drop me off for a decent reason. So then I asked my cousin if he could take me and he said yes. So then I was like great I'll just do that, problem solved. Then my mom literally says ""No, You don't have to go everytime."" In reference to me going out to hang out with my friends. So then she says go bond with family even though I have literally been hanging with my cousins all day. So me and her go back and forth not aggressively or disrespectfully at all mind you and she still says no. Then I tell her I'm gonna call Grandma to convince her, because you know grandma's always come in to save the day. She then says she has a meeting as soon as she picks up which makes me wonder how she was texting me for the last 10 minutes. She then threatened to cancel my trip with my friends in August and make me quit my summer job I'm doing to pay off all the gear I need for said trip and my spending money so I then stopped. So I feel like my mom was being absolutely unreasonable and just looking to abuse for power right now and just say no to me because she can, but now I'm wondering if I was TA and if it was reasonable for her to do this and if I went to far and was a petty little shit."		1	0

My father [m66] and I [f24] jointly cared for my grandma [100f] for the last 10-15 or so years of her life, with me taking more responsibility as I grew. 

She entered at-home hospice in late November and we knew the end was close. I had booked a flight with my husband to visit his family overseas during the Christmas holidays and was unsure if I should still go.

I spoke to my grandma, who was still lucid, as well as my father, explaining to both that I thought I’d be more comfortable staying. Both urged me to go on the trip. Mu father intimated that he thought my grandma would prefer me not to be around for the worst of her death.

My husband encouraged me to do whatever was best for myself and my family.

Ultimately I chose to go on the trip. It felt terrible to be away from my family but I was doing my best to respect what I believed my grandmas wishes were. She passed peacefully on the 26th of December last year.

c4upju	2019-06-24 20:07:09	InfinityR319	"AITA for raising the red flags for a sketchy ""job offer""?"	"So to begin with the story, here's the context: 

&#x200B;

I am a recent graphic design graduate that had been relocated to Portland, OR for a month. I am currentlyliving with my aunt while trying to find a job here. I have sent multiple job applications here and there, but what I got back are either irrelevant (real estate sales agents, commission based insurance salesperson etc.) or just outright scams. So I am excited to heard back from the company that I have applied to over on LinkedIn. 

&#x200B;

The company in question is a prominent nationwide construction company, and they have a UI/UX opening posted. When  I received the job offer email, I was excited, thinking that the search is finally over. However, upon second inspection, I noticed that there are something off. (Details here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c4fv94/a\_legit\_job\_offeror\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c4fv94/a_legit_job_offeror_not/); TL;DR: The email is coming from a Gmail address \[for a nationwide construction company!\] and they are asking for a Google Hangouts chat interview) Having read articles in the past about job scams, my alarm is ringing like crazy at this point. So I decided to forward the email to my aunt, but she said there's nothing wrong about the supposed ""job interview"", and instead called me out for being stubborn to forfeit the ""opportunity"". So in order to find proof, I decided to do some detective work on my own and call the company in question as well (and recorded the conversation for good measure) as forwarding the email to my college's career adviser. The HR lady of the company indeed confirmed my suspicion as she told me that they have never posted a UI/UX opening and it was a scammer impersonating them. My college advisor also noticed the discrepancy and advised me not to go forward with the ""interview"". So I decided to forward it to my aunt, and you think she would accept my argument, right? 

&#x200B;

WRONG. She still isn't convinced, and she even rebuked to me by saying ""what did it waste? 2 minutes? I don't need proof (that it's a scam)"". At this point she feels like I am really pushing her button and she's ""90% done with me"", but in reality I have been finding jobs here and there to no avail. Now I can't risk to burn my only bridge here in the US, as I came here on my student Visa and currently pending my OPT. So my question to all of you is, am I the asshole for standing up to my uneasy feelings about a potential trap? Or am I being rebellious to defy my aunt?

TL;DR: I tried to ask my aunt about a sketchy interview offer, she insisted me to push forward despite my uneasy feelings and evidences."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My (late 20s F) friend (late 20s F) and I were excited when she started dating someone new who she was serious about so we could finally go on double dates and do couple things together with our boyfriends. 

Before I met him she told me a bit about him and he didn’t exactly sound like my kind of person but he also sounded super into her and at the same place in life as her and she was excited so I was too. 

Then I met him and didn’t love him but didn’t hate him. I have spent time with him since and he is fairly quiet but when he does talk he says little things that make it sound like he thinks he is better than everyone else and everyone else is always wrong. 

The more she tells me about him one on one, the less I like him. We are just completely different people with different values and life experiences. I also don’t love the way he seems to interact with her family. She is close with her family but all families have their issues and I think he seems to lean into their issues because he is not close with his family and would be fine not seeing them ever. 

I would never tell her not to be with him. He may be a good partner for her. That’s not what I’m getting at. I just don’t want to spend time with him. My boyfriend has met him a couple times and doesn’t really like him either. I asked him and he said it’s not because I don’t like the guy, his reasons are different than mine. 

They will be living together soon and I’m happy for her. But I want to avoid spending a bunch of time with him as life is too short to spend time with people you don’t like. (Already aware you have to work with people you don’t like).

When we would hangout he was always there which was 99% of the time. Well I moved to another state 2.5 hours away. She even came over for a weekend at my place and brought him. She came to my graduation (with her bf of course) and I planned on going to hers a year later. Well I ended up getting super sick from my other best friends graduation and helping her move in the rain plus being broke so I couldn’t travel the 2.5 hours plus it was on a Sunday afternoon and I had work the next morning.

My brother and I have never had a very close relationship. We have the same mom, but different dads. My brother has always lived with his dad in a different state and I grew up living with my mom (my parents divorced when I was young). So my mother passed away in 2011 from cancer, my brother made it in time, to say goodbye and stayed for the funeral. 

So in 2018, I had been trying to get ahold of my brother for a few months. He has always been really hard to get ahold of  always changing phone numbers and not giving me the number, changing FB accounts. I had my suspicions he was using drugs, but could never get a confirmation. After much FB stalking I found a friend of his and she told me he is in rehab. I got his dads number and contacted my brother. He was in the end of the program and was about to get out. Well I offered him to come live with me to get him back in his feet. He agreed that would be best. 

He gets here and i get him a job with one of my friends doing remodels. He doesnt have a car so my friend is letting him take his service vehicle, and i told him if he saves his money for a car he doesnt have to pay any bills. Well a few months pass and  he talks about wanting a beer, which being sober means being clean of all mind altering substances. He doesnt want to attend any meetings or programs. I work a lot of hours on an ambulance so I cannot be around all the time stop things from happening. so eventually he gets his beer and says he’s a man and needs to have a beer after a long work week. Well that beer after a long work week has turned into getting trashed every weekend.  He just broke his hand and can no longer work because he was mad when he was drunk and punched a fence. He has established his own group of friends out here so I dont know what other things he may be doing. He is 30yrs old and I cant act like his mom.

c4uln4	2019-06-24 20:01:01	JuanMulaney	AITA for hating my brother	"Ever since middle school, my older brother has been, in my opinion, abusive towards my family. He used to physically assault my parents, especially my mom and having screaming matches with them. I'm five years younger than him so I was forced to deal with living in an explosive environment at a young age and simultaneously looking after my younger brother who is five years younger than me. He was diagnosed with depression a few years back and he says that his most recent medication has been helping him but he's still a huge asshole and takes advantage of my parents ie, stealing money from them and telling us to constantly shut up, cursing and screaming at my parents, mind you he's in his early 20s now and still acts this way while living at home, rent free and everything paid for him.

My most recent gripe with him is his trip to Canada. My parents paid for a trip to Canada for him and he rented an Air BNB for $1200 because he told the girl he was seeing there that his family had money. He did this to impress her knowing full well we don't have money to just throw away like that. The whole trip he was snide and disrespectful when my mom would call him and he spent (my parent's) money that he didn't have on this girl to impress her. When my parents told him, you're about to reach your limit and we won't be able to send you more money, be careful, he spent the money on clothes that he *offered* to buy her and her friends. My parents were able to send more money but they told him that he needed to get on the flight they had booked him and get home because he had *nothing left.*He thought, meh my flight is in four hours, I want to eat, I'm going to the mall for two hours. Let me make it clear that if he hadn't made that flight, he would have been spending the night on the airport floor with no money for food or anything. And he couldn't give a shit because he wanted to hang out at the mall. When my mom called him, and said what the hell are you *doing*, he had nothing to do but give her attitude, curse at her, and hang up the phone; a regular occurrence for him really. Oh and he's visiting again, right now, this time a different girl.

My mom and I fight sometimes because I no longer have any empathy for him and I actually hold him accountable for his actions instead of blaming it on his depression and saying that ""it's not the real him."" I guess out of ignorant hope, they think my ""real"" brother is caring and selfless? My mom yelled at me to stay out of it because she doesn't want what he does to affect my relationship with him, but how could it not? She gets mad at me because she wants me to take pity on him but I don't.

c4ullw	2019-06-24 20:00:57	Bathroomfixpls	WIBTA if I didn't pay the handyman?	"I own a home that was completely renovated a year ago, most of the work having been done by my parents' friend and handyman who has worked on all of their properties. 

He is a known ""jack of all trades and master of none""type, and due either to his skill level or his level of care, I've had to have some of his work fixed afterwards, or completely redone at my own cost, and after the renovations, I don't plan on using him in the future.

Before I moved in, he mentioned to my parents he was missing a part for the upstairs shower, and would have to fix it when he got the part.

Now a year later, the shower started to leak and remembering what he said, I gave him a call, mentioned the issue might have to do with that part he talked about, and asked if he could come fix it.

He came by the next day while I was at work and my boyfriend was watching the house. While there, he fixed the issue and even said to my boyfriend that he was supposed to make this fix a long time ago.

The next day my mother texts me saying he left the bill with them, and I should come by to pick it up.

At first I was just annoyed that he left the bill with my parents. I know they're friends, but I was the one who called him to come out, and I own the home, it just seemed disrespectful. 

I still planned on paying the bill however, until I let my boyfriend know what happened. He told me he didn't think I should be charged at all, seeing as the issue was relating to something the handyman had freely admitted he should have done a long time ago. 

He also pointed out that he probably gave the bill to my parents seeing as the rapport he's built with them will probably mean they'll try to convince me to pay the bill, or if I refuse, will cover it for him anyway, which I think is a very likely explanation."	Not enough info	0	0
c4ulkq	2019-06-24 20:00:55	280454	AITA for causing a scene at the zoo?	"At the weekend me and my SO visited a local animal park, which costs a fair amount to visit since the ticket price funds the conservation efforts. A safari experience is included in the ticket price - this is the main attraction, and what the whole park is geared towards.

My SO and I waited in the queue (in very hot weather) for atleast twenty minutes, then finally we got to the front of the queue. I expected to board the vehicle like everyone else infront, however we were stopped by a man who demanded to see a receipt for our tickets.

I replied that we didn’t have the receipt anymore and he responded that we couldn’t go on the safari without the receipt, even though everyone else had boarded without a receipt. Apparently there was an event elsewhere at the park that was free to attend so he needed to check we were paying visitors.

I asked repeated what I could do to fix the situation and he just looked at me, not responding and just looking generally rude and defiant. Me and my SO got pretty annoyed considering how much we had paid for our tickets and the fact this was our only day out in the past couple of months. My SO got pretty angry and asked him why we would have waited in this long queue if we were just chancing a free ride - visitors to this other event could still wander the park and see the animals for free anyway. To me, it seems like poor organisation on the park’s behalf.

Eventually I found the receipt right at the bottom of one of my bags (I assumed I had thrown it away like I usually would) and this man let us on the vehicle without even reading the receipt.

I have phoned up the park today to complain about our treatment and they have said they will look into it. I wouldn’t have minded if everyone had their receipt checked, or if I was told at the ticket office to hold onto my receipt, but I had no reason to believe I would need the small little card receipt.

AITA here? I don’t want to get this man in trouble but he belittled two young people infront of a whole crowd and enforced a rule he had clearly made up. I feel like I may be TA because I did eventually find the receipt and it was a hot day so he might have just taken it out on us.

c4uk33	2019-06-24 19:58:39	thedepressedbadger	AITA for what I say	"My husbands family has always had a problem with me and over the years it has just gotten worse to the point that if I even want to talk to my husbands father I have to go through someone else even if we are both in the same room right next to each other. 

My husband and I have been together 6 years. When we got or first apartment together his parents gave us bunk beds that they had to put in the second bedroom for guests, since then we have moved into a house and had two kids. Which they only see 4-5 times a year (that’s a generous number) even though we live about a two hour drive. 

Anyway they only come out to our house about 2-3 times a year, one of those times being for my husbands birthday which is in February. They have not been here since or seen their grandkids since. The bunk beds they gave us were in the toy/craft room and to make more space I decided to take the bunk beds out and move the recliner from our nursery into the toy room.  

The weekend before I disassembled the bunk beds (3 weeks ago) I told my husband to inform them that they were more than welcome to come to our house and pick them up if they wanted them, and if not I was going to give them away either on let go or offer up or just for free to a friend who is looking into getting her own place. They said no they have plans (despite his mother being on a 10 day vacation and us knowing they have no plans). We invited them to come the day before Father’s Day. The day we had invited them to come, which they said no to, they call and say they would like to come the next day (Father’s Day) to which I said no we have plans I invited you for today and you said no (aita for that also?). I said come next Saturday since we already have plans for tomorrow, to which they said no and made a remark about how they dont like coming to our house because it’s like going to a hotel (I get anxiety about people in my house and always request from ANYONE that I get at least 3-5 days notice although I prefer a weeks notice). They said no they have plans. 

My husband was talking to them on Saturday (the second Saturday they claimed to have plans) and they told him they were just generally doing nothing even though they claimed to have plans that made them too busy to come over. So now I have informed my husband to tell them that if they dont pick up the bunk beds by next weekend I’m getting rid of them because they take up so much room we can hardly park our cars in the garage. His parents got super pissed and said fine he will come pick them up and leave without spending time with his son or grandkids. AITA for threatening to get rid of the bunk beds they gave us?"

c4ujuf	2019-06-24 19:58:17	TattoosForDays	AITA for regularly reporting a colleague and getting her fired?	"Using a throwaway and going to try to keep this short with minimal details so it's not too obvious.



I'm a nurse and work in a community setting. I have 5 colleagues I work with in a day. We start our days all assigned an even amount of patients, usually around 8-10 each, that we visit in their homes / school / retirement homes, etc. Throughout the day new referrals, orders, and resumes come through so we take turns picking up patients. I've got the most seniority and have been working here for 5 years.



A year ago I trained a new nurse, Kyla. She was great at the beginning, however me and a few colleagues noticed she has some lazy habits. She lives ~20 minutes outside of town and would often refuse to pick up extra visits after she's home and finished her day by 2pm. This resulted in myself and others regularly picking up her slack and feeling like we pull all the weight. Our hours are 0830-1630 (4:30) so she absolutely needs to be available until then. She just always says it makes more sense for someone else to see the pt rather than her drive back into town.




I talked to my manager and she agreed this isn't how it should be done - she talked to Kyla more times than I can count. Also addressed it during our monthly meeting and called out ""lazy nurses"" stating how unacceptable this practice was, focusing the comment towards Kyla. It kept happening. So - every time she'd head home for the day and a patient needed picked up but she didn't offer I'd immediately report it to management. 



She'd always reach out and see if anyone needed a hand before she left for home which was nice, but the problem was she was somehow always the first done. Home by 1 or 2pm most days. Then a patient needs seen around 3 or 4 and she wouldn't offer to pick up. So same thing - myself and 1 or 2 other nurses are stuck carrying the majority of the weight. After reporting it several times and nothing happening, I went to my manager's boss in corporate (who was my old manager and who thinks very highly of me). She ended up firing Kyla over it. 





On the one hand I feel guilty - I wasn't expecting her to get fired, just reprimanded. I wanted her to carry her own weight. On the other hand she had more than a fair amount of chances. AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4ujt4	2019-06-24 19:58:13	bonny_the_bear	WIBTA for making my housemate pay for wifi?	"Ok, so a few of my friends and I are renting an off-campus house for the coming school year. Since the lease started in June, I decided to take advantage of the fact and take some summer courses at my university while living at my house. My three other housemates won't be moving in until the fall semester begins, so late August to early September.

&#x200B;

The way the wifi works is we have a joint account with the people living above us (it's a two-story). The cost is fixed every month, it doesn't change depending on how much is used, and it's split between everyone in the house. The trouble is, my one friend Jack (fake name obvs) doesn't want to pay for the wifi for the months of June through August. His argument is that since he's not at the house using it, he shouldn't have to pay for it. Everyone else in the house (at least, those who have given their input, which is most) is ok with splitting the wifi between all of us, regardless of whether or not we're living at the house.

&#x200B;

So my question is: should Jack have to pay for the wifi even though he won't be using it? Or AITA for wanting him to pay?"	Asshole	0	0

c4uj3w	2019-06-24 19:57:10		AITA for telling my parents about my brothers vaping incidents	"Background: Me and my brother are the same age and are in highschool right now. Our friend groups overlap quite a bit. The people who hang out with my brother aren't junkies, but partake in casual vaping/weed/drinking like a good portion of teenagers in our area. 

So my brother was pressured into trying a vape at school, but he didn't make it a habit and it was a one time thing. He didn't touch any drugs until recently. He tried vaping again of one of his friends but still did not make it a habit. There was a year/1.5 year gap between his two ""experiments"". When Avengers: Endgame came out, all the teenagers flocked to the movie theater in large packs to see the movie. Me and my brother went with a largeish group and enjoyed the movie. After the movie my brother looked a bit off and I asked him about it. He said it was nothing and I just shrugged it off. A week later my mom is going through his phone and finds some questionable messages. They went something like this

Brother: ""I like meth""

Friend:""wut u high""

Brother:""ye""

My parents see this and flip out. They ask me if I knew anything about this. I said he doesn't do meth for sure that was just a joke. However this text clicked something in my brain. My thought process was something like ""Wait omg he looked high at the movie. He has been acting differently. He took a bathroom break during the movie with all the smokers in the group. He's doing weed"" I then call all his friends and ask ""Is my brother doing weed"". They all said he did, but his eyes are naturally red so it is a running joke that he is the king stoner. I didn't pick up on that when they said he was smoking weed so I went ahead and told my parents about his vaping and weed and stuff. My parents flipped out. They took his phone. He can't go out during the summer and is confined to the house. They even picked him up from school when they thought he might be vaping during certain periods(1-2 periods a day out of 4 periods). He even got a therapist to help with his ""addiction"". Later I found out that my brother is innocent and only hit a vape twice and is not addicted. He does not do any other drugs according to his friends when I asked them for serious answers. So in conclusion he is suffering because he hit a vape twice in 2 years.

And recently the spam telemarketers have gotten really bad.  Hanging up on them quickly does nothing.  It’s part of the cost to them. They expect it. 

So I upped my game. I keep them on the phone a while when I have time. Waste their time so the cannot waste others time.  My favourite was a few years ago when I had friends over playing cards. That guy was on the line for 10 mins and even called back when we got “disconnected”. 

But now I’m getting a call for “Duct cleaning” several times a week. I hang up. I try wasting their time. They give zero shits. And if you haven’t seen it, the duct cleaning companies that advertise this way are 100% scams.  Videos of them randomly blowing air in the house to make it sound like work but it isn’t. 

So I’m considering asking them to show up somewhere just to up the “wasting their time” ante. I don’t feel bad about wasting the “workers” time - they are in in the scam.

c4ubvl	2019-06-24 19:45:21		AITA for telling my mother to stop cleaning when there's no need to?	"First of all, sorry for my English.

My mother doesn't work and she's the one to keep the house clean, doing all of the house chores while the rest of the family isn't at home.

She also doesn't like if anyone tries to help saying that they're doing a poor job and she would have done it better. I've often found that if I do something to help she'll then do it again as soon as I can't see (for example she cleans the same thing that I cleaned a second time) making me feel like it's useless to even try.

The problem with this is that I'm also starting to feel like she's really overdoing her ""job"", cleaning even when there's no need to, just to then complain about the fact that she's always cleaning for us and that we never help.

Today my brother left the bathroom and my mother went in after him to brush her teeth and immediately started to wipe the water that was on the sink, complaing that we never do it and always leave it to her.

First of all, I don't feel that it's true. I know how much it bothers her to see wet and I always make sure that there's no water after I use the sink, it may just happen sometimes that I forget about it and then I apologize and offer to wipe the water off myself, but my mother still gets angry.

Second, I still think that it's dumb to wipe the water away after using the sink. I've never seen any other family do it. My mother has a lot of other things that she can't suffer and all of the people that I spoke to about this just find it extremely weird, as most of these ""taboos"" are absolutely normal things to do at home (like sitting on a bed).

Going back to the sink: as she was complaining I just told her that she was right, my brother could have cleaned up, but I didn't get why she was wiping the water off the sink as she was going to use it immediately after, getting water on it (to then wipe the water off in like... 2 minutes or so).

My mother got really angry saying again that ""we"" never clean and that she was tired of doing it for us and that my argument was just dumb as I was ""saying that it's right to use something and then not clean as someone will use it at some point later"". Which was not what I had said at all.

I had just told her that it was useless to get the water off, then use the sink and get water on it again immediately after to then just clean it up again. Just... don't wipe the water away, use it and then wipe once and for all. My father came to my mother's rescue saying that I was dumb for saying it, I should ""just be grateful that my mother was cleaning our mess"", and he again told me ""oh so you would at lunch use a plate, eat on it and then not clean it just because you'd be having dinner later?"".

But it's, again, not was I was saying. My parents both got mad at me for trying to explain my point, then I got tired of it and just told them they were right and minded my own business. So, AITA?"		1	0

It’s never been an issue before but when I was on my break this weekend, it was fairly busy. Not “impossible to get a seat busy” but busy enough. I found a seat in a corner and sat there on my phone with some water and snacks for a while.

Now I’m curious. AITA for doing this? It’s a food court, not a single restaurant or sit down restaurant. I’ve done this before and never got this reaction so I didn’t think anything’s wrong with doing this. I also don’t know where I’m supposed to go eat and sit otherwise..."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I work for a very large retailer in the UK that has a reputation for being very “by the book”. 
I work part time and quite regularly work with a certain group of co workers (who we’ll call group X). Group X is very cliquey and tends to demonise/ostracise anyone they dislike and thus attempts to pressure them into leaving. If this is unsuccessful they try to dig up dirt on the individual in an attempt to get them fired. 
I get on quite well with Group X, I don’t get involved in the bullying etc I just stay neutral as it’s not my business. However working with this group of people is making my work life a bit miserable because of the constant stream of vitriol that comes from them. When I work with Group Y (which is about 1 shift a week) life’s a dream, everything goes smoothly and everyone is lovely.

So the other day my friend had a $20 in his pocket when we went out for lunch and by the time we were done eating he realized it wasn't in his pocket anymore.

The next day I open my passenger side door and there's a $20 sitting in open sight next to the seat. 

Now, I treat my friends a lot, often get them lunch (sometimes they'll just order with me and assume I'll pay) and buy them things under the idea that they'll pay me back (their words). Nearly every time I get them something I never get any money back. I recently got concert tickets for us so we'd all sit together and they assured me they'd pay me back.

They found her passed out at the table. That time I wasn't around for it but it was heard through the grape vine. 


She also comes in super early and leaves super early. She was told her hours are 9-5 but she heard it as 'well if I work 8 hours who cares' and continues to come in 7-3. I tell her manager about it as well and she got disciplined for it as well.


She spends a lot of time on Facebook and YouTube. I can see her screen by turning like side ways and she's always just glued to some video she's watching. So yet again I let her manager know. 


I'm like... This is so not my personality to tell on people!! But here I am telling on her and I feel kind of bad. But at the same time if she ever wants to be a professional this needs to stop."		1	0

We first took a video of me (M14) “using” the USB stick as if it was a vape. With a little editing and some quick music changes, it was seamless.
I sent the video out into a group chat full of girls, who we know very well from school
2 out of the three girls were skeptical about if we were lying or not, but the last girl got extremely mad. She sounded completely worried, and constantly criticized on how stupid we were being.
Me and “Tom” explained the joke to them, and girls 1 and 2 were still laughing. Girl 3, on the other hand, was still mad at us over it
We feel like it was a pretty harmless joke that got carried a little too far. Are we assholes?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4u746	2019-06-24 19:37:37	EmBran84	AITA if I am mad at my sister for not coming to my wedding?	"This all stems back to when I had first gotten engaged 1.5 years ago. My Fiancé and I had tossed around the idea having a destination wedding but were not sure yet. 
Even though we had not made a Decision of where to have the wedding I went ahead and asked my sister to be a bridesmaid officially. Her automatic response was yes of course, I proceeded to tell her to think about it because we might be doing a destination wedding and I know it’s a lot of money she might not have. She replied that she would go no matter what.

Cut to a year later, date has been picked, venue is now booked. We decided to have the destination wedding instead of staying home and having a big fancy one. I ask my sister again if she’s okay with it but this time she says she won’t do it u less we have a local wedding. I was hurt obviously and annoyed she didn’t tell me that before. Her reasons were that she couldn’t afford it with student debt and her SO didn’t have a job. I though “that’s pretty fair and reasonable”. 

We then decided that we could definantly help her out if we drove to the destination and booked an air bnb for us all to stay in. That way it doesn’t cost her anything, she replied no to this as well stating she did not want to go while her SO was in school. I then found out from my mom that she had offered to pay for everything for her as well.

At this point I ask her “what’s going on it’s clearly not about the money, do you not agree with who I’m deciding to marry?” She responds that she does have money, it’s true. Now her SO and her are also planning a trip for the long weekend as a get away with me and my fiancé.

Which brings us to today, her current excuse is that she does not want to travel, does not have any vacation days and is stressed out that she will be studying for her LSATs. On top of that, without telling me prior, she said the reason for planning the long weekend getaway was to make up for the fact that she’s missing my wedding. She says “well if it’s so important that I go, You shouldn’t have booked something so far away.”

Not sure if I am being reasonable about being upset at her. My fiancé is definitely pissed."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4u56d	2019-06-24 19:34:26	twothousanddollarrr	AITA for revealing a price of a pricey coffee table in front of an acquaintance??	"Hi,

&#x200B;

So my husband(30M) and I(27F) had a little drama yesterday.

&#x200B;

We just moved, so we've been purchasing new furniture for the new place.

&#x200B;

He's also considering buying a new coffee table, and I didn't know which one until yesterday.

&#x200B;

All I knew was that he's very obsessed with this one particular design, that's pretty pricey.

&#x200B;

Yesterday, we were having coffee with one of our mutual friends, and my husband started talking about the coffee table he's obsessed with.

&#x200B;

And he opened a website and showed an image gallery of this particular table on his phone, which looked really nice. He showed me those pictures before, but I never saw a price.

&#x200B;

So, I closed the gallery to see the price – out of curiosity. And it was over $2,000.

&#x200B;

I blurted out, ""Is it $2,000??"" and he seemed a bit uncomfortable for a second, and said ""No, I'm gonna get a similar one from somewhere else cheaper"".

&#x200B;

When we parted our ways from the mutual friend, he got upset and raised his voice and said ""How could you be so oblivious in such a social situation, were you trying to make me look like a pretentious pr\*ck who buys $2,000 dollar worth of coffee table???""

&#x200B;

As much as I'd admit that sometimes I have a hard time reading social cues, I didn't think it was my bad this time around. I felt like he was trying to mislead me into something that I didn't do.

&#x200B;

Or maybe it was. IDK!

"So this really started during the lead up to the Brexit referendum, I found my mum's brother was posting intentionally inflammatory racist and xenophobic content on Facebook and called him out for sounding ""like school yard bully"". Apparently my mum knew that her brother has always been racist but I had no idea, although it makes a lot of sense when I think back. Him and his wife then attacked me and my mum on Facebook, that's when I deleted Facebook because I just couldn't be bothered with it anymore.
Honestly it was really easy for me to cut out these members of my family because they had been awful to my mum my whole life. They still treat my mum like rubbish and I don't know why she let's them get away with it!
So since then I have completely ignored this part of the family, they haven't been invited to my wedding or baby shower. Good riddance to bad rubbish. 
People have told me it's stupid to cut out family for these reasons, but I think it's stupid to keep people in your life who do nothing but make you and the people you care about miserable.

c4u3ab	2019-06-24 19:31:30		AITA for resenting my father?	"Dear Reddit,

For some context, I am a fifteen year old girl who lives with her father and her brother. When my parents still lived together, maybe 4 years ago, my mother drank her way through most of their shared savings, and left my father in debt when moving my brother and I out into a new house. A few months ago, my mother died after a battle with cancer caused by alcoholism. Now, my father is very financially stable: we take lots of vacations, his job pays very well, and he's almost clear of the debt my mother gave him. We just adopted another dog, and he's clear about the fact that he's doing very well. When my mother died, her job provided him with a fairly large amount of life insurance and money from her pension. My mother was very reluctant to sign these papers over to him as she was dying, because she didn't want him to have that money, she wanted it to go to my brother and I. My father plans to work on paying off the mortgage and the remaining debt my mother gave him with this money, instead of it going to my brother and I. In the limited discussion we've had about this, my father told me that once he had paid off the mortgage, he would be in a better position to give us financial help for college. He also talked about how it would go to paying off our house, despite me making it very clear to him that I do not plan to live with him at all during my education, if possible. My brother and I don't have a lot in our college savings, so he says that once he pays off the mortgage, he'll start contributing more. I've done the math based on the information that I have, and it is highly unlikely, based on his current spending that he'll be able to pay off the mortgage before I turn eighteen. Whatever he can contribute towards my education will not be at all comparable to what I could have had if the money had gone straight to my savings. This also means that my brother will receive a lot more help from him because he'll have a lot more time for my father to contribute. My father and I have also had issues in the past with me wanting to go away for college and living without him, and I wonder if a part of this is him wanting me to be financially dependant on him. Am I the asshole for being upset that I'm not getting my mom's money?

TL;DR -- My father is using the money my mother planned to leave to me to pay off his mortgage."		1	0
c4u2vm	2019-06-24 19:30:48	VintageNectarine	AITA for breaking up with my ex-boyfriend and being upset that my family keeps in contact with him?	"Basically, I was in an LDR for 2 years. I am 20 years old and my ex-boyfriend is 21. We had been having issues for months due to falling out of feelings on my side, and I broke it off with him. My family absolutely loves/loved him. He is extremely respectful, kind, and an easy going guy; although we had a great, healthy relationship, he just wasn't the right guy for me!

I told my parents I broke up with him and they were immediately distraught. My mom began texting my friends behind my back, accusing/asking me of cheating on my boyfriend or lying about the reason for our breakup, because my explanation that ""I lost feelings"" didn't seem right since we looked so happy. The truth is I was extremely private with my relationship to avoid anyone forming negative feelings if we had issues. My parents didn't comfort me at all, instead, they would ask if there was still hope, we should get back together, and if he could still come on trips with our family. When I would tell them no, they would keep telling me how sad they were, to the point my mom was sobbing at work about our breakup and had to go home early.

My parents would call and text him, comforting him after the breakup. Not only this, they texted my friend behind my back asking, ""Hey \_\_\_\_, please don't tell VintageNectarine about this. Do you think she would be upset if we invited \_\_\_\_\_ to Mammoth in August with our family since she won't be going? We told her uncles that he would come with us instead of her."" I was absolutely upset that they tried to invite him on a family vacation behind my back.

I told my mom how upset I was that they are overly invested in keeping a relationship with him, to the point it feels they're disrespecting my feelings and just me as a daughter. Not only that, but how could he move on if he is constantly in contact with his ex's parents? My mom blew up and basically said I was selfish, cold-hearted, and that just because I cut him out of my life doesn't mean they should have to. She also said to never bring anyone home ever again and I am no longer allowed to date until I move out, or hang out with guys. She also said I was cold-hearted for blocking my ex on social media, even though I told her the reason I blocked him was that he was bitterly subtweeting me and publically talking to his ex-hookups, and that I didn't want to see any of those things. She replied that I was still cold-hearted and that is just how he is moving on.

I just feel like I want some respect for my decisions and that they care more about my ex than me. However, It's obvious they're really upset with me and I just want to know if I'm being an asshole without seeing it. Thanks.

Now, my dad had proposed that we met sometime today or that I went to eat with him and his girlfriend.

I usually don't check on my phone as I have it in silent the whole time, let alone when the deadline for my project is tomorrow, I'm just focused on getting it done - been skipping meals over this-.

Now, my dad calls at 18:00 and I check my phone half an hour later, and tell him that if I finish in time I'll go there. As it turns out, I ended up staying till 22:00 and I still am not done. At 21:45 I check my phone to see 5 missed phone calls from dad, two of my roommates and one from the residence I'm staying in. I never called back so dad thought something had happened to me and told everyone. I also had a message from him, 'I'm waiting for you outside.'

I half-assed the rest of the things I had to do and found him and his girlfriend waiting in their car.

I understand I am in the wrong, but I don't like being yelled at till I cry, nor being told I'm a bad person and I don't appreciate anything and I'm ungrateful and a bad person. I apologized, I did, and after that he drove me back to the residence and told me I was going out to eat with them.

In March, my bf of 3 years broke up with me. Then, two weeks later he asked me to take him back, I said no. Since then he has been publicly talking about it on his twitter, and yes I know this because I’m stupid and looked at his twitter. Anyway, it kind of flip flops between him lamenting the fact that he made a mistake, and then getting all down and depressed and saying that I don’t care about him, and acting as is I am the bad guy. Well the other week, I saw one of his tweets and just decided that this had to stop. We have mutual friends who follow both of us, and it was really getting on my nerves that he was acting like the victim in this whole thing. So I called him out, and I said that I get venting but you don’t get to say untruthful stuff and act as if you didn’t do this to yourself.

Because we have mutual friends, I thought I would put my side of things on my public twitter, which up until this point I really hadn’t besides saying I was single (back in March). I tried to stay fair and acknowledge that no one HAS to date me or stay with me, but he *was* the one who broke up with me, so he isn’t a victim in this. I also talked about how some of his last tweets reflected poorly on me for moving on and that because I was trying to heal and take steps to better myself, that doesn’t mean I don’t still care about him.
 
Anyway, for my own mental health I decided to block him so he couldn’t see my tweets and it would be more difficult for me to see his.

Well, he found out within like 5 minutes and texted me and saying he was sorry for all the stuff he said and that it really wasn’t fair of him to say those things when it was his mistake...

And this is where I get to the WIBTA part.
He asked that I stop tweeting about our past relationship because it was making him look like a bad guy.

Well, 1) I only wrote the thread to defend myself.  2) i really, really tried to keep it to the truth. I know that I will always have a bias, but I wrote stuff that even he admitted to... 3) he’s had since March to vent as much as he likes, and I get to do it one time and that’s it?

c4u10z	2019-06-24 19:27:50	Dragonios	AITA for not letting him use my tv?	"**Super Edit**: heya, the issue has been resolved! Thanks to the advice of u/labanlieue I talked to both of my parents, and asked for their side of the story again. Turns out my dad was just a little disappointed because he thought I just sent him out of my room, I told him my side, and he understood. As for my mom, she was concerned I had really hurt my dad’s feelings, and that’s why she got mad (which I find a reasonable reaction). But anyways, thanks for informing me about the situation I was in y’all! I’ve decided we were all being a bit of an asshole, but were able to resolve it in a civilized matter! Have a great day everyone! :D



So a bit of backstory, i’m a 16y old and just recently passed my exams (hell yeaaah) and because I passed I got a 4K HD tv from my parents. I have also been working at my job quite a lot recently, so the only time I have off is in the evening (only Monday till Thursday). I usually play some games with friends on my PS4 and that’s exactly what I did tonight.

**Edit**: The tv is in my room, we have multiple tv’s spread across the house and he wanted to use mine for a test about some extra channels to watch.

So, to my story then,

So, this evening I was playing Division 2 (for those that don’t know, it’s a game you **cannot** pause) and was having a fun time. 
My dad comes to my room and asks if he can use the tv for a test which he drove 30km for, I tell him he can’t right now since I’m playing division with friends, and that I’ll finish the mission I’m doing as quick as possible, he persists he gets to use it, but eventually gives up and tells me I have 30 minutes. 

So, to pass time, he takes a shower, to which my mom comes up the stairs and tells me I hurt my dads feelings, I ask what I did wrong and she says I denied him access to the tv... and I’m just looking at her like... *what. the. fuck*. 
She even said that she would have taken away my tv, because I wouldn’t stop the damn game, I tell her it can’t be paused so if I stopped, I would have to do everything again. She... didn’t really care and persists on the idea that I broke my dad’s heart because he had to wait to use the tv, I get upset with her and turn off the game, my friends confused af, sending me texts to ask what’s up, and my mom still has a very displeased look on her face.

My dad comes out of the shower and there’s... no problem at all, he’s happy he get’s to test some stuff with the tv and goes on about his day, nothing seems wrong but my mom is still pissed.

So even though this has a... ‘*happy*’ ending to it, my question is, am I the asshole for not letting my dad use the tv? Or is my mom overreacting?"	Not enough info	0	0
c4u0qa	2019-06-24 19:27:25	marxistpoodle	AITA for asking my neighbor to rename their dog?	"Posting this for my mom:

My family and I got our dog, Daisy, four years ago. We have the biggest yard in the neighborhood, so we invite our neighbors and their dogs over very often. It gives our dogs good exercise, and the adults have fun hanging out together. 

Three weeks ago, a young couple moved in across the street from us. Just before moving, they got a puppy, who is also named Daisy. I’m not too surprised, given how common the name is. Daisy and Daisy get along very well together. Since they moved in, the couple and their dog have come to the neighborhood playdates 5 nights a week, and we all go to the park together in the mornings.  We even dogsat for a night so they could visit family.

I am excited to have them as neighbors, but an issue has come up that I can’t seem to get around. It can be really hard to control the two dogs when they’re together, because they have the same name. Imagine two adults calling “Daisy!” at the same time. If we are going to continue with playdates and dogsitting, which we both intend to, I think it would be easiest if they renamed their dog. From past conversations, I learned that they named their dog Daisy just because they liked it, so there’s no emotional attachment or whatever. I asked them about it casually last time they were over. The husband seemed open to it, but the wife got very offended. I feel bad about it now, and but I don’t know how else we can solve this problem. I should say that I would 100% be willing to change my dog’s name, but I think she’s too old for that. Their dog is five months old, so it would be much easier for them to do it.  AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

Sadly, we still live with each other due to the lease but were ok with dating other people. Weirdly, one day at a bar I bumped into my other ex, let's name him Zach. We hadn't talked in a year and just hit it off again. So we began going on dates for a couple of months. Still living with my Clay, my Clay got jealous and super mad one time and choked me and slammed me.

&#x200B;

I was pretty shaken and just decided to move on. I thought I could confide in Zach and tell him about what happened to me and hope he would be supportive but he basically told me that if he was in my ex's position he would feel the same too seeing me with another guy. He said, "" Now by no means, I'm condoning his physical actions but all the other shit I can understand. Honestly, I see where he was coming from because I wouldn't want my significant other to be around someone they used to have a thing with regardless of trust ( its a guy thing)"". He made sure to say he doesn't justify the physical abuse part, but he said that it's a ""guy thing"" to be jealous. Honestly, for me, I was pissed cause I was going through A LOT and I thought Zach would be supportive so I went off. I told him he doesn't know how to connect with people and that he lacks emotional intelligence because, in a situation like this, it's not time to comment who is right or wrong, you should try to be supportive. I continued to tell him that he doesn't know how to feel bad for others because if he did, he would have tried to comfort me rather than defending my ex. Then I told him goodbye

c4tygh	2019-06-24 19:23:44	blacktoblame	WIBTA for outing my dad for his infidelity 6 years after knowing about it?	"My father has been having a secret sexual relationship with a maid of our family for about six years now, and I'm the only one who knows. She left to her country after my mother fired her after a long argument that I instigated. Basically, I was 10, playing in the maid's room, and my father visited her and began talking really strangely. I don't remember what they were saying, but I felt sick and told my mom, who promptly ended her contract the next night.

After a few months, I realised that my father was still in contact with the maid. I watched him type his password a few times, memorised it, then went into his phone at night and saw their chat. I was disgusted because I respected him so much so I ignored it. He then began going overseas multiple times (about once a month) on ""business trips"". This wasn't suspicious to anyone else because he does go on many business trips but the trips were getting more frequent. When I was 12, I obtained his password again and hooked up his whatsapp web to my computer. Their chat was _lengthy_ and worst of all, they had a kid.

Now, I wasn't going out him because he's loved by his family and divorce is pretty frowned upon in our culture. Also, my mom is emotionally unstable and it takes very little to set her off. I thought outing him would be the end of everything I knew, and my top priority was my national exam that I had to take at the end of that year.

It's been four years since then and I haven't done anything about it. I basically erased it from my mind. Also I have another national exam at the end of this year. Recently, he's been going on trips all the time, only coming back once a month for a few days. He bought her a house, a phone, ipads. He even has two more kids with her. I don't know what the fuck I've done. He locks his door all the time to video call her, is irritable when I knock to get things from his room or let the dog in. Basically blasts for the smallest things. (I used the word bastard on my brother as a joke and he acted as if I uttered the filthiest word known to man). He's also incredibly horrible at hiding the secret because he left his phone on with her face just hanging out on video call.

TLDR, WIBTA if I told him I knew? I want to do that because his lying disgusts me, and he's wearing himself thin by working overtime to support both families. It annoys me that he chose her because I feel she's not worthy of his money or time. I want him to start being an actual dad to his real family and focus all his expenses and time on us, his three legitimate children. She's unemployed and basically a parasite but I wonder if I'm being the asshole by wrecking their family too."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c4txwy	2019-06-24 19:22:53	dirtypants816	AITA for missing my grandfather's funeral?	"I've been struggling with this situation internally for a while now. This incident is one of the main points of contention between myself and my father's side of the family (parents divorced). We haven't spoken in almost 3 years. 

My grandfather was very important to me and 2 years ago he lost his fight with cancer. I made sure I visited him as often as I could for the last year of his life even though I lived about 2 hours away. I'm extremely grateful that he got to meet my newborn daughter just before he died even though he just mentally there anymore. Those will always be some of my favorite pictures. 

I was very emotional when he died because I was sleep deprived from a colic-y 2 month old, trying to support my wife with moderate post-partum depression, and losing one of my primary care takers growing up. So maybe I wasn't in the best frame of mind when making these decisions. 

The funeral was held in the city that my grandparents were born instead of the city that they and the rest of my family lived (and I grew up). The plan was for my family members to make the 4 hour drive down the night before and stay in a hotel, have services the next morning and then drive back home that evening.

The problem was that we couldn't afford a hotel room at the time nor could we afford a baby sitter for the whole day. I told my family this, but understandably they didn't have a lot of extra cash with paying for the funeral costs to spot me any money. So that meant if I wanted to attend I would have to drive for 8 hours round trip. 

I felt stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either I A) drive by myself and leave my wife by herself knowing how much she had been struggling. B) Take my wife and new born and drive most of the day and deal with the screaming. Or C) miss the funeral all together. 

I chose option C with the compromise that we would meet everyone in the city they all lived the evening after the funeral. We had some friends who graciously offered us a place to stay that weekend and it was only a 2 hour drive which seemed more manageable. 

Although they all reluctantly accepted my proposal it later came out that my father's side of the family was furious with me for missing the service. My grandmother was disappointed that I couldn't make it, but she was understanding of the predicament I was in. The rest of my aunts, cousins and my father just could not believe how selfish I was being by not supporting my grandmother.

c4twx3	2019-06-24 19:21:18		AITA for not paying what I owed?	"Recently, I hired a company to help me and my fiancé move into a new house. 

When the job was finished, the head mover called the Office Manager to calculate the cost. They finished and he brought the bill to me inside to review. 

I was pretty tired after the move and was a little confused when he showed it to me. They broke down the numbers hourly for labor, insurance, and materials which they hadn’t done previously. I shot a glance at the breakdown but since the total matched the initial price I was quoted on the estimate, I was satisfied. I tipped the movers a little over 20% each, signed the paperwork, and sent them on their way. 

As I sat down to catch my breath for the first time in hours, my neuroticism about expensive purchases pushed through the fatigue and I got a sense something wasn’t right about the bill. 

The price matched my initial quote, but we took 45 minutes longer than quoted which wasn’t reflected in the total. Since I had called over a dozen companies before booking, I figured maybe I confused rates and everything was kosher. Before I could check the bill, I get a call from the Office Manager...

Office Manager: “Uh, hello sir, it seems we made an error in your bill, and, well, it seems we didn’t charge you as much as we should have..................(long, long pause).................... but if you’re going to object to it, I guess we’ll just have to eat that cost”

Me: “Well....... yes, I would like to object and would prefer to pay the cost I signed for. What I paid was already very expensive and what you’re saying I owe now would almost run me dry”

OM: “Well.. Alright then, sir, thank you for your time, have a nice day.”

And that was it. Sure I could have paid, but the move really is expensive and it really would have emptied my account. I’m blessed with a good job and could have made it work, yet thrilled to save the money and not have to deal with it. 

tl;dr Company made a math error and undercharged me on the paperwork. When they realized their mistake, they called to ask for the difference but gave me a clear option to not pay  before I could even respond. I took it.

c4tvov	2019-06-24 19:19:20	bodycatchabody	AITA for wanting to get a dog sitter?	"My boyfriend I have have been together for three years. We're both in our mid-30s. We have two dogs, one of which is crate trained and unaccustomed to roaming free when we're not at home. He chews. They other one is okay being left out, but she is very skittish and she occasionally has seizures.

&#x200B;

There's a video game and streaming convention an hour away from us this weekend. My BF is trying to grow his Twitch stream and wants to go. I say great, let's go! I love supporting him in this hobby because he's super passionate and talented. We book a hotel for the weekend.

&#x200B;

Now, usually, our dogs stay with my parents. But they're getting their floors redone this weekend, so we need to make other arrangements. My BF says he doesn't like the idea of our dogs being under the care of a stranger, either at a doggy daycare or boarded at the vet. He thinks that we should just have a friend come over once a day for the two nights we are gone to let them out.

I have a huge problem with this. I am horrified at the thought of our crate-trained dog spending 12 hours at a time in the crate, with breaks for bathroom, food, and water once or twice a day. To me, that feels like solitary confinement or something. Also, as I mentioned, our other dog occasionally has seizures, and I am afraid that she would have one while we were gone and have no one to check up on her for hours.

&#x200B;

I expressed my feeling to my BF and he said I'm being overprotective; that I'm over-thinking it and that they will be fine like that for a couple of nights. We got in an argument about it, because I am shocked that he is being so cavalier about all of it. We made a promise to be responsible for them when we adopted them, and that means making sure they are safe and well cared for in our absence. I told my BF that I'm not comfortable leaving them alone, and he was like, ""then you can figure it out."" This upset me further because I thought we shared the responsibility of the dogs equally. Now, I'm not so sure. I love and respect my boyfriend, but think he is being callous about the care and responsibility of our dogs.

Do people leave their dogs alone for weekends at a time? Am I being an overprotective fur parent? Am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: It would seem I am not the asshole. Thanks for weighing in, everyone. To be clear, I never intended to leave the dogs alone. I simply wanted confirmation that my boyfriend was being unreasonable for fighting with me over following my instincts. As a woman, I hate being made to feel crazy over some innocuous bullshit. I have booked a dog sitter I trust, and my pups will be well cared for."	Not the A-hole	0	0

&#x200B;

My fiance likes to smoke pot. He used to do it A TON in college, like a daily thing to survive. He has mellowed out a lot with it, which is good, but I still am not a fan that he does it. He does it because he has anxiety, and it helps, but he won't go to a psychiatrist or psychologist for the anxiety. The reason I don't like it is because he lies to me about it. He tries to evade me, cover it up, and sometimes flat out lie. I've caught him almost every single time. I'm way more mad at the fact that he lies than that he actually does it. I wish he wouldn't, he becomes so sleepy, acts like a zombie, and harshes the entire evening. I would never tell him ""absolutely no smoking pot or i'm dumping you"" I just wish that he wouldn't. The reason it's **really** becoming an issue now is because he's recently fallen on hard times financially. I've been paying for everything like food, meals, etc because he doesn't have money, yet i've caught him high a few times. AKA he's spending money on weed even though he barely has any money to begin with. We've fought about it a few times, and he just accuses me of hating him doing it which is why I bitch about it. He's right, I do hate it, but only because of the circumstances in which he's doing it. He makes me feel like TA, but I don't think I am.

c4tnpo	2019-06-24 19:06:50	VeryAngryCNA	WIBTA if I didn't tell a resident why no one likes her?	"This one is a hard situation for me. We have a resident at the nursing home I work at that I'll call Ms. Green. She's a nice lady and everything but the problem is, she has some quirks.

One of the main things she does is she coughs a lot without covering her mouth! When she does this, a lot of residents get very noticeably uncomfortable, especially when it is flu season or any kind of illness is going around. A resident cursed her out the other morning because she was doing it around their food.

Ms. Green has good intentions but yesterday she opened the door for a resident who isn't allowed outside. Some residents have on ankle bracelets that trigger an alarm if they go out the door. They can't go out because there's too much of a chance that they'll wander down the street and end up getting killed. Residents aren't supposed to be messing with the door controls anyway so that ticked some of the staff off.

Ms. Green also ticked off the administration because she contaminated the ice machine. In the employee break room is the ice maker that we use to supply ice to the whole facility. She went in there and stuck her bare hands into the ice machine. Maintenance had to come in, empty the whole machine, and sanitize it before we could use it again. This took a long time to do. The resident that saw her do it publicly told every other resident why no ice was being passed out so the residents went from being annoyed to being furious. These people love their ice.

Ms. Green has been asking people why everyone hates her and I don't think I have it in me to do something like that. I especially don't want her to think that I hate her too. At the same time, I know what it's like for someone to feel like everyone hates you and not know why. I feel like no matter what I do, I suck here.

EDIT: I said this in one comment but I should say it here too. She was really really sad one time when I told her that she shouldn't touch her roommate's things. She was sad for about two days just for that. I know if I give her this list of reasons she will be worse."	Asshole	0	0

c4tn44	2019-06-24 19:05:54	greychurch26	AITA: I won’t let my brother use my personal laptop for schoolwork.	"To start, I have been raised with a lot of technology. My mom, my dad, my brother and I all have iPhones, and all but my brother have MacBook computers. We have had laptops, phones, and various other devices in the house since I can remember. I own a MacBook Air for college, and my mother and father have them for work. My brother has a school issued laptop, but it was given back, and he doesn’t have a device with which to access google docs. Or rather, he has an aforementioned iPhone, but my mother does not trust him to use it for schoolwork as he will become distracted by the amalgam of apps he owns. So, on occasion, as I own a personal laptop and am out of school for the summer, my mother asks me to let my brother use my laptop, to which I decline. My reasoning follows as such:
1. It is not my responsibility to supply technology to my brother simply because he cannot control himself around his phone.
2. I believe my mother places a higher value on her laptop than she does on mine, and therefore refuses to acknowledge that my brother could just as easily get distracted on my computer and damage it in some way. 
3. As we have accumulated technology, we have also grown to depend on it fiercely, and develop a bond. Just as I will not allow my father to be on my phone for more than a minute, I am certainly loathe to allow my brother to use my computer without my constant supervision, which the supplying of is inconvenient to me. It’s simply my personal rule to not allow others on my devices."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4tlzb	2019-06-24 19:04:07	Makmaldisney	AITA for asking an Airbnb neighbor to turn off thier music I could hear through the walls with deeply offensive lyrics? Then demanding a refund when he refused?	"For this to make sense I need to set the stage, I’m staying at a 7 condo unit in New Mexico with my husband and two kids. It’s a gorgeous property but we can generally hear the neighbors next door. The owner of our unit and the one next door lives in the complex and up until this morning was polite, as was the neighbor.

Last night I could hear the neighbor playing music which sounded like a sort modern blue grass and I actually really liked the tone of the music. It was pleasant back ground noise in all honesty. This morning he must have placed his speaker in a different spot he used while the music was the same I could now hear the lyrics. I knew there was trouble wheb I could hear the words “Dixie” and “land of cotton.” I googled just to be sure its a song by some little known country star clearly celebrating “lost cause” and racism and hating on “city people.” 

I was furious but i politely went next door she said we could hear the music through the walls and would he mind turning it off. He said he was sorry and would. I probably made a mistake and said “I don’t want to expose my kids to that type of music.” He gave me a dirty look and closed the door. We went to breakfast and I could hear the song playing again. I decided after the dirty I didnt want trouble from someone who may be unhinged. I decided I would take it up with the owner. He said he would ask the neighbor to keep it down. I told him it’s not the volume, it’s the lyrics. He said he really couldn’t control the lyrics. I said he needed to do better then that or I needed a refund. He said he wasn’t going to offer me a refund for “offensive” lyrics but he would make sure I couldn’t hear the music anymore. I asked him if he was serious he said he’s not “speech police.” I told him we were leaving and I would take it up with Airbnb.

My husband is acting completely put out and that I’m being ridiculous. I told him we aren’t listening to trash and our kids aren’t either. Husband said the problem was solved when owner promised he would make the neighbor turn it down. I said no, the Problem is the neighbor exposed himself as racist, probably dangerous and we are leaving. Husband told me I was acting ridiculous and took the kids on a hike without me. 

Before I pack up and move, am I being ridiculous? (I know this sub is asshole but I figure that’s a reasonable substitution).

Edit: just to reinforce my point here’s some lyrics which are racist:

c4tjuy	2019-06-24 19:00:53	dwightbarnes	AITA for cutting off my friend over broken promises	"So I've known my friend for about four years and we always hung out with our group of mutual friends. This year I got to know him better and I started helping him with school projects, studying and similar things. We ended up staying together almost every day.

This is where trouble starts. School was almost over and we started making plans: I started making arrangements for holidays and he seemed pretty cool about going a week together to some nice place. Then he told me we would study together for the upcoming entrance exam for the university since we had to enroll before a certain date.

During the first month after school had ended he basically ignored me. I would message him and call him to go to the cinema or hang out as we always did but he just wouldn't reply to me. The only time I managed to speak with him he simply told me that he was busy and he wouldn't come on holiday with me because he had other stuff to do.

I got fed up with him and i decided to call out his behavior and he it looked like he wanted to fix things too. We joined a local airsoft team and we decided to try this sport together. And lo and behold, when I finally went to play with the team, he was missing again.

And then the last straw: as I said earlier we had to study for the university exam, and so I asked him what he wanted to do. I found out he was actually applying for an internship at a local company, but he said he would cancel it and that he had forgotten about the exam. And so he did, he canceled his internship but instead he decided to start driving school without telling me anything. Thanks to him I'm now going to university alone.

So after insulting him (which i kinda regret) I've decided to completely cut him off. He said that I would see him at my birthday next week, with all the other friends but I told him not to come as he wasn't welcome anymore.

Am i being too needy or manipulative because I feel like I'm the piece of shit here, and if I look back we also had a lot of fun and good times together. I've been told he's just that way, he doesn't even know what he's doing next day but I find it hard to believe.

"Some backstory: Me and my (1 year older) brother have not been on good terms in a long time. In school he was my biggest bully, and as he got older things got worse.  He lived a violent, reckless lifestyle, always getting into fights, getting involved in gang activity. He's been to jail multiple times, and honestly it was a reprieve for me and my mom when he was locked up, cause it was hell living with him. He'd threaten violence (most often implied, sometimes outright) to me and her if he didn't get his way. He even put his hands on her once - that was the only time I ever fought back against him.

&#x200B;

He hasn't been above stealing from family either. He stole my mom's money or car multiple times. He's ""borrowed"" money from other families claiming he was gonna use it to go to school or get a car for work, only to use it to buy drugs to sell.

&#x200B;

Having been a broke kid in high school to being an even broker college student, I didn't often have much of value for him to steal. But I was always an avid gamer, so my game consoles were an exception. He's stolen systems from me three times in my life. After the most recent incident, I swore I'd never let him in my life again. A couple years passed.

&#x200B;

Then he got shot. I wasn't surprised. No one was. We all knew his lifestyle would get him shot eventually. He survived, but is permanently paralyzed from the chest down. I didn't go see him when he was in the hospital. I was glad he wasn't dead, but I had meant it when I said I would no longer let him into my life. Everyone told me he was doing better, no longer running the streets (like he'd be able to), that he was settling down. My mom, as much of a pain in the ass he was to her, still loved him, and  wanted me to forgive him. But I refused.

&#x200B;

Then. . . my mom died a month ago. . .

&#x200B;

I knew I'd be seeing him at the wake. And I knew my mom would want for me not to hate him. So I resolved to give him a chance. And, yeah, he was much calmer, more mature then ever before. I had the first decent conversation with him in years. I told him that I forgave him.

&#x200B;

A few minutes ago he contacted me for the first time since the wake, asking to borrow my PS4. He says he's bored out of his mind not being able to really go outside, and he needs something to do, and I mean, I understand that and feel for him. But I REALLY don't want to let him. Partially cause I just got it half a year ago, partially cause of the history. But I feel like a dick for not letting him.

&#x200B;

A few years back I would have parties inside of my barn at my home, and there was this wheelchair that was my father's from surgery he bought, but he no longer used. Not many may know this, but wheelchairs are not cheap, and replacement parts are also very costly. Continuing on, we would play around in this wheelchair, learned how to do wheelies in it etc, nothing to damage it. One day we decided to take it over to my buddies shop (basically a garage that we would also party in), we'll call this guy Harry. I ended up leaving the chair there for the night and went home. Days pass and I forget it's there until harry reminds me i left it in his shop and should come pick it up, and I tell him I will, but I fail to every time he reminds me due to me being forgetful and lazy. So I left it there for about a month or two probably, can't exactly recall, anyways one day I go over to his shop and find it with both wheels completely busted in half. Apparent Harry had decided to load it up and take it to a big party and let people take turns riding it down the stairs at the party. I demanded that he paid for it but he refused and said it was my fault for leaving it at his place for so long. Does me being lazy justify the destruction of my property? AITA? I also asked if he had left something expensive at my place for that long and I destroyed it if he would care, and he said he wouldn't."		1	0

c4tblu	2019-06-24 18:47:24	Everybodysfull	AITA for not just giving in so my Dad will see my kids?	"My dad has always been my hero, I was definitely a daddy's girl my whole life. My mom and I love each other but she's a narcissist and I don't tolerate her well. 

I am married in my 30s with 2 teenage daughters. They are not my husband's children, but my husband and I have been married for 7 years. My husband is an outstanding provider, father figure and husband. 

My parents divorced after 38 years last April. My dad moved in his new girlfriend on Mother's Day. His new girlfriend has lived romantically with 2 of his brothers and was married to another, so she is the mother of my dad's nephews. She has a bad drug problem and has multiple pending drug charges for meth. She doesn't work and her son and his 3 kids also moved in. The son has never worked and has a drug problem as well. 

I made it clear to my dad he was welcome to see my kids anytime as long as he came alone. My dad and my youngest were huge buddies. I have invited my dad to multiple events so he can see his granddaughters. He has ignored me. I wished him Happy Father's Day in a message and he ignored that. I finally lost my cool and told him what a pos he is being and how he can have a relationship with his grandkids and his girlfriend and I'm not asking him to choose. He has chosen to not have a relationship with my children and I. His reasoning. My husband and I smoke weed occasionally, so according to him we are no better than his girlfriend. My husband and I both have great income, good jobs and our shit together. Our kids are well taken care of, well rounded and score in the top percentile for their age group. We obviously aren't junkies. His second reason is, my dad says I'd never go anywhere my husband isn't welcome, so I can't expect him to go where his girlfriend isn't welcome. 

I know I'm NTA for keeping drug addicts out of my children's lives. My question is, AITA for thinking the situation is completely different in my husband's case than in my dad's girlfriend's case? My husband is an upstanding guy and hasn't done anything to make himself unwelcome anywhere, so it's not fair to compare him with an addict who has my dad doing drugs and is mooching off of him. My dad is pitching it out there like I'm being a spoiled brat. AITA?

Edit to add, my sisters have both welcomed my dad's girlfriend in order to see our dad. My sister said she'd take any scraps he threw her way because she loves him, she doesn't have any kids. My other sister is a shit mom anyway and doesn't care as long as her kids aren't bothering her."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4taif	2019-06-24 18:45:37	encoln	AITA For using dark jokes around my friend?	"We have a group of friends we always hang out with for almost two years. We like to make a lot of dark jokes including racism sexism and religious stuff. Sometimes we joke about our parents. We are in no way actually racist or sexist or have hatred against religous groups, we just like making jokes about them because we find them funny. Everyone laughs, no one seems to be offended by the joke and we have fun. Making dark jokes aren't only thing we do, I'm just keeping this story short. 

One night I messaged a friend in that group online. We just began some generic small talk and started a converasation. Dark jokes did slip out once or twice. When I made a joke that his parents do cocaine, he lost it. He got really emotional and called me and my family a lot of bad words. He kept insulting me and of course I thought he was just joking around. I followed up with jokingly comments. He kept insulting me, and it gave me a hit that maybe he wasn't joking. I told him again, ""Stop acting like you're upset dude, it wont work on me. I'm not gonna apologize and let you make fun of me for doing so again""

He ignored me for a few minutes, I asked him if he was serious, and he did. Just now it hit me he was actually hurt by the comments. He apologized, I apologized but I'm not sure what to do in this situation. He told me that he has a tendency to hide his feelings, and that he secretely hated the comments and jokes all along. It's the first time he ever told me this. I told him ""You should have told me this way earlier"". He proceeded to say ""How can anyone find these jokes funny? You have to be really weird to find these funny"".

I feel hurt because he called me some serious shit and it wasn't a joke. I called him some serious shit too but it was a joke and he always seemed to be fine with it. Now I realize he doesn't. AITA for using dark jokes near him?


(Edit) Okay I have seen all the replies. Thank you for making them. People say I am a racist if I am making racist jokes but I mostly do it ironically, like to make fun of people who are actually racist. I don't know if that makes sense to you. [Saying random phrases like ""I support the slave trade"", calling each other Abu Hajaar, roleplay things like we live in North Korea etc. I don't make what your racist grandma would make in a dinner table. I don't find edgy stuff funny.] Plus his parents actually doesn't so cocaine, I made it up as a joke.

Now for the real reason I made this edit is because... HE WAS JOKING. Yeah. No shit he was joking. He was the one that enjoyed jokes like that all the time and it really didn't make sense for me for him to get extremely upset. I met him irl today, and he just told me everything was a joke and I was an idiot. I am pretty pissed at this guy because I genuienly felt bad for my friend that I kept making jokes like that always offended him. He even made fun of me that I made this post. Who's the asshole now?"

c4t9dx	2019-06-24 18:43:43	fineapple52	WIBTA if I didn't want to pay full cleaning fee for vomiting on a wedding coach	"Title not fully describing the situation, but I wanted to keep it short.

Tl;dr went from UK to USA for an aunt's wedding. SO puked on a wedding coach on the way back. Aunt wants him to cover $360 cleaning charge, he thinks this barf is wildly overpriced, and wants to send her what a 'normal' company would charge. I'm mediating and feeling like I'm also going to throw up from all that stress. **WIBTA for backing up my SO, and trying to push the ‘normal charge’ scenario?**

By way of introduction, English is my second language, I'm on mobile, etc. First time poster (was hoping for something nicer to post about for the first time, but well, it is what it is).

Me (25F) and my SO (29M) recently attended a wedding, it was all great, excluding one incident.

I bet everyone who was on a bus after a party agrees with me that it’s not the most pleasant experience. Long story short, my SO didn’t feel well on a couch on the way back from the said wedding, what got painted was a “plastic” back of the sit in front of him, his lap and the floor (I had a plastic bag which we made use of immediately). I cleaned it up a little using a t-shirt worn before the wedding – just to picture for you that the situation wasn’t super dramatic, I understand the bus still needed cleaning, and disinfecting.

Shortly after that I contacted The Bride (29, aunt), apparently she wanted to contact me too, since the company charged them for the cleaning already.. In a shaky voice I apologised and asked how much, she said $470, and sent me a screenshot of an e-recite. What the actual hell, I thought. The whole cost of renting a bus and a limo (!) was less than this cleaning charge! The light in the tunnel appeared when she said that charge they agreed on in the contract was $360, so she said they’ll make a complaint, and let us know the outcome.

Fastforward to the next day, the company agreed on $360, we still felt obliged to atone for the faux pas, The Bride is not clear, so since we’re family I bluntly asked whether we could get them something from the wedding wish list, or just use Paypal. She chose the latter, and said she wants my SO to cover the whole charge. Still shocked by the high charge, we googled a little bit and found out that no other company around has charges so high – it’d be usually $50-150.

SO feels responsible for the situation, but says he feels like he should only pay the ‘normal’ rate, so up to $150, since he did mess up, but he doesn’t feel like he should be accountable for the Newly Married Couple’s choice to use, as far as we know, company with the highest cleaning fees.

I am between a rock and a hard place; I understand both sides, and trying to juggle the moods in both camps. Please, don't try to be nice, if you think I'm just being dumb! I feel like my mind is on a rollercoaster and can't think straight, so (metaphorically) slap me if you feel you need to, just let me know how a person from the outside sees the situation.


Update: 
Thank you all for your comments! I feel stupid now for trying to look at things from that perspective... obviously you're right, the bill just needs paying off. I've talked to my SO as well, and we're both on the same page - wanting to sort it out as soon as possible. 
Sometimes even obvious things may seem foggy, but that's why I like reddit, it'll always give you a lesson when needed.

c4t6fd	2019-06-24 18:38:57	Citiza	AITA for (WITH PRIOR CONSENT) taking advantage of my girlfriend's friskiness when she's been drinking?	"I (25M) have been completely sober for about nine months now. My girlfriend (24F) and I have been together about six months, and she has helped immensely with my sobriety. She doesn't drink that often herself, but definitely does not make it a point to avoid alcohol. She will drink moderate amounts maybe twice a month. That's fine, it works perfectly for both of us.

Our sex life is great normally, but gets kicked into a ridiculous gear when she's been drinking. She becomes considerably more adventurous and we've done a lot of things when she's tipsy that she is absolutely not okay with sober.

The first time she tried to initiate sex while she was drunk and I wasn't, I stopped her and told her that we would talk about it in the morning when she'd sobered up. The next morning she said that short of getting her pregnant, she is absolutely okay with me taking advantage of her being drunk to do anything that she wouldn't normally be okay with. So long as ""drunk her"" consents to it, ""sober her"" won't have a problem with it later.

Even though she's given me the okay, I still feel kind of skeevy about this sometimes. I never, EVER pressure her to drink or encourage her to drink more than she normally would. Her levels of drunkenness are entirely her own doing. Also, this has never come up, but I would never even consider doing anything with her if she was unable to give affirmative consent.

So am I being a creep about this? She insists I'm not, but I kind of wanted an outside opinion."	No A-holes here	0	0
c4t550	2019-06-24 18:37:00	supertaquito	AITA for eating leftovers I cooked myself for fathers day?	"So, my significant other and myself went to visit her parents for fathers day. As a gift, her father wanted me to cook ''Pasta la Bolognesa'' which I made 7 pounds of. We (gf and I) bought all the ingredients (This was on Sunday), and went back so I could start cooking. Cooking finished, everything was great, they loved the food and we all had 2 to 3 servings and there were some more leftovers which I put into a big plastic container and into the fridge. We never discussed what was going to be done with the leftovers.   


Anywho, we went to sleep at a visitors room as we were planning to stay for a week. I brought my laptop with me as I work from home, and since we are planning on making a big trip we couldn't really afford missing a couple of days of payment. I slept in on Tuesday as my GF said she would be going out with her parents that day. At around noon I started getting hungry, and couldn't find my wallet, so I heated up the rest of the pasta as there was only one more serving since they reheated some leftovers on Monday, ate the paste, and went to work.   


Inlaws and GF come back at around 10pm, turns out my wallet was in my gfs bag and she forgot to take it out. This is when it got ugly, my in laws realized there was no more pasta and they blew up saying that pasta was my father in laws as it was cooked for fathers day. I explained I did not have money with me and I was hungry and didn't feel like cooking at a place that is not my home, but my MIL did not have any of it and started to ask my girlfriend if she was okay with me being the man she was going to marry. So I did get a bit pissed and just asked them if they were being serious about getting mad at someone for eating, EATING. We don't have the best relationship with her in laws because they can sometimes be extreme, but since we have plenty of rough interactions, I just want to see it's not a case of **''When you always find a problem with something, you might want to see if you are the problem, instead''.**"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4t4va	2019-06-24 18:36:34	mille73	AITA for wanting my neighbor to clean up their yard?	"  

So I live in a mobile home park and I have an older house but I try to keep up a nice yard. For me, even though I own a mobile its still my investment and I am doing my best to take care of it. And now that a new owner has taken over my park they are bringing in new homes which has led to a little property value spike. Thus incentive to keep up a nice yard should I one day decide to sell.

My issue stems from my neighbor who was actually the previous manager a few years back. She moved into the house next to mine shortly after I moved in. And ever since I believe she’s encroaching on my space. When I moved in she never told me where the lot lines were and as a first time home owner in a mobile home park, I never thought to ask. 

So let me lay out my space: I have small hedges that fence in my entire front yard (right side, front, left side). I own dogs and so to keep my dogs from getting through the bushes I put a light mesh on the inside of my bushes. My problem is solved, my dogs can go outside and not escape. 

Flash forward a few years and the area beyond my bushes, the shared side in question, is being taken over with ugly broken half dead potted plants. She also has broken yard ornaments, broken rubbish, and a very large, very ugly peacock statue facing my house outside her enclosed car port.  

My problem is that she now has moved her STUFF outside and beyond her enclosed carport. Everyone else’s property line ends at their car port. However, she insists that the property line is actually where I put up my mesh fencing along the bushes and that the bushes themselves are HERS! I know for a fact that the previous owner of my home planted those bushes. So I ask you, why would someone plant anything on someone else’s property unless they thought/knew it was theirs?

I have tried to politely speak with her about my concerns but when two people can’t agree on what is fact its futile. During our conversation she tried to touch my shoulder and because I was upset I said, “don’t touch me.” Later that day she wrote a facebook post about how offended she was being told, “don’t touch me.” She didn’t call me out by name but it was still some super passive aggressive shit. 

Later, this lady actually came into my fenced off yard, walked into my back yard, tied up some fishing line and made a visible “property line” that gives her several feet of extra space beyond her carport. 

I really just cant with her. My husband wants me to leave well enough alone. But it eats at me every time I look out my kitchen window and I see her trash. At this point its become about principal. She has too much stuff and because she was the former manager she thinks she can get away with it. 

Am I the asshole for wanting to write current management and complain?

c4t38r	2019-06-24 18:33:59		AITA for not letting my gf's brother sleep on our couch?	"Names:
Gf Brother: Lucas
Gf Father: Leroy
Gf Sister: Lauren 

Back story: Lucas is 18 and lost his first job because he made dumb choices and went to jail for a few months. Leroy, the dad, is an alcoholic who was recently unemployed but now has a minimum wage job. Given their situation, Lauren has taken in Leroy and Lucas. She shares a 2 bedroom apartment with her step mother, her husband, and kids. 

Two weeks ago, my sister asked if her dad Leroy could sleep on our couch for the night as Lauren and Leroy got into an argument about rent money. Apparently Leroy took back the rent money from Lauren and drank it out, which is primarily why he can't find a place for himself. I said no because I wanted privacy. We got into an argument because ""it was just for a night"", but quickly moved on. 

Few days ago, Lauren threatened to kick out both Leroy and Lucas. My gf again asked to let just her brother Lucas sleep on the couch this time, and I said no again. I said:

""He sleeps on our couch for one night, then what? We either keep him like Lauren has or are you going to be the one to kick him onto the street? It's evident that Lauren is trying to shift some of the burden onto you.""

I told them I have nothing against her family but we rent a small 1 bedroom apartment, and both my gf and I like to spend a lot of time on the couch either gaming or watching TV at nights. I also like to sleep in my underwear or naked since the climate is quite hot, and you need to walk into our bedroom to use the toilet.

"I work at an organization that prides itself on a strong work culture that values honesty, respect, and building strong relationships. We have a committee that plans celebratory events (baby showers, wedding showers, birthdays), and during team meetings people are put in the spotlight by our boss for major life events such as engagements or the birth of a child. 

I've worked with my boss for four years now, and my child was born a year ago. In early 2018 he casually brought up to the team that my wife and I were expecting, and many people congratulated me which was so thoughtful. I was also surprised with a really thoughtful baby shower planned by my coworkers. However through all these events, and even during my weekly checkins, my boss has never asked about how my baby is doing. At happy hour events he and his husband will talk about their vacation plans, family dynamics, or other personal matters. However he has yet to ask about how my baby is doing, or how I am doing being a new parent.

AITA for checking in with my boss to ask him why he's never asked about my baby? I want to honor the fact that we are professionals and don't have to talk about personal matters at work, but it feels inauthentic to our culture and insensitive having known me for so long."		1	0

It's impossible for me to do it and feel anything but fake and unattractive. My friends tell me snapchat is the best way to keep in touch, and you don't have to use it to make selfie videos; I know there are funny snapchats where you can record something going on around you, but it's also generally used for making a face and adding filters etc.; I avoid social media, and my friends are annoyed that I won't just install it so they can contact me with it. Am I just being stubborn? Not gonna lie, my low self-esteem dictates my decision when it comes to this. It's also why I can't do online dating, I can't take photos of myself. When I did do it, everyone would always be surprised that I looked like my pictures, or  better (they were all old facebook photos people had took of me year prior). Regardless, my friends say I'm missing out and I don't have a good reason not to use snapchat.

edit: Thank you so much for all your advice and support. I'm trying to work my body image again, last year I was running and lost 20 pounds and I was out in public with my shirt off for the first time in my life. But it didn't last once grad school + stress came in. I think I am being too stubborn with respect to snapchat, I still don't really want it, but I'm going to install it the next time they bring it up. As for selfies with friends, I don't mind taking them but I'm completely unable to put a real smile on once a camera is on me. If I am interacting with someone I am naturally smiling, and someone needs to sneak a candid shot of me or something. Selfies are something I might not never figure out how to do. I don't think I'm that unique when it comes to that feeling, but when I see instagram and all the smiles, it seems like I'm lacking something. I can't make that smile.

c4sxsa	2019-06-24 18:25:26	ry_fluttershy	AITA for being angry at my brother's ridiculous behavior?	"As a little backstory, my brother has some anxiety and other related mental health issues, so I can sort of understand some of the things he does.

&#x200B;

So my brother is really rude to my mother and I sometimes, and fine other times.  He will act like a child (he's 16) and be angry until he gets what he wants.  An example would be that since my mom is a single mother for about 2 years now, she was wondering if he'd get a job over the summer to help out.  Apparently, this was not reasonable because he got into a huge argument with my mom and even used the old ""Why do I have to get a job if OP doesn't?"" (I'm 17 months his junior so most places wont hire me.)  The fight ended with my mother in tears crying and asking him why he's so mean to her.

&#x200B;

Another thing is when we're playing games.  He takes them so seriously and basically rages if he doesn't win.  My brother and I have a friend group who all play Fortnite (hurr durr fortnite bad xd) and he basically whines until we play the mode he wants to play or he will leave the party.  He also only plays if he will win.  I asked him why he can't just enjoy spending time with friends and he said he doesn't have fun playing with friends, only getting wins in Fortnite. 

&#x200B;

He will also use hyperbole to support his arguments.  For example, if I've been playing on my PC for 15 minutes and he tells me to do chores because my mom said so, instead of taking my response of ""I've only been playing for a little while, can I finish some things and then do it?"" he'll tell her ""OP refuses to do chores.  He wont do anything.""  That's a little ridiculous, right?  I didn't ""refuse"" to do my chores, I just asked for a little more time.

&#x200B;

c4swri	2019-06-24 18:23:46	DedierWasTaken	AITA for wanting money from my uncle	"So quick preface, I'm 18m and for my whole childhood my uncle and parents paid for trips to the US so I could stay with my uncle and grandparents while on vacation. Since I was 14 they have slowed down, but I do come every 2-3 years still.

Pretty much, I want to go to a Smash tournament in Daytona this weekend (I'm currently visiting him in Miami). So I talked to him about the trip and asked for advice, and we ended up getting to a figure of around 500$ for the weekend. Fair enough, I don't have that amount of money (I do work, but I live in Colombia, so my salary is cut by 3.5 when switching to dollars, so a similar trip in Colombia would be possible) right now, but I could lend it from him (or he could just gift it to me).

So while we're going home from the place we were eating and having this discussion at, he suddenly stops the conversation and starts saying that I've been trying to make him say that he would take care of it and make him pay for all of it. He then goes on to say that I should ask him to lend me that money (which was my goal together with maybe getting it for free, I do see that it's expensive as hell) so I do, I ask him to please lend me that money. Yet he still says that I'm being conceited and trying to trick him out of his money.

Context, my uncle is very wealthy, he is not rich per se, but he has a house of his own a very good looking car and a lot of expendable stuff (like a gigantic tv). Whenever we go out we eat at very expensive places (at least from my point of view) and he clearly could lend me that money. He knows that I work, and that in time I could pay him back. Also, in the past he has been happy to give his wealth to our family. Recently he has changed a lot, he treats my cousin like shit for no reason, and it seems like he has grown attached to his money, he talks a lot about how he has to think about himself first a lot.

So, I am an asshole for 1) Wanting him to pay for the trip 2) When that went off the table, for asking him to lend me money to go  and 3) Being mad at him for saying no? Also, what do you guys think I should do to negotiate with him? I can ask my cousin (who lives with him) to help me go, but it feels wrong somehow. I generally feel selfish about the whole situation

&#x200B;

UPDATE: My uncle asked about my plans, and I just said I wasn't going (which I genuinely thought I wasn't) and he responded he'd already paid for everything, but that I should be clear to ask him for things clearly when I want them.

From my own point of view, I never bother people while they're off. I find the whole thing to be pretty disrespectful in fact. Especially since it's not anywhere close to an emergency.

c4svwi	2019-06-24 18:22:23	TheDkone	AITA for not tipping at a drive-thru beer distributor	"I posted this a couple weeks ago, but messed up the title so here I go again.

&#x200B;

The title says most of it, here is a little background information.

&#x200B;

The main facts: This is in the US.  The State I live in only allows beer to be sold by the case at beer distributors that can only sell beer and other malt beverages.  Wine and liquor are only sold at stores run by the State.  The distributor closest to my house is on my way home from work and the next closest one is maybe 5 miles out of my way and not convenient to get to.  The one that I go to is a drive through, meaning you drive in through a garage door, pull up to where the attendant is and he/she gets your beer and puts in your car while you stay in your vehicle the whole time.  This is how they have the business setup and it is not really practical to park and walk in. There is no man-door to get into the building, you have to walk in through the exit garage door.  There is a minimum wage law in my State which is 7.25/hr, I am pointing this out because if you are a waiter in this State you can legally be paid something like 3/hr, this is not one of those jobs.

&#x200B;

My presumptions: The store is private, meaning it is not a chain and it is run by a family, although I am not sure if the one guy that works there is part of the family since he was there before the new owner bought the place.

&#x200B;

My biased reasons: The price of beer at this location is on average $2 more on a case of beer (\~7%) then the other places near.  My assumption for the higher cost being that it is for additional labor costs.  I don't have a problem getting my own beer and carrying it to my car, the problem is that if you are to park and walk in you have to cross a slightly dangerous road. They have a sign on the cooler door that says employees only, so it is not like I can even serve myself if I wanted to.  If either of the male employees takes my order, they hand me the receipt to sign and there is never a tip line on it.  Since the new owner, who is a woman, took over whenever she or her daughter take my order they bring out my receipt for signature and they always print it out with a tip line on it. 

&#x200B;

I don't have a problem with tipping at restaurants, if the service was even halfway decent, my minimum is 20%.  Before the new owner took over it was owned by a man and I never really gave this much thought.  I have been going this same place for many years and the employee turn over is low.  At Christmas time when I go there with a large 5+ case order for our Xmas eve party, I always give the guy that loads my truck 20 bucks, but more in the spirit of Christmas.  So my questions is, AITA for not tipping when I pull trough to grab a case of beer on the way home from work every other week?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c4stoa	2019-06-24 18:18:53	fer-aa_repasser	WIBTA if I asked my GF not to wear the high heels I gave her?	"Last year, my GF and I were on study tour with the whole class. We were shopping as she saw these wonderful high heels : black and with an at least 3in heel.

The problem is the is already tall. I am 5ft 9in and so is she. So, when she wears them, she is 6ft tall. I am not bothered with her being as tall as I am or 1in taller (when we were 16), but her being 3in taller than me is frankly disturbing... And the look of strangers seeing us together in the shop already makes me cringe so hard...

I made her notice she would be this tall, but she didn't care. She wanted them so badly. But she knew her mom would be super angry if she ever got back with those heels. We were also in a cheap country so she knew she would never be able to afford them back home if we ever find them again. So she was sad knowing she could never have them.

I felt bad, really bad for her. Even worst than knowing she would be taller than I am. So I told her ""If it is a present, your mom will not be able to bother you?"" and she agreed. I paid them. I told myself ""She will never wear them with me anyways, so I don't have to worry"". Big mistake. Every time there is a big event, she wears them, even for dancing parties.

There's my problem: next week, there will be presentation of the bachelor's degree. And at midnight I will be 18. So I know me and my GF will be taken on multiple photos. And I know everybody will mock me being shorter than her or at least make me cringe hard. And I don't want it. She has also once mentionned how she was looking foward to wearing them on this particular day.

So WIBTA if I asked her not to wear them?

EDIT: Thanks to all of you who say I would be the asshole. I wanted to know if would be justified and in fact, no. I know that I'm having a lot of self-esteem issues, but I didn't suspect the one about my height being that big. I won't bother my GF with them, I have to change.

c4ssda	2019-06-24 18:16:54	MajoretteKay	AITA if I'm not affected by family deaths?	"For context on my family situation; I was moved away from any family other than immediate when I was 7. The majority of my family lives in Massachusetts and I was moved to North Carolina (15 hour car ride for those who don't live in the US). I remember my family often getting together at our house in MA when I was super young, but no one ever really visited us in NC except my aunt. Other than her, no one attempts to make contact with me. Not grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, or anyone. I don't even remember what some of them look like. 

Some of them have blamed ME for this. Saying that I'm not willing to call or visit them. I'm 20 years old. I have never had a car so I can't singularly visit them and my parents are usually pretty tight for money and never go up north anymore. I received my first cellphone at 16 but I've never been given any relatives' numbers and, because it had been so long, I really never thought about reconnecting. 

Now, I am engaged to a lovely guy who has a lovely family that helps and supports me more so than my own. They helped me move in and out of college and have opened their home to me more than I can say. One year, I was invited to stay with them for Thanksgiving and I agreed. I texted my mom that I wouldn't be coming home for Thanksgiving this year and told her the reason. She responded with ""You'll have to ask your dad about that"". ""Ask"" is what confused me as I haven't been dependant on them for anything especially since I do not live under their roof and haven't for two years. So I texted my dad the same thing, come to learn he had told my grandmother we would be at their house for Thanksgiving. 

I told him he'd have to tell her I wouldn't be coming. He responded ""They won't be alive forever"". That's when I really started thinking ""Would I even care?"" Sure my parents would be upset and I'd be there to support them but my actual grandparents' deaths would not affect me in anyway. Nor would anyone elses' other than immediate family. 

Am I the asshole when they have never once tried to communicate with me, have blamed me for not visiting/communicating, and I'm just kind of done with them at this point? Why should I attempt communication after 13-14 years of silence? Why should I care? Just because we share genetic material?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I've talked to him before and it seems like he can hear well enough with his hearing aids. I don't have to speak louder than usual as I would with my grandpa.

The issue is that he has this little dog that will bark at literally everything. We live on a somewhat busy street so anytime someone walks or drives by the dog will start barking. Even with headphones or the TV on I can hear this dog. My wife doesn't think it's that big of a deal but she gets home later in the day when the dog has been brought inside for the night. She told me I should just leave it alone, but honestly I'm at my wits end listening to the barking.

We also have 2 dogs of our own and this constant barking can really agitate them. Our dogs will occasionally bark back but I always make an effort to stop them and they will rarely do it anymore. Anytime I let my dogs in our back yard, my neighbors dog will just run up and down the fence line barking at them, I can leave my dogs out for an hour and this dog will literally do that for the entire hour.

c4sper	2019-06-24 18:12:03	johnnyhavok2	AITA for wanting to pro-rate a friend's rent for moving out 2 week early?	"**Backgound**

My [32m] fiance [28f] and I offered an old high school friend [28m] room and board while he moved up to the same state/city we live in. The initial plan was to allow 3 months tops which we believed was fair in giving him time to get a new job and place to stay. 

It's now 3 months later, and my friend isn't out yet, but has a place lined up around middle of next month. Already signed and everything, just needs about a month longer before he can move in.

I spoke with my fiance about it and we agreed he could stay one more month as long as he paid us 600 dollars rent. I consider this a fair rent as my fiance and I pay 2100 a month for the house. Discussed that option with my friend who agreed wholeheartedly to it and paid us the money the day after. 

**One Week Later**

My friend mentions to my fiance that he will be able to move out much sooner than expected as the prior tenant in the apartment he picked up is leaving early. She comes to me telling me his plans, and I bring up the need to pro-rate the rent as, to me, that's the only fair and right thing to do. 

At the mention of this, she digs in her heels and says that's out of the question. She explains that in a standard renter situation you don't get ""pro-rated"" simply because you can move out sooner than you plan for. 

I, however, think that's an immoral thing to do because this isn't a ""standard"" renter situation. We made a verbal agreement for 600 dollars for one month staying with us. So if he stays half the time, I think he should only have to pay half.

My fiance didn't accept my argument and has since stated that she won't be sending a dime to him and if I want to ""pro-rate"" it then that's coming out of my personal money and not our shared account. This turned into a substantial fight.


**Am I the asshole here?**

Is her position the completely reasonable way to handle this and I'm just being absurd?

So bitch 1 is bossy, clingy, and think everything should involve her. Everything MUST revolve around her. Me and group of friends ditched her around her birthday and we felt bad. She cried and all while we ate at McDonalds together across the street. 

She's not a nice person at all. Bitch 1 has caused emotional PAIN to me and emotionally manipulated/guilt-tripped my friends and I to buy her gifts, let her tag along trips when she doesn't pay for it. Even swindled our money when we ate a restaurant before. And borrowed money without paying it back. 

I feel so damn happy its like peeling a price tag CLEAN off the bottom of a glass cup. Bitch 1 came crying about being alienated and ignored to me before. Said she was sorry about before, and wanted to reconcile. Blah blah. even said I she felt close to me. I have never been SO close to breaking into maniacal laughter. 

All i could think of is ""YOU.DESERVED.THIS."" Nowadays I don't even see her or talk to her anymore and it feels FUCKING GREAT. I feel guilty for her, sure. But a part of me is BEAMING for peeling that scab-equivalent of a person off me.

c4snev	2019-06-24 18:08:57	levinson2504	AITA for cutting contact with a friend	"So around 4 years ago, I was elected as the class representative and there was another female CR. That day I spoke to her and asked her number just for representative work. This will come to bite me later on. We did start talking a lot but I knew we weren't compatible even as friends because she liked things which I hated a lot. Was superstitious,was so innocent which would worry me that someone might take advantage of her, I just knew we'd just be normal friends till our cllg. Our classmates started linking us as a couple and what not. Didn't affect me but she'd act weird about it. 

Then after a few months she sends me this quiz, she filled it first, there was a column where she rated me 9 in closeness of relationship. We just started talking I was confused, prolly should've told the truth but I wrote a 9 as well. I admit this mistake but since that day she asked me for everything. Of course she liked me more than I did, but I didn't tell her because I thought it'd be rude. Every small thing she'd call me. I'd comply because I thought it'd be rude not to, and also if I was bad at conversation, even bad at saying no. There were times where I expressed that I don't want to do it, you're forcing me to, but it's as if she ignored it for some reason. She'd ask me again after some time. It was so uncomfortable for me whenever I got her texts. I have an OCD of not replying quickly which made it worse. 

And then out of nowhere, when she was about to go abroad for studies, she asked me out. This was 2 years after we first spoke. I told her no, yet she was persuasive. I could barely keep my sanity talking to her. It might sound extra but this is how I felt at the time. I stopped contact with her. Her parents called me a couple times which Idk how to see it.

I've finally told her I don't want to talk to her anymore, this happened in the 3rd year. I've asked people about this because I feel guilty, it might be more my fault Idk. I thought I'd just move on but still I have some guilt in me. My friends tell me i was right but most girls I've asked take her side. I wanted a neutral opinion on this. So am I the asshole?"

c4slzp	2019-06-24 18:06:49	DabouC	WIBTA for bringing up a topic to my dad knowing it will turn into an argument?	"To give some context to my story, my mom and dad separated when I was 5 and my dad met his wife when I was 6. She lived in Miami and we live in France so she didnt properly move in with my dad until I was 10. 

Since the day she moved in she made my life a living hell, she would kick me out of my dad's bedroom (which was the only room with TV), she would be an ass if I left my shoes outside the door coz it had rained. She would constantly call me a bad behaving kid, when i was absolutely doing nothing but being a kid. It sort of really fucked me up because I never managed to feel like I was home after that. It felt like i was in her house with her rules. 

I am 21 now and she still has no job and only does shopping and goes to the hair dresser. They have two new kids who are living a dream childhood without any limit or borders. 

Since I live in another city for the past 4 years, I only see my family a total of 2 weeks a year. And when I do my dad has to rent myself and my boyfriend an Airbnb. I find this ridiculous because I still have m bedroom at my dad's and that it cost so much money. His only excuse is that my stepmom doesn't want me to give a bad example to mu little sister with my boyfriend sleeping in the house. I've been with him for 2 years and we are getting civil partnership next month. 

Basically I want to ask my dad if now that my boyfriend and I are almost married, if I could finally sleep in my own house when I visit my family. My grandparents live next door so I could also be close to them and also spend time with my siblings who I never see. 

I know that his answer will be a no because I have insisted on the topic many times before but I just feel like if I dont insist now I'll never be able to come visit my dad even when I'm married with children. 

So would I be the asshole for bringing up the topic, knowing it will he a no and that it will create a fight?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4sl03	2019-06-24 18:05:11	Fantismal	WIBTA if I asked someone trying to be helpful to back off?	"I run a fandom discord server of 600+ people. I met this person, Sam, at a fandom festival put on by the local libraries. We played Dungeons and Dragons and hit it off. Sam and Laura, another player there, wanted to get together to play some more, but the DM was from out of town. I offered to DM some one- or two-shots, and invited an old-school player, Keith, to be our third player. I made it clear that 3 players was the minimum I wanted to run a session for, so the more the merrier.

First attempt to get together, and Laura had a sprained ankle so had been unable to access her computer to get details. She also cancelled morning-of due to vomiting and didn't want to pass the flu to the rest of us. Understandable, even though I had spent hours prepping for the game. Sam came over that day anyway, we played some board games, and I learned that Sam was interested in the same fandom I ran the server for. I invited Sam in and they settled into an active member of the group.

We rescheduled D&D. Keith was unavailable for a couple weekends, so we arranged a month later. 

And then on the Thursday before, Sam revealed they were moving to Colorado that weekend and wouldn't be able to join. We lived in Michigan.

Cue last minute panicking and scrambling, because Keith was recovering from cancer and had been waiting to play D&D again for at least a year that I knew of, and probably a good ten years before that. I was not about to cancel again! However, after cajoling a neighbor into being our pinch-hitter, Laura cancelled two hours before game time and I had to call off the game AGAIN. After canceling, I curled up with my cat and cried for an hour because I'D been looking forward to this, had been investing a lot of time and energy into preparing for it, and I felt thoroughly betrayed.

Sam continued to be active in my discord server. They apologized for ditching last minute, but they had really hoped they wouldn't have to move. I was still upset, and they were trying to be over the top helpful to make up for it. They have decided to civilian-moderate (telling people where to move off-topic conversations and trying to mediate tensions between members) and they comment on everything I write, even though they jumped into my story halfway through and aren't understanding it because they didn't read the start. I can't do anything on that server anymore without them being RIGHT THERE, and I'm still annoyed with them.

A group on my server had become invested in another fandom, my all-time favorite. I offered to start a sister server for that fandom but said I would need mods.

Sam jumped up immediately. ""ME! I'LL DO IT!""

My gut reaction was ""no way in Hell, because then I'LL hate the new server."" But I'm aware that's not fair to Sam.

So... WIBTA if I private messaged Sam and said ""look, I'm still working through feeling betrayed and abandoned, so while you're welcome to participate in these servers, I won't be asking you to help me run them""?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I feel guilty about this because I used to work with customers and I hated when they got tense with me, but I just lost my shit.  I called UPS to arrange to pick up my package at a UPS location.  When I finally got to an agent, she needed me to spell my last name for her and got confused about the spelling (little pet peeve of mine but not a big deal).  Then she needed me to repeat the tracking number a couple times.  Then, without asking me, she arranged to have this package picked up at a location nowhere near me, in a bad part of town.  Also, I looked on Yelp and this location is permanently closed.  I told her ""That won't work, that store is closed permanently so i can't pick it up there, and it's far away from me anyway.""  She repeatedly said she needed to put me on hold for 1-3 minutes, then would come back and just repeat the address I should pick it up (the store that's closed).  I told her to please change the delivery address to a UPS store that was open and close to me.  She said to call the retailer of the package and have them do it.  I politely asked to be transferred to someone else since she didn't seem to understand anything I was saying.  She told me that wasn't possible.  So I told her she had been incredibly unhelpful and I didn't want to speak to her anymore, and I hung up. 

&#x200B;

I feel kinda guilty, because English was very clearly not her first language (I'm actually shocked she qualifies to work in customer service in English) and I didn't want to be mean.

I have always been opened to the idea of introducing a third into our relationship and so has he. It has nothing to do with putting a spark in our marriage or anything like that, we are both 23 and have been married for a couple months shy of 3 years and we have been together a total of 5 years. Sometimes last year when we had our last apartment we started openly dating to see if we could find our wonderful third person, after a while I found someone whom I dated for about 2 months and we broke up because she couldn’t continue the relationship. So I stopped dating because I was a little hurt and I let my husband continue the search alone, he found someone and after a couple of weeks of talking things had to end because she was not completely truthful on certain aspects. That’s as far as we got into bringing someone, after that things in our life got rocky money wise and we basically went homeless and started living with my mother in law, she doesn’t know about our openness in our marriage and I don’t think she would agree and we also don’t have the privacy required to have that type of relationship so we both agreed that the search would stop until we could meet certain standards and we had also spoken about being open and honest through the whole process beforehand. Well today when I woke up I glanced over and I noticed my husband was texting in a platform I didn’t recognize and when he noticed I was awake he shut it off. Eventually I made myself into his phone and saw he downloaded 3 dating apps, and when confronted about it he said that he had just done that earlier in the morning, at this point it was 11:30 am and I had already been up for over and hour so there was a reasonable amount of time to tell me at least that the apps were downloaded. He said he was sorry but I feel like my trust was betrayed and the way he’s acting about it makes me feel like I’m overreacting, 

Update: I forgot to add that I got us these phones about a month and a half ago we have never had issues with trust so both of our phones have each of our faces in recognition and we both have the same passcode (not a trust thing we are just bad with numbers so we have a set 4 digit that we both will remember) I didn’t snoop through his phone because I have always had permission to open and actively use any celular device he owns as he does with me, so when I went through his phone it was not behind his back he was sitting right next to me and saw everything I was doing and reading."

This would be all well and good, and I'd even be excited, but there's one small caveat; my mom's not normal. She's manipulative, spiteful, rude, hateful, switches moods at the drop of a hat, etc. And that's only being *nice* about exactly what kind of person she is. When my brother was going to get his new car, she offered to put down a couple hundred, and the rest of the money that went to that car was from me and my brother (it was also around the time my mom had a psychotic episode and threatened to kick us both out, so I gave my brother most of the money I saved up, which was $2,000, so he could get a car and get us out of there, which ended up not needing to happen anyway). Now every time she gets mad, she tries to flex how her couple hundred dollars got him a car (compared to everyone else, who put down at least a thousand or more) and how it's *her* car even though the title not only isn't in her name, but *I* contributed more for it than she ever did so if anyone should flex, it's absolutely not her. And she feels like she should be able to take it from him just because she gets pissed off.

I don't want to deal with any of that. I know she will definitely hang it over my head if she is involved in any part of the process of getting me a car. If she even gets to contribute a penny, it's ""her"" car, no questions asked, and she would take it away just because she wants to, no questions asked.

I’ve also gotten a few massages on vacations and have never experienced this “issue” before. 

I tried a massage place in my new town and while the experience wasn’t necessarily bad, the massage therapist talked a lot. She basically had me doing breathing exercises the entire time. “Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Release all of the toxins and negativity....” Things like that. The massage itself didn’t feel bad but I definitely found it harder to relax with all of her added instructions. 

Would it be rude for me to ask the next person I get not to do that or should I just try and find another place? I’m not sure what proper massage protocol is."	No A-holes here	0	0
c4sad6	2019-06-24 17:48:34	RealAvation	AITA for not wanting to pay someone else’s rent?	Hey guys, I’m new here, so if I do something wrong please let me know. In my current living situation, I live with my girlfriend (GF), her dad (D), and D’s new girlfriend (GF2), and GF and myself pay rent to D. GF2 just moved in, about two weeks ago, and she is okay enough, however, we were just told by D that she was moving in. No discussion or room for us to voice our concern, it was just a commandment. Yesterday D came to us and told us that GF2 didn’t have enough money to pay her share of rent (which is still TBD, and as of right now GF and I pay $650/mo total, without GF2’s share in play), so we have to pay her rent as of right now. I don’t want to pay for somebody else’s rent, especially since I didn’t even get a voice in her moving in (and bringing her two big dogs with her in an already small house). Also, should I tell D that I’m not going to pay her rent this month, and she needs to get her crap together and pay it herself? I feel like I’m not being unreasonable, am I?	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4sa44	2019-06-24 17:48:10	Dekar17	WIBTA if I told my parents that I won't take care of them when they get older?	"Long time visitor, first time poster, yadda yadda yadda.

English is not my first language, sorry about any mistakes.

&#x200B;

I'll try to keep the story as short as possible.

I never lied to my parents about who I am or anything like that, and when I discovered that I'm gay I wouldn't be hiding that from my parents either, I couldn't stand the idea of living a double life and lying to them.

Ever since I came out as gay when I was 19 (I'm 25 now, male), my relationship with my parents has changed a lot, after that, everything wrong with me was because I was gay: ""He's lazy because he's gay"" ""He don't want to find a job because he's gay"" ""He has those psychological problems because he's gay"", it got worse to the point that they they kicked me out.

&#x200B;

I had to live with a friend for about 5 years, and even with that, i still visited them every weekend and never asked for money, I did it because I wanted to see them, and they visited me about twice in those 5 years. Since then, I got a scholarship (and started college), got a job and everything got better. I take them to trips, nice restaurants and stuff, help with bills and emergencies(even though I don't live with them anymore), I pretty much do everything I can to be a good son and keep a good relationship with them, even though I'm still hurt (even over 4 years later).

Sometimes when we are together they say stuff like ""I hope when i'm old and you're taking care of us, you (proceed to say something I have to learn how to do or something like that)"", but in reality, I don't want to take care of them, and I don't feel like I should.   
I can help them with money, I can visit, I can pay for medicine(if necessary) but I would never want to live with them ever again.

I would never take care of someone who wasn't there for me when I needed the most.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I told them that? I really don't want to go into a deep conversation with them about what I typed here because ""I can forgive but I won't forget"".  
I'm planning on just saying ""Look, I'm not going to take care of you guys, I might even pay someone to do it if you guys need, but I won't do it myself"".

Recently (about 3 months ago) I got a new job and it has been quite stressful for me, but I've still made a huge effort to not show it around my home. Around 3 or so weeks before my 33rd birthday my wife asked me what I wanted to do for it. I told her I'd just like to come home (I would get back from a business trip on my birthday around 5pm), have a nice dinner, watch a movie with us and the kids, then maybe have a celebratory cigar by the pool. I am not one to organize parties for my birthdays and usually end up doing something pretty casual and relaxing. 

However, my wife for the week or so before my bday was asking me certain questions which gave me the hint of her organizing a bday party. I told her ""please don't throw a party or anything, I just want to relax and hangout with my family"", and she insisted that she wasn't planning anything and I had nothing to worry about. For a total of probably 4 times I said exactly what I wanted to do for my bday, just eat dinner and relax. Fast-Forward to my bday, the expected bday texts from family and friends, I had a 5 hour flight home and I hate flying. Once I land my wife picks me up from the airport and I had never been happier to be going home. I noticed my wife smirking some of the ride home, but I didn't think anything of it because I was so relieved to finally being able to go home and relax.

We park at home and I can't wait to go inside and just have a nice meal with my kids, and watch a movie. My wife opens the door to a gathering of 30+ friends and they all scream surprise and all that jazz. She then tells me my kids are spending the night at her sister's. I won't even be able to see my kids on my birthday. After about 15 minutes of saying hello to our friends, I walk out of the house and drive to a restaurant to have a meal with my old high school buddy (my sister in law never replied my text asking if I could come see my kids). I missed 4 phone calls from my wife and I texted ""I'm having dinner with \*friend's name\*"". She's been mad at me for the past 3 days, saying I'm an asshole for leaving my own party and everyone was upset.

Staff member says ""yes"" not thinking the guy is asking for a bathroom for him to use. I overheard them and I say to the guy ""we don't have a public bathroom"" and then I direct him to one nearby. We have a staff bathroom way in the backroom and because we handle food we are literally not allowed to have customers behind the counters.

Guy snaps back at me sorta yelling and nasty ""I don't believe you!"" I respond ""why not?"" He keeps yelling saying something along the lines of I'm a liar. I say to him ""do you see a door labeled bathroom anywhere around here?"" He responds ""no"" and then goes ""I can keep this up all day long buddy!"" I guess meaning that he can keep yelling at me. I'm in my thirties and he's in his late fifties. I often get mistaken for a much younger staff member and they think I have to take this type of treatment because I'm afraid of getting fired.

 I respond ""yeah please get out of my business."" The guy looks startled and goes ""you own the business?"" My response is ""please get out."" He tried to apologize to me but I just tossed him out.

I've had this happen to me a handful of times. I tell a customer ""no"" they get pissed and yell at me. I ask them to leave and they get super remorseful and try to apologize. I feel like they are only apologizing because they got called on their bullshit and are getting ejected. Not because they are sorry for being an asshole to me."	Not the A-hole	1	0

c4rylj	2019-06-24 17:29:58	Gonegoober	AITA for telling my sister her boyfriend can’t come on our family vacation?	"Throwaway for because my family knows my other account.

    This year my family finally has been able to go on a vacation to the beach. We haven’t been in over half a decade so this is really our chance to get away. A few days before we left for the trip my sister asked me if her boyfriend can come (because my parents made her ask me if I was ok with it) and I said no. Now for a bit of backstory, my sister had been dating her boyfriend for about 6 months. Every day for the past month and half he has been at our house. When I say every day I mean everyday. She doesn’t ask anyone if he can come and just lets him over without considering anyone else. They do virtually nothing except for going and spending our money on junk food and “cuddle”. My sister doesn’t do anything around the house when he is here. Plus we also have to provide meals for him as well (his family is perfectly capable of feeding him). 

   At this point I was getting pretty tired of him being there everyday and having to provide for him so I told her no this is my time to get away and spend it with my family. She handled it somewhat well and kinda pouted off. Now fast forward to now and the trip is about half way over. My sister approaches me again to ask if she could bring her boyfriend over (again because my parents made her consult me because this is a family vacation) and once again I said no. Now this is where it gets hectic. She now starts yelling at me telling me I have gotten a day without him and so he should come and “do my wants not matter to you”. I replied with “ you have received your wants without consulting anyone for the past month and a half and now I want just a week away from him” (plus where are staying can’t support anymore people). She then stomped of and yelled at me some more.

   At this point I don’t know if I was an ass or not so I’m here now. So AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

As we were about to take the lift up to the bowling alley, a guy came to us and started a conversation. He said ""Good, u guys waited for me. "" which was rather strange as we didnt know him at all. He looked in his mid 40s and is dark skinned, and wore clothes that reminded me of a homeless guy. As we were bowling, he came up to us randomly and was making comments on how we played, like ""nice shot"" and ""you better win"" which was nice but I found it unnecessary and rather strange.. I then spoke to my friend quietly ""just ignore him"" but the man saw me or maybe heard me, getting the gesture that we didnt want him here and just left. He was all alone at that time.

It took me a few days to realize that I just disappeared completely and that people were waiting for me to come back. But even then I still did not have the motivation to return, a few other things unrelated were also happening in my life at the time. So I never came back even to say goodbye

Yesterday I accidentally opened my old discord only to find a bunch of unread messages from my former friends (I refused to read them then). It made me feel guilty that I just left without saying a word and that others were worried about me. I'm thinking of coming back, clearing it up and maybe even returning for good. 

I got no idea how me returning would make everyone feel and if I might be welcomed back or hated for ghosting and expecting forgiveness.

I mean I’m disappointed but not really surprised because I had a flaky shitty friend in high school (I graduated last year) and so I haven’t had birthday plans with friends in a very long time, but it’d just be nice to have them again. When I was 13, I went to see a movie with two best friends and we had such a good time (as of today, one of those friends decided to start hating me and everyone else, and the other hasn’t talked to me in years).

As for what I posted, I didn’t want to sound guilt trippy. I posted on my Snapchat story “does anyone want to hang out with me? all my friends cancelled and it’s not their fault but i just wanna get out of the house not by myself today”, or something along those lines.

But yeah. I have no plans today except for staying trapped and isolated in my dark room on my phone and laptop, which is what I do every fucking day and I hate it.

c4rsi6	2019-06-24 17:20:33		AITA for wanting to boycott my Cousin’s 4th-of-July-weekend-ruining wedding?	"My cousin has always been a bit of an odd ball in our family, thinking she (we’ll call her Nancy) is more important than the rest of us.  
She’ll be the 3rd of 4 cousins to get married, and looking like she’s the last one.

Anyways, Her wedding is in a little town without hotels/Airbnb type rentals, nearly an hour away from a town big enough to stay the night.  She booked the venue and let family know immediately.  So my wife thought to ask about the room block.  
Nancy: there is none, the wedding party took all 8 of the rooms. Maybe you can find a place in xxx (the city nearly an hour away)
Wife: (annoyed but working on alternatives) ok, will there be a shuttle in and out of xxx big city for anyone who will be drinking?
Nancy:  no, we aren’t providing a shuttle service.

So not only do we have the 4th of July weekend taken away from us, but we aren’t even able to cut loose because of logistics and proximity to the nearest town.

Also, come to find out that the only reason the wedding is over the holiday weekend is because ‘it was the only weekend that a groomsman could make it’.  This wouldn’t bother me if it were the best man.  And even so, I learned the maid of honor isn’t even Nancy’s sister, it’s her longest friend!  I’m not sure why that bugs me, but it does- maybe it’s the straw that broke the camels back.  Maybe it shows Nancy’s level of thoughtfulness, or lack there of.

So, AITA for being upset about having one of, if not the best summer weekends taken from me because of a cousin prioritizing her soon to be husbands friend over the entire wedding guest list’s weekend???

Oh. One last thing. Nancy couldn’t believe her venue was available so ‘they had to pull the trigger’.  No sh*t Nancy, no one else wants to get married over a major holiday and extended weekend!"		1	0
c4rsgz	2019-06-24 17:20:30		AITA for ending a long-time friendship for “flaking” out an an event?	"My ex-best friend had invited me to a girls night out, getting tickets to a show. During this time, I had just moved out of my mum’s house to a new apartment, so this was a huge transition for me. I hadn’t really kept in touch due to the move, but prior to the move, we would see each other every weekend. It’s been two weeks since I moved and I’ve been limiting my social interaction with everyone in general, except my roommate, who we are mutual friends with.

Upon making plans for this night out, ex-bff informs me that another mutual friend / her nephew, whom I had an unresolved issue with, was also coming. This particular friend pulled out on moving in with me and my roommate and did it in a very shady way. I won’t get into those details, but basically I was going to spend a night with him, when we still had issues. I wasn’t mentally prepared for that, given the situation and transitioning with the move, so I respectfully declined a week in advance and explained everything, without going into details of the issues because that’s my business with her nephew. I was SO MINDFUL of her, being careful of everything I said, apologizing and even trying to make it up to her in the future. Also, doing all this a week in advance so she can find someone to replace me since she bought ticks already.

This bitch FLIPS out on me.

She basically accuses me of flaking out on her, using our friendship as a means of convenience. I’ve been friends with this woman for 10 years, since we were in high school. I saved her from being bullied, opened up my home and family to her, even bringing her into my friend group. I loved this woman. Upon flipping out on me, she even brought up the issues I had with her nephew, stating that what I did to him was “FUCKED UP”. I haven’t even talked to her about that issue so I was confused as to why she’d think that way about me but that was the straw. She basically used information that she fabricated herself to hurt me. Constant, blatant disrespect. 

I know that my choice in ending this relationship was a long time coming, but the events following me declining to join her for a girls night out was the cherry on top. We tried to patch things up, but I no longer could foresee anything good anymore since that incident. Maybe I could’ve stuck around to see her change because I think she is capable of that. But the way she treated me and refused to believe that this was a toxic behavior that she has made me think otherwise and I cut her off.

c4rsb4	2019-06-24 17:20:15	wasting_my_youth	AITA for not giving my classmate the questions for the history exam which I had taken before him?	"We had a history A level mock exam last Tuesday morning for the Russia section. My classmate Jared wasn't in for it because he was apparently ""sick."" Then he had his exam rearranged to this Monday afternoon. He asked me multiple times last week to tell him the questions on the paper but I said no repeatedly because it wouldn't be fair for me to just give him the topics he needs to study, in my opinion. I wasn't told the questions to the exam paper so why should he be told them? Also he had 5 extra days to study for the exam than I did (because he did it later than me), I gave him condensed revision notes weeks ago but he clearly didn't use them, and I did already tell him the questions for the mock examinations in January, I don't need to do the same thing for these ones in June. Plus this is only one half of the exam, we did do a different test on the tudors which he could get a good mark for too. Plus he's doing a resit year so he already learned all this material last year whereas this is the first year I've done this course.

My classmate Jared went around telling everyone that I'm a horrible person  because I didn't tell him the questions and they all agreed with him and called me ""sly"" and ""mean."" Then just before his exam I went over to him to wish him luck and said I didn't want to be rude and then he retorted, saying I was being rude for not giving him the questions and I was being immature and he said that everyone else is more offended and annoyed at me not giving him the questions than he is. Also his friends said that I don't want him to do well which isn't true, I want him to do well through revision and exam practice, not through cheating. He hasn't even given a practice paper in to either of the teachers either in preparation for the exam.

I really don't get it. 1) It doesn't need to be this big of a deal. 2) He should have revised and I'm not breaking the rules by telling him the questions and giving him an unfair advantage.

c4rrbu	2019-06-24 17:18:43	FeelsBadDad	AITA for telling my stepdad he can't be alone with my daughter?	"Back story. My parents got divorced when I was 4 years old and my mom got married to a very loud, violent person. I remember occasions where I was forcefully put in the corner, forced to eat food that I did not enjoy the taste of (to the point of throwing it back up onto my plate and being told to sit there until it's gone), and waking up to numerous arguments which eventually led to my mom's screaming and crying. For a young kid, that was some terrifying shit to me.  

My stepfather also has PTSD and bipolar. He's rather short-tempered so anything that anyone does sets him off. For example, if my mom pisses him off in the car, he will tell her to stop and he'll get out and walk the other way while my mom is driving alongside the road for miles trying to stop him.

Now I'm almost 30 years old and I had my first little daughter. Our relationship has gotten better but it's still hard for me. They come out for the weekend, and although hosting is extremely stressful, we understand that they want to see their first granddaughter. My stepfather still has his temper, but as an adult I rarely experience it. The only thing that we currently have a problem with is that he's rather aggressive when it comes to holding her. ""Here, give her to me,"" he'll demand from my wife. Almost like a forceful, unkind ""I insist."" He loves her, but it's a lot to handle his personality.

Now, my mom and stepfather used to live about eight hours away from me. With the recent news of my daughter, they took it upon themselves to move about an hour away from us. Weekend visits to visit the baby when you live 8 hours away is perfectly understandable, and for the first time in my life I'm seeing my mom and stepdad in higher frequencies than ever before. (I lived with my grandparents from 4th grade onward.)

During a weekend visit my wife and I were getting  frustrated with how we were being treated as hosts and we were burned out from consistently hosting them. With them moving an hour away, we thought it would be wise to have a talk with them about some basic boundaries to keep the relationship healthy. A few of those rules were no more weekend visits where everyone is staying the night since they are now only an hour away. Day visits are just fine. Another boundary was that my stepfather not being allowed to watch my daughter alone. Having PTSD and bipolar mixed with my horrible upbringing with him, we felt it necessary to draw the line before anything potentially happening. If we let him babysit alone and something were to happen, something even as small as him getting frustrated and treating her in  an aggressive manner, I would never let myself live it down. I'm extremely protective of my child, and I don't want to her to experience any of the negative aspects of my stepfather, while still having her know her Grandpa and love all of the good qualities about him."

"Hello Reddit, professional waitress, wanna be actress here. Using a throwaway account because I don’t want to be misconstrued as being self promoting. 

About a month ago I was just getting off work at 8am and my best friend dropped by to ask me if I’d like to go to an audition with her. I wasn’t really in the mood but she heard the director himself (not an A list name, but one most film buffs would know) was going to be there she she was so nervous. I agreed. We did the typical wait around in a hot stuffy room and by the time her call came up I wanted to peel my skin off I was so tired and miserable. She did ok and they closed the call. As I was gathering my stuff up a secretary came out and asked if I’d read yet. I said no I wasn’t auditioning for the part. She said the casting director wanted to meet me and asked if I have my SAG card. I said yes so she cleared the rest of the waiting area (including my friend) and she said he wanted to see me sitting exactly like I had been all morning. Then he had me read. I guess struggling, pissed off waitress who wanted to peel her own skin off was exactly what though the director was looking for (the actual director did not show) and he offered me the part. I asked “no call back?” He said no, the job is yours. I accepted. 

I didn’t tell my friend on the way home but she was obviously curious about why they cleared the room and wanted me to stay behind. I lied and said the secretary thought I went to high school with her daughter. I just wasn’t ready to talk about it yet. 

Well we start table reads this week. I had to tell my friend. She is furious with me. She says she can never trust me again and that I’m a liar. I don’t think I would be acting like this if she got a part and I didn’t. But was I the asshole?"	Asshole	0	0

Long story made short, 1.5 years ago he bought me a Christmas present, he hyped it, I got disappointed and ""ruined"" the evening by being sour. 4 months after Christmas, I turned 30, he didn't celebrate my birthday in anyway because, and I quote ""I don't feel like it"", all this because his previous present he gave to me flopped.

Now to be fair, I do agree that I could have been more gracious about my reaction. I did not say anything bad to him. I basically went to the bathroom sobbing and then when he saw my reaction, I explained to him how I felt tricked and he got angry with me. So it's not like I was being a jerk telling him that he sucks at buying presents, I did really like the training pants he gave me, and I told him that several times. It's just the way he made me believe that he would do this super romantic thing for me and then realise it was just a joke for him, that made me really sad and made me feel stupid and tricked to ever believe he would do something that romantic for me.

I have told him multiple times that I still think me being sour one evening after feeling tricked and disappointed by his overly hyped present, is not reason enough to ignore my birthday, especially since I turned 30, did not feel good about turning 30, and also had a rough year.

To clarify something, I have no interest in expensive fancy presents, just some kind of acknowledgement that it was my birthday, that he likes me and so on. He could have taken me out for a dinner, movie night, something, anything. Instead he blamed me for being an entitled bitch because I wasn't jumping of joy of his previous gift, and therefor did not deserve a birthday celebration from him.

So now, almost 1.5 years later we are still arguing about this. In the beginning he thought all of this was 100% my fault. After the previous AITA and the verdict was ESH, he changed his mind that the fault is 50-50 between us. I do not agree, I feel that he started the whole thing by setting up high expectations for me and then not being able to handle my disappointment after his ""joke"". And that should not result in being punished for by not getting any love on my birthday. And since my explanations doesn't help him understand or he simply just doesn't care about how I feel, and he much rather listens to strangers on the internet, I've turned to you fellow humans.

If you feel like I was the biggest crook here with my reaction to his Christmas gift then vote **YTA**.

If you feel we are equally bad, 50-50 exactly, please vote **ESH**.

If you feel that the biggest blame is on him, then please vote **NTA**.

If you feel that you want more information, then ask a clear question and I will try to answer it as truthfully as I can."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c4ronz	2019-06-24 17:14:34	captainmarchingband	WIBTA if I quit this job	"I recently graduated from high school and took a part time job at the company my dad works for. (Separate from the job I already have). The job includes very long hours (13-14 hour days) and hard manual labor. I’m not afraid of hard work but some things have happened in the 2 weeks I’ve been here that make me feel like it’s best for me to quit. 

I got the job in the beginning to earn some money for college and it pays better than my current job (I love my current job, have had it for 2+ years and want to continue) for which I was supposed to have gotten a raise about 5 months ago but didn’t meet some very stupid requirements. 

Like I said, I’m not afraid of hard work or manual labor, but some of the guys that work here are very much not people I want to be around anymore. I’ve heard a few of them talk about their arrest warrants and other times they’ve gotten in trouble with the law. Overall, just not really people I want to be around. 

But to top it all off, last week one of them threatened to assault me and charged me because I wanted to get the job done quick and was trying to speed up the rest of the crew. I’m pretty shaken up about it, and now I’ve met with the manager and I have to file a written report on the incident. 

Anyway, it looks like I’m gonna be getting that raise at my first job soon so it will pay a little more than doing this, and that’s what I think I want to do full time. 

My only concern is that my dad helped me get this job, and told everyone here how hard of a worker I am. If I left only a few weeks after starting, it could put a dent in the reputation he’s worked hard to build at this company. 

He says that I should do what’s best for me and not to worry about him but I still don’t want to risk hurting his reputation, especially since I’ve only been here 2 weeks and some shit has already hit the fan between me and these other guys. 

TL;DR: got a job working for the same company as my dad, don’t really wanna work here anymore, but don’t want to hurt his reputation."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So me (24m) and my girlfriend (26m) have been in a committed relationship for around 8 months now (previously dated for a month or so). We know everything about eachother (including past partners and hardships) and this came across.

One of her previous duck buddies is in the same country as her because she is working there. Thing is right, she says he is only a friend but I know they had a (albeit only physical) sex connection. She feels like she owes him a visit while she is staying in the country. I said I was very uncomfortable about this but let her be because I can't control her actions.
Later I found out she wants to give him a visit in Germany too where she wants to stay at his place. I told her absolutely not gonna happen. I told her that I don't trust him and I certainly don't believe she is mature enough to not cave in to blackmail (refer back to the owing a visit part) (emotionally quite weak because of her past). 

I told her, alright babe, I love you and you know it but this shit needs to stop. We have planned to spend a week together for holiday and I told her to cut contact with this bloke or we are done and to never contact me after that.

She was upset at that, saying she loves me, would do anything for me and she would never cheat (I'm her first real relationship by the way). I gave her time of course to think (24h is plenty of time to think).

Thing is: she shows signs of only affection towards me normally. She is a pleaser and she does a lot for me, gifts me things, enjoys sexy time with me and loves my presence and her chest feels crushed when we are far away. What I mean by this is NO OTHER RED FLAGS.

2. I could move out but that would make both of us a lot less comfortable. My privacy isn't worth the financial hardship.

3. Last time I talked to her about it, she made an honest effort to give me space but it obviously still hurt her feelings. I'd like to get my alone time in a way where it's not as obvious.

I'm in my second year of high school. We recently had to go swimming with 2 classes. One of our gym teachers (40-50M) was swimming with us. We were just playing around and the guys are fighting (like one on the shoulders of the other) and trying to push each other off. The girls are just watching and talking when the teacher comes up to them and encourages them to get on his shoulders to fight against the boys. My first thought was: 'Wow, that's kind of inappropriate for a teacher to do'. All the girls were wearing bikinis etc. The girls were hesitant at first, but one girl climbed onto his shoulders. I left when that happened. When we were done swimming the other teacher asked me if I liked swimming. I was honest and said I didn't really like swimming, because the water makes me feel uncomfortable. The male teacher in response asked if I were insecure about my body. I personally don't think that that's a nice question to ask. Till now, everybody told me I should report it (even if I weren't the girl on his shoulders) but one guy told me I'd be an asshole and said there was nothing sexual behind it.

One time I asked whether I could borrow her pen and she got hurt. She said she thought we were close enough to just take without asking. Anyway, others agreed, questioned why I never accept any physical contact. Ironic because they were the cause. They called me a bad friend. Thing is, I never thought we were that close?

I mean, they all came from the same primary school while I'm new to the neighbourhood, school and everything. I thought they were closer to each other than with me and though I was just the gum stuck to their soles.

c4rdar	2019-06-24 16:57:09	peanutbuttterit	AITA for calling out a friend in public?	"I have a friend who says she’s very unhappy with her weight. She recently had a doctors appointment who declared her as morbidly obese which she says has been a wake up call.

I put her in contact with another friend of mine who’s a personal trainer. I’ve never worked with him in a weight loss capacity but he really helped me get back in the gym after surgery on my knee and has a lot of clients who have lost a lot of weight so I thought it’d be a great match.

He gave her a meal plan, a work out plan and they agreed to meet 2-3 times a week depending on each other’s availability.  Obviously I’ve not seen her diet plan, but I really doubt what she eats is included. She had three take aways last week, and when we met up over the weekend she had 2 bottles of (900 calorie per bottle) wine. 

Having spoke to my trainer friend, she’s skipped a lot of their sessions for various reasons i.e her car broke down, she’s sick, there’s been a death on the family (that one she told me was a lie). He’s been understanding but is slowly loosing his patience.

When we met up over the weekend a couple of my other friends mentioned they want to lose weight for a wedding we have coming up and were considering joining the gym we attend. When I mentioned the personal trainer, my other friend chimes in, saying he was crap, he’s mean, she’s lost no weight and he’s too demanding. 

I basically called her out saying he’s keeping up his end of the bargain, but he can’t physically drag her to the gym or slap the food out of her hand. She went very red and told me it was none of my business which is true. 

The only reason I said anything is not only is she basically lying, but I feel like she’s taking money out my friends pocket by making him out to be a shitty trainer. He relies heavily on word of mouth for new clients and I felt like she was deterring potential clients.

AITA?


**ETA: my trainer friend wasn’t tattling or anything, he asked me to pass on a ‘sorry for your loss card’ to her which surprised me bc she never mentioned a death in her family. When I passed on the card she told me she lied to get out of their session."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Then i help him set up with a girl i knew who was a friend of my girlfriend. After a few weeks he asked her out and they started dating, we would go on double dates often. That girl was in the same college i went to but my friend was on a different college so eventually she became pretty close to me. The guy had been my best friend for a long time so i trusted him, he was like a brother and i stood by him in every decision, during the times he got bullied to the time he was rebelling his parents (teenage years). They eventually fell in love, the girl was kinda outta his league but i was glad he found her. Then after a few months she found out he was cheating on him, his first girlfriend. I called him up and he started making lame excuses. I felt bad for the girl, but there was nothing i could do, i didn’t think it was my place. After all this happened i got cheated on by my then girlfriend twice, with two different guys. I was going through a rough time. I moved on after a while. Awhile later i found out my best friend cheated once again to the second girl, though i barely knew the girl and myself being cheated twice, i just started ignoring him and stopped talking to him ultimately. I just couldn’t stand the thought that someone really close to me could cheat on their SO and be so unashamed of themselves.

Me and my wife have been married 6 years now. Dated for 2 before that. We have an 18 month old boy and are looking to have another one soon. My wife works in the tech industry, she brings in about $40k a year working from home, and she loves it. She's around for the kids and still collects an income. I make about the same at an office job, but I hate it. It's boring, repetitive, and isn't even in the field that I got a degree for, which is very competitive.

After trying since college to get a job in my degree's field, I finally got a job offer. $110k/year +benefits. The problem is we'll have to move, and the hours suck. Swing shifts and working holidays, at least in the starting position. I'm over the moon, but my wife is horrified. She's afraid that with a schedule like that, I will miss all of the kids milestones, and that I won't be around enough for them. She grew up with an absentee father, so she doesn't want me to be like that. It seems like it'll be easier on the family if I stick to the 9-5.

&#x200B;

The thing is, I still want the job. The hours will suck, but I want to be able to provide for my son. We have a decent nest egg, and we'll have a large inheritance when my parents pass away, but I can't shake the feeling that that isn't enough. I get that she's afraid that I'll turn out like her dad.

"Just a little context - I share an apartment with 11 other people (crazy I know) and I just gave my landlord my two weeks and five day notice. I wanted to calculate how much I would owe him for the five days in advance.

A little about him - he is an ok landlord for the most part but shitty at resolving problems. He responds to texts and calls right away but when he agrees on a time to come meet any of us living at the apartment, he is ALWAYS without fail at least 3 hours late. Everyone is used to this so we don’t really make it a big deal. One of the many times this happened was when I was meeting him to get my keys to move in. He was 3 hours late so I was left waiting outside in the rain. Another personal problem I had with him was when he allowed me to move to a better room for a $20 price difference (paid biweekly). I went on vacation right before we agreed I would move in and when I came back he gave my bed away to someone else even though I already paid the price difference.

So for the five extra days I would be staying, I calculated that I would pay at the rate of the old room since he gave my room away and never refunded me the difference. I also expressed to him that I think I should only pay for four days instead of five since the day I moved in was one day into the biweekly period and so technically he owes me a day of rent. I wouldn’t be so calculating but he charged my old roommate to stay one night so I thought it would only make sense to give myself the free day. 

AITA for being so calculating? He reluctantly accepted and said I was right but only because he was trying to avoid conflict (I was evidently pissed off after he brought up some situations about the other roommates that had nothing to do with me but he tried to blame the issue on me)."

However, because we have been looking forward to this concert for so many years, I thought it would be cool to get VIP tickets. I asked him about it but he said they were way too pricey for him.

I won't go into specifics, but they have 1 child (3 years old) and it's been messy, with the husband an ex-vet who has been in and out of rehab and uncooperative from the beginning/contributes ZERO to their kid's life. 

&#x200B;

I (30F) can't blame my best friend for finding her own. She was married since she was 20. About 3 months after the separated, she joined all sorts of dating websites and goes on dates 2-3 nights a week with different men (her son has a nanny who watches him while she is out). 

&#x200B;

At first, I thought this was kinda of her just letting out her wild side and my husband and I would hang out with her and she'd occasionally have a date meet up with us. Well, here we are 18 months later and she still goes on multiple dates a week with different men.

&#x200B;

This past weekend, a small group of our close friends got together for my husband's 32nd birthday and she wanted to bring a date (someone who we've never met). We wanted to keep his birthday small and close-knit, so I said no to her bringing a +1. I didn't give a reason at that time.

While we were out celebrating his birthday, however, she made the comment, ""You won't let me bring a date."" I told her I didn't mean to hurt her feelings, but I didn't see the point in meeting new people all the time, especially ones I most likely would never see again. I told her I felt it was a waste of my time and effort. She was clearly annoyed at my comment, just said ""OK"", and we never really spoke of it since.

Last year only my brother saw him (because I insisted that I didn't want to go), and because of that, my dad is saying that it's my turn this year even through it isn't something about turns, it's simply because I don't want to go. My reason is personal and is absolutely a choice, it's nothing like we're out of money or i'm sick, because of my personal reason I don't want to go. The reason has nothing to do with my dad/mom either. My mom is saying that this year i'm going to see him no matter what, that she's already buying the passport and stuff. BUT I WON'T GO. She says i'm not 18 years old to make that type of decision (I am 14) but I know that's just and excuse, because last years she was encouraging me to do what I wanted, and the one who kinda forced me was my dad through emotional appeal. I know this affect my dad and makes him sad, but still,I'm not going. AITA? (I will probably not reveal the reason, but I dont think the reason matters, just my choice after the reason, but IDK, if it matters maybe i'm revealing it, i'm anonymous on reddit anyway)		1	0
c4r3lv	2019-06-24 16:41:42	Zenithtrap888	AITA for not wanting hang out with my best friends Wife	Long story short for y’all my friend always asks me to hangout which I do, we play games go to dinner etc. Now his Wife who I really don’t have much in common with don’t really have fun around her etc wants to become my friend and hangout outside of just me and my friend hanging out she wants to be more of a friend then just “My friends wife” now typically I am a nice person but with friendships and personal time when I’m not working I really don’t want spending with someone that I don’t really enjoy. This has caused both my best friend to be mad at me and her to be upset at me, since I’ve been denying her requests to hangout. Am I the asshole in this situation? Keep in mind whenever we do hangout I’m always very kind and nice to her and try to include but in my sense if someone doesn’t want to be your friend why force it? Thanks!	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4r37r	2019-06-24 16:41:07		AITA for going out with my girlfriend instead of staying at home for a family gathering	"For a bit of context, I'm 16 year old guy, living with my parents and recently got a girlfriend. My girlfriend and I were discussing a day out together over text as we have a lot of free time after just finishing exams, and so I went to double check it was okay with my parents. As soon as I mentioned it, my mum flipped out as it turned out we were having a family gathering on the same day I had organised to go out, with lots of relatives coming over for lunch to celebrate my brothers 18th which was a few weeks ago. To my knowledge, I hadn't been told about this. I had literally no idea this was happening, as I usually don't with events because my parents rarely inform me of anything yet insist they do. My mum insists that I was lying about not knowing we had a family gathering and insists she told me repeatedly, saying I just wanted an excuse to not have to socialise, because I hate family gatherings. Which is true, I really don't enjoy family gatherings. 

I start texting my girlfriend saying something along the lines of ""I'm so sorry it turns out we won't be able to go out tomorrow"" and before I can send the message, my mum then tells me I can go and that ""I'll just be miserable if I stay"" and goes on a bit of a rant, as usual. My dad didn't seem to care whether I went or not, and I think he would rather I have a fun day out instead of being stuck at home with a bunch of relatives I don't wanna talk to. 

So I go out the next day, have a good time, and all the relatives have gone when I get back late in the evening. I say goodnight to my parents and go to bed, everything seems fine. 

Turns out my mum was really pissed off with me for going, and that apparently I was selfish for not socialising with the family even though she told me I could go. She continues to insist I was lying about not knowing about the event.

My BF and I were spending the day together a couple days ago. One of our ""dating activities"" involved making triple layer brownies together. We were at his place since he had the brownie pan, and both roommates were home. His step brother was in the living room right next to the kitchen playing video games. 

Bf and I were having a good time and baking when his brother called to him from the other room. ""You're going to share, right?"" While we were going to share as there was no way the two of us could finish a whole tray of these by ourselves, I felt it was rude of the brother.

The brother hadn't offered to help or anything. He just sat on the couch playing video games and was also a bit rude when BF asked him to turn the TV volume down. 

Idk, maybe I'm being over critical? If he had asked it in a nicer way like ""Hey, would it be cool if I had some of those when they were finished?"" Or something like that, I dont think I would have had a problem.

c4r1ca	2019-06-24 16:38:11	catedoge282	AITA for getting annoyed with my boyfriend for trying to surprise me with chocolate?	"So, I'm kind of feeling super guilty here because I love the guy to bits and I knew he was just trying to do something nice, but here goes.

&#x200B;

We're both med students, but I'm a year older than him, so while he is relatively free right now, I'm studying for a major exam I have on the 15th of July. He lives 40 minutes away, so we meet 2-3 times a week. I haven't really left my house in a few days, because stress.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Since I'm done with college and I don't have a job yet, I've moved in with my parents. My dad and I don't always see eye to eye. He doesn't know about bf and would lose his shit if he found out (brown parents) and though I'm 24 and I know my dad is unjustified with regards to his attempts to police my personal life, it's just not an argument I want to get into  right now. (we've fought many times, it always messes me up.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So today I was in my pajamas, pulling another 12 hour study day, when bf called to say hello. He asked me if I wanted him to come meet me, since I was tired from studying, but I told him I had planned to do questions all evening so even though I wanted to see him, I asked him not to come. He said okay, and I got back to work.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Couple hours later, as I was having dinner with my parents, he calls me up and tells me he is outside my house and has come to get me some chocolate. Now instead of being happy that he drove 40 min to see me, I got upset, and just replied, ""oh."" He asked me if everything was okay and I told him, ""well no, this isn't ideal. I told you not to come.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He apologized immediately, and a lot, and I told him it was okay, but I couldn't stop feeling incredibly mad at him. I met him, and he gave me the chocolates, and while I wasn't mean or anything my behavior was definitely cold towards him. I didn't really talk to him much, and I've been feeling almost unreasonably annoyed about this. Luckily my dad didn't see, so no harm done, but I'm still pretty upset.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He felt incredibly bad since he had wanted to cheer me up and do something nice for me, but it backfired. I feel so guilty about making him feel sad and not appreciating the fact that he drove out just to see me and make me feel better. I know he shouldn't have disregarded my feelings, but am I TA for being cold and distant to him and annoyed at him even though he was apologetic, especially since no harm was done? It came from a good place, and seeing his face crushed is making me feel terrible. He's feeling really sad and I can't bear to see him sad, and I feel super guilty. I told him things are okay but to be honest I'm still a little annoyed and I'm guilty about being so annoyed about this, since it's a small thing. I feel like I should have handled it better, and I'm not sure if I am overreacting. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

Edit - My mom, brother and various other family members know about bf, so he isn't really a secret. Only dad doesn't know because he would react poorly so I'm not planning to tell him till after my exam. Bf knows about this."	No A-holes here	0	0

c4qy0a	2019-06-24 16:32:48	tittyroad	AITA for wanting to split up when our lease is up?	"Should be “are we the assholes” but let’s move along. On mobile.

For clarity, my boyfriend (let’s call him J) and I have been together for 3 years. His best friend (G) moved here from out of state, a year and a month ago to live with us/work here. 

J and I lived with our parents until May of last year when G moved here. The three of us got an apartment together and everything was great for ~9 months. G goes home for Christmas, comes back and J&amp;I realized we don’t spend any alone time together when G is home. On the weekends, all three of us would go out and I was starting to notice G was always talking over me, fighting to get J’s attention, and I was always pushed to walk behind them. G would complain about the stores we went to but never would suggest anything else. J noticed this as well. Around April/May, we decided that we would start making an effort to go out alone at least once a week, just for alone time. 

After doing this a couple times, we noticed G was starting to get annoyed every time J and I went out alone. From that point on, he would make passive aggressive comments about dumb shit. He makes comments that J and I’s stuff takes up more room (we are two people compared to his 1), made a comment about our new shower curtain being “too girly” even though our last one was disgusting and he refused to split a new one 3 ways because it was “fine.” He gets angry when J and I are “flirting” or goofing around. This isn’t all he does, but everything else is based around these complaints. 

I try to be understanding seeing how G moved here to be around J because they’ve been friends for ~8 years and G has no friends here. However, he’s lived here for almost a year and a half and has made no effort to make friends, meet new people, or find a girlfriend despite complaining about these things often. 

Would J and I be the assholes for wanting to move out next May when the lease is up? We’ll have lived together for 2 years and J and I will be together for 4 years."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My father recently died. Very recently. He and my mother were married over 30 years, but he was much older than she is. It also wasn't a surprise, he'd been sick for a long time.

My fiance and I both work for the same company. We have an opportunity to move to a different state for work.

Now, I hate the state that I live in and I've always wanted to leave. But my father had me very late in life, and so by the time I was old enough and independent enough to make that kind of choice, I put it on the back burner because of his poor health. I didn't want to leave while he was sick, not knowing when something might happen.

Now that he's passed away, I want to take the job and my fiance also wants to. The place we'd be moving is gorgeous, and the vibe is so different to the city/state we currently live in. Our company might break our lease for us, but if not, we wouldn't be leaving until October when the lease is up.

But my mother has been expressing wanting her kids around especially now that my father's passed and she's getting older as well. I haven't talked to her about this yet, but I feel like I would be abandoning her. I do have an older sister who just bought a house 15 minutes from her, so she's not going anywhere anytime soon at least.

c4qq69	2019-06-24 16:20:09	blue-box1255	AITA if I don’t want my dad reading aloud on a road trip?	"Apologies- I am on mobile!
This summer, my family and I will be heading up to North Carolina from Florida by car, and possibly even further (farthest we will go is Maine/DC, still by car). Just to North Carolina, the drive time is about 12 hours, with us stopping at a hotel overnight to split the trip into 2 6-7 hour ones. My dad plans on reading a Game of Thrones book aloud to us for a sizable portion of the ride there, and those books are pretty long. The reasons my dad is doing his is because he used to read aloud with his family when he was a kid, and he remembers enjoying it. He also wants to have “family time” with us in this tiny car (although IMO we will have plenty of that at our destination). None of us asked him to read aloud to us, he just said he wanted to do it, so he’s doing it I guess. 

Here’s the problem: my dad isn’t the best at reading aloud. It’s kind of hard to describe, but in short he’s far from the those people from audiobooks who read in a certain tone to make the listening enjoyable. Usually on long car rides like these, each of us spend time doing our own separate thing, because our car is small (for gas reasons) and we’re all sick of being around each other for such a long time.

c4qpql	2019-06-24 16:19:26	mypreciousssssssss	WIBTA if we sell my mooching BIL's stuff he abandoned at our house?	"A bit of backstory: My BIL lived with us, mooched off us, for about 18 months. Before he moved in with us (supposedly for a maximum of *six weeks)* he had stopped making his motorcycle payments, and after he moved in, in order for the bike not to be repo'd, we paid about $2k to catch him up on the payments. He had literally only 2 more payments to make and the bike would be his, but - we found out months later - he chose not to make them in spite of the fact he had the money. We did finally start charging him $100/week rent during the last couple of months before he moved out.

So after 18 months he finally moved out, with, of course, a big blowout between us and a dramatic scene. This was about 3 months ago. He left the motorcycle (which he had wrecked driving drunk), and a bunch of specialty hand tools.  I want the bike gone, and I want us to sell the tools and keep up to $2k of the money. Maybe more, for the hassle he put us through, including the fact that we had to delay burying my mother's ashes for *two months* because we couldn't afford it, having pissed the money away trying to ensure BIL could keep his motorcycle before she died. That was BEYOND upsetting. My husband contacted BIL after he moved out, but when he tried to contact him again last week to tell him to get his crap out of our house, the number was disconnected, and he didn't respond via FB. 

To be fair, he may not consider his property ""abandoned."" More like an entitled attitude: we're expected to keep it here for him, forever, because - I don't know, he's special? Beats the hell out of me. So now I feel like, screw it, screw *him* \- we're not his free storage unit. And I want our $2k back - that's a hell of a lot of money and we have bills to pay including debt we incurred because of him while he lived here. My husband (BIL's brother) has so far not really expressed an opinion about whether to sell.

So, if we sell the tools and contact whoever to give them the info on where to repo the bike and get it out of our yard, WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Sorry for bad formatting, on mobile.  

My brother (21) almost didn’t graduate high school, but when he did he wanted to move out to about 6 hours away from home to gain freedom. My parents helped him by paying the deposit and giving him a car, on the condition that he enroll in community college. In that time, he was arrested for DUI (smoking while driving), getting into multiple car accidents, and lying about his enrollment. My parents hired a lawyer for his DUI and allowed him to move back home. Since moving home, my brother was given the stipulation that he was to not touch any drugs (weed, etc) and to actively figure out his life, whether it was going back to school or working full time with the intent of becoming independent. 

It’s been over a year and half, and some things have come to light. While living away, my brother was heavily involved narcotics (Xanax, etc). During the time he was at home, my parents had found drugs through out the house (canisters, bongs, etc). He’s stop going to school and has a part time job, saying that he was going to get a license to get a full time job in the industry he’s entered. It’s been a few months since he’s made that decision and hasn’t studied to take the required test. When asked about his progress, he gets mad and says he’s instead decided he wanted to get investors for a business. He also has made no strides towards that goal, and instead has been spending all his time out of work “hanging out with friends,” code for going out and smoking weed/drinking/gambling. 


I(26) live long distance from the rest of my family, but have had to walk my parents through the last three years. My dad actually has clinical depression and heart pressure issues. The last few months have been especially hard, and I’ve spent a lot of time trying to calm my dad down and reassuring him while defending my brother. When I found out my brother had been lying to all of us, I called him to see if would come clean, but he kept denying his usage until I basically backed him into a corner with the evidence my parents had sent to me.

Note: I have no issues with weed. A lot of friends smoke and I’ve partaken once in a while. My gripe is that my brother had been lying to us. There are addicts who have self control with small usage of weed. My brother is not one of them. In fact, we do have a family history of bad addictions, where even alcohol can be a problem. 

After he admitted to his usage, I let him know that he’s uninvited to my wedding (he was supposed to be a groomsmen) and that if he wants to talk to me that he should contact my fiancé, as I’m no longer on speaking terms with him. I even encouraged my parents to kick him out. My fiancé supports my decision, but some of my friends said that I overreacted and took it to an extreme. So am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4qny9	2019-06-24 16:16:42		WIBTA if I excluded my cousin's BF from my engagement party?	"My fiance and I are planning a small engagement party. It's going to be just our families (grandparents, aunts and uncles) and our groomsmen/bridesmaids. Adults only.

I'm super close to my mom's family. My cousins and I were all raised together. One cousin is married and his wife and I are very close, she's a bridesmaid. Another cousin lives far away but his gf and I have hit it off every time we've seen each other, so I'm including her on the invite. My teenage cousin's gf won't be attending. This leaves one more cousin and his bf, both young adults not yet 21.

I've tried to be friendly with BF, but he makes it difficult. They have a super obscure interest, and I try to ask about it to be friendly. I'm lucky to get a one sentence answer. He doesn't talk much around my family, and when he does he can be fairly rude. But what kills me the most is how he treats my grandparents.

My grandparents are the center of our family. They have either helped raise or totally raised all their grandchildren, including my cousin. They are pretty old school Catholic, but they are always kind to BF and hospitable. They let my cousin hang his rainbow flag in his room, have always allowed BF to come over, even had BF over for Christmas Eve one year when his parents were out of town.

But he's rude to them. We went camping a couple weeks ago, and he came to our campsite and went straight to my cousin's tent. He nodded to me because I pointedly said ""Hey BF"" as he practically sprinted past us, that's it. My grandma- the kindest woman in the world- looked almost in tears as she told my mom, fiance and I that BF *never* says hello to them.

Add to that, BF was rude to another cousin, to my mother, and didn't help us pack anything when it was time to leave. This was the most interaction I've had with him, and I decided I don't want him at my engagement party. He'll be invited to the wedding (probably won't come) but I cannot bring myself to extend an invite to this event. 

I hate the way he treats my grandparents. My fiance knows they helped raise me, and he always shakes my grandpa's hand, hugs my grandma, and has had many conversations with them. So it kills me that this kid can't even say ""Hey"" when walking into *their* home (where my cousin lives rent-free). So I don't want him in my home.

AITA for excluding my cousin's BF because of his rudeness to my grandparents? I feel like my cousin will make this about being gay, but it's really not. It's about how this guy treats the most important members of our family.

c4qnwm	2019-06-24 16:16:38		AITA If I hide that I'm possibly infertile.	"I got a surgery when I was 15 for a dermoid cyst in my right ovary.The cyst ruptured ,thus endangering the ovary.

It was removed with my ovary and life was normal in a few months.My family was a constant support in this time and they were relieved I was out of danger.

However,I come from a developing country where women with such conditions are shunned to no end.

My parents are educated and don't place a woman's worth on her fertility But they told me to never tell anyone in my life about my surgery.Even to the extent of my husband (if I get married in the future)

I know that my personal medical history isn't something to be publicised.But I recently saw an AITA where a man hadn't disclosed his vasectomy to his partners.I know my situation and his are poles apart.But I'm still met with this doubt whether it's the right thing to do.

&#x200B;

I'm 19 right now and not in a relationship.I have PCOS on my left ovary(condition with a side effect of infertility).

This might be a stupid question since I'm single and everything But I see my cousins getting married and having kids, and I wonder whether in the future my boyfriend/husband will feel betrayed if I don't disclose this.

There is also the possibility that I would be shunned if I tell someone. (I definitely don't want people treating me as damaged goods)

I step on all her chargers but that’s because there’s barely any space in our room to walk around and I feel like it’s not a big deal. 3. I have been using the bathroom for hours at a time and she exaggerates it to be 4 hours but I just simply need a lot of time in there.

I feel like these are really not a big deal but she’s really annoyed at everything I do. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

The first one I have known for years but only agreed to work with him because he had no one else. He half-assed the entire thing and then decided not to turn for the last sessions and I don't think he handed anything in at the end. I offered to help as much as possible but he refused it. When he didn't turn up I messaged him and he just ignored me so I'm not bothering to talk to him anymore. The other didn't turn up for important sessions to go on dates and expected me to help him out. He still hasn't finished it and we finished months ago.

c4qfdh	2019-06-24 16:02:59		AITA for making casual partners get tested before having sex?	"I am not in a relationship and am a heterosexual single man. I do not ever do one-night stands, but occasionally I'll have sex with someone I've gotten to know, whether it's over the course of a couple of days, weeks, or months, but am not in a committed relationship with.

I'm open to friendships. Sex isn't the most important thing in the world. 

However, with people where there's mutual interest I always try to be candid that I wouldn't be comfortable having sex unless we both get tested beforehand and share the results. 

It's completely up to them. They don't have to do it. But if they choose not to (which is their right) I won't have sex as I wouldn't feel comfortable with the ""what-ifs"" in my head.

Some people this offends, as if I'm insinuating they have an STD. I'm not - I'm going to get tested as well. This is as beneficial for you as it is for me. 

Others feel that because they're not comfortable taking it I automatically assume they have an STD. I can see this. But for me that just takes sex out of the equation, not an admission of having anything.

Others it has killed the mood. Don't care. Would rather be safe than sorry.

AITA? My best friend is a resident physician at SUNY Downstate, and I am horrified by some of the STD stories I've heard. I don't want that to be me. And there is no sure way to know beforehand what everyone has."		1	0
c4qfbi	2019-06-24 16:02:55	alexdonepic	WIBTA if I cut out a few friends, most of which did nothing wrong	"So, hopefully, I can keep this kinda short and not make y'all read several novels just to get my point across. I've been in the same friend group since middle school, just for context I'm 21 now, so needless to say our little group of 4 is quite tight. I saw us more as brothers, yeah we fought but isn't that what brothers do? Anyway, so today is my birthday and I've been asking if Charlie wants to do anything for almost 2 months now. Every single time I ask I always am met with one of two things, either a collective ""yeah lemme see when I'm free"" followed by silence, or just plain on being left on read.

&#x200B;

I can't blame my other 2 friends, one is currently in China on holiday and the other one got back from Australia yesterday,  However Charlie is only like 40 minutes by train from me, I've offered to go down to him, rent a hotel room and everything just to see him for the first time in almost a year. To say I'm hurt and betrayed feels like an understatement. In an ideal world I would only cut out Charlie, however, our group is so intertwined it makes that impossible.

&#x200B;

I really do not know what to do and this isn't even the first time he's done this. He moved down to be with his girlfriend about a month ago now and he said he would visit me on his way down, putting an extra 30 mins driving + any time we spent together on it. I was excited until I got a text from him that day telling me he didn't want to drive any longer than he had to.  


Am I just over thinking this? Am I being unreasonable? I really don't know what to do, if anything.

I have been paying out of pocket with the understanding that I could be reimbursed. Well I found out that this company’s reimbursement policy is that your expense has to be at least $100 and no older than 2 months. My travel expenses have never reached $100 in 2 months so I have never been able to be reimbursed. I know it doesn’t seem like a lot of money but it adds up for me.

My coworker who also has to travel has a company issued train pass. She is supposed to leave this train pass for me to use when she’s off. She has never done this and I’ve brought it to our boss’ attention several times. He’s never done anything to solve this other than finally telling me to buy my own pass after I brought it up for the hundredth time. He would then give me petty cash to load it with.

Between the time that he finally offered some solution (albeit for me to spend more of my own money) and now, I haven’t had to travel so I haven’t bought my own pass. I also ended up giving my two weeks notice a week ago so I will not be buying a pass now.

Today, my coworker called in sick so I was told I would have to cover for her and travel to another location. I told my boss that I will instead reschedule her appointment since there is no train pass for me to use. He said “No worries.” About 5 minutes later, he forwards me our email exchange where he told me to buy my own pass. He questioned why I didn’t do this. I told him I haven’t needed to travel and at this point, I will not be purchasing one.

He didn’t say anything after that but now I feel like kind of an asshole for being so particular about this, especially since we’re not really talking about a lot of money here.

c4qau3	2019-06-24 15:55:49	HawkRyan	AITA For Letting My Puppy Go Potty On A Certain Grass/Playing Field?	"I got myself a puppy, 12 weeks old, I've got another dog so I know how annoying it is to have them pee or poo in the house constantly so I thought ok I will take him outside allot, almost all the time, now about, I wanna say 15 seconds of walking from my house is a grass field, and in the front of it are closed of gardens, now I've never seen children play on it,  partially because I normally would almost never go there with my adult dog as I walk long rounds, so the thought of children playing on it didn't cross my mind, so I let the puppy go potty there for almost 2 weeks, and he's gotten so used to it that he will not pee or poo anywhere else unless he goes on that grass field, now here is where the problem arises.

&#x200B;

Eventually weather got better and couple of kids started playing there now and then, I tried to go somewhere else with my puppy but if I don't go to that specific grass field and say walk somewhere for 30 minutes he won't do a thing and then do his potty once I go inside so I have to keep walking there until he learns to do it somewhere else, now I go to the grass field again and an angry mom walks up to me telling me to go walk the puppy somewhere else, I tell her what I explained above but she doesn't care and just walks away, the next day her husband walks up to me and tells me as well to take the puppy somewhere else, I tell him the same that I told the mother at which point he threatens me and says he will beat me up if he sees me one more time on the grass field with the puppy, at this point I'm scared and go home and call my family, several of them come and threaten him right back, he eventually went inside as there were too many of us and he hasn't said anything since.

&#x200B;

Now I do always clean up the poop of the puppy and once I saw children playing there I made sure to keep along the corner of the grass field, but is it still my fault for going to the grass field? since it was placed in front of gardens so usually that means it's for people to use, I know better now not to go to that grass field but am I still an asshole for simply assuming no children would play on a grass field that is right in front of people's gardens?

&#x200B;

This may seem tame to some people but the situation scared me so much that I honestly want to know if what I did was such an asshole thing to do that it warranted being threatened

&#x200B;

c4qa2e	2019-06-24 15:54:31	RLRR__LRLL	AITA D&D Session fallout, a bag of holding, a beholder, and a tabaxi rogue walk into a dungeon.	"I have been DM'ing the same game now for over a year.  A homebrew campaign with its own gods, lands, cities, tensions etc.  There are 6 players that meet every other week, and we play for upwards of 5 hours.

I have been generous about giving them weapons, armor, and magical items.  I try to balance the game the best way I can, and inadvertently earlier on in the campaign they found a bag of holding.  The rogue snatched it up and began putting everything he could find in it, stealing everything not nailed down, and in general forgetting about quest items that he steals, places in the bag, and eventually it becomes a dead end.

&#x200B;

In the story they come across a neutral evil  beholder (I know they're generally evil but its my story), This beholder has a major quest item that is imperative for the group, and there is a subplot how he wants to be a magic colleges headmaster.  He offers up the quest item, but only in exchange for the headmaster position, and will only give them the item (a crystal orb) if they have something that is worth collateral, which he'll return once the position is his.  This beholders importance is much more than the quest item, and in fact could be one of their biggest allies in the upcoming final battle.

I didn't have anything specific in mind, but the cleric says, ""Well what's in the bag of holding?""  The Beholder hears this and responds that he'll take it as collateral.  The person playing the rogue flips out, gets into an argument with the other players trying to explain that it helps them, when it's actually never used to their advantage, he ends up leaving abruptly in a huff.

Now there is a lot going on story wise here, and there are subplots, and story devices being used to work against peoples alignments, creating inner conflict for 2 of the PC's in game, not to mention the overall fate of the realm at hand.  I thought I was being clever, intertwining everything creating a linchpin, that would change the course of the game , essentially being integral to the final outcome, and how difficult the game will begin to get.

My question is, AM I THE ASSHOLE?  The rogue clearly feels like I am singling him out, but it's not like I wouldn't give them a chance to get it back, and I am not picking on him, they have the ability to try and persuade me otherwise, or come up with another item for collateral.  This is a game of make-believe

Girl on Okc was wearing a see-through leotard, and also kissing another girl (also dressed slutty) in her profile.  Left almost everything else blank.

I sent her a pic of of myself on snapchat holding a flogger (ok now hold up I was clothed), asking if she wanted to help me break it in.  She replayed it and added me as a friend.  We were talking and whatever and I said that I was looking for a sub to train.  In a consensual and whatever kinda way, stop judging.  She was just like “Im not looking for anyone to fuck and especially a dom.”

I was kinda like, “wut?” But I just wished her a nice day and said “my mistake”.

This isnt really a big deal, its very much something I wont care about in like 30 minutes.  But still like, did I do something wrong assuming someone dressing/acting in a promiscuous manner was looking for sex?

The whole bdsm thing was just because she replayed my pic.  It didn’t go very far.  So reddit did I interpret signals correctly and they were just bogey signs or am I an asshole for assuming whatever.

c4q8h1	2019-06-24 15:52:00	A11ie0	AITA for not wanting a relationship with my father?	"  

Recently my mom had a “good talk” with my father, that had been ""a long time coming."" She apologized to both of us about how when we moved to Louisiana she did it without giving him a forwarding address or a way to contact her. 

When she was apologizing to me, she told me she was sorry that she’d taken my dad away from me, that I’d loved him so much, and I should give him a chance now.

From my point of view, I was two when we left, toddlers love just about anyone. When we left I got someone that raised me and who I called Dad for a period of 6 years. 

When we moved back home my father didn’t contact us for half a year. When he did he wanted to see me and spend time with me—but what happened was me being a summer weekend babysitter for free for his 4 kids. I rarely saw him during these weekends. I also never saw him during the school year unless it was for an event that my mom insisted he had to go to, and he rarely made those.

Another reason I don’t care to have a relationship with him is because of his lack of consistency. My grandmother and I both remember multiple times where he would say he was coming to get me and then never show up. The only one my mom remembers is where I finally put my foot down because I was done with his flakiness. It was Father’s Day weekend, and he’d asked to come get me a week before. I was excited, I’d made a gift for him, it was also the first Father’s Day he’d asked for me. I waited all day. No phone call came to say he was late or even not coming. I decided then that I wanted nothing to do with him, because he didn’t act like my dad so I wasn’t going to consider him my father. 

I didn’t see him after that until I was 17 and it was only for a week when my mom had nowhere else to put me after driver’s ed and my brother was in the same class with me. Then she made him come to my graduation where my mom forced me to walk with both her and him. As well as my college graduation, I didn’t mind that so much because it was her college graduation as well and he is her best friend. 

He’s moving out of town now, and my mom is on my back about a relationship with him. I think she just wants someone to feel sad with her. Anytime I try to tell her how I feel she tells me I’m being a bitch and to get over his “one-time” screw up. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable because I never felt like I was really his kid. I also know that what happened was years ago, and this is the only grudge I’ve ever held this long, so am I the asshole for it?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4q8ej	2019-06-24 15:51:53	castaid	AITA for not wanting to work for my mom anymore?	"My parents run their own business that has been struggling the past few years bringing in new customers, they were worried they’d have to go into early retirement and sell their business. This year, I suggested it might be because their social media pages suck and they’re not drawing in any young people. I offered to revamp their pages and my mom was totally on board. Paid me in advance for 12 months.

We started working on the new branding of their social media while I was at school in a different state and because I was at school and operating on my own time, I was able to schedule posts in advance and just let them post the next day so I could mainly focus on school work while still working on ideas at a time that works for me.

It totally helped her business— tons of new, mostly young people. We gained almost 1000 new followers and are getting much more engagement.

For the summer I am back home and my mom has gone way off the deep end with this stuff. She obsesses about it 24/7. I don’t even feel like I have a relationship with her anymore because we can’t talk about anything else. She’s constantly looking for updates on who’s following us and how many likes we’re getting and now it’s ruining my sleep schedule.

I work a late night job doing security for concerts and it’s an hour commute from where I live, I don’t get home until late.

She comes blazing into my room at early hours of the morning because she read somewhere that you have to post before 8am to get any interaction. Screaming about how people are getting mad at us for not posting (which is ridiculous). I’m living off of less than 5 hours of sleep p consistently. And if you’re wondering “why don’t you just go back to sleep after that?” Well she will come into my room every 5-10 mins after that with worries we posted at the wrong time or no one has liked the photo yet etc.

I have begged her multiple times to compromise with me and let me schedule posts again so we can post at the time she wants to but I’m not sleep deprived and getting sick and subsequently sucking at my other job. She says she’s most productive in the morning and therefore not willing to work during any other time.

She believes that if we don’t post immediately that her business will die. Every little tiny post we post is literally life or death. The stakes are so high and she usually ends up crying and screaming at me which makes me cry and it’s horrible.

Recently I told her I’m quitting. I will complete the 12 months that she paid me but this is getting completely out of hand. And despite being young and on social media, I don’t even get it that much. I know I helped her pages to a new level but I suggested she should hire someone professional who actually knows what their doing.

She told me I’m a spoiled brat and a total asshole and threatened to not only take away the money she already gave me but to cut off all support in general. I feel trapped and depressed af but is she right?

So we were on a night out, just taking a taxi to the club. We all had bottles of beer with us that we were drinking at the time, so they were open. The taxi driver told us that it wasn't usually allowed to bring open bottles on the taxi, but he'd make an exception. When we arrived at the club, my friend F got out first, then noticed he forgot his wallet or something and came back in with the beer, spilling some of it on the taxi seats.

I then went to my friends (a group) and told F angrily that we had to calm the taxi driver down because he spilled his stupid beer and that he was dumb for coming back into the taxi with the beer. Admittedly, I was kind of enraged because of my discussion with the taxi driver still and that probably showed. Now here's where it gets hot: The taxi driver was of Turkish/Middle Eastern origin, however only had a slight accent and was nice to us. F said to me ""If he wants to make such a big deal out of it, he should just go where he belongs."" to which I replied ""Well if you think he should go where he belongs, why don't you go where you belong?"" I'm a very left-leaning guy and against racism or discrimination of any kind, so his comment annoyed me and in the heat of the moment I said what I said back, because in my mind those two comments are of the same kind - and I didn't say what I said to hurt him but just to point out how much of a massive hypocrite he was being.

&#x200B;

He then really freaked out, left the group and didn't join us in the club. Accused me of racism, anti-semitism and said really, really bad things to me that I won't repeat here. I'm not anti-semitic or racist to ANY extent.

A bunch of her other friends are also coming that I don't know bc we attend different schools.

So yesterday and today I was on vacation in a nearby country when last night, around midnight, I received a call from an unknown number. The profile pic had a photo of L so I knew it was one of her friends but I didn't pick up but then he call another time and so I picked up. 

He introduced himself as N and I vaguely recognized the name so I talked to him. We talked about our friend's birthday when suddenly he asks me to be his girlfriend. 

Like, we never met in person and this is the first time we talked so it was very uncomfortable for me and I awkwardly rejected him. 

He apologized so I moved past it and we continued to talk a bit before I was just so uncomfortable that I had to end the call and tell him not to call me. 

He messaged me afterwards and I kinda trying to ignore him but stay polite before I just told him I was going to bed. 

I tried to just push it out of my mind and have fun on vacation. My Family decided to leave early so I was in the car when I saw the messages. 

First L messaged me bc N told her about the situation and she said he's 34.

I'm 19.

He also messaged me about his age and then I had a long car ride having to deal with this info. 

I was actually very pissed, but now that I'm home I just feel very out of my depth and uncomfortable. 

I talked to L shortly and stated I didn't want to date her friend and I also messaged him about it. 

I don't believe he's given it up though so despite him saying we can be friends I don't think I can do it if he believes we'll end up dating. 

15 years age gap isn't what bothers me bc I believe adults can do whatever they want to do, but I'm not an adult so I feel kinda violated by this.

Students are given Flat Stanley cutouts to color and laminate, mail Flat Stanley to someone in another locale, take a photo of Flat Stanley in that locale, and then mail Flat Stanley onward with a letter detailing his adventures with the recipient. Eventually, the students are supposed to receive an assortment of photos of their Flat Stanleys out in the world, and letters describing what they did in the places to which they were mailed. The class gets to see the reach of their Flat Stanleys.

So I split up with my boyfriend about 3 weeks ago, but we still live together because we have a huge house, and it has a basement apartment, so financially and for the kids it makes more sense. We came to an amicable agreement about who would have our baby, and who would care for the children in the summer, and the vehicles and what not. It was simple, easier for both, and the smartest way to do things. UNTIL grandma dearest.
His sons grandmother and I do not see eye to eye, which put a lot of tension on my boyfriend and I throughout our relationship. Basically this woman is gone to another country for 6 months out of the year, and comes back with a calendar full of weekends and days that she ""books"" well in advance to have his two boys from a previous relationship. Not only do we have to work around her schedule, but she and he daughter also need to use our SUV because it can fit 7 people. Also now that my boyfriend and I aren't together he will also be gone a lot of the time to their cottage in the summer. 

So the issue is that he refuses to break grandma's schedule because she told us way ahead of time what days she booked. Although this is true I don't think it has any weight when it comes to the fact that she is booking weekends that I need to do things for my children. 

My daughter and sons birthdays both fall at the end of July, daughter is July 19th and son is July 26th. I want to throw a birthday party for both of them at the same time as I cannot afford to do two at the moment (not receiving child support or assistance as he still lives with me).

c4q5e0	2019-06-24 15:47:12	Chillenlikavillian	AITA for wanting to rat out my brother and cousin?	"This summer I was given the opportunity to work for a family member for 15$ an hour. Its mainly construction work, and sometimes the job gets tough with the constant lifting/dry walling ect. My brother (well call him John) and my cousin (well call him Sean) we’re also given the opportunity to work this job, considering they’re a part of the family as well and our relative needed some workers to hire. 
Here’s my dilemma- recently, instead of going to the bathroom once every couple hours or once every hour, John and Sean are CONSTANTLY going to the bathroom, mainly just to hit their vapes and smoke weed. It’s one thing to go to the bathroom constantly and smoke on the job, but this is creating a negative workplace for basically only me. While they’re gone, I’m trying to pick up the slack and meet the demands of our boss by doing the work of basically three people. The other day, us three were called in to our bosses office and we’re basically told if we don’t pick up the slack and work harder like the other construction workers around us, we will all be fired. 
This is not the type of boss that looks at individual merit, but overall performance and results of my brother, my cousin, and myself. I love John and Sean, but if I explain to my boss that the reason we’re not being productive is because of them, I have no doubt I will keep my job and they will most likely be fired. I don’t want to rat on them about the smoking, but rather just the inconsistent work ethic and me constantly having to work harder. When I bring this up to them, they joke around and basically brush it off.

This happened years ago, but it got brought up again this morning and my family is half and half about who the asshole is. When I was 11, my family went on a cruise (I’m very grateful for that part) and one of the days we went to Jamaica. I was not told what we were doing in Jamaica, but I thought we would go to the beach or shopping or just something fun. I was shocked and disappointed when we got to Margaritaville, but I figured we would be there for an hour or so and then do something fun. The restaurant was. SO. loud, there was a water slide into the ocean, but I wasn’t told what we were doing so I didn’t bring a swimsuit so I had nothing to do. After about 20 minutes, I asked my parents “What are we doing after this?” And they said like “getting on the boat, this is what we’re doing today” and I didn’t take it well. I know I was livid the whole day, and I may have cried. Every time this gets brought up, I think it’s ridiculous that they brought an 11 year old to essentially a bar, and were shocked when I didn’t have fun, but maybe I was out of line.

c4q3od	2019-06-24 15:44:22	myfirstthrowaway1k	AITA for declining to spit on Nazi graves?	"Me and a few friends recently got the amazing chance to spend two weeks bike-packing across Normandy we’re all really close and in a peloton back home so we were all really excited.

 The whole area is geared up for World War II commemoration and memorial because of the 75th d-day anniversary a couple days ago and the anniversary of the liberations of many cities afterward.
So museums and memorials were a large part of the trip. 

The trip was going amazing and it was my first time going so places like the American cemetery and point du hoc were all very moving. The trouble that this post is concerning started when we came across a burial site for Nazi soldiers who died defending occupied France. When we’re done reading the plaques and were walking back, all my friends spat on the graves as they went past. They are all Jewish, so I could see where they were coming from, but I felt like that’s not a correct thing to do at a cemetery no matter who’s buried so I didn’t spit.

When I walked past without spitting as they’d done before me, one of my friends, that we’ll call Adam, looked at me funny and tilted his head. And we left and continued toward our hotel.

 Me and Adam were in the same room later that day and he asked me why I didn’t spit and I said that I don’t think it was right to do that to someone’s grave. He said “it’s not just *someone* it’s a Nazi. Why are you trying to defend them?” I said that I’m not trying to defend them, but whoever they are they’re still a person. He then said kind of coldly, “they didn’t think my great grandma was a person.”  I said I hadn’t thought about it like that and I was sorry and went to get some air. Mostly because I felt like there was no good response to what he said.

The subject never came up again. And we didn’t discuss it further. But I can’t help but feeling like they were in the wrong there, and this eye-for-an-eye stuff brings us nowhere. 

So Reddit, am I the asshole, or are they?  Or is there no one assholy?

&#x200B;

I was in a 7/11 getting a slurpee at 11 pm (one of those nights) and a woman was asking the shopkeeper if they had aluminum foil. He said they didn't so I was like, I live a block over and have aluminum foil so I can just give you some. She said yes and we started walking toward my apartment.

&#x200B;

While we were walking, she asked if I smoked and I said no and it became clear she was homeless. As I was going to get the foil, it dawned on me that she probably wanted the foil to smoke crack. I brought it back for her anyway and she did indeed want to smoke with it. I've felt torn about it ever since.

c4q3bd	2019-06-24 15:43:45	THROWZZZZAWAYY	AITA for snapping at someone for a small comment?	"Obligatory pre-apology for any mobile-related formatting issues.

The only backstory relevant here is:
I have pretty severe rosacea. 
If I’m (32F) not wearing makeup, it looks like a standard sunburn. 
I get comments on it regularly, such as; “did you go for a run before this?” “Wow, is it hot outside?” and my personal favorite, “I see someone forgot to wear sunscreen!”
It is by far my biggest insecurity.

Two days ago I went to deposit a check. It was pretty early in the morning so I decided to go makeup-less. I get to the teller and she is a super sweet younger girl, probably her first bank job out of college! We exchange pleasantries and as I’m getting my ID and check out of my purse, she asks if I had been out on an early morning run. I know exactly where this is going, but continue anyways.

“What do you mean?” I replied

“I just thought you looked like you had been exercising”  she motions to her own face

Then I went off the rails 

“Oh! No I just have pretty extreme rosacea. It’s just super noticeable because I felt good enough about myself this morning that I didn’t feel the need to cover it up.”
*a lie, I was too lazy to put on makeup

She immediately starts apologizing and backtracking and my dumb ass just continued

“Sorry for being so blunt, but I get comments on it all the time, and I’m tired of lying and saying that it IS a sunburn or I DID go for a run this morning just to save their feelings. It is my biggest insecurity and I’m constantly baffled by the amount of people who feel the need to make a comment.”

She processed the rest of the transaction while looking like she was about to cry and then I just walked away without saying anything else. 

I feel absolutely horrible. I am extremely shy and docile and for me to snap on someone like this is so unusual for me. I also don’t know if it was a good way of standing up for myself after years of hurtful comments that I would NEVER make to anyone else. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

c4q2la	2019-06-24 15:42:32		WIBTA For leaving my girlfriend when i feel that she needs me?	"Let me establish some things. 

(sorry in advance for the bad syntax and grammar, English is not my first language)

I'm an 18-year-old woman diagnosed with psychotic depression, this is important because when my paranoia hits I start seeing the ""true nature of reality"" and this "" true nature"" has a lot to do with the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. I know, what a shocker, but hear me out: I know this is just part of a historical delusion, mental illness is not a new thing, we've been dealing with the ""rottenness"" of the mind since we (as a species) had our first encounters with the rupture (by any alterations of the chemicals in our brain) of what we believe is objective reality... Anyways, these ideas really f\*\*\* me up, and they intervene in every single one of my interactions with the outside world to the point where I am afraid of colors (especially green, because it means, in my brain of course, what has perished and is slowly decaying) 

So, let me go to the point 

about 4 months ago i started a relationship with a girl, well call her... Lucy. she is a creative, passionate, loving, kind, respectful, understanding, kind of childish person. She brought me a lot of light, and I admire her for that... 

But about a month after we started dating i was at her parents’ house, just chilling, you know?. Her mom is some sort of spiritual person, I don't know how to describe her, but we started talking about drugs and at some point we started smoking weed, I didn't smoke that much because it really hurts my mind and, but she did, oh how she did, at some point she just started hugging her knees and silently screaming. She had a bad trip, and of course, Lucy was trying to help her. At the end, Lucy managed to get her to sleep. We smoke probably more than what I should have smoke and got ourselves to bed. In that moment I started having I really bad psychotic episode, I started seeing the colors that I see and the division, how you go down through the colors form the top spheres to the bottom ones (Sefirots and Qliphoths) and I start feeling that I couldn't breathe and she was, just by being next to me, crushing me and taking me down to the green. I can't explain this because there's not a comprehensive way in which I can put it, but the point is that she was Green and she was going to hurt me, unconsciously of course, because demons don't know they are demons. I decided that I needed to go, but at the next day I just stayed... 

And that's when everything went wrong, because I started seeing some things that I didn't saw until that point, like some economic issues that keep her from using all of the potential she has, and some health issues that I just overlooked and some family dynamics that interfere with our relationship. Her mom is a possessive person and treats her really bad, she manipulates Lucy a lot and makes her feel guilty of everything. (I will continue this in the comments)"		1	0
c4q0uq	2019-06-24 15:39:35	FirmPair	AITA for being demanding about my hair?	"This is extremely petty and the title makes me sound vain, I know...

I have very thick, coarse, and curly hair. It's not often that I straighten it, but I do when I want to switch things up and it makes trimming easier. I usually do my hair by myself but this time my mother kept insisting that she do it for me, but I refused. The reason why is because she's not the most patient person and you really need to take your time when it comes to hair like mine. She also doesn't like my hair texture and has tried to talk me into chemically straightening it multiple times, so I figured zero patience and a negative attitude would only makes things worse. I was about a quarter of the way done when she came into my room and said she wanted to try something with my hair. I asked her what she wanted to do and she didn't tell me; she just repeated that she wants to ""experiment"" with something.  My hair has been extremely damaged in the past. I put a lot of time and effort into nursing it back to health, so I don't really like the words ""try"" and ""experiment"" like my hair is some kind of toy or template to do whatever with it.

At this point I didn't have a choice, and she took over. I saw her put some oil in her hands and I immediately turned around and asked her not to apply oil as it will fry my hair and will make it stiff. Once again, she said she just wants to ""try"" something with it and did it anyway. I saw her pull out the flat iron and I realized she didn't use my heat protectant spray. I asked if she used it and she said yes. I asked if she was sure, and she said ""Just sit there and be quiet"", and proceeded to flat iron my hair with just oil. She liked the result, and I said I don't feel comfortable putting oil on my hair before using a flat iron and she said, ""Well I like it"" and then continued to do what she was doing.

As time went on, I noticed she was putting these giant, old Hollywood style curls in my hair, and I said I didn't want that, I just want my hair to be plain straight. Then the situation escalated and she started saying I was being a brat for making all these demands. She said she offered to do my hair ""out of the goodness of her own heart"" and that I was being ungrateful for making a bunch of criticisms. In my opinion, it's no longer out of the goodness of your heart if you're forcing someone to accept your help, and then forcing that same someone to accept your version of helping. Like I said before, I value my hair a lot and want it to be done a certain way to ensure it stays healthy, but was I being too demanding?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

He's been unemployed and hasn't gone to school for almost 3 years now. I try to be supportive and be patient because he is still figuring out what he wants to do with his life, but it's been getting difficult. He got a job 3 weeks ago as a busboy. I was really excited for him to be doing something other than video games. As days passed he talked about small altercations with his boss. Today he told me that he quit. Apparently he was going to eat a sandwich after his shift, but his boss told him to leave. My bf got upset after the boss yelled at him, asked why he couldn't sit there (he didn't receive a response), and quit. My bf came home complaining of eating cold food. I told him that his boss was rude, but he should have handled it better. I told him that he should have at least been nice until he found another job, but he refused to see his fault in it. I am just frustrated because I was really hoping this job would stick for a little while longer. He is upset with me for not being in his side. He said he was sticking up for himself.

There are three rooms divided 2/2/1. The girl who has her own room, however, has started to sleep on the couch nearly every night. I think she does this for two reasons: 1) she is a bit of a hoarder. Her room is packed full of stuff, and for some reason she thought it was a good idea to start collecting furniture for her next apartment, since she moves in the fall. You can barely walk across her room with all this stuff. 2) She agreed to take care of another friend’s chinchilla over the summer. The little guy can be loud at night and smells a little bit. 

My roommate sleeping on the couch doesn’t *really* affect me, but I find it annoying. She’s the only one with her own room, and yet she still has too much to stuff in it to make it live-able. Plus, she sleeps in way later than the rest of us, who have internships. She’s only taking classes and they start much later in the day. She doesn’t complain about us coming downstairs and eating breakfast before class, but I hate feeling like I have to be extra quiet and not being able to sit on the couch. 

I have tried to offer help her clean through her room before. She always thanked me but said she would do it herself. It’s been almost a month and she hasn’t yet. This also annoys me.

My mother recently had knee surgery, and my sister and I agreed to stay at our mother's house to help her out for a little while. My sister, who does not have easy access to a washer, brought a lot of laundry with her, which was fine with my mother, as long as my sis used her own laundry detergent and not my mom's Tide pods. Since sis isn't that well off, I did buy her some.



A few days later when sis had already gone home and I was still out at my mom's, I went to do some laundry. Lo and behold, all my mom's pods were gone. So I assumed sis used them all and didn't replace them with her own. I was really bothered by this, I'm not rich and my mother definitely is not, so little things like this add up. A few days later I sent a text, admittedly calling sis a thief and telling her that she needs to replace mom's pods.

Well, my sis exploded, sending a rant in which she called my a narcissistic bitch and an abuser. My mother wanted me to write it off in the first place and was disappointed that I brought it up. My sis wants me to apologise and I want an apology. So, I'm asking, am I the asshole here?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c4pqsh	2019-06-24 15:23:39	MaximumLoaf	AITA for being annoyed that I have to take my sister to her court hearing?	"I’ll try to summarize this situation quickly. My sister (19), went to a college party and she and her friends got pulled over by a cop. They had pot on them. I don’t know all of the details of what she’s being charged with, but the result is that she needs to be at the court house (an hour and a half drive from where we live) at 8am next Wednesday. 

For context, my sister has a history of irresponsible behavior. She’s experimented with drugs in high school. A few months ago she was hospitalized for a bad acid trip. The police were called to her then boyfriends place because of noise and when they arrived she was apparently in hysterics and completely naked. My parents have “given” her two cars (they weren’t really hers, she was the one who primarily used them) and crashed both. They now refuse to let her use any of their vehicles, which is why someone needs to take her to her hearing.

I don’t live at home anymore. I have my own life and responsibilities. I lived with my parents until I was 23 (I’m 27 now) and I would often help out with my younger siblings when my parents needed me to. But now that I’m on my own and live further away, I don’t really do as much for them. 

When my boyfriend and I went to visit my parents for Father’s Day they asked me if I would be able to drive my sister to her court date, because they were going to be on vacation. Now the thing that had annoyed me about this, was that previously, they had decided they were not going to go on vacation. This was a last minute decision. I expressed to them that I really did not want to do this. I did not want to have to use one of my vacation days to get up at 4am to a half hour to pick up my sister and then drive an hour and a half to take her to the courthouse. On top of that my dad told me to go in with her and listen because apparently at 19 years old she can’t be trusted to do that on her own? I can be a pushover at times, especially when it comes to my family. So I eventually said I’d do it, emphasizing the fact that I really was not happy that I had to do this. Ever since I agreed to do this, my annoyance and resentment has been just bubbling up. ALSO, I’m slightly annoyed by the fact that my parents were the ones who asked me to do this, and not my sister. But I digress.

I just feel like this shouldn’t be my responsibility and that my parents are kind of assholes for even asking me. I’ve already agreed to it and I’m not going to back out, but then I also feel like I’m being a dick for whining."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So this weekend is a long weekend and I’m going away with my friends from high school — one of whom i started dating after we graduated. Her and I try and keep our relationship private and when we hang out with our old friends we very much try to just act like friends and not use pet names or PDA. Not a big deal. 

Last year we tried to go tenting as a group (long story) and after a quick kiss one of our friends asked us to keep our affection private in a rather rude fashion. Since then we’ve tried to confine our affections to whatever tent or room we’re staying in while with this group of friends. We slip up a lot when we both drink but everyone agrees this is fair. But sober people will get frustrated with us for so much as holding hands. 

This year one of our friends suggested that my partner and i take the pull out couch in the common area of the cabin. I was open to the idea until it was “joked” that we wouldn’t be able to be affectionate at all since it’s not technically a private space.  The one friend also suggested that my gf and i share beds with our other friends but i didn’t feel comfortable with that nor did i see the sense in it. It also raised a red flag to me and made me feel like there may be some weird jealousy going on and generally just made me feel like this friend doesn’t want us together. 

My partner and i are also long distance for the time being, with full time jobs in different cities.  The long weekends are the only time we get to see each other for more than a day. I won’t have seen her in about 3 weeks, and i won’t see her for 2 weeks after this weekend. I feel like this is relevant. 

Would i be the asshole if i asked for my partner and i to take one of the bedrooms for the privacy since our friend group isn’t comfortable with any sort of affection between us?

c4ppvd	2019-06-24 15:22:12		AITA for not wanting to wait on this table last night?	So, I wait tables on the weekends. The restaurant I work at is next to a movie theatre. We get a lot of young adults who come over to the restaurant late at night after a show. I had previously waited on a young man three times in the last couple of months. His hair is distinctive and it was easy to remember him. He had another guy with him each time and then two to three other people at separate times. Each time I waited on them, they kept me really busy and were messy and did not leave any tip. They might be college kids; I don't know. So late last night when he came in with two guys and two young women, and were seated in my section, I said to two of my coworkers and assistant manager if someone would take them. They asked me why and I said I was really tired and was honest and said they probably wouldn't leave a tip, that they had not left a tip for me but maybe they would for someone else. I was accused of being a racist by a coworker at that point; all the people in the party are black. If I had realized that's where the request for coverage was going, I wouldn't have asked. I might be racist because I was wondering if maybe the party of young people might tip my two coworkers because they are black and if it would make a difference. Total asshole move on my part?		1	0

I can tell that she needs the help. Her math ACT scores thus far haven't been great, but she has shown improvement since we began.

I'm getting a bit frustrated since I keep organizing my schedule around weekly tutoring, but she seems like she has other things she would rather be doing.

I hate confrontation, especially since we have both been friendly to each other throughout this process.

When I came back Sunday, my grandma told me she had helped me by picking up my room a little, which I initially was grateful for. My room was not messy when I left, maybe a little cluttered, but I still appreciated the gesture. 

However, when I got to my room and noticed what she did, I got pretty upset. I asked her about everything and this is what she said in response: 

- I had some dried wildflowers in a vase on my nightstand, my grandma threw them away because she “didn’t like the way they looked.” Those flowers are out of season now, so they can’t be easily replaced. 

- A friend drew a picture of my cat, which I tacked to my wall with posted putty. My grandma said she threw it away and didn’t realize it was special to me, when it clearly was on the wall. I don’t hang things that aren’t special on the wall. 

- I keep my medical records in a large folder so I can have all my medical information with me at every doctors appointment and any time I go to the emergency room. It’s missing. I asked my grandma if she knew where it was, she said it’s “in a safe place” and to not worry about it. I’m very worried because I might need it when she’s not available to give it to me. 

- I hand stitched a doll when I was a child and keep it on my dresser. It doesn’t look the best, but I think that’s part of the charm and absolutely love it. My grandma has since taken it down to her sewing room and said she’s going to fix it. I don’t know what she plans to do to it, but I made that doll by myself and think that it doesn’t need “fixed”. 

I know the best solution is to move out, but I’ve had some health issues that make it so I can’t work and need help with day to day tasks, and my grandparents are letting me stay with them rent-free and helping me in whatever I need. I’m at their mercy. But on the other hand, I don’t like my grandma deciding what is and isn’t of value to me without my permission. I never asked her to clean my room, and I feel the issues mentioned were not her decisions to make. So given that it’s her house and I’m not paying anything to stay here, WIBTA if I asked her not to clean my room anymore, or at least to do it with me?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4powk	2019-06-24 15:20:40	donotgetbaptized	AITA for not wanting to attend my grandmother's funeral?	"My grandmother on my father's side just died, and when he called me and told me about funeral arrangements, I kindly informed him that I wouldn't be making it. He thinks I'm being extremely disrespectful. 

Now, it's important to note that my entire family including my parents, grandparents, uncles and cousins are all part of a religious cult. I was raised in this cult and publicly left the cult last year as an adult. 

Upon leaving, every family member shunned me and cut me out of their life. I got married and not one of them attended my wedding.

My father hadn't spoken to me since I left until this. 
Even while I was a member of the cult, my grandmother wasn't the kindest person to me (always judging me for ""not doing enough for God"") and I didn't like her very much for it. She had nice intentions and wanted what she thought was best for me, but conversations rarely ended in a pleasant manner. 

So if I were to attend this funeral, I feel like I would just feel judged by every family member who see me as the devil and create an uncomfortable situation for everyone.

c4po58	2019-06-24 15:19:27	AnonThrowAw4y	AITA for telling my past abusive father it’s his fault my older brother is messed up	"Long story short. I was raised in a small Eastern European county. While growing up there my dad was military and a drunk, my older brother by 3 years got the worst of the beatings next to my mom, mine weren’t quite as bad, and my sister wasn’t really touched, (3 years younger). 

We moved to the US when I was 10, brother was then a teen. Since we moved my dad never laid a hand on us, stopped drinking plus obviously he didn’t want to end up in jail. In reality it’s been a complete 180, he’s been loving and supportive these last 10 or so years. 

Fast forward to present day, and my brother is a druggie, constantly in trouble, no drive, and has called me at his worst times and often spoke about his beatings as a child, but he has never spoke about this stuff with my dad, no one actually talks about this. 

Recently my brother wound up in big trouble with the law, my dad blew up in disappointment and speaking about how much of a failure my brother was. In turn I blew up at him letting him know he was like this because of what he went through as a toddler through teen. 

My dad is upset with me and was extremely hurt by my comments, but I couldn’t stand there listening to his self-righteous bullshit anymore. 

He always mentions how me and my sister turned out great, we’re both successful, but we didn’t get nearly the brunt of what my brother did.

One bring we don’t enjoy kids activities like school plays, sporting events where parents gather around and watch their kids kick a soccer ball with other kids. That sounds miserable. Anyway, my nephew is 10. He’s been playing baseball for a few years. His mom (my SIL) is always bugging my wife and I to go watch him play. We live in Kansas and July in Kansas is miserable. I can’t imagine being on a baseball field in the 100 degree weather for hours watching kids play baseball. That’s literally the last thing my wife and I want to do. 

Here’s the thing - we aren’t that close to his family. It would be one thing if my nephew called me on his parents phone and was like, “unkie xxxx. Will you pleeeeeeease come watch me play!” But that doesn’t happen. My SIL just texts us where and when he’s playing and when we text back, thanks but we are going to pass. She gets all butthurt. 

A while back my SIL texted me saying she was raising money for their kids school and asked if we could donate $100. I said, no. She just basically demanded $100 from us. Just use a shred of common sense and have my nephew call me and ask me and tell me what it’s for - like a normal parent. I feel like this is the same situation for the baseball games. If you really want us to believe my nephew wants us to be there have him tell me. Don’t just text me. Does that makes sense?

i could understand the anger if i had just eaten it and not told her or bought more but she is now better off, has extra food than she had before she left and i didnt think she’d mind about me eating as she gave consent for other stuff to be eaten and i replaced it before she got back.

Please hear me out, I promise I'm not as horrible as that sounds. Addiction hits me sharp in the heart for my mother has been recovered for 11 years now, so I understand the sensitivity that this brings. But also.....

This weekend is the weekend my bridesmaids/MOH (3) get to meet and get to know one another. So far it has been going so well. All my ladies are from very different parts of my life and it's an honour to have then all in one house. My MOH travelled from a far away land with her Partner, who is a recovered alcoholic (amazing,) and I brought my soon to be husband and son (husband is watching son while I go on this little adventure and offering support to Partner.)

Now, we were planning to drink a bit, but with consideration of Partner, we all agreed to tone it down and keep it casual so as to not make anyone uncomfortable. We were given the green light in having some beers and sharing a nice bottle of wine I brought. Cool!

Last night  MOH and Partner hid in their rooms. All night. They didn't come down except to get food (that they ordered without us) and MOH didn't even make an effort to speak to anyone. They had a long trip, it's a lot of stimulation, I understand. 

This morning I woke up to text messages stating how they were tired and uncomfortable with all the alcohol in the house (6-pack and the aforementioned wine) and the weed (my husband is recovering from a car accident and it's his primary source of relief, it's safely stored due to our SON being in the house.) She made it sound like we were going hard and disrespecting Partners previous life (my mom is recovered, I fucking understand how this goes.) 

We were sitting around the table, eating Vietnamese food and sipping beers, like any other night. 

Now the house is tense and they have left for coffee and I have no idea what is happening today.

c4pktc	2019-06-24 15:14:09		AITA for not wanting to speak to my MIL after she accused me of being lazy and unwilling to help her when I totally do help her?	"Hey reddit, 

Been (f21) with my bf (m26) for nearly 8 years now and we split the week living at each other's parent's house whilst ours is being renovated. 
So its one day at his the other at mine (although we only just sleep, wash and eat because we work 8 hrs in the day). 

Last saturday his mum was hosting a bbq and his dad asked me to help her out as ive done before (this whole scenario has happened before but not to this extent). I said yeah sure ill help seeing as i wont be doing much else. 
So the day before the bf and i had a falling out and i ended up crying myself sore and i knew the next day i would be in one of my ""i dnt want to be bothered moods"". Apart from that I had a nasty headache that lasted all day so i wasnt my chirpy self for those reasons. But anyway, she told me what to do and i helped her out with things like the tables and chairs, the clothes (which have nothing to do with the bbq but she became hassled and stressed out so i was obliged to do them) and the food prepping. By the time i was cutting the veg i was in great pain - but i soldiered on without a single complaint. 
Then her younger son came home and i assumed he would take over since he is her son after all... and i snuck away to sleep off the headache. I didnt even know he left soon after he came - i was already passed out. 
When i wake up shes yelling and screaming that i didnt help her at all and i just slept all day, which isnt true. 
Now im not talkimg to her, shes not talking to me. im percieved as the asshole and my bf doesnt know whos side to take.
Now ive pledged to be more like her other son who does nothing and doesnt get yelled at, than my bf and i who do lots of housework and get yelled at for the littlest things (that dnt make sense like making a mess in the kitchen when ur still cooking. u cant cook and clean at the same time ffs). 

so wibta if i refuse to help her in the future so this doesnt happen again?"		1	0
c4pkkh	2019-06-24 15:13:42	throwit22356	AITA for not wanting to go to my mums birthday party	"Myself, my mum and sister are a close knit family. We have no-one we would consider family outside of the 3 of us, only close friends. Her birthday is today and we have a tradition of the 3 of us going out to eat at a restaurant in the evening and this is the case 3 times a year for all our birthdays.

  


  


A close friends of my mums (not mine or my sisters mind) has organised a surprise birthday party for tonight, inviting a few close friends and other people I would consider 'pub friends'. I received an invite for me and my sister last Thursday and I agreed to go and said I would confirm with my sister this past weekend (I knew my sister would not like the idea, and I needed time). However she did not think to involve myself or my sister in the planning or organising of the evening, didn't check to see if we had other plans and arranged it to start 2 hours before either of us could arrive. Another reason for my doubt is due to this being a repeat of her birthday 2 years ago, where the same woman hosted a party and invited 2 estranged members of my family we do not speak to. (She thought it would be a nice idea. It wasn't and ended the evening for us)

c4pkgd	2019-06-24 15:13:32	msjollywood	WIBTA in asking for payment up front from a broke friend for a bachelorette party?	"One of my friends is getting married this fall, and although she didn’t ask me to be in the bridal party, I want to be there to support her. She made it known I’m invited to the bachelorette party, and after weeks of not hearing anything I asked if her MOH, or any other bridesmaids started to plan anything. She seemed disappointed that no one stepped up, so after a little talk with the bride I told her I’d take care of it (and she’s super grateful).

I’m very good friends with two bridesmaids. One bridesmaid, Liz, is a single parent (separated from her husband) who doesn’t really have a steady income. She went to a bachelorette party last month and someone else paid for the whole thing. For this other wedding, the bride let her pay things in installments. For this weekend, I planned this pretty cost effectively, so it’s going to be substantially cheaper than the other one. But I also don’t want to front the bill for anyone’s share.

I know her financial circumstances. On nights out, I don’t mind covering the cost of dinner. While I probably could afford to cover her, I work as a teacher and don’t get paid during the summer so I’d really rather not. Plus, I’m going abroad for two weeks so I’m already spending a lot this summer.

Would I be the asshole if I ask her to pay her share of the cost in full?

ETA: I’m sorry if this wasn’t clear. I have no intention of singling anyone out. My plan was to tell everyone the amount in a group chat (divided equally among us). Then ask EVERYONE for the payment by the same date. I don’t want to front money for anyone in this case. I just have a feeling based on my past experience, that she may ask me to cover it for longer than I would anyone else."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4pj1c	2019-06-24 15:11:10	ceceorionatl	AITA for not wanting to hear about my grandmothers love life?	"For some background information. My grandfather died quite young. In his 50s. My grandma was single for over 10 years after that. Her only child, my mother, had me young but remarried and I think kind of pushed my grandma away. Like we all used to live together but then my mom and stepdad had more kids and my grandma moved out etc. So she evantually got onto the dating scene. She seemed happier overall by having companionship in her life. Unfortunately after moving in with one mad he too passed shortly after. She found him unconcsious one morning which I know is super traumatic.

Since then she has a new boyfriend whom is not the best guy. He doesn't really treat her that great and is kind of a dud. . But she chose to move in with him bc she is not in a good financial situation despite working her whole life... Due largely to having to bail my mother out constantly and just bad investments in real estate.

I am in my 20s and live away from my family now but she often messages me and will divulge into her relationship woes. Complains about what he does.. He's bad with money. Doesn't communicate. Doesn't make an effort to make her happy. All that.

It really sucks to hear my grandma isn't happy with him but she won't leave as she feels she can't afford it. I have two young kids and cannot help financially and my mother if anything leeches her money so is zero help either.

But honestly I get uncomfortable hearing about her love life. It just is weird. She's my grandmother. I don't want to discuss her boyfriend's behavior or hear about it. It feels weird to me. Half the time I just want to ask her to stop talking about it. AITA for feeling that way? The more I type the more I think I am because of how much she's been through. But c'mon.

I live with Samantha in a dorm like room. We share the same bedroom and bathroom. Lately Samantha has been acting really standoffish to me so I asked her if there was something wrong. She told me that i’ve really been annoying her because: 1. I talk on the phone a lot and apparently really loud when she’s trying to sleep (in my defence it was 7pm and she slept in because she pulled an all-nighter studying until 1pm and went to bed then but I feel like it’s not an unreasonable time to talk). 2. I step on all her chargers but that’s because there’s barely any space in our room to walk around and I feel like it’s not a big deal. 3.

For a example we took a class last week and it was $10, he didn’t have cash so I paid. Then we got some drinks and I paid for those too (that was more so as a congratulations for his promotion though). Ok Friday night we got takeout and I picked it up so I paid for that, around $30. Then on Saturday we wanted to both try edibles so I asked one of my friends (since she regularly smokes and neither of us do) and I went to get them from her and paid $45 for those. Then finally yesterday we went to a bbq and stopped to buy drinks, I was at the counter first so I just paid for both of us, his was about $12 I think. Anyways I’ve paid a lot for us lately which is fine I didn’t mind but then I saw a $40 Venmo request from him for when we got dinner and he paid (only thing he paid for this past weekend). AITA for being annoyed? Like if you’re going to request me $40, then you should also pay me back the $60 or however much you technically owe me.		1	0

I have a great relationship with his parents and they are very nice people. My mother and I have been planning the whole wedding and have been trying to get them involved in the process but they always say “don’t worry about it. Whatever you want we’ll just pay”. Okay cool, I still inform them on every big decision we make. 
Months ago we all agreed on an adults only wedding, so no kids except for our cousins who are teenagers and our newborn who will be in the bridal suite with a sitter. I just found out they told their niece she can bring her 1 yr old to the wedding and didn’t mention it to me or my mom. The issues I have with this are that 1. We all agreed adults only was a good idea and we told all our guests about it, including my half siblings. We also have some family who are unable to attend because of it but understood. And 2. Being that my mother had planned the entire wedding, done all the hard work and is paying for more of the wedding. I just don’t think it is fair that they make decisions without talking to us after my mother has done everything and has informed them. 
My husband thinks I’m an ungrateful asshole and spoiled brat for telling him how I feel and wanting to talk to his parents. He says they should be able to make this decision because they’re helping pay for the wedding and we’ve been fighting a lot over this.

The issue is, when we all lived together she was in charge of the tenant insurance. So every month we gave her money to pay 2/3 of that bill. By the time she had moved out, we had spent a total of over 200$ on tenants insurance. When she moved out she gave us the contact info for her insurance guy, so we contacted him to set up our own insurance with our new roommate. The issue is, we were told that Boyfriend and I could be on the plan, but new roommate would need her own. We told J, she called the insurance place and confirmed that we had never been on the insurance. If something had happened that involved making an insurance claim, we would have been screwed. Now, I cannot stress this enough, I firmly believe that J did not intentionally have us pay for insurance knowing we weren't covered. This was a mistake and a miscommunication, J had never set up tenant insurance before, she didn't know that her policy would only extend to a significant other but not roommates.

The other thing is, right around the time J moved out, she had a severe mental breakdown and had to quit her job. She is now, under doctor's orders, not working while she gets her mental health in line. She does some small freelance stuff on the side and collects welfare, but she is barely scraping by.

We asked J to pay us back for the insurance, and she felt awful about the situation and immediately sent us 50. We told her not to worry about the rest until she was back on her feet and back in the work force.

The thing is, AITA (or are Boyfriend and I the assholes) for asking her to pay us back at all? The total was a little over 200, but we live paycheck to paycheck so that's a lot. On the other hand, it really only amounted to ~14$ a month while we lived with her, which was not difficult to pay at all. I just feel bad because J feels bad, and she's the kind of person that hates having debt and will do anything to pay it back ASAP, and she can't right now. We haven't talked much about it because money talk stresses her out these days. I'm just wondering if at this point we should cancel the debt and consider it the cost of a lesson learned, or stick to our original agreement and let her pay us back on her own time, once she's taken care of herself.

c4pdtg	2019-06-24 15:02:54	BloodQueue	AITA for delaying an urgent blood donation because I didn't like the free shirt?	"I’m a frequent blood donor.  About 6 times a year, I walk down to the major hospital near my workplace and donate.  I donate platelets.  If you aren’t familiar, they suck in more ways than one.  They stick both arms, they take 2 hours to complete, and you spend your day planning around being hydrated enough to donate, but not so much that you have to go pee.

I have a close family member who would be dead today if it weren’t for a massive blood transfusion.  My work also makes it easy to donate with its policies.  But, to be totally honest, I’m mostly motivated by the swag - namely, they offer a new t-shirt each month.   Blood donation t-shirts come in two flavors.  The first is a boring infodump.  Loads of text and earnest and passionate facts about how vital donating is, think walking billboard.  The second flavor is more whimsical.  Usually a blood-related joke (“Always give 100% - Unless you’re donating blood!”), or a sports logo, or something seasonally appropriate for the graphic.

June’s t-shirt is absolutely of the first variety.  That’s why, when I got a phone call from the donor center last Friday telling me there was a shortage before the holiday and am I available to make a donation, I politely lied and told them I was just too busy but I could absolutely come in after the 4th do give platelets.  Left unsaid was that the June t-shirt really sucked and I’d rather roll the dice on July’s after I get back.

My wife thinks I’m the asshole for this decision.  It’s selfish, it's motivated by greed and not altruism, and I’m putting the hospital in a bad spot when they’ve expressed an urgent need.  She believes that my bad intentions in considering “what’s in it for me?” taints the subsequent action of actually making the donation.  In other words, because I’m doing a good thing for a bad reason, I am compromising the goodness of the thing I am doing.  I concede that if they had a cooler t-shirt in June, I would have donated earlier.

I don’t think I’m the asshole.  In my own moral calculus, a person’s intentions are unknowable and therefore unimportant.  Their actions, however, are knowable and consequently the only thing worthy of judgement.  A good action performed for a bad reason is still a good action.  Conversely, someone with great intentions who accomplishes nothing or has their attempt backfire doesn’t deserve credit.  The iron test and needle sticks are painful, the 2 hours of waiting are uncomfortable, my arm bruises for a week afterwards, I feel sick for the rest of the day, and today, 60-days since my last donation, you can still see the point on my arm they last stuck me.  I need an incentive to motivate myself to go through all that beyond just saving a life.  I’m one of the 3% of age-eligible Americans who donate blood at all in a given year, so I feel entitled to some consideration in scheduling.

So Reddit, what's your judgement?  I turn to you all to give me the binary judgement on my moral character that I deserve.  AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

Alright, this is my first time posting anything and english is my second language so brace yourselves. Me and my friend always played minecraft together and i considered him a good friend, but he was sometimes annoying when it came to stealing my shit and ""pranking me"", he stole my donkey which i loved, he kidnapped my fish Jeffrey, he swapped our horses (my horse was better than his, they were the same color), and most recently, killed my newfound black cat which i got from a nearby village when he was attempting to destroy my boat in which the cat was because i would not give him a ride in it, i was furious because of all prior events i thought the only thing that would be right to do is to destroy something he loved, so i disconnected from the server, told him i would burn his forest, proceeded to do it, i don't really know what to do, i feel that the burning of the forest was too harsh but i feel no remorse and he really should have seen it coming.

c4pckx	2019-06-24 15:01:00	OverallDisaster	AITA for cancelling a job interview the day of?	" I  am an accountant and I have not been searching for a job. I've been at  my current one about 4 years and this is my first after graduation. I  had a recruiter approach me last week with a position that would  basically be the controller/CFO of a company which would be over other  accountants. She asked if I was interested and it sounded like a great  opportunity so I said yes and she sent them my resume and a statement  and we scheduled an interview for today at 2.

Over  the weekend I did some heavy research and the company has went through  major changes the past few years and downsized heavily, moved into a  smaller office space that they rent. I also came across a podcast with  the CEO and he mentioned almost going out of business several times. The  business sector they are in is also very small and limited and I am not  sure if the work they do will even be around in 5, 10 years. It is a  company that really puts out that they're entrepreneurs and that they've  had a lot of failure in the past so the whole thing just really  concerned me. I also saw some reviews from past employees that mentioned  they had major payroll issues.

I let  the recruiter know at 9 this morning that I felt as if I wasn't a good  fit and wanted to cancel and she demanded an explanation, saying I had  already wasted their time since they've blocked off their schedule. I  explained some of my reasoning and she got very huffy and said if this  was going to happen again we could no longer work together.

I  realize that cancelling the day of IS not professional and does put  people out but I did give a 5 hours notice and felt as if it would have  been a bigger waste of time to go and interview (and miss at least 2+  hours of MY work) when I really wasn't interested. I wasn't comfortable  with this position and didn't want to interview somewhere that could go  out of business at any time. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4p885	2019-06-24 14:54:11	TealAssassin	AITA For blocking someone's view at the cinema?	"Someone posted a cinema post recently which reminded me about this. It happened maybe a year ago when the last Mission Impossible was about to be released.

As background I live in the uk and the cinema near me shows 30 minutes of ads and trailers, so if the film is due to start at 12.00, the ads will start then, and the feature itself starts at 12.30.

I went in to the screen with 2 friends maybe 15 minutes after the scheduled start time. The trailers were playing as we went to sit down.

I sat at my seat while still wearing my rucksack, rather than taking it off while still standing up, so as not to block the view for too long. I was sitting maybe six inches forward in my seat while putting my wallet etc away before taking my bag off.

Just before taking my bag off (we had been sitting less than a minute, and the trailers were still playing), someone behind me (we were second from the back row) tapped me on the shoulder, and said in an irritated voice 
""excuse me, can you sit down please!""
I was pretty confused and told the woman ""I am sitting down...""
She replied, still annoyed ""well can you sit back please, because I can't see!""
I snapped back something about giving me a chance to take my bag off.

I am a slim built man, about 5'9"", so not particularly big/tall at all. I was confused as to how me leaning forward in my seat could obscure her view.

When I looked back, i saw she was lounging in the seat with her feet tucked up, and her head sort of resting on her boyfriend's chest (he also looked about average height), so she was a lot lower than she would have been had she been ""sitting back"" like she asked me, and presumably I would block part of her view whether sitting back in the seat or not. 

I was quite upset by the aggressive tone she used when asking me, so was a bit stressed for the whole film knowing they were directly behind me. I sat back in my seat bolt upright the entire time after that, maybe as a bit of malicious compliance, as I was surely more in her way then than when I was sitting forward, but also because I didn't want them to have an excuse to tap me again and tell me to sit back. At least this way, even if I was blocking her view, I was doing as she initially asked. 

I'm not sure if I'm being the asshole here by  sitting so upright the entire film, or maybe for coming late and allegedly blocking them from seeing the Mission Impossible trailer? But I feel we went in quietly and discreetly enough, trying to be unimposing long before the film itself started, and if she wanted to be able to lounge in her seat without anyone blocking her view, they shouldn't have picked the back row. AITA here?

Also as we were leaving, I glanced round, and she was still lounging in her seat, giving us an evil glare and presumably waiting until we'd left before moving."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4p5nn	2019-06-24 14:49:46	KnotKnives	AITA for cutting off my former roommate? (We have all the same friends)	"Hi guys! Long time lurker first time poster etc etc 

So end of last year me (20F) my BF (22M) organised to move in with a friend who we’ll call Jake (23M) and we took my dog (my parents couldnt take her she’s 11 yrs old and under 5kg) with us.
Jake, my BF and I had a couple of rules - all three of us either worked, went to uni or both so we didn’t want people over a lot and we definitely didn’t want a lot of drugs in the house (we’re in a pretty liberal group). We found a house, and apart from the landlords living right behind us (this is important) life seemed pretty good.

A few months into the rooming situation, Jake lost his job and started doing drugs a lot. Like, daily. All the time.  My BF and I didn’t like this because, again, our landlord lived RIGHT BEHIND US and the issue culminated in a house discussion where we aired out our issues. Pretty much Jake was unhappy that my BF and I spent so much time in our room, that my BF gamed too much, and my BF and I were unhappy that the was having people over 3/4 days a week and hotboxing the house on the regular. We agreed to keep drug hangs down to 2/3 times a week and no excessive drug use during daylight hours, and my BF would game less.

After this talk, Jake spent the next month avoiding us. He was never home, when he was he didn’t talk to me, and finally after a few weeks, he told us he has found a new house and he was moving out and would only pay the next months rent. I tried to talk to him about fixing things but he said he didn’t like that my BF and I spent so much time in our room (we weren’t having loud sex btw just watching movies the walls were thin so we only had sex when he was out) and that he wasn’t happy with the new house visitation arrangement. 

At the end of the conversation I pretty much told him to go fuck himself because 
A) we were splitting the rent equally 3 ways so he was fucking us over massively
B) he knew that I couldn’t go back to my parents and my BF couldn’t go back to his, and worse, no one could take my dog (not my dogs fault there’s other literally life threatening reasons my parents couldn’t take her back) so he was potentially dooming me to giving up my chronically ill senior dog who would likely not find a home. 
And finally c) his reasons of ‘I don’t like feeling like I’m living alone because you’re in your room a lot’ seemed silly to me because he was moving out...to live on his own.

Anyway eventually we spoke and he wanted to stay friends but I said he hadn’t been my friend for a while now and after that there was practically zero chance we’d stay friends. We’re in the same group so it’s caused some drama but I’m a horribly anxious person so I feel like the asshole. Help me out here - should I just forgive him to smooth things over with our group or am I right for staying mad?

EDIT::  I offered several solutions to him to try and fix his issues apart from the drug use in terms of us hanging out more/compromising on visitors. He does have money and an allowance he’s not broke.  After I suggested some arrangements during the initial argument he ignored us for a few weeks and didn’t come home before making his decision. He didn’t try to implement the compromises we agreed on before making his decision. And the months prior to his increased drug use we were all happy with the house and how it functioned. I can’t stress enough that several compromises were offered but instead of trying to implement them he disappeared for a month then said he was leaving citing that nothing changed when he wasn’t around to try and change it.

EDIT 2::
There is a lease. Jake has a place to go but my bf and I don’t, and if we break the lease too our rental histories will be screwed massively so our chances of finding a new place will be close to none, especially with the dog.  So since he’s not finding a replacement and it’s on us left behind Jake has pretty much washed his hands of us."	No A-holes here	0	0

I sent a screenshot of the chat to one of my closest friends, I'll call her Sarah— and pretended to be disappointed in myself for 2 short messages: ""i feel stupid"" ""idek why i did this"" then sent the screenshot of the chat. Sarah asked if I actually sent him nudes then before I could reply, she said ""Nevermind lol"". 

I sent a pic of what the ""nudes"" were and she told me that she's mad at me now and I've lost her trust. I honestly thought this was a short and playful prank since the messages in the screenshots were very exaggerated: ""OMG DONT SCREENSHOT NUDES I HATE U"" for example. I also did this to a few other friends who thought it was funny before I did it with Sarah.

My Aunt is not someone I see often. She got on with my son but only really saw him a handful of times a year. She came a few times to see him when he was sick but not often. When we were told he didn't have long left I asked if she wanted to come and say goodbye and she said she was too busy with work. I figured she was in denial, maybe. I certainly was. She then missed his funeral to go to a concert.

Her husband messaged me yesterday asking if he would be able to get some of our sons ashes so she can have some jewellery made. Apparently she asked him for one for her birthday as she really misses our son and wants to feel close to him. I said no because I want him to stay with us. All of him. Then my Aunt called me yesterday afternoon and said I was being selfish, he was her family too. 

I still said no. She said she acted the way she did when he died because she was struggling with it, and was in denial. But so was I. But it's been 3 years and she's hardly come to see any of us. She's not even met our newest baby yet who is 4 months old.

c4p2ci	2019-06-24 14:44:19	FormalBee9	AITA because I did not tell a 29 year old guy that I was 36 before we hooked up?	"Okay, I am 36/f, I take extremely good care of my skin, I have a young sounding voice and most of my friends are in their mid-twenties. The reason most of my friends are younger is because most people my age are busy with their kids, but I don't have kids. So almost all people I meet assume that I am also in my mid-twenties. If they explicitly say something about my age then I tell them my real age. But most people just assume and don't say anything, so I don't bring it up either.

So I met this guy while playing sports, pretty much everyone there was in their mid to late 20's except me. To make a long story short we ended up hitting it off. He was in town for business so we just had fun together, and then we hooked up. He had told some people that he was 28 but I found out by googling that he was actually 29. He never mentioned age to me though and we never talked about it.

We kept in touch for several months afterwards and he kept telling me I should come visit in his area where he lives. He then brought up how he was going to have a party for his 30th birthday. After he said that he very directly asked how old I am.

I told him I was 36 and his only reply back was a shocked face emoji with bulging eyes. Then he said he thought I was basically his age.

I said thank you, that's nice of you. He didn't reply. Then he said I should have told him how old I was.

I didn't reply to that and I'm not sure what to say. I think someone who's 30 and someone who's 36 ARE basically the same age. I never lied to him about my age and when he asked, I told him right away. But if this was a 29 year old woman and a 36 year old man, I don't think a single person would even think to act like it was weird or even classify it as an age gap.

c4p18o	2019-06-24 14:42:28		AITA by bringing a formal complaint to my boss about my supervisor	"Last year, I started experiencing inappropriate relations with my supervisor (who had been a good friend, colleague before I started this job). Inappropriate in the sense that I was being scrutinized, micromanaged, and being treated in a condescending way. Long story short, I brought up my concerns to my supervisor in after dealing with it for a month. I basically asked if there was anything wrong with the quality of my work, and my sup said no. I politely told them that the classification of my job allowed for flexibility in my hours (based on HR policies) and that as long as I was meeting expectations, that I didn't feel it was fair to be scrutinized if I was 30 minutes late (if I stayed 30 min late). The situation ""seemed"" to be resolved at that time, but a couple of weeks later the issues became worse. I received scrutiny related to my sick time (I had cancer, undiagnosed at that time). 

Over the next couple of months this continued, and it got so bad that I experienced a decline in my self-worth, doubted my expertise, and was anxious to leave my desk to go to the bathroom, grab a cup of coffee, etc. I only noticed it getting slightly better after my cancer diagnosis and surgery. This was all happening amidst my boss, who I also work closely with. I decided to tell the boss what had been going on. I didn't provide any instances, but told her that it had deeply affected my work environment and work-life balance. My boss and supervisor are close friends, and I was also scared of bringing it up to her because of that. Basically, my decision to bring my complaint to my boss backfired, and the boss conspired against me with my supervisor. They asked for instances of my supervisor's behavior. I provided them (they were documented with HR also - unbeknownst to them) and they proceeded to dissect each instance and make excuses for sup's behavior and began bringing up issues they had with my performance that had never been brought to my attention. At that time, I told them I wanted to involve HR and in our HR meeting, they said they thought I was going to sue the company (I'm not) and that they felt we needed to hash it out. HR backed me up when I said I didn't feel the need to hash these situations out and that I just wanted to move on. Sup and boss told HR that they felt that I had brought personal accusations forward and sup said they didn't think they could get over them but that they would be professional. HR did nothing. AITA for approaching my boss instead of going to my supervisor again to tell her my concerns? Should I have handled this differently?

&#x200B;

TL;DR I was being treated unfairly in the workplace, and after telling my supervisor about it once, decided to go to the boss about it after months of it continuing to happen. Now they both don't talk to me, and think I'm going to sue the company (I'm not)."	Not the A-hole	1	0

I grew up Muslim in Egypt and immigrated to the US when I was 9. I lived and grew up here. My parents were usually ""moderate"" in that they allowed me to take off the hijab and never wear it in the US. I also don't pray 5 times a day, and don't cook or clean. When I lived at home, my parents were strict. I wasn't allowed to have friends, wasn't allowed to go out or leave the house, and wasn't allowed to play music, watch shows/movies that weren't PG-13, and anything else banned under Islam. They are religious and they fast and pray. I was expected to fast during Ramadan when I lived at home.

&#x200B;

When I was 23, I graduated college and moved out on my own. I had boyfriends growing up, who I've kept ""in the closet"" because if my parents found out, they'd send me back to Egypt ""to be disciplined"". Well I'm 29 now. I'm recently single and dating someone I really like and I'm not sure if I want my parents to be involved in my marriage life at all. As you can probably imagine, I'm expected to marry a Muslim man, and they WILL raise hell if I don't. 

&#x200B;

Well...  I'm interested in White Agnostic or Athiest men and this is probably NOT going to go well with my family. I'm thinking since I live on my own, and my life is separate from theirs ... maybe I should just keep this from them. When I DO get married, I will probably do a courthouse marriage and just keep it quiet. I guess the cat will be out of the bag when I have my first kid...

BTW - I'm at that age when my parents would start venturing out and ""looking for husbands"" for me.... like by talking to the parents of other Muslim men. So if I'm not married to someone else, I'll be pressured into marrying a Muslim man and well... you guys can check out r/MuslimMarriage to see what that looks like.

In essence, Olivia was always miserable and crying and upset and at this point, I got tired of being her emotional sponge. I started to distance myself (after talking to her about this three times with no change) and I’m sure she started to notice. However, she’s never wanted to talk to me about it other than when I have brought it up and now it’s been six months since. Once in a while she will text me a meme or something like I love you and I miss you but that’s it.

"I have lived in a 4x2 apartment for the past year with a few of my friends and it has not been pretty. My closest friend and I have always been neat. We clean up after ourselves, buy cleaning supplies, cook, we do everything.

Our other roommates, not so much. At the beginning of our lease and throughout, we’ve talked to them multiple times about cleaning up after themselves and how “we’re friends and roommates, not personal maids.” And how they’re adults and we shouldn’t have to tell them to help out around the place. One of our roommates has gotten better about cleaning up after himself and helping out as the year has gone on. He will volunteer to help us clean the place of a weekend, takes out the trash when it’s full, he’s done his part for the last half of our lease.

Our other roommate still hasn’t gotten the message, and our lease is up in a month. Granted, after several months of preaching about how it isn’t cool to leave the apartment trash and then take off for the weekend, and how we need to clean up after ourselves when we make a mess, he has gotten a little better (and more receptive). He used to take us asking for help so personal and would just leave the apartment for a week. Just ignore us and leave us to clean up after him. Now, it’ll take him a few hours to a few days to follow through on us asking something of him which is better than nothing.

But every now and then, he still makes messes and will leave them for us to clean. Where we live, our city doesn’t have many affordable places for 2x1 or 1x1 floorplans, so I decided to propose for us to all live together again. Granted things got tough every now and then, but my closest friend and I agreed that they’ve both made improvements as roommates. 

I am thinking of retracting this offer to our one specific roommate as I had returned home late from a conference I went to to find empty alcohol bottles/caps piled on top of our trash can, more bottles/caps and napkins on the floor along with an empty pizza box, his sisters shit spread out in our living room, and dirty dishes in the sink. 

I was only gone for two days but he still decided to have his sister sleep over (without notice) and left a huge ass mess. When I woke up the next morning and saw him, he said absolutely nothing about everything that was still in the living room. Just turned to me and said “hey, I’m going to the beach. I’ll probably be back Monday.”

I couldn’t say anything back. I was speechless. Just fucking left and didn’t say anything about the mess. So my other roommates and I had to clean up after him, and now I am thinking of leaving this entire place for him to clean once we move out (for all the times he never helped out) AND retracting my offer.

c4ox4z	2019-06-24 14:35:37		WIBTA for suddenly not wanting to babysit my boyfriend’s niece anymore?	"I’m using a throwaway as friends and family know my main account. I’ve been dating my boyfriend Louis for almost a year now. He lives with his sister Anna, who is a single mother, and his young niece Jane (old enough to self entertain but still young enough that she needs adults around). Louis serves as a kind of positive male role model for Jane, which I think is great and I respect Louis’ decision. I am a live in nanny and as such, Louis can’t spend the weekends with me so I usually spend them in Anna and Louis’ shared home.

I’m fine with talking to Jane, helping pour her a bowl of cereal or chatting about school. But, I’m not Jane’s nanny. Jane often comes into Louis’ room without asking and will perch herself in the bed drawing or reading a book, while Louis and I are in bed watching a movie together. I find this inappropriate, especially when we are watching an adult film. I live far away from my family, but if I had a guest over I’d expect my young siblings to respect adult’s space, especially those who aren’t their parents. 

This sets up what happened a couple weekends ago. Anna went out of town and Louis was to look after Jane. Cool, Anna deserves some time off and Jane is old enough to be fine without her for a couple of days. I came over per usual, and the weekend’s activities centred around what Jane wanted to do. Fine, I was keeping Louis company. However, as soon as we came inside from the park Louis seemed disengaged and even got on his PS4 at one point. I was fully engaging with Jane but he was not. This drove me up the wall and we had our first argument. Louis is a very loving person, but I think he overextends himself, gets frustrated, and feels the need to disengage. 

Anna is having a girls’ night out this weekend. Again, cool, great for her. WIBTA if I told Louis that I won’t babysit Jane with him unless he agrees to a set of conditions prior (we schedule the evening completely, Jane in bed early i.e. 9:00 versus 9:30, us not on our phones or other devices, spending time outside versus inside)?"		1	0

My boyfriend of two years has cheated on me soooooooooo many times, w sooooooo many different girls. He literally cheated and lied to me for a year of our relationship. We have a daughter so we’re trying to work things out. 

One habit we have is always saying “I love you more,” after the other person says I love you. This was totally fine with me before but for some reason I absolutely hate it now. It almost offends me now that he’s done everything he has. Like how can he say he loves me more even though he’s lied to my face and fucked so many other girls? I want to bring it up but I feel like I’d sound like an asshole. I’m not even sure how I’d bring it up. AITA for absolutely hating this? 

Another thing i’m struggling with is leaving now that he’s actually trying.. The last time he cheated was in March and I’m sure it’ll eventually happen again even though he disagrees. He’s decided he’s done with other girls and he’s ready to be a boyfriend and dad. He’s really grown up and stepped it up but i’m miserably sad w him. Yes we have great days and great times but I can’t get everything he’s done out of my head. We got a place together in October because he claimed he was done cheating but of course that wasn’t true. I love our home and everything we have together but it’s not worth the depression and anxiety. I want to leave but I feel terrible. Here he’s doing everything to turn things around but nothing takes the pain away. I know this is probably a stupid question, i’m not looking for validation, I genuinely feel like shit for wanting to leave now that he’s “changed.” AITA for wanting to move on and be single even though he’s trying so hard now?"		1	0

First time posting here, usual “on mobile” so sorry for formatting. Also, throwaway just in case.

Anyway, to set the scene, I have been with my girlfriend for over a year now. I love her, she’s amazing, love of my life, etc… I also love her family, everyone treats me amazingly and I get along with them very well.  Unfortunately, they have these family friends who I don’t quite get along with. My girlfriend’s family goes over to these family friend’s house quite often and as a result, I get dragged along as well. Even though I don’t like being there, I still go because of my girlfriend and her family. I’ve always been a good guest, bringing over wine and other stuff whenever I go over there. 

So one day, me and my girlfriend along with her mom decide to go out for a quick bite and go to the bar together. I did not know that the family friends were going to be there too. It was a crowded place, so much so, that my girlfriend and me had to be at another table away from the rest of the group. It’s fine, no big deal, her and I were having a serious conversation about our future plans with her still being in school and me continuing my career.

Anyways, one particular couple from my girlfriend’s family friend group comes in. They are an older couple, let’s call them Steve and Molly. A lot of the family friend’s get-togethers are at their place, and I don’t really have a good time there, but I am still a gracious guest… Cleaning up afterwards and always bringing stuff over when I’m invited.

So, Steve and Molly go around the family friend’s table saying hi to everyone. Okay, no big deal, I was having a serious conversation with my girlfriend at a different table next to them, she probably didn’t see me, whatever. What made me think differently is that she was flamboyantly saying Hello to my girlfriend who was standing right next to me. Fine, no big deal, I just continued talking to my girlfriend afterwards.

When Steve and Molly finally leave, Steve says good bye to me and it was nice seeing you again, etc… I say the same. Then Molly was like “Why didn’t you say Hi to me?” to which I respond “Well, you could have said Hi to me too.” Then she says something about her being the elder and I’m always supposed to go up to her and say Hi. I just stand there astounded. I had my mouth open. I watched her go around and say Hi first to everyone (including my girlfriend right next to me) and she says this to me?

My girlfriend is on my side on this one, however that’s not the case with everyone else. Even my girlfriend’s mother says I owe Molly an apology. I am completely astounded… Am I the asshole here?"	Not enough info	0	0

"So my step sister is the daughter of my step mom who is an amazing woman and she takes care of me very well, and my SS is very nice to me too. However my SS is 25 and still living at home when she has her job and the bank and a plan to live with her boyfriend and puppy in a small house. They are planning to get married and have kids but neither of them are moving to their goal. The two of them take trips all the time to go dirt biking and they go Mexico and Ireland and they say that these trips are ""treats"". I feel like they should be saving money for the house and marriage though. Now let me explain where it really gets annoying. My sister has a lot of clothes, so I let her use my walk in closet for some of them when she was moving in. I can not get into my walk in closet at all now. The other thing is that our bedrooms are all on one floor with temporary walls and the ventilation system is cut off on my side. What does that mean? I'm hot as balls in the summer and cold as hell in the winter. But SS can be warm and have an AC in her window! My room is also very small and as I grow I'm going to get more stuff and eventually all my stuff is going to fill up my tiny room. I was also promised this room before it was hers, it was separated for when my other sisters came over but they are long gone. Am I the asshole for keep mentioning for her to move out?

c4os5b	2019-06-24 14:27:14		AITA for not “allowing” my roommate’s boyfriend to be alone at our apartment?	"This happened about a year ago and although I felt justified at the time, I always wondered if I was the asshole here.

I was living with my roommate/friend for the second time in a new place (both women/early 20s). We decided to live together again because we got along well as roommates - both clean, quiet, respectful, helpful, etc. Both of us were going to school and working so we were often out of the apartment and didn’t see much of each other. We honestly co-existed really well in every way except for this.

She started dating her new boyfriend around June and we moved into this place in August. He lived 3 hours away so when he visited it was of course for a few days at a time, but not super frequent. Even though we never really discussed overnight visitors (mistake I know), I had NO PROBLEM with him spending the night. My issue came when she would leave for work/school and he would be alone in our apartment, either when I was there or just by himself when I would leave.

This REALLY bothered me, although I can’t really explain why. It just DID. I didn’t like coming home to find this virtual stranger on the couch watching Netflix, hearing him in the kitchen, going to the bathroom, etc. It just really weirded me out. 

I told her I wasn’t cool with this and it really ended up putting a rift in her friendship. It was kind of resolved in that he came less frequently although he still hung out there alone.

I honestly can see her side, although I think as a roommate my comfort should have taken priority over his/her convenience. Maybe that makes me TA and I’ll accept it if so.

Her arguments (from what I can remember)
• he lives too far away to drive back so what else is he supposed to do during the day 
• she really likes him (FWIW they’re still together and she did move in with him after our lease was up)
• he’s nice and him and I have lots in common so I should make more of an effort to talk to him when he’s there 
• it happens infrequently because of the distance
• he’s quiet and clean

My arguments:
• I don’t know this person and I’m not comfortable having him in my space around my things when neither of us is home
• AT THE TIME they’d only been together for a few weeks/months - it might have been different if this was a long term boyfriend who I’d gotten to know better 
• staying overnight/hanging out in common spaces was totally fine AS LONG AS she was there too. It was literally just the alone thing that I was super uncomfortable with.

I honestly think either I’m NTA or there are NAH, but I would like some objective opinions."	No A-holes here	1	0

c4orjv	2019-06-24 14:26:13	flyditaly	WIBTA if I lied about being sick and called out?	"I am a college student working a retail part-time job for the summer. I am a completely fine employee, always on time, have good relationships with my coworkers and managers and even pick up extra shifts when asked. I am working almost constantly- my record so far is 10 consecutive days in a row, sometimes up to 9 hours a day.  For the most part I don't mind it, the job is entertaining enough and it's obviously not my life's work- I'm eventually going to go back to school at the end of the summer. However, they are terrible when it comes to giving days off. My coworkers are constantly complaining about days they requested off being blatantly ignored and being ""forced"" to change their plans and come into work if a cover was unable to be found. 

&#x200B;

For over a month I've had tickets to go to a matinee of a musical with a good friend of mine that I rarely get to see and it is something I've been looking forward to all summer. I put in a request for that day off weeks ago and lo and behold- I was scheduled.    

&#x200B;

There are two options for me here: 

1. I mention it to the scheduling manager and they try to find me a cover. If they are unable to find a cover, I will have to come into work and miss the show, therefore screwing over my friend. 

&#x200B;

2. I call out sick the morning of, lying and screwing over everyone at work that day of course by understaffing them, but guaranteeing I get the day off. Keep in mind, the manager that directly supervises us on the floor does not handle the schedule and therefore will not know that I initially requested that day off. 

&#x200B;

Because I'm fairly new, I really have no way of contacting my coworkers outside of work to ask if they can cover and I don't want to ask at work in case it makes it back to a manager. 

&#x200B;

I'm getting mixed opinions about calling out- my Dad is saying deal with it and be responsible by asking the manager and risk not being able to go. My Mom and a bunch of my friends are saying that they should expect people to call out when they don't honor requested days off and that ""everyone's done it"". 

&#x200B;

Of course, I will feel terrible about calling out and possibly changing the way my coworkers view me, but I also don't want to cancel on my friend, who at the end of the day is more important to me than a summer job. I have already missed out on a lot of plans with family and friends this summer so I can work. And besides, as I have mentioned, otherwise I have been a very good employee and really don't plan on making a habit out of this. 

&#x200B;

Either way I'm going to be screwing someone over but would I be the total asshole for calling out of work? 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Had tickets to a show with a friend, requested that day off weeks ago and was scheduled anyway, plan on calling out that morning."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I broke my foot. I have a one year old who is high energy and a climber. 

My dad is on holiday. My MIL is retired but chose going to the gym and attending a local event she said she didn’t even want to go to over offering help and childcare.

I don’t do things for myself unless hubby has our child so it’s not as if I’m asking for babysitting all the time. I thought family were meant to help out during the bad times?

c4opuv	2019-06-24 14:23:17	betsyplum	AITA for refusing to pay for something I ordered because they had a no laptop policy?	"I live in a city full of young professionals, students and freelancers and it's very common for over half the people in cafes to sit there working or studying on their laptops during the week. It's the norm, especially in my neighborhood. Some cafes have a ""no laptops during weekends"" or ""no laptops between 12-2 pm"" (during lunch breaks), types of policies. Some have designated areas for people sitting with their laptops. The few cafes that do restrict it put up signs clearly specifying their policy.

&#x200B;

So on a Tuesday I was working from home and went to a cafe at 3 pm. The place was 80% empty. I ordered a coffee and a piece of cake at the bar, then sat down and took out my laptop. As the waiter brought me my cake, he told me there were no laptops allowed in their cafe. I said sorry, I hadn't realized that since there was no sign anywhere, but said ok and in that case I'd like to cancel my order. He said it won't be possible to cancel my order because my coffee was already being made. He also said it's shitty that it has become the norm for people to work on their laptops in cafes, and that it's ruining the cozy atmosphere. I said I can take the coffee to go, but that the cake can easily be returned and that I won't pay for it. He said they didn't have any to-go cups. So I told him that they should put up a sign to avoid such misunderstandings in the future and simply left.

&#x200B;

I kind of feel like I was the asshole for ordering and not paying, but the alternatives would have meant for me to sit down for 15 minutes not being able to reply to some urgent emails just to eat that cake, or to pay for no service at all in order to be able to leave.

&#x200B;

EDIT: This was in Germany, so that may be the reason for some people's confusion about a few details like sit down cafes, not paying up front, the lack of to-go cups, etc."	Not the A-hole	0	0

He said it’s just for his own peace of mind, and he makes no comments about where I go (which is true) so he doesn’t know why I should care. 

When I’m home for the summer he’s also a bit weird about location. I made a *platonic* male friend in my neighborhood and my dad asked me to go on a drive with him, “conveniently” drove towards his street and asked me to point out his house. 

This irks me bc in 9th grade my dad was driving me home, and my brother (12th grade) was out for dinner. My dad drove us by the restaurant to make sure his car was there. He said he trusts him but it’s for his peace of mind. Basically my dad is very worrisome, but thinks it should be no problem bc he makes no comments or judgments towards us. He gets upset when I tell him to not do this. He says he does so much for me and all I do is complain about tiny things.

c4onka	2019-06-24 14:19:17	eyerollmom	AITA Can you be expected to be friends with someone you can trust?	"I quick backstory first, so you’re with me...my husband met a guy through mutual interests and they became really good friends. I met his wife and we became friends too. I met the wife’s BFF and she was awesome. We hit it off immediately. Turns out, the husband was having an affair with the BFF. Long story short, the husband and wife got divorced and he’s with the BFF...

Now I was absolutely disgusted that the two people you trust most in the world would do this to someone they loved. My husband asked if I could put my differences aside for the sake of his friendship (long story there) with the husband. I said ok because I know what their friendship means. So now they both expect me to be friends with the BFF. I just can’t. I can’t trust her and I certainly can’t respect her.

A few months ago, they asked if I wanted to join them at an opening of a restaurant. I told my husband to go ahead without me (made it clear to didn’t want to see the husband and the BFF together). I would pick him up on the way to the party we were attending later. So we arrange a time for me to pick him up. I arrive at said time, only to be told they still waiting for their lunch orders to arrive. So I suck it up and go into the restaurant. Only to discover, their were no lunch orders. They were waiting for me to join them for lunch! I was so pissed at being ambushed! Anyway my husband got a fucking earful!

Now fast forward to today, my husband phones to say the husband is coming for lunch on Sunday. Ok cool, no problem. Oh and by the way BFF and her son are coming too. Now what the fuck do I say to that? You’ve already invited them, told them it’s cool. I can’t even get drunk because I have kids and have work on Monday. So now I have to fake a fucking personality.

c4onbp	2019-06-24 14:18:53		AITA for texting my boyfriend about work while he’s on vacation?	"My BF and I have been dating for 11 months, almost a year. We are in high school. During the school year we work part time at the same store, and then we are both working full time in the summer. His family decided to go on vacation after school got out, so they’re at Disney world for a 8 day vacation and I’m at work all the time. 

We’ve had some meetings recently about changes to the company and letting us know about the ways that corporate is going to be doing things differently in the near future. I thought I would be a good girlfriend and let him know about these meetings so he’s not overwhelmed when he comes back to work next week. So I’ve been taking detailed notes and texting them to him. 

He snapped at me last night over text saying he’s trying to relax with his family and he doesn’t want hear all this stuff about work while he’s trying to have fun at Disney world. I got a little angrier than I probably should have and I snapped back at him with a long text about how the world doesn’t stop just because his family takes him on vacation, everyone back here is still living in the real world and I was just trying to be nice and keep him informed. He said none of it affects him directly so he can just read my notes when he gets back. We fought for a while. 

I just don’t think that his excuse of being at Disney world is a good enough reason to avoid your full time job. It’s not like he deserves or planned this vacation, he’s just tagging along on a trip his parents are paying for. I also think some of his explanation is childish, we are both going to be 18 next year, Disney world is for little kids, there can’t be so much for you to do there that even talking about work a little distracts you from much.

c4omyu	2019-06-24 14:18:19		AITA for keeping this extra money from my mom?	"Just to clarify, I work for my mom’s business. I work A LOT- I can’t even remember the last time I had an actual day off. I’m a college student, so saving up and working as much as possible is important to me. 

My mom finds reasons to deduct money from my pay a lot. If she’s doing bad financially, she’ll take money from my paycheck for some silly reason. If I ever tell her I really need the money that week and ask that she takes some money a different time, she’ll freak out on me. 
Reddit has already told me not to let her borrow money anymore. I posted about her before. Whenever she’s doing badly on bills (which would happen a lot because my dad basically doesn’t work because he’s lazy) she’ll demand and/or guilt me into lending her $2000. They’re very irresponsible with spending and often blow money on stupid shit that isn’t important. 

Anyways, my parents were on vacation this week, so I was working my ass off because I was the only person who could cover all of the work. I didn’t have a moments rest. One of her customers told me she should give me a bonus for all the work I was doing, and I thought it was funny so I told my mom. 

Well I got my pay this week and it was $120 heavy. I calculated and counted just to make sure, but the amount was on my pay stub, so I was thinking maybe she was just being appreciative of all the work I did this week (silly silly me). I was ecstatic. I’ve been thinking all morning how I’m gonna say thank you- wash her car? Take her out to breakfast? Maybe I’ll just tell her I don’t want the extra at all. I work so hard and give up all of my time to help her out, but I still didn’t think I deserved it. 

Yeah well I called her up to thank her. The reply? “It was only $20 extra, there’s no need to thank me”. IT WAS A MISTAKE. Here I was thinking she was thanking me for all of my hard work, and it was a mistake! That conversation was followed by her telling me she needs to borrow $2000 from me, so I felt a lot less guilty. 

AITA for just keeping this money? I was thinking that if I start to feel REALLY guilty (I’m already feeling pretty awful) I’ll just tell her I counted my money and realized she gave me extra and give it back to her. Her demanding money from me really changed my entire approach. I feel stupid because I was so happy about the possibility of her wanting to give this to me as a thanks."		1	0

"A little bit of background, I commute to work opposite the normal flow of traffic meaning I leave the city in the morning and come back in the evening.  This means I generally have to deal with less traffic and, more importantly, carpool lanes are open to all traffic for pretty much my entire commute.
Now I know what your picturing and no, I wasn't sitting next to some car for 2 whole minutes slowing gaining on them.  In fact, I had just passed the third car in  a slower moving caravan when the incident in question occurred.  I was driving 56 +/- 1 mph (questionable old car speedometer) in a 55 zone passing the traffic which was probably going 2-4 mph slower than me when someone starts riding my bumper clearly wanting to get around.  Now on a normal highway with just passing and travel lanes, I probably would have bumped up cruise control a few mph and got out of their way, but on this particular stretch of road there's a third ""carpool lane"" to my left which, as I mentioned before, is open to  all traffic at this point and currently wide open so I just held speed.  Instead of passing me on the left, this driver waited until there was just enough room to veer to my right and zoom by while giving me the middle finger.  She was actually the first of a few people to aggressively pass on my right, but in all cases my left was wide open.   I get that these people might not have known that the carpool lane was open to all traffic, but there were electronic signs at every other overpass saying ""open to all traffic"" and analogue signs in between listing carpool hours (4-7pm I believe).

c4oegg	2019-06-24 14:03:39	_Ameno_	WIBTA if I asked my mom to buy me another bag of crisps?	"This is a really minor thing, but it has been bothering me slightly.

&#x200B;

I am 18 years old and still studying, I have a minor job with which I earn about 140 euros a month.

Yesterday, I had a movie night at my house and my friends brought snacks, but I had some of my own too. Not everything was consumed and my friends left the remaining stuff, so I stored it on a shelf so I could eat it later. There were two nearly empty bags of crisps and one big one that I had bought myself that was filled for 2/3rds or more. 

So fast forward to today, I went to work for 5 hours and when I come back, my mom kind of laughingly says they ate *some* of it. I take a look at the shelf and I see that they ate the two nearly empty bags, which I don't care about at all. But they also completely emptied the big bag except for about 10 crisps...

The bag costs 2,35 euros so it isn't expensive, but I hate how she said they ate *some* of it and I come to see that they ate everything while I was away and they didn't even ask...

Now, I would kinda like to tell her it bothers me, but it may be unfair since she pays for all the groceries and almost all my other expenses.

c4ob7p	2019-06-24 13:58:11	NonConPornVic	AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to massage a particular person?	"This is a person we both use to work with and i want to make it clear that is not the reason i have a problem with this. She is free to massage whoever until there's a conflict of interest to our relationship.

We met at Jimmy John's and she was one of those girls everybody wanted including this particular person. We've both moved on since to other jobs and professions. 

This is where the problems begin. He knows I'm dating her and one night when we were all out at a bar with coworkers he tried to dance on her while she was extremely drunk. First action of disrespect. Once she noticed she pushed him away. No big deal. She did what she needed to so nothing needed to be said. This was about 6 months ago. 

Next problem came about a few days ago with this guy. I was playing on her phone and he texted her saying how he's excited to smoke and drink with her for his massage. She's told me about everyone else she's planned to massage but him. We don't snoop through each others phones but I became alarmed and curious so I looked through their messages. I found where he tells her how good she looks and cute knowing she's dating me. She sends emojis and thanks. I feel like she should have said ""thanks but would you say that if my boyfriend was around?"" He wouldn't. In my eyes that's disrespect. And let it be known its completely different if its someone she doesn't know coming in for a massage telling her she's cute. That does not bother me. Its the fact that he knows im with her.

Also since she's still in school for massage therapy she does this privately at her home not in a business. If it wasn't private i probably wouldn't have as much of a problem with it. I have a hard enough time getting her to do massages for me topless because in her words its not professional. To me getting drunk and high with a client is also bery unprofessional. She thinks im asshole though because she's ""just trying to network"" for when she gets out of school

Edit: she's actually already done the massage and drank with him. She just admitted it. I've broken up with her and don't really know what to think about all this."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4o647	2019-06-24 13:49:10	throwawayYEET7	AITA for not spending as much time with my disabled friend?	"So for context, me and my core high school friend group have a friend (we'll call him P) who's condition (I believe it's muscular dystrophy, but don't fully remember because I've only asked once) leaves him in a chair for the rest of his life. We met him as juniors and for two years we've gone to his house many times to play video games, smoke weed, and just hang out with him. We're all graduated now, and five of us live together, but now with us working full time/going to college/living further away, it's harder to consistently hang out with him like we did in high school.

&#x200B;

One of our buddies works with P as an aide, and he said that recently P is mad/disappointed with us because of it. Keep in mind, we still see him about once a week, just not as often as we did because it was easier to just go from school to P's house and chill for a bit. I personally feel like P is being somewhat unreasonable. Those of us living away from our parents now live 20 minutes away from him, which doesn't sound like a lot, but for young adults paying rent that can add in gas money. We also just have more responsibilities now and it's harder to find times that work with everyone's schedule. P's also mad that we don't buy weed as often, which is because most of us are growing out of it quicker than we thought we would, and that oftentimes we do go out on weekends and do something that he's not a part of. He says himself however that he doesn't enjoy doing the types of activities we like (could just be going out to eat or visiting a park, etc), the only one he really does is going to concerts, which we invite him to. I would like to invite him over to our apartment, but it's on the second story and there isn't a practical way to really get him in.

&#x200B;

AITA because we're not taking his feelings into consideration? Or are we justified? I feel like he has to realize we can't always hang out with him like we did, and that sometimes we like to go out and do things rather than stay in, get stoned and play video games or watch movies all the time.

&#x200B;

Edit: P also badgers me to do acid with him because he knows that I've dabbled in psychedelics and wants to try it, but I refuse because his dad won't approve. I get that it's P's body and he technically decides what he ingests, but given the situation and the fact that his dad is his caregiver when an employee isn't there, I don't feel comfortable going behind his back and giving his son LSD. I mean he let us get stoned at his house whenever we went over and has been very friendly to us throughout the years and I don't want to overstep any boundaries."	No A-holes here	0	0

This is fairly minor compared to some things on this sub, but it's a conflict I have going on rn. So, I'm a vegan. I'm not an asshole about it or anything, I won't tell you you're a shitty person for eating animal products or anything, but I do do it for ethical reasons. I've been vegan since I was 16, so six years and was vegetarian for four years before that. 

Now, here's the issue. I babysit my 7 year old nephew for a couple of hours after school three days a week, plus full days every other Saturday. He's a great kid, and we always have fun. I keep my fridge and snack cupboard well stocked with plant based goodies, and he's always welcome to help himself. He's not a spoiled kid at all and never complains, but he did recently ask about Babybel cheeses. Now, I'm of the opinion that vegn cheese is shite, especially if you're used to ""real"" cheese, and even if it wasn't idk if there's any kind of vegan alternative for Babybels specifically. I just kinda told him ""oh sorry mate I don't have those"" and he said okay and had some crisps instead. I guess he mentioned it to my sister, because she's been nagging on at me for being a cruel uncle who refuses to buy his only nephew his favourite snack. I've explained that I just don't buy animal products but I'm willing to buy him any vegan alternatives to things he likes. This isn't good enough for her, and ahe keeps calling me a selfish weirdo for this. Idk where I stand. I don't really wanna put my ethics aside, but I can kinda see why she thinks I'm selfish.

c4o3n9	2019-06-24 13:44:51	kindakeen	AITA for giving up on my negative brother?	"Background: I'm 23, my brother is 27. We work together @ the small family business and live on the same floor of a building.

My brother is a sworn metalhead. We're talking tens of band shirts, huge collection of music, trips for concerts/festivals, etc. With the years, he has started listening to pretty heavy, dark stuff. I am not sure if this music brought up his affinity to negativity and ""darkness,"" or it was the other way around, but this is the reality. My brother is fascinated with serial killers, people who are in jail for burning down churches, and loves being very graphic when insulting somebody (i.e. ""This guy deserves his mom to watch him die a horrible death""). He often casually expresses disdain with life and existing as a whole, which is ridiculous considering he has nothing to complain about. Naturally, all these things make people around him very uncomfortable. He keeps dropping bombs at dinners and family lunches, and always seems to steer a conversation to something metal-related.

Latest example: (at a family lunch) ""At this death metal concert I went to a band kept throwing pig blood at the audience it was sick!""

Us, normies: Awkward silence followed by a topic change.

His behavior is not different at lunch with our 4 employees, and the outcome is the same.

Between not being able to have a normal conversation with him, his racist/homophobic moods, daily having to message him to turn down his music, I have become colder and feel pushed away. I find it difficult to talk to him, especially knowing I would never have or want anything to do with him if he was a person I met on the street and talked to. I have tried to have many conversations with him, where he seems like he gets what I am saying, but never changes. At this point I have pretty much given up on the relationship and keep it mostly professional. It makes me sad because I am sure he feels this change, and I know he isn't a bad guy, he can actually be very helping and caring. He just doesn't seem to get what makes people uncomfortable or is too inconsiderate to keep his strange hobies/affinities out of conversations with uninterested people. Either way, I have been dealing with this for years and am fed up with it. So, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I don’t know the cause of death but he wasn’t murdered, that much I know. It was still unexpected. He didn’t have any life insurance so his widow is asking for help with the cost of his funeral. She’s has shitty job at a laundromat that pays minimum wage. I lost count on how many kids she had. I think she was up to 4 last I spoke to her.  We’re not close. The oldest is like 25 and the youngest is, i don’t know, like 10. She’s 46, so do the math 

We’re a large family and one of my other cousins organized a goFund me and has asked all of us to pitch in a couple hundred bucks. Myself and the rest of my cousins are doing okay for ourselves and a few hundred bucks isn’t a big deal.  Well... I don’t want to participate, and this is why:

1. This is the second time we pay for a funeral for her. Her son died of the flu. He had congenital heart disease and needed a lot of attention. She is antivax and would take him to Mexico for treatment because “these doctors don’t know anything”. We all helped because, c’mon it’s a dead child. 

2. She’s “Christian” and doesn’t believe in cremation. Which would be way less expensive than a whole funeral. She’s being a choosy beggar. 

3. Her husband was a grade A creep, with a history of drug use. Honestly, I think he overdosed. He was 35 and my cousin was 15 when she ran off with him. Her parents were just kinda “meh” about it. Unfortunately it’s not unusual in Latin-American countries.  

My brother says I’m being a judgmental asshole.
So...AITA?

Edit: I will accept my judgement, and yes give her money, but let me paint a better picture of my reason for my disdain.  Afterwards I will say no more. 
When her child past away, we (family) were sadden but not shocked. She was very noncompliant with doctor’s orders to the point that the pediatrician reported her to CPS. Nothing came of the investigation, child remained with her. When her child died she posted selfies with his dead body on FB with only the link to the goFund me. It was grotesque. And I guess I never forgave her? Idk if that’s even the right word. 
Her husband was abusive and controlling, (no surprised there) and I guess I feel like he should not get a big funeral like he was some great man. I know that’s not my call. I just can’t understand why after all the abuse she would even care. I guess for his kids, idk. 
Thanks for all the comments. They did make me “dig deeper” into the reasoning behind my actions. I won’t lie and say we’ll best buddies, but I’ll do what the rest of my family is doing for her."	Asshole	0	0

This happened yesterday morning and as it was a Sunday we were preparing to go to church, so I threw on jeans and a top because who am I trying to impress and took my pink backpack.

 I went to the living room to get my jacket and saw my sis trying to stuff her things into one of *my* red bags I was fuming and tried to grab from her since she didn't ask, she then ran to our mum bag in hand asking *her* if she could use my bag, and my mum being the bitch she was said yes.

 I was livid. I told her it wasn't right seeing as it was my bag not her's and she didn't get it for me it was a gift  (a very special one) and to top that off the little shit didn't even ask.

 Our mum just said she should ask, she did and I shut her down with a hard no. Then my mum started screaming insults at me, I waited till she was done but I still refused to let her have the bag.

The little shit grudgingly gave up the bag and I went to hide it in my room.

My MIL doesn't know my kids names
u/MOKGCBAL
I have been with my husband for 18 years, married for 17 years. I had 4 kids when we met. The 3 oldest lived with their father's family, the youngest lived with us fulltime and was eventually adopted by my husband, we eventually had 2 more children together. So all together I have 6 kids, the 3 youngest who lived with us and the 3 oldest who did not.

My MIL has never liked me. When she was told that we were engaged she offered to pay for my husband to go to college but only if he moved out of my house and called off the wedding.

I have tried to get to know my MIL. I have asked her questions about her life, her childhood, her interests, her firends. My MIL has never made an effort to get to know me. She has never asked about my childhood, my interests, my 3 oldest children, my physical disabilities. I learned a long time ago that when she asks how I am doing the only response she wants is ""good, thank you, and you"". In the past she has turned her back on me mid-sentence and started a conversation with someone else when I have answered with more than that.

For the first 8 or 9 years of our marriage my MIL complained about me to my husband every chance she got. She mades statements like ""where does she get off spending $3 on herself if she doesn't work"". The $3 was for a pair of shoes. My husband prefers I stay home and manage the kids, the house, the budget, the bills, the cooking, the laundry, the mortgage. He is very good at earnimg money, he is not so good at anything else. He doesn't know how to make a pot of coffee, how to deposit money in the bank, or even who holds our mortgage (I negotiate everything through email, pretending to be him and just signs the paperwork) Our situation works for us and he made it known before we got married he needes to be ""taken care of"". My MIL did not give my husband the life skills he needed to do anything for himself other than earn money.

My husband insists that his mother likes me. That she buys me birthday presents and Christmas presents. My response is that she is too polite not to give her son's wife a present at Christmas.

So here we are 18 years in and she does not know my oldest 3 children's names. My husband thinks that it is unreasonable for me to be hurt by the fact that she doesn't care to learn my children's names. That she doesn't ask about them. He won't even hear how I feel and why because he thinks his mom is a Saint.

He hasn't been able to finish any sort of education, has never even tried rehabilitation and quit his previous apprenticeship six months ago. Since then he has been sitting at home unemployed, doing nothing. My father has been the enabler most of the time, while my mother was more on the strict side and tried to push my brother to go into rehab etc. Living with them made my sister and I very depressed. Years ago I decided to cut off all contact with both my father and my brother. I now have a stable, independent life and a fulfilling job. I steal deal with depression, but it's better. My parents separated.

My brother used to live in a different city for the apprenticeship he was doing. He's now back home, but there is a lot of furniture that needs to be moved as soon as possible. Yesterday my father texted me, asking for help, because my brother won't cooperate. My mom, with whom I have a healthier relationship now, thinks I should help because he is almost 60, has heart conditions and can't do all the work alone. I think it's not my responsibility to clean up my brother's mess, especially when he would be perfectly capable of doing so himself. At the same time I feel really guilty for saying no.

A bit of background: 
I was away all weekend and got back late last night. Side note: I typically do all the chores in the house (bf does most of the cooking) and I like to get my chores done in the morning before I make coffee and start the day. 

This morning I’m doing my chores, exhausted as fuck all, and kinda frustrated at just how many chores I have to do before I start actually making coffee. 

While I’m in the middle of my chores, bf comes in to say good morning and get the usual hug and kiss. Usually this is fine, but today I’m not really in the mood for any human contact, so I give him a quick kiss and say “I just want to get this done, but I’ll bring your coffee when it’s ready.” 

Finish my chores, bring bf coffee and he’s upset that I wouldn’t “take 2 seconds out of my day to say good morning.” He says it made him feel like shit especially since I’ve been gone all weekend. Talked about it some more and he said if roles were reversed, he would have put aside his discomfort to say good morning to me.

c4npin	2019-06-24 13:19:25	0000MRT0000	AITA for not wanting to pay for my 18 yo step daughters phone and car insurance?	" 

I will be married 10 years in Sept. Her kid (my step daughter) just turned 18. I've been with her since she was 4 but she has NEVER showed any real love or affection towards me. Her dad is in her life. I intentionally did want want to be her ""father"" but more of a ""father figure"" in her life. Currently I have been paying for her car insurance and phone for the last 5 years. Her grandma pays for her car payment. She barely works. She is extremely lazy around the house doing absolutely NOTHING to help out. When we ask her to watch our kid she is the worst and does minimal. It's like she doesn't even care about her half sis.

&#x200B;

Months before she turned 18, I asked that her mom and her talk about what the game plan was going to be when she turned 18. Nothing happened. Big surprise.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now, she just turned 18 and moves out of the house. Partly because her mom wanted her out and partly because she decided she wanted to leave on her own. Just like that. Moves in with her bio dad. I gave her a week to figure out what to do with her phone. Does she want it? Will her dad pay for it now? Does she want to cancel it costing me $? 

&#x200B;

I really don't think I should be paying for her phone or car insurance at this point but my wife still totally baby's her to the point that she's admitted that she's ""fucked up"" in raising a spoiled entitled self absorbed selfish child. But now mom says she will pay for her phone instead of me. Yes she works, but it is our money, not mine or hers is my belief. I really don't think we should do anything and let her grow up. Especially since she decided to put her big girl pants on and move out and take all her stuff with her.

&#x200B;

NOW her dad says he can't take her! I don't want her at the house. I want her to grow up. Had she gone to school we would have continued to pay for things as long as she got good grades etc. But the moment she decided to move out, to me, all bets are off. She needs to learn consequences and accountability with I have battled with my wife for her to learn but then again, I'm only her step dad so I feel like all I'm good for is $ to her and that hurts my feelings. AITA for not wanting to pay for her stuff anymore?

Update:  I just learned that she doesn’t want to move in until I move out because she says it is “toxic” in our house.  So she is actually trying to manipulate the situation so she can get rid of me and make me divorce my wife.  Really.  It might work.  We have fought over how to raise her for years.  And my wife has said, if it comes down to your or my daughter, I will always pick her.  So this is what I’ve had to deal with since she was around 8.  Powerlessness."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c4nok9	2019-06-24 13:17:47		AITA for being protective in my relationship?	"Some backstory: Me and my SO since 4 years have recently had bad fights over things that in the long run don't really mean shit and mostly stems from me being protective due to history of unfaithful people. This shit sticks, and it makes me question more or less everyone that has 2+1 interactions.

An example of this would be the most recent fight. She and her recently single best friend were meeting this guy my SO´s best friend was into, we'll call her Clare. However just when they were about to head out the guy Clare fancies, wanted to have a drink at hers before going out. Clare accepted, and when they opened the door not only did the guy Clare fancy come but also his friend who also just recently came out of a relation, effectively making it a double date.

My SO did not approve of this but felt she might as well go along with it since she did not have any plans of going on much longer, she called me to get picked up about 30 minutes later. My SO is way too kind of a person to believe Clare knew about this and denies it was a double date. This by nature caused another tiresome fight, where me being insecure spit out horrible words about her BFF which she in return can't bear to hear so she attacks me to protect her BFF.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This makes me furious. But still makes me question whether or not its me being an overprotective POS or Clare being a \*4kids censorship\* for most likely knowing there would be 2 guys coming in and having a ""chat"", also knowing me and my SO has had it rough during the whole week, yet proceeds to do this so she could get \*4kids\* that night."

c4nfvu	2019-06-24 13:03:14	Idkwhatthisis22	AITA for snapping at my brother, after he refused to contiribute financially after father pased away?	"My father recently passed away and our whole family is understandibly not in the best position.

We are of middle eastern culture so we are brought up to always help, support and endure the family and their mistakes.

So in his will, my dad left the family some money to get by. Its enough to feed us and pay all the bills for little over a years time if we all contribute equally to the circumstances (My brother, my mother and my sister and me got nearly equal share, with my mom having the most obviously, which is, as it should be).

So we are about a little over a months in on my dad passing away and we all still visibly struggle with emotions and dealing with all the stuff, because my mom was never working (middle eastern culture, as I said) and she was more of a stay at home mom for most of her life, but did a wonderful job in raising us, I couldnt be more proud of the education and love we received growing up, which is not a given in this culture.

So naturally we are about to sell our big appartment to downsize because of low income (I recently graduated and now making acceptable amount of money, my brother is 22, jobless and isnt really the type of person searching for a job, my sister is underage and still living with my mom.)

So as the oldest son, the duty of providing for my family fell onto me, which I gladly will take responsibility of, because thats what my father would have wanted.

&#x200B;

The Problem is, that my brother wants to take his share and not contribute to the situation.

So we had a huge argument and I told him, that I fully understand, that its fathers will and his share and he can do whatever he wants with it, but it would be nice, if he contributed to the bills and stuff,  which will cost us a lot.

The funeral was very expensive on its own, so some of the share has already been burned up.

He refused to contribute, because he says he got no job and needs the money.

The problem is, that I know, that he takes this as a free pass to not work for a couple month and feed him off of his share and only after its depleted, he would look for a job again.

But I would have expected, that he knows, how hard this is on the entire family and contribute even just a tiny bit.

So I snapped at him and told him to never speak to me again and get lost.

&#x200B;

After things cooled down the past days, I tried to contact him to make up with him, but he didnt call back.

My mom and sister told me I was too hard on him, but I personally disagreed up until now. Hence this post, if I ATA.

I know that it is hard on him too. I may have done him wrong and its definetly his choice to decide, what he does with the money.

But my father did raise us to always look out for each other, which hurts to see, that he currently is not.

But then again, he may have real problems, we do not have time for right now, which I could be neglecting and thus he may feel ignored. But we got bigger fish to fry right now in my opinion.

AITA in this?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Since some of you needed some info and I could not be around yesterday here it goes:

My brother and me moved out a couple of years ago, he moved out at 19, worked until he was 20 and lives off government assistance for the last 2 years.

I moved out 21 (am 25 currently) and graduated this year and found a job immediately and have been full time employed for the last 2 months.

Regarding the question of how much I would like him to contribute, we did not have a fixed number yet. It was more like the first thing he said, he wouldn´t do, so we did not come down to the part of actually calculating, how much it exactly was. Of course we already payed for the funeral and I calculated the next 12 month of groceries, rent, canceling fee of current apartment, down payment of next and so on. This I did AFTER we had the fight, because it was pretty much the first thing he said after he got to see the money from my fathers will, so we immediately had an argument. I do not want to disclose the exact amount I came up with and we would need until next year, because who knows if relatives or anything are seeing this post and I dont want to get into details for them to know.

c4nf93	2019-06-24 13:02:14		AITA for not wanting a relationship with my dad?	"(sorry typed out on phone) 

I'm 21 and live with my parents and younger siblings. My dad has schizophrenia (explaing his actions).

Around the age of 10, I started to be bullied at school so I took that home with me and bullied my younger sibling for about a month before I realised I was a cunt. (I regret this deeply and try to make up for it by loving them as much as I can now)  

My dad noticed I guess and started to pick on me in return. This would be things like calling me names and grounding me over things that never occured, to tripping me over, acusing me of stealing, I was chased and hit a lot etc. 

In high school I tried to be friends with him again but now I was older and started to gain my own values and perspective, I noticed how he treated those around him. He would steal money from my mom, accuse her of cheating, double standards, throwing tantrums over things like wanting to watch TV, us kids playing,  having no food prepared. 

To me he acts like a toddler and can't communicate affectivly (meaning he feels like we are attacking him when we don't understand or don't know something as it wasn't explained). An adult should make their own food,  be a parent and not call it ""babysitting"" when mum had to go out for food and such. I dont think parenting is only disciplining your kids when they are being annoying. 
 
I backed away from him. I slowly found it uncomfortable to be in the same room as him and now has lead to anxiety. I cannot make eye contact with him, Talk to him more than simplicities, be around him for extended periods of time or hear him yell.  I have an anxiety attack.  

He now ignores the younger kids when they are acting out and he yells at them when they are annoying him. (IE playing video games or watching TV when he wants to, arguing) his reactions are like a child's but he talks to them in a way that you would talk to someone who just shat on your lawn.

Everyone has learnt to ignore his behaviour and pretends it doesn't exists, he gets very angry when you comment. 

Mum told me I hurt him by not wanting to talk to him or be around him. I feel like an asshole. I know it's his illness but I just can't do It. I can't connect with him. I can be civil and I will continue to ignore his behaviour becouse I don't like conflict but I don't want to be friends with him.

c4neyy	2019-06-24 13:01:46		WIBTA if I tell my sister that her boyfriend is bullshitting her?	"My sister wants to study to the US with her boyfriend.She had national exams, similar to SATs, She has shat the bed and now (yesterday) we also know how bad.

She will, with very high probability, not get accepted to the degree that she wanted but, with high probability, she will be accepted to a decent programme that is also significantly closer to what she wants to do after, but it's 2 and half hours away by bus and we don't have the funds to support her living there. She could live there if she gets a job but that will make the whole situation harder as we don't have a second car. Another issue with this is that her boyfriend is in this town and this is her main reason for not wanting to go. Her boyfriend has to do 1 year of mandatory military service.

Our suggestion (our mother's and mine) is that she takes a year off, reserving her spot for the next year and take the exams again, if she fails again, she could start the original degree and move on from there, if she doesn't, she can get to study to a university that is really close to home, she will probably have a car to drive herself around and in the case of her getting accepted to a university in the states, she could go there. We suggested this because we know how easy it is to do if, assuming one puts the work required.

The issue, her boyfriend comes from a very different background compared to ours. We are poor, 3 children, our mother has a huge mortgage, no relatives from our side of the family, I am studying full time, but I am also working in my field, our brother is doing poorly at school and mom is working 12hour days, with my brother and I helping around the household. In-contrast, her boyfriend hasn't experienced anything close to what we have and he doesn't understand our situation because he never got to live it.

Her boyfriend has the skills and the diplomas to get accepted as well as the necessary funds. My sister doesn't have the luxury of studying in the US. She doesn't have a large or good enough portfolio, she isn't an amazing artist and the $20 grand per year she will need is close to mom's salary. So her boyfriend for the last IDK how many hours has expressed that the university she wanted is horrible and filling her head with ideas of how they will go to the states and study together and doesn't realize that not only that, is not feasible, it's impossible.

Another issue with this situation is that her boyfriend is one of the reasons she wasted time from her studies as she wanted to go see him give his music examinations. I get that if she wanted it she could have stayed home, but my sister isn't the kind of girl that can make this kind of decisions and he could have very well asked her to study instead of coming because that would be more important.

____

WIBTA if I tell my sister that her boyfriend is filling her head with bullshit? I don't want to end up bad mouthing him but I can't seeing this whole ordeal unfold making her even more delusional.


**Edit**: Since this has been mentioned 3 times already, she can't travel from our country to the US without a **visa** and she has nobody to sponsor her besides a university that might accept her.

**Edit2**:
I am also not telling her not to live her life. I want to tell her that her boyfriend's plan are not realistic and filling her with resentment towards either university is only going to cause more harm to her than good."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4nery	2019-06-24 13:01:28	Quickthrownaway	AITA for not knowing my friend liked someone?	"Okay so throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I’m (20f) currently in uni and one of my housemates (19f) wanted a house party this last weekend, inviting like 30-50 people from my course, her course, our other housemate’s course, their housemates and other random friends. 

There’s three of us girls living here and we were all happy to split the cost of providing some mixers and beer, and happy with anyone crashing over who needed to. 

So the party starts, everyone’s having a great time and I hit it off with a guy I know from the gym, had a few flirty convos in the past but this is our first time properly meeting. Much, much later into the night I end up going up to my room him and on our way up, we bump into his friend I’ve never met coming out of our toilet. They have a little chat and he says he might be going home, but we try to convince him to stay. We talk for a little while at the top of the stairs and basically, we all end up going back to my room. 

Well the following morning, the guys leave and the house starts to clear out, probably like 10 people ended up staying on the sofas, floor and other housemate’s rooms. 

After everyone’s gone, my housemate starts unleashing hell on me. She’s screaming and crying about how I apparently, slept with the guy she really liked (not the one I knew from the gym) and I’ve betrayed her and she can’t beleive I’d do this to her etc. 

I start saying about how I had no idea she even liked him, but she cuts me off to say that the whole reason she wanted the party was as an excuse to get to know this guy more and after like an hour of them talking, he’d disappeared and she thought he’d gone home. 

Now I obviously feel totally shitty about this situation and I get maybe I shouldn’t have done what I did? But I also had no way to know she liked him, so AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4n861	2019-06-24 12:50:05	75mark	AITA for cutting off my brother for constantly doing petty things and belittling me in front of family	"Update:


The responses I got confirmed that I was NTA, my brother takes delight in gas lighting me, putting me down and accusing me of terrible things to my workmates and family for ""fun"". I cut him off via text and posted AITA on reddit. Last night I came home (I still live at home and my brother does not)  to a bunch of cars on the driveway including my brothers car. I walked into an ambush. 

My brother had called my parents and said that I was addicted to drugs and he set up an intervention with my cousins and my parents minister (we are not very religious but go maybe once a month).  As soon as i walked in my dad and the minister sat me down and asked me if I had been using drugs. I was bewildered. I do not do drugs. As soon as denied it my dad said, son it's OK, Brett (my brother but not his real name) told us and we love you. 

Then we went into our main living room with about 12 family members there. My oldest cousin was crying and my brother was sitting there smugly. My younger cousin who is a similar age and who I KNOW smokes weed was also smirking. Then the minister asked us to start the session by praying. But in my head I am so angry at my brother. His idea of a joke is to say I am addicted to drugs and my whole family believes it?!  My mother is blaming herself. I argues that hay I am not doing drugs, and I started swearing at my brother. ""you tell them, tell them the truth that you are joking"" I screamed. Then my father and the minister took me out of the room and said how dare you speak to Brett when he was the only one willing to help you. He organised all this and he is trying his best to help you. 

I started to cry at this point because of all the rage. I didn't know what to do so I left the house. Before I left the minister said you are allowed to leave and we will be here for you, but you cannot drive away from here. But I said to him that he and my dad can check all my belongings, my room my car and everything. I reasoned with him that Brett is playing a prank. A prank that went too far and he is not my brother. I said to my dad the same. My dad wasn't sure but I could tell he was seeing it from my side. I said go to my room right now and show me the drugs then. I don't even smoke. Show me the needles? Show me the drugs? I work and I play Xbox dad. 

I left in the end because I was so embarrassed and am staying at a friends tonight. 

I don't even want to get my brother back. I just want him to stop


***original below***


So, I'll try and keep this short. My younger brother gets butthurt at the smallest things, losing in halo when I try and help him, if I run late to meet him for coffee he will blow me off and act like I've ruined his day etc. We are adults now and he still acts like a child. To get to the crust of the matter, he constantly belittles me whenever a girl is around or someone from our family. If we are together or just hanging with the boys he is normal. 

20 years of pent up anger has driven me to the edge, like he will make a sexist comment one day and then the next he will say it was my comment around girls that I work with. Then he will tell our family about it and how the girls were all horrified. (this is an exact example of what happened last week). 

There is more of course but I can barley write it because I am so furious at him. 

The final straw in the camel was him taking over my Xbox live account (I give him access to my games)  and he ruined my kill to death ratio in Halo 5,sent VERY rude messages to my team mates who don't believe my side of the story (r/oopsdidntmeanto) I sent him a text saying I am cutting him off and no longer see him as a brother or friend. I brought up the specific recent things in a calm manner and he responded with a meme of Homer Simpson sitting on a toilet and saying ""d'oh"" because there was no toilet paper."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4n1kl	2019-06-24 12:38:44		AITA for making my ex boyfriend sleep on the couch	"So, we've been broken up around 2 weeks now. It's amicable, we're getting along and co habitating until the lease is up in a few months. A week or so ago, I felt it would be best if we stopped sleeping in the same bed and he said he would set up the spare mattress. All the furniture, including the bed, is mine from before we were together so I'm staying in my bed.
We have a spare room with a mattress for when people stayed over, and he stores all his misc. things in there so it's pretty much been his extra room the entire time.
But for the last week, he's been sleeping on the couch and it's been irritating me. He said he keeps falling asleep on the couch while watching tv and when he wakes up at 4am, he's too tired to make up the bed. 
But he's just had two days off, he has nights off and he does absolutely nothing else other then sit on his computer. 
I come home from work today to find he'd had a lie down in my bed with the dog as well. His excuse was he wanted to cuddle the dog but didn't want to move him from my bed.
Am I being an asshole for being annoyed? I feel like he's taking the piss or trying to play the victim."		1	0

c4mwtc	2019-06-24 12:30:14		AITA for wanting to drop out of my friend's wedding after a Bachelor Party gone wrong?	"Where to start?

Going into this I thought it was going to be a pretty low-key bachelor party. The buy-in was $250, which covered 1 night at a hotel and a Red Sox game. Another $36 was going to be needed for one of the activities we were doing that weekend (brewing beer). The best man told us all we would need from there was just money for food and whatever beer we wanted.

Except that was nothing like what happened. First restaurant we go to, I *literally ordered nothing* while the other guys picked 4 apps to share and bought beers. $374 bill. I had one slice of a flat bread pizza, one spare rib, and one egg roll. I get stuck paying $90. 

The other major cost was eating out at a restaurant Saturday night. I bought a $20 meal and one beer and again, ended up paying $50 because other people got more beers or more expensive meals. It was always a split.

When all is said and done, it ends up being a $500+ weekend for me.

On top of it, I don't even get a bed to sleep in on the hotel and have to sleep on the floor cause there are 4 beds and 5 of us. Groom + bestman slept in one room and the other 3 of us were in the room over and we were all talking the next morning (Sunday morning) about how ridiculously expensive this all came out to be, mostly due to best man not laying out expectations correctly and in my case, having to split bills which I hardly contributed to.

I'm thinking about dropping out of the wedding. It is in late July, over 1 month from now. I'm looking at another $600 in costs, between a $200 tux rental, $300 in hotel costs, and a $100 gift. I just can't do it right now, the Bachelor Party just fucked me and left a really bad taste in my mouth. 

AITA if I tell my friend I no longer want to attend his wedding? (I am in the wedding party)

---

Update 5 hours later: Thanks for all of the responses. Just wanted to chime in with what I am going to do as well as give a little bit of additional clarity behind why I was considering this. I want to say that I have read every single response that came through to my inbox today while I ponder over what to do, but now I must make a decision so I can take this off my mind and get focused on work. Basically, for the past month I felt like the $250 ""buy-in"" was a rip off as it was not great seats to a not great Red Sox game and 2 hotel rooms split between 5 people. I felt like the best man was being lackadaisical about the whole thing, maybe not out to make a quick buck but didn't really think it over. That had me pissed off.

On to the restaurant issue on Saturday. I really felt it would've overly complicated to ask to pay for my own portion of just the apps and the groom's share and sent out a bad vibe. So I didn't say anything. It sucked but I figured it was better than making things complicated.

So anyways. Today is the first time I've really had a clear mind after a weekend of drinking and I just felt really frustrated with the entire weekend. On top of it, I absolutely hate baseball. I felt cheated by paying towards the drinks of the entire bachelor party when I was holding back and not drinking at certain restaurants. I felt pissed off cause I had a shitty night of sleep on a hotel floor after only getting like 5 hours of sleep the night before. These aren't even things my friend wanted to do either; it was mostly the planning of the best man. 

I guess I am going to go forward with the wedding and just make it happen. Its the only real option. As much as I am pissed off with the situation, a lot of you made it clear that really in no situation should I ever skip out on this wedding if I want to remain friends with this kid. So that's what I am going to do. I am probably going to remain a little frustrated with the situation for the rest of the day, mainly because I hate wasting money on alcohol at bars (I did suggest we pregame at the hotel before going out but it fell on deaf ears somehow) but doubly so when its alcohol that I don't even get to drink. 

So, thanks for all of the responses. I read all of them and tried to factor in most of the little nuanced points some of you made. And it really did help me see the situation more clearly. I think some were a little harsh and/or immature but beyond that I mostly see both sides of YTA and NTA. I don't think IATA for wanting to skip it but its financially feasible for me so I will not skip it. I'm just in a bad mood and its Monday. 

Once again, thanks all for bringing some objective clarity to what was a very difficult and frustrating situation for me, and I am going to get on with my day now."	Asshole	0	0

A mate (17M) of mine (22M) passed away five years ago. We became super close after meeting in hospital, and our parents bonded. 

A friend of his parents is organising a fundraiser in his memory, and my parents have agreed to host it (we have a big field suitable for the size marquee they want). They agreed on the date and I was looking forward to attending and helping in any way I could. 

Situation:

The fundraiser has now been moved forward, which isn't a problem, except it's now on my birthday. I don't have a problem with it going ahead, but honestly, I don't think I can attend/help out. I don't want to spend my birthday feeling guilty for being alive when my mate isn't. I've been stressing about it for a week now and I don't know what to do. Everyone thinks I'm being selfish, but I'm worried I'll end up spoiling the event.

"My family had planned a day at a theme park, and invited my brother and his daughters to come with us. No one payed for their tickets; they were complimentary since my mom worked for the theme park.  

We arrive at the park at 10:30 am. From the time we arrive until the time I left, four hours later, we did nothing but take my nieces to kids rides and make pit stops at smoking areas. Each ride was about a 30-40 minute wait which consisted of the adults trying to stay out of the Florida sun, and sticking their nose in their phones.    

On the last ride before I left, which was an hour and a half wait, I asked a couple of the other adults of they wanted to walk around until my nieces at their dad were done with the ride. I was getting bored of just standing in the heat and a headache started to come on. But no one wanted to do anything; they just sat in the heat, their noses in their phones.  

So I told everyone I was going to get a drink. I walked around by myself for twenty minutes before heading back to the group and telling them that my head was killing me and I was going to go, which was just an excuse to leave.   

Well, when they get back home at 10 pm, my 4 and 9 year old nieces start telling me that I should have stayed longer, so I know they were talking about it after I left.  

AITA for leaving?

c4mmpf	2019-06-24 12:12:01		WIBTA if i didn't let my girlfriend be named on the mortgage?	"(Throwaway account)

I (25 M) and my girlfriend (25 F) have been together for around 4 years now. We have been living together renting out a place for 3 years now and everything has gone amazingly. We have a really strong relationship together and are looking at getting a mortgage. We are getting to the point in our relationship where we are thinking about taking our relationship to the next level with marriage, kids etc. 

I have a very well-paying job for my age in the UK (around £45K a year which can rise to easy £80K+). My girlfriend not so much, with salary of around £22K a year with not much progression. Whilst renting, I have always paid substantially more, but have never had a problem doing this due to the obvious gap in salary, and also, if anything ever went wrong in our relationship, I wouldn't lose out financially.

Anyway, I mentioned to my Dad how we are looking to get a mortgage together soon. He told me to not get a mortgage with her unless we both paid 50/50 down the middle. I told him this was not possible due to her salary and he told me to pay the full mortgage each month and take ""rent"" from my girlfriend to whatever she could afford. I asked why? So he explained how if she was named on the mortgage but only paid say £200 a month and i paid £800,  if we ever broke up, the mortgage would be split down the middle, leading to me losing out on a hell of a lot of money due to us being common law husband and wife after 2 years of living together.

I know in the past this happened to him with my Mother, and he has told me of friends that this has happened to. He said at the end of the day, it is my decision, but he was offering only a word of warning that he wishes I never have to experience.

I mentioned what my Dad told me to my girlfriend, and she said how she wouldn't be willing to do that, as if I was the only name on the mortgage and we split, I would keep all the money she has contributed to the mortgage. I understand where she is coming from, but I don't want to be financially stung in case our relationship ever goes sour.

I'm the type that will ignore your call and text you back. I'll fake an incoming call so I can hang up.

If it's important, by all means call me and let me know what's up. 

What I'm referring to is mindless chit chat. I hate it. I feel trapped on the phone listening to shit I don't care about and be forced to keep the conversation going to avoid awkward silence.

My friend, on multiple occasions, texted me after I ignore his call and says ""call me back, it's urgent"". So I do and it's nothing. He laughs because he just wanted me to answer. He likes to talk on the phone while he's driving. I don't want to. Seems he's always driving somewhere. If I'm at home relaxing, I don't want to be on the phone making stupid small talk. 

He doesn't like to text. So he never answers me when I text after ignoring the call. He also doesnt respond on purpose since he knows I ignored the call

Finally the other day my friend said he's not going to call unless he actually needs to tell me something. That made me happy."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4mito	2019-06-24 12:04:57	Dibaydibay	WIBTA if I continue talking to him even though I don't plan on being with him romantically?	"I met this guy via hookup app. I don't intend to talk to him after the deed, but he was so nice and sweet that I entertained his texts after. He always call me even at work, checking up on me and asking how my day was. At first, it was all good.
I've been single for the longest time that I welcomed the feeling of being wanted. But I know in my heart that I will never be with him. He's a good fuck, yes, and a really nice dude, but I already settled on being single. I don't want to have kids, and I know that's not ideal with a lot of guys.

I stopped answering his calls - and I don't like calls anyway - but answers his text every now and then. He expressed his frustration with how I communicate with him and I told him that I'm not ready to date and might never be ready. I told him that he's a good guy and he should date other girls instead. He said he was confused and was hurt by what I said so I told him we can still be friends. 

After that it sort of morphed into fwb - we didn't stopped sleeping together but in my head, it's just that. Though I know and am fully aware that it's different for him. He still text me and calls me babe even though I rarely answer his call. At some point I thought that it might work, that maybe I can be with this guy, but I realized that I wanted to sleep more than see him. 

It's been a couple of days since I answered his text and he still calls every now and then though I don't answer it. He's texting me every morning asking me how I'm doing and how he misses me already. He also said that he understands that I'm busy and he's not my priority at that this point. 

I'm starting to give in. I am tempted to reply but will I be the asshole if I do that even though I know very well that I will never reciprocate his feelings?

EDIT: Thank you for everyone that cared to comment. I appreciate everyone's take on it. And yes, I realized that I AM AN ASSHOLE for continuing this set up. He told me a couple of times that he wanted more out of our relationship, I have been telling him before that I am not ready for anything serious but my recent answer was not very concrete and will lead him on - I recognize that now. I want to have all the fun side of our set up without the effort that comes with being with him like spending quality time and caring for him. I will let him know my decision and block his number so I won't be tempted every time I see his text."	Asshole	0	0
c4mhvr	2019-06-24 12:03:03		AITA for chargind my friend more for our holidays?	"So recently I've had a dilema.

&#x200B;

I have this close friend who likes to spend money in, expensive things that he fancies, Im alright with that. The problem comes when we buy things together, for example a couple weeks ago we went to a party and we decided to buy alcohol for us and split the bill. My friend decided to buy this really expensive bottle of alcohol just cause he fancied that drink, so I had to spend 20 € that night when I usually spend like 5 € when going out with friends. He's done this more times where he buys expensive things and I have to pay for them.

&#x200B;

I know it's not a huge deal but it bothers me. Keep in mind his parents give me a lot of money weekly, and I have to work a sidejob apart from uni to be able to have some money for myself. 

&#x200B;

I've told him before that it bothers me but he doesn't seem to mind really cause he keeps doing it. I don't wanna seem like a cheap asshole but why should I pay for his desires?

&#x200B;

Im going to charge him extra for an apartment  we're renting on our holidays next month. It's not much more than the real price I just want some money to not feel like im always paying for his shit.

&#x200B;

AITA?

&#x200B;

tldr: my friend makes me pay for his expensive desires im charging him back on our holidays."		1	0

c4mdc1	2019-06-24 11:53:17	queenblorp	AITA for dining and dashing my entree?	"Was reminded of this event by a similar post. This was a few years ago, and I suspect I was TA, but there didn’t seem to be any other options available at the time.

The event:

My friend and I had decided to stop into a near-empty Mexican place for a snack and a drink before heading off to a gig. We’d gotten an entree (onion rings) and a jug of sangria to share.

While we were there we’d been taking cigarette breaks. The restaurant was in a semi-enclosed outdoor area, so we could see our table from the smoking area and the people in the restaurant could see us (though we were an appropriate distance from people eating). We also left our bags at the table. 

As someone who’s worked in hospitality for 8 years, I’d considered bags at the table a pretty universal sign of “we’ll be back”, but apparently that wasn’t the case here. The 2nd or 3rd time we went out, a waitress came and took our food and drink. By this time we’d almost finished the onion rings, but barely touched the sangria. We were both pretty shocked that the waitress a) didn’t see us (if she’d scanned the area before clearing the table she would’ve easily spotted us) and b) cleared a table that people’s bags were still at, when the food and drink was clearly not done.

Confused and a bit drunk, we decided that if we’d been prevented from consuming the stuff we’d ordered, we shouldn’t have to pay for it, so we grabbed our bags and left. 

AITA for essentially stealing some onion rings and a half cup of sangria?

Edit for clarification: this isn’t in the US so there’s no chance a waitress was stuck with our bill. This was also in a very social downtown area, the reason we were going outside frequently was to chat with people out there while we smoked. Multiple patrons were doing the same thing and we were the only ones whose stuff got taken away."	Asshole	0	0
c4mc9z	2019-06-24 11:51:09		WIBTA if I call the police on a homeless tent city?	"I definitely feel like IWBTA but better at least get some strangers opinions.

Basically I live in a government housing building in a low socioeconomic area. It's no secret to anyone that the area is a big hot spot for drugs and crime.  Many of the abandoned buildings in the area need to be securely fenced off because they frequently become filled with squatters smoking meth.

On the edge of my building lately I've noticed a small but growing tent city, which I assume to be occupied by some local homeless. 

I understand they have nowhere else to go, but I already fucking hate the looming feeling of being mugged while I go out to check the mail, or having my apartment cased while I'm out. I know it's probably really shitty of me to call the police but I think I'm going to anyway for the sake of my own mental well being and anxiety.

c4mbxu	2019-06-24 11:50:23		AITA for coming into work and spending my time looking for another job?	"So, a couple long stories short. I work for a big company in the UK ( I won't use names) but I work in a large office with 500+ people. I work on a small team which operates an area in Scotland. I graduated from University a couple of years ago and only came to this company once I left Uni to A: Pay the bills B: Pass my driving test (so I could look at jobs further out). Last year I passed my driving test and now I am ready to look for a job in my career area. However, I would like to mention that a few months ago I was happy here until I found something else. I liked my team, get paid well and work good hours. I only spent my time at home on weekends and evenings looking for other jobs and tried my best to get interviews around work. 

&#x200B;

The last month however everything has all changed. I was moved over to a non achieving team (I was a good worker and was moved to try and help the team out) but the team is understaffed, full of sickness and part timers and overall has some really lazy colleagues. Because of this my bonus has been pretty much stripped from me and is not achievable. There is also many other issues with the company but I wont bore you with details. 

I just wanted to know AITA for coming into my shift, basically doing what I need to do and then just sitting on the internet looking for training courses (to make me more desirable) and polishing my CV and applying for jobs etc? I also plan to go off long term sick in August to volunteer so I have recent experience on my CV (if I have no luck in finding a job beforehand). 

I feel tight on the rest of the team sometimes but the morale in the company has completely gone, there is 0 incentive anymore and I just feel like the company has screwed me over to be honest and like I said above all targets are unrealistic and bonus is no longer achievable for me due to the team I have been moved to. 

so....AITA? or would you do the same in my situation?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c4m8ke	2019-06-24 11:43:06	greeny8008	AITA for asking my friend to pick me up a pizza after I refused to drive?	Me and my friend have an agreement where we take it in turns to drive places (only if we both want to go to the destination). So recently when my friend suggested getting a pizza and it was my turn, naturally he expected me to drive. However, this is where the problem starts.. on this particular day I didn’t think driving 15 minutes to get a pizza was worth it, so I told him I wasn’t willing to drive. He flailed and complained for a little while but then finally decided that he would drive himself to get a pizza (obviously he thought the pizza was really worth it) so I figured because he was driving there anyway, I would ask him to pick me one up too and he completely blew up and became extremely angry with me and accused me of “using” him and manipulating him just so I didn’t have to drive but I don’t think that’s what I was doing. I just didn’t think a pizza was worth the drive on that particular day... AITA?	Asshole	0	0

My partner’s brother (M24)is also engaged (F21). They have changed their plans about getting married several times, but now I found out they are having a very small wedding in a few weeks at my partner’s parents’ house without telling/inviting my partner or I. My partner’s mother has never been accepting of the relationship and subsequently, we’ve never met. I never thought I’d be able to change that, but I am surprised and hurt that my peer-aged relatives (to whom we are close and we have supported a lot) are hiding this from us because we are gay. The bride and groom to be haven’t said a word about getting married so soon (denied it in fact when I asked what I could get them as a wedding present 2 months ago) and my partner’s sister tried to soften it by saying “the wedding is only the two families”. I feel horribly for my partner. 

The WIBTA stems from the fact that everyone involved, myself excluded, is from 2 other countries where lgbtq is less accepted or totally unaccepted (we’re in the US). Also, Im trying to stick it out for my partner’s sake who is trying to have a relationship with them despite everything. I don’t know how much more flexible and teflon I can or should be, considering. But I dont know if Im being selfish as my partner loves them very much.

c4m35h	2019-06-24 11:31:30	SlothsRuleTheWorld87	AITA My sister brought her dogs when she visited and didnt even ask and when I'm planning to visit her she is refusing to let me bring my dogs.	"Edit at bottom with update.

So I will try to keep this short. But a little back story.

I live wuth my dad, sister, and nephew. My 2 dogs and my sisters dog and my dads cat.

A couple of months ago my sister and her wife came to visit. They live about 10 hours away. When they were about 30 minutes away they call and tell my dad they have their 2 dogs. My dad would have been happier if they had asked (he would have said yes) so he could have put some gate ups in the house. So for 3 days we had 5 dogs it was a bit crazy but with my family it always is. 

Well my sister and SIL kept going to visit friends and would be gone for hours and would leave me to watch her dogs. (I'm disabled so I dont work). Their dogs kept peeing and pooping in the house it was driving me crazy but I didnt want to fight so i just cleaned up the mess and moved on.

Now fast forward to the present time. My dad and i are suppose to go visit and stay with my sister and SIL for a week over 4th of July. And dad asked her if I could being my 2 dogs. Now I have a 8 pound toy poodle and a 20 pound maltese/poodle mix. (My sister has two big hounds) My sister automatically said no. There was no ""let me think about it"" or ""let me talk to my wife"" it was just no. So then my day said okay how about just the Maltipoo. Still no. Her reasoning, she doesnt want 3 dogs in her house. 😒😒😒 I dont get it. 

Now one of the main reasons I want to bring my dogs (besides I just want to have them with me) is it's too much for my sister who is staying home to watch all 3 dogs, plus the cat and her son and she works longs hours. It's just to much for her, it's not fair to  burden her with all that. 

So we said if at least one of my dogs can't go then we are not going. 

So am I the asshole for not seeing my sister because she refuses to let me bring my dogs? (Also she lives in a 4 bedroom house on 10 acres of land so it's not like she doesnt have the space.)

This is my first post so please be kind. 🙂🙂🙂

Edit: Update on what finally happened. I had decided not to go because I was not going to put my sister, who was staying staying home, in a postion to take care of all of the animals, plus work full time (usually 10+ hour day) and she has a 3 year old. 

Originally my dad was still going to go. However after thinking it over for several days. He decided to ask my sister one more time to see if she'd change her mind. Well she didnt and she was actually extremely rude to him about it. She was just extremely disrespectful to our father. 

Well since he really did not want to drive 10 hours by himself, he told her he wasnt going. Now my dad used to travel the country all the time by himself for work. So he can do it but he is at a point in his life he'd feel more comfortable going with someone plus it was the original plan. Also he said he is tired of being basically dictated what to do by his kids whether we are adults or not. So if that means she doesnt allow me to bring my dog, which in turn means I cant go, then my dad wont go. 

So then she will either have to wait until my dad is willing to fly ( which he hates) or when my other sister can take off work and go with him instead. Since I'm disabled and dont work and dont have a child it's easier for me to take care of the animals by myself."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4lw38	2019-06-24 11:15:45		AITA for refusing to pretend like my ex-wife doesn't exist?	"My ex-wife and I split over two years ago after nine years together. Out of nowhere. Her decision. She didn't tell me why. She blocked me. We didn't talk afterwards and we had a simple divorce a year later. She ignored me on the street, pretended like I didn't exist. She moved on, I moved on. Life moved on.

Important point - we had two wonderful dogs together and due to circumstance, she kept them. This killed me. Still does. What can I say, I'm a dog guy. 

I met and fell in love with someone else. Six months after the divorce, my ex-wife contacted me. She told me she had moved past her anger and wanted to wish me well in my new life. I was happy to simply ignore the message, but my girlfriend convinced me to engage with her to find out 'what she is after'. So I did. My ex-wife suggested meeting up to discuss why we split. Felt we could both use the closure. I agreed, and with my girlfriend's consent, my ex and I met one afternoon and had a good chat. 

Her feeling had been all over the place for the past few years. She was convinced she was still in love with me. I told her I had moved on, was with someone else and felt that her backpedal on me was not about me, but about seeing me move on.  That she wanted to split and divorce for a reason, and she'd made the right decision. 

We parted on good terms, she made it clear she didn't want to continue pretending like I didn't exist and although we'd never be hitting the bar for a beer, that we should at least be able to say hello and give each other a smile. I agreed.

I've since bought a house, a cat and and recently, rescued a dog with my girlfriend. 

On my birthday, my ex-wife sent me a simple happy birthday text. I told my girlfriend and she went bananas. Told me I should tell my ex never to contact me and block her. 

More recently, my ex-wife posted a picture in a dog-related group on Facebook all three of us belong to. It was a picture of one of the dogs we had together, and since I'd last seen her she'd become old and grey and had difficulty walking. I commented on it, saying how she was still a beautiful dog. 

My girlfriend seems to be pissed off about this. Gave me the silent treatment after she got the notification I'd posted in the group. I forgot she'd get ping after I posted, but it wasn't something I was trying to hide, public group and all.

It turns out that my mate drunk it when he woke up because he couldn’t be bothered to get up and get himself his own glass of water.

I go to a mildly religious co-ed school. For the past few years I've been close with a pretty evenly split group of boys and girls. Around March one of the guys started texting me late at night (around 12) and asking for homework and relationship advice. I would be extra nice to him, and in retrospect, majorly overaccomadate for his requests. I'd send my completed homework and texts about how to cope with his (really, really whiny) girlfriend. I felt like I was just doing a friend a favor. It got really fucking annoying. He then started to tell mutual friends to ""back off"" because he liked me, but never did anything about it. He started unbuckling his belt around me whenever we were alone. At first I didn't think it was weird, but he did it repeatedly. It got uncomfortable. He would text me flirty messages over instagram and then delete them later. It too sucked because I liked this other guy and wanted to hang out with him instead of the friend that was being weird. I started skipping class and eating my lunch in the washrooms to avoid him. Then, after school as everyone was going to a rally he stood in the middle of the courtyard and yelling at me "" YOU FUCKING CRAZY WOMAN, I DON'T WANT TO DATE YOU!! WHO WOULD ??? FUCKING DISGUSTING!!! STOP TRYING TO RUIN MY LIFE!! FUCKING F\*GGOT!!"" he threw all of his schoolwork and shit at me and ran off and started recording on his phone. I was really hurt but i pulled out my phone and started reading out old messages from him to me ( sent over imessage and not instgram so they couldnt be deleted) They included a lot of slurs which i left out but it was a lot of whining and bitching about his girlfriend and a lot of gross comments about him "" thinking about biting me"" + some personal shit about his family.

My best friend 24 (F) was working with a girl who she quickly became obsessed with. I was excited for her because she finally fell in love. Her and I have horrible commitment issues and we frequently hooked up with other people. I recently got into a relationship and settled down and I was happy she was finally meeting someone she could hopefully do the same with. 

This went on for a few months. My relationship was going very well, hers wasnt. They never actually started dating, this girl gave her excuses after excuse on why they couldn't be together, but would have sex with her all the time, invite her to clubs and would flirt with other people all night, say they dont talk enough and ignore her all the time. Claiming that I'm having sex with her behind her back, even though she turned down the opportunity to have sex with multiple partners since meeting her and stayed exclusive to her. 

Shes having a very rough time. I wanna be there for her. Shes my best friend. She is not afraid to reach out. I work a lot of hours and I try to hang out when I can, and if I cant I make sure I have my phone so I can talk to her. She even stays at my house when she needs a shoulder to cry on. 

One day she is pretty drunk and while asking for advice, she starts becoming very self loathing. I want to help. I tell her ""the only way to love anyone is to learn to love yourself"" 

She brushed that off and called my advice dumb. Said that ""you're acting like you know everything just because you have a girlfriend now. Dont be so cliche"" 

I got upset. I paid my restaurant bill and walked out. When we got outside we had a long heated argument. I was having my own relationship problems so I think that comment didnt help. I ended up getting bloody knuckles from punching a tree. 

This was months ago, we have since made up. Shes not talking to the girl any more. I apologized for the way I acted. I cant stop feeling like I was the asshole. I know everyone's got their breaking point and no one would appreciate being talked to that way, but I feel like my reaction went overboard.

c4ld8o	2019-06-24 10:33:05		AITA for asking my Sister to reconsider her no kids rule at her wedding?	"I come for a big a big family, there are 5 siblings, I am the youngest. We are all married with kids except from my older sister. She got engaged last month to her boyfriend. This weekend we got their save the date, the wedding is next spring. We were all very excited (I’m the maid of honor!) until we noticed that on the back of the invite is said “no children”. She has 12 nieces and nephews and he has 4 plus 2 children for his previous relationship. No children means his kids won’t come to his wedding, which I think is ridiculous and very sad. We have offered to pay for all the kids food and more and she’s still refusing. My oldest brother, who was going to walk her down the aisle (our father past away 10 years ago) is now saying that if his kids don’t go then he won’t either and myself and the other siblings are also considering doing it. Im feeling the pressure from our family to talk her out of the no kids rule as I’m the maid of honor. I’m going to be honest, I’m quite upset that they are inviting 200 people but don’t have the space to invite 18 children. We are a very close family, we all live about half hour from each other and we see each other at lest 3/4 times a month and we didn’t expect it. He’s always been a bit distant from us (I don’t think his family is as close as ours) but he’s a good father and has his kids 50/50 with his ex partner so I can’t believe that he’s now not wanting them there in his special day. The wedding is in the middle of nowhere, about 5 hours from where both sides of the family live, so is not like we can just go for the day and come home. To not bring the kids will mean we’ll all have to leave them with other people for atleast 3/4 nights (as part of the wedding party we have been asked to help set up the barn the day before and tidy up the day after). I’m not sure if they have thought through all the chaos they are causing, but at the same time is their day and I understand they can do what they want.

I work in project management for a telecom company in Europe. We are a subcontracter for a major player here. I have about 25 colleagues and on our main project there's 8 of us.

1 of my colleagues has been on sick leave for over a month as she wishes to leave the company but they want her to quit rather than fire her ... while she's still on the books the company can't replace her.

I have 3  colleagues who only work 4 days a week.

Recently I've been assigned an additional project ... this new project is bad. Nothing has been done in a correct manner.

I'm submerged in work and feel like I'm drowning. I've been in a terrible mood for weeks and I'm afraid it might start affecting my personal life.

I've been contemplating taking 1 week off sick leave, I don't even know if my Dr would allow it, and I feel real shitty for having these thoughts ...

I've been struggling to adapt to my new project manager's working methods, he spams me all day long with requests via telephone, email & skype ...

My predecessor didn't write anything down so it's very hard to analyse why things are going wrong ...

c4l67q	2019-06-24 10:16:08	alwaysshitting	AITA for demanding my ex girlfriend pay me back the money she owes me right away?	"I'd been in a relationship with this girl, let's call her X for around a year now. We broke up last week after she confessed to me about having feelings for some guy at her workplace. Although quite hurt, I made peace with the fact she was atleast being honest and split up as amicably as possible. I know for a fact she's never cheated on me for the duration of our relationship. 

Now, X is very irresponsible with money and mostly lives paycheck to paycheck. I've often had to lend her money to help out with her monthly expenses. Nothing very large, $100-200 here and there. To her credit, she's always paid me back and never once defaulted on any of her ""loans"". 

At the time we split, she owed me around $200. She did bring up the topic and said she'd pay me back asap and I was cool with it. 

Couple of days back I see my now ex posting Instagram stories of her partying and vacationing with her new boyfriend. I get kinda pissed and call her saying I need the money she owes me back right now because I need to pay for some unforseen expenses. She kinda gets the hint and pays me back within a day. But she tells me she knows what's up and calls me an asshole for putting her into unnecessary trouble. She says she had to ask her dad for the money. I chose to stick to my unforseen expense story. 

Now that I've cooled down a bit, I kind of feel shitty about doing what I did. Especially after I'd assured her she could pay me back whenever she could. I feel I let my emotions get the better of me. But I also feel I'm entitled to ask for money someone owes me whenever I desire. What if I had actually needed the money for some unforseen expense?

c4l3yy	2019-06-24 10:09:53	throwawayayaya34637	AITA for refusing to hang out with a friend unless he takes a shower?	"My friend has the worst hygiene I've ever seen. He can go MONTHS without shower, doesn't wash his face, I don't know how much he brushes his teeths but probably not often as they are green-ish, he has had the same sheets on his bed for more than a year (his dog sleeps on the bed too and sometimes it brings fleas), anyway it's a disaster. He is aware of it so I don't bring it up often, and aside from that he is a genuinely good person and a good friend so I enjoy hanging out with him.

 However we're now in summer. In my country it's around 45°C (113°F). I thought he'd start to wash a bit more often considering the unbearable heat and the sweat it causes. He doesn't. He says he doesn't like to take showers. But at this point I find this disrespectful for other people, because he stinks a lot and with this heat the smell is even worse. And even for him, it's not good to not even scrub your body a bit with simple water. Plus, it's not like it takes much time at all.

So, after we talked about it, I told him what I thought etc and he just told me ""I just don't like it much..."" I told him he was going to be sweaty and stinky to which he replied ""I know"" and after that he changed the topic and said he was coming over tomorrow. Honestly I didn't know what to do at this point so I just told him ""Not if you're sweaty and stinky"". I think he was vexed but he told me he was going to shower.


Tbh I'm feeling a little bad about it but really I don't think I could have beared the smell so I just said the truth..

c4l0cj	2019-06-24 10:00:19	aitaalt3867	WIBTA for cutting off a friend because I can't deal with her mental illness?	"Alt bc I'm pretty sure she knows my main. 

I've been friends with this girl we'll call Mia for about two years now. We've never been super close by any stretch of the imagination, but we've certainly been in the same friendship group. To be honest I've always found her...a lot. She's the type of person who will post on Facebook about feeling miserable and then say she doesn't want to talk about it when people ask. 

Anyway, about six months ago Mia and I discovered that we both suffer from the same mental health condition. I won't get specific so as not to reveal too many identifying details, but it's a pretty shitty condition which comes with a whole host of pretty intense symptoms. I went through hell with it in years past, but am dealing much better now. I believed she was too, and told her if she did ever wanna talk with someone who knew she could talk to me. She told me the same. 

Honestly, I regret telling her this. It feels like every day she's calling me with some new problem, usually crying on the phone for up to an hour. I get that our condition can make tiny things seem like catastrophes but the things she calls me and cries about are varied and endless. Anything from a fight with her parents, with whom she has a horrible relationship, to the supermarket having no milk left so she can't have any tea tonight. I feel like this would take a lot of energy and be draining even for a neurotypical person. With my condition, it's downright exhausting. Especially given she more often than not ghosts me if I try to talk to her about my own issues bc she doesn't have the energy to help me out that day. 

So here's my situation. I've tried talking to Mia about maybe switching therapists/getting more therapy (I've used her current therapist myself in the past and honestly he's not great), but she insists this is working for her. She doesn't like to take medication, which I believe would help, but okay that's her decision. Point is, she doesn't really seem to be making any proactive steps to improve and I don't know if I can handle her at full-tilt any more. The issue is I'm kinda the only person apart from her therapist she can really talk to about mental health things. None of our other friends have the condition so, while sympathetic, can only help so much. As I mentioned she has a shitty relationship with her family and can't really talk to them about it. If I cut her off, I'm essentially taking away her one outlet in order to save my own mental health. I just feel like that's disgustingly selfish, and idk if it's worth it. WIBTA for doing this?"

Constantly screaming and cussing at kids in practice, calling them faggots, personally insulting them, screaming at parents and siblings who try to sit in on practice, etc.  It's gotten to the point where multiple kids have transferred and/or quit high school ball to play travel instead because of coach's attitude.

He has some sort of in with the principal that landed him the job in the first place, and according to all the kids he's pretty buddy-buddy with everyone around the school outside of practice (he's also a teacher at the school).  Remaing kids are all scared to say anything because coach has threatened to cut playing time/kick them off the team.

Two of my former teachers, both of whom are fantastic dudes with pretty extensive coaching experience, applied for the job, but lost out to psycho coach.  If psycho coach was fired one of them would probably get the position.

Personally, my biggest concern is that if I successfully push the guy out as coach he could also lose his teaching position and I honestly don't know that he deserves that.  I'm not looking to potentially ruin the dude's life.  So what do you guys think, WIBTA if I tried to get him fired?"		1	0
c4kwpy	2019-06-24 09:50:07	BigSportzfan	AITA - broke my girlfriend’s dad’s foot?	"Okay gotta explain. Have been with my GF around 6 months but haven’t met her parents. On Saturday night we were having a BBQ at her house when I heard a knock on the fence and a loud voice saying “keep it down in there you assholes!”. We weren’t being overly loud and it was like 6.30pm so I felt this was unreasonable. I called back “calm down mate we’re not even being loud.”

There was a louder knock on the fence and I could see the top of a man’s head peeking over. The man yelled again “I said keep it the fuck DOWN!” At this point I’d had enough and I stood up and yelled back “mate get fucked!” There was a soccer ball at my feet and I kicked it at the fence roughly where he was standing. I saw the top of his head duck and then heard a kind of crunching noise and a painful yelp, then groaning.

At this point my GF came running outside and screaming. She ran and opened the gate and I followed her to see the guy on the ground clutching his foot. She ran over to him and said “dad are you ok?!” The man was her dad. They’d organised him to come over as a surprise to meet me and I guess he thought he’d prank me. When I kicked the ball at the fence he startled and fell off the bricks he was perching on and broke a bone in his foot. I apologised profusely and we took him to the ER. He was quite magnanimous about it but my GF is furious. He’s gonna be in a cast for a while but the doctor said it’s not that bad an injury. I paid the emergency room fee and his insurance is taking care of the rest. My GF has gone completely cold on me. Am I the Asshole?

"I was living with 2 roommates, a woman and a man, both of whom I have been friends with for over 15 years. We lived in a multistory building 2 bed one bath apartment, sharing the rent and bills, food and sundries in an equitable manner. There are no romances between us Roomies. I used to stay there occasionally while I had work in the area, and after their last roomie moved out , I stated paying rent and being more or less a permanent resident. ""Ken"" is a great delivery guy, but it's a business with mass fluctuations and a seasonal down period, which frustrates himself. ""Barbie"" is a sales whiz, but had an injury that caused her to gain weight and become more sedentary, which she isn't happy about. I'm a freelance artist , but that isnt lucrative yet so I work for a general contractor and his brother, a high end landscaper specializing in hotel beautification and large property maintenance. I also win a few  hold em poker tournaments in casinos on the weekends I haven't booked with hourly work.  
Ken has become consistently late to work, resulting in a few good situations to fire him. This in turn infuriates Barbie while she tries to work on her exegesis, thesis, or other college work, and it has become a  stressful daily cycle of us trying to get Ken to go to work early or on time, not five minutes  or more late. He is a gamer guy and will be up all night watching anime or playing video games, eating food not recommended for his Diabetes, and the state of hygiene in his room has fallen by the wayside. We cleaned up after him but that got old quick, and with Barbie's leg and back injuries, she had to quit picking up after him.
In addition to some stress factors pushing me to seek life elsewhere, I got a unique opportunity to take a Road trip and work in ""Florida"" with a friend. The 2 brothers said ""go for it you can always come back, we always have a place for ya"".  So I informed my roommates, packed lightly and drove across the country from Reno Nevada to Port st. Lucie Florida. Now Ken wont take my calls and is telling me I'm a traitor, and a selfish asshole for leaving them in the lurch in uncertain financial times, and moving to ""the deep south""  or ""deliverance country"" .  Barbie told me to take the opportunity that life is offering me. So I left behind all my community ties and now I live as a stranger in a strange land, with new Hispanic roomies who don't speak German at all, their English is so so, like mine, and my Spanish is piss poor. I'm here until I can find a better spot, or give up and return to ""Nevada"".

I call once, no answer. I call twice, no answer. At this point I’m freaking out because I start to think the worst imaginable. I call a third time, no answer. My anxiety is at its all time high and In the panicking moment I text him “if u don’t answer me I’m never speaking to you again” and by then he calls soon after I sent that.
This is when the problems begin. He tells me he was driving and he just got home. I ask him why couldn’t he just answer me, in which he says what’s the issue if I just wanted to drive alone. We get into it a little bit, he’s mad I’m upset and I hang up.
After the hang up the problems continue over text and he tells me I have to see a counselor because I’m not being fair. But this time he didn’t see his phone is why he didn’t answer.

c4kt6r	2019-06-24 09:39:33	GarryAlbeans	AITA for being angry and upset I wasn't invited out by my 'best friend'?	"So a group of my friends went to the pub last night and I wasn't invited, I had made it clear many times to my friend that I liked going to the pub with them and I wanted to do it more often. So I said to him 'Didn't you think to invite me?' to which he said 'No, not really'. He then invited me but said 'I never really know with you' leading me to believe I'm probably not welcome so I denied the invite. His reasoning for this was that he doesn't know my place in the group and doesn't know if I'm welcome which definitely hurts knowing he's my closest friend and I've known the others for a long time. I said it hurt a lot so I didn't want to speak, so I could keep my anger in and not ruin his night. I said I'd talk to him tomorrow to which he said 'No, don't'

My upset mainly comes from the fact that he never even checked if I could go, it definitely comes across as not wanting me there. This comes after certain other issues such as him cancelling plans with me to go and get drunk to plans being cancelled and him choosing just not to tell me. This leaves me in a place of anger, which I'm not sure is justified or I'm just putting too much expectation on him. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

He moved away because of work. We would sext for years on and off he would always sleep with me when he came home to visit. He once cheated on a girlfriend with me, but I had no idea they were dating because he hid it from me. I haven't seen him in person for four years. Three years ago he got a girlfriend, and I stopped contact with him. Nine months later he tries to sext me I assume he's single so I text him for a couple of days.


He then reveals to me he's still with his girlfriend I said I don't feel sexting someone with a girlfriend. He bombards me with texts for weeks asking why I'm ignoring him and asking if we would be cool again if he were single. I keep ignoring he breaks up with his girlfriend we talk for a little he gets a new girlfriend a month later we don't speak for a year. Before he moves in with his new girlfriend, he tries to see me again and facetime me I ignore. He sends tons of texts apologizing to me saying that I'm a great beautiful person and he wants to see me again.


I ignore him for a couple more months then ask him why he wants to cheat. He says that he's a sex addict. He says he's hypersexual and masturbates to me all the time. He says that him masturbating to pictures of me helps him relieve sexual tension without doing anything. He says its just picture, and that we're friends, it's just fun.

The rooms were of varying sizes and had corresponding prices assigned to them (bear in mind these prices were ballpark estimates).

We have a group of 8 people who have been good friends in school.  Though after getting into uni,  the communication became slightly less but still we all decided to meet for lunch as a reunion after 4-5 years. 

So I have been the only one in the group who has been able to crack the medical entrances in my country and soon I will be able to become a doc. There were 2-3 more who attempted the entrance but couldn't clear it and are doing some other average course in some uni. 

Well one of them is a girl who is doing something related to mass media and right now she is a intern at some outlet.  That outlet asked her to collect data and all of patient experiences with doctors and write a draft for an article. 

She started discussing abt it and started saying - ''quite a lot of people I asked simply said that doctors are rude and unprofessional.  A few days back even my relative was telling me they couldn't find cause for her pain and that docs are rude and just can't do their work properly and ethically.  They should make strict rules.  Doctors don't even talk properly and order all tests for making money out of us. 

At this point,  I snapped.  This is bcoz we docs actually are quite kind and more often than not,  it's the insane work hours that get us.  And lots of conditions present with same common symptoms and cause is always not apparent.  I told her in front of everyone -
'' Right...  I think you are just jealous of us.  You couldn't clear the exam as well and even if I give you another chance,  you can't.  You should be the last person saying these opinions.  When you don't know,  keep quiet. 

She became quiet and the whole group had an uncomfortable atmosphere for a while before topic changed. 

Later at night,  I received messages from other members ( Especially the guy who had crush on her lol)  that she cried later and that I am an asshole who is stuck up on his high horse and have a holier than thou attitude etc etc.  And that I should apologize... 

Now I don't think I was an asshole here and I won't apologize.  But i am not sure hence raised it here. 

Tldr - One friend of mine started saying docs are rude and unprofessional based on few interviews and her relative experience.  I brought the sword of fair judgement on her.  Found out she cried later and now people asking me to apologize."	Asshole	1	0
c4kfix	2019-06-24 08:56:21	UniqueSubstance	AITA for having sex with a girl, a few weeks after a breakup?	"Almost 2.5 years ago, I met my first and currently ex girlfriend. The first two months were fun as I was also exploring all the new things that come with a relationship. We had a lot of fun and I felt loved and cared about. After a while (maybe 3 months) I started noticing the little flaws but I saw them as something normal as the relationship progressed. She had a strong personality and often showed it by acting really hard towards me. A few months went by and she started showing less love, she got angry at me for stupid little things, she didn't want to have sex with me often anymore, she stopped calling me babe and just used my name, she stopped saying ""I love you"" and so on... It just made me feel really bad and often sparked fights because I was always annoyed about the way she would act towards me. Just rude and selfish. To me and her parents as well. She always loved and was fun around her friends. I just wish I could get that same love. There are other things I could list that really got to me.

The not 'having sex often anymore' part is also something that really got to me. And with that I mean almost zero sex. First there would be a period of 5 months, then sex just once, then a period of 8 months, then sex just once. And then the relationship was already over so yeah... It just felt like she wasn't sexually attracted to me anymore and also often made me very sad and angry. She always blamed it on her medical condition. That her medication just made her hormone levels low. And I really believed her, but still... I still got that feeling. *But then she did have a fuckbuddy for months before she met me and she had no problems having sex with him?*

I always made sure to make her feel loved. I often did nice things for her, I always told her sweet things to make her feel good but she never gave any of those things back to me.

Fast forward to the end of the relationship after things just got worse, I just couldn't do it anymore and neither did she. We actually broke up in a good way, as friends. After that I felt all alone and miserable...

A week later I started chatting with a girl via messenger. She was just so sweet and amazing to talk to and she still is to this day. We went on a date and we had sex. (I'm currently in a relationship with her) My ex found out and she was furious. She couldn't believe I did that so soon after we broke up. She blocked me on everything. The fact that we parted as friends vanished.

Well, all this is now in the past and I don't really care about all of it anymore as my focus now lies on my current relationship. And as I look back at it, I realize I was in a pretty bad relationship. Maybe it was just that easy for me to do since it felt like it was over a long time already before the breakup and we were just delaying breaking up since we were so used to each other. I was just wondering what you guys might think about all this? I'm just very curious. Am I the asshole for having sex with her so soon after my breakup?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4kemq	2019-06-24 08:53:27	throwaway626123	WIBTA for messaging a girl I know in real life on social media anonymously?	"Basically I am up late and it's one of those ideas that sounds crazy and stupid. So I need the internet to tell me I'm crazy and stupid.

There's this girl I am interested in. She kinda knows I exist but we don't really talk much. Anyway she's also really pretty so I assume she might get a lot of random messages on social media.

Aaaanyway I want to talk to her/get to know her more (we're both out of college, and I hang out with her brother kind of often. Don't see her very often though).

I've been rejected by girls a couple times now (3 to be exact), so I'm sure that's a factor when it comes to this idea. Honestly I think what this is really about is that I don't want to be rejected again. Typing this all out kind of helps with clarity.

I want to message her from a random account and kind of just talk. It sounds creepy right? So WIBTA if I go through with it?

"My son is 18 yo and currently on a gap year, he has offers from a range of fantastic colleges including princeton and Berkeley. He isn't interested in going and wants to work as a scuba diving instructor, something he's done as a hobby for years.

This is something I'd never even consider cause of lack of money, social status, accomplishment but he honestly does not seem bothered by this. Still I feel as if he will end up regretting it long term when he's older, which is why I've suggested to my wife cutting him off and then seeing if he still feels the same way after he graduates. She's flipped out and brings up how he's wanted to do this for years, lifes dream etc but at the end of the day I'm the breadwinner and my sons moneys coming from him. WIBTA if I cut him off if he doesn't attend? He could easily ""survive"" without support but it would be a far less luxurious lifetstyle."	Asshole	0	0
c4kdsj	2019-06-24 08:50:52		WIBTA if I traveled abroad solo for up to 3 months when I’m in a committed relationship?	"So one of my sort of ‘bucket list’ ambitions is to experience living in a different country for a longer period of time.

I’ve been in a relationship for 4 years, living together the whole shebang. My partner is perfectly content seeing the world through 2 week holidays and staying in hotels- which is totally fine, but I’d like to experience travelling in a slightly more immersive way.

I’ve been looking at tefl opportunities and ideally I’d like to go away for 1 month but most short term contracts appear to be 3 month minimum.

As we’re in a long term relationship, I don’t think 3 months is a long time in the context of things (if we went on to spend the rest of our lives together). I’d be willing to look at shorter things for 1 month but I don’t know if this makes it better as I’d still be going alone.

I’d like to travel with him too but this is also something I want to experience alone (I’ve never traveled alone but I think it would really improve my confidence)

I’m feeling like this in as asshole thing to do and it’s been on my mind a lot lately so I’m interested in seeing what other people think about this."	Not enough info	1	0

c4kd0j	2019-06-24 08:48:14		AITA in this conversation during a comparison of school marks	"Basically, we got our school reports back and I was waiting for my bus with a couple of friends. I had already received my report a few days ago, whilst she had just gotten it that day and was going through it.  I did not initiate the conversation and would not have brought up the marks until she did. 

&#x200B;

Friend (F): Wow I can't believe I did so bad in chemistry

Me: Don't worry, I did really bad too.

F: Shut up, you got an A.

However, I want to mention I only scrapped an A (I got the exact mark I needed), I was also considerably under average (I also had a rank close to the triple digits lmfao) and she was only a few marks lower than me (less than 5 marks, so she would have had a high B and a rank not too far from me).  

Me: You know I only just scraped an A? 

F: It's still an A.

Me: Well it doesn't really matter what mark we get, it's the rank anyways but we can work hard and improve this exam block.

Other friend: Wow shut up, can't you just be empathetic for once?

I just teared up and left the conversation.

&#x200B;

My perspective of the situation is that I am not in the wrong and my feelings shouldn't be invalidated just because I got a few marks higher than her. After the recent exam block I know we were both pretty devastated but I genuinely spent a lot of my time at school crying/ walking out of class because I kept crying lmao. 

I know I'm bad at trying to express my sympathy even if I feel it and I'm also very bad at reassuring people but this was not malicious, nor was I trying to flex my very very very sub-par mark. 

However, I feel as if my other friend's interjection was uncalled for and it's not fair that some people can bring up their bad chemistry mark and I'm not allowed to express my feelings that I didn't do well either, just because I literally got \~5 marks higher which honestly makes a negligible difference. Like we both felt sad after receiving my marks, why am I not allowed to be sad for failing lmao.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Friend complains about doing bad, I say I did bad too, I get yelled at for not empathizing."		1	0

c4kc65	2019-06-24 08:45:22	Azrynix	AITA for asking for my breaks after a power cut at work?	"So, this happened today. I came into work for my usual 12 - 8:30 shift, and a power cut happened at around 11:50am when I arrived. Management wasn't sure when it would come back on, but the assistant manager told me to clock in anyway.

All of the staff on shift except for the general manager sat in the office, trying to work out if/how we could fix the power and if not, what maintenance we could do in the morning. The GM was walking around, calling electricians and area managers frantically. I would say we sat there for about 30 minutes, so 12:30pm. My AM then told me to start working, doing whatever I could, so I started restocking and cleaning.

I took my 'first' break at the designated legal time (2pm) signed it off, and then went back to work. My AM and two other staff members ended up leaving at around 1pm because the GM wasn't sure when the power would come on and he didn't want to waste labour costs when there was nothing to do. The power came back at 2:30ish, we reopened at 4pm.

It hits 5:30pm, and the GM approaches me asking why I haven't signed off my other breaks (a 15 and 30 minute) When I tell him I haven't had them, he says this: ""But you and the others were sitting in the office doing nothing for an hour. I told everyone to take their half hour break then, while the power was off."" I was gobsmacked. When he told everyone to go on their breaks, I assumed it was everyone else as they had started at 9am, and that did not include me. He wanted me to count the first hour of my shift as breaks because of a power cut, and work the following 7 and a half hours on my feet.

We argued for a little bit, where he tried to guilt me into not taking a break now by saying, ""Its give and take here, I shouldn't have paid you for not working, but if you want a break that badly, take it."" 

Here is where I think I might be the asshole. I DID sit in the office for half an hour-45 minutes doing nothing, and waited to be told to do work rather than finding some of my own. It could definitely come across that I was taking a break with the others.

However, I think its positively NUTTY to make an employee count a power cut as their breaks, something they can't control. I think its pretty bad considering he wanted me to work for over 7 hours without a break, which is illegal in my country, and it was also the first hour of my shift.

Tldr; got to work, there was a power cut, manager refused to give me any breaks because I sat in the office for the first hour of my shift. AITA for asking for breaks?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4kc34	2019-06-24 08:45:04		AITA For Shouting At My Mom?	"I'm on break from college over the summer and have chosen not to get a job. I have been struggling with anxiety for a while and received medication for it. I can tell my parents are pissed I don't have a job as they consistently bring it up (yet they don't to my siblings who don't have jobs) however I still pay them the rent they ask of me, and buy the bulk of my own food, which my siblings don't do. I pay this out of my savings that I deliberately built up over the past year to ensure I would have a care free summer.

Being honest, I mostly stay at home and watch movies etc all day. I am happy to go out solo, as I did to a concert last week. I am also happy to go see friends which I have been doing throughout summer. I am choosing to stay home MOST days a week because I WANT to, not because I am a recluse.

My brother told my mom he was going to do some shopping and she told him (not asked, told (behind my back)) to invite me along. I said yes because I would have felt guilty and to be honest I wouldn't mind spending time with him. For the record, he has aspergers syndrome.

I found it weird however as he never asks me to do things with him (despite having AS he is certainly capable and enjoys going out alone, my mom is aware of this as he does a few times a week) so I asked my mom if she asked him to ask me to go along. She said no.

I later find out (before going) that she lied, and my brother didn't even want me there. She lied, I assume, to make me do things and get out the house, desite me being comfortable in my own company. She knew I would feel guilty if I didn't go along and she played to that.

I raised my voice to her, telling her it's not up to her to guilt trip me into doing things just because she wants me to do them. She wouldn't even make eye contact with me, and I haven't spoke to her since.

c4kaki	2019-06-24 08:39:51	Leonetta85	AITA in the eyes of everyone cause I have feelings?	"Background story: I'm (F) on holiday with a few friends of mine on a different continent.  The whole vacation was organised by me, from plane tickets to hostel bookings,  basically everything.  
My boyfriend is at home,  due to starting a new job,  he couldn't take part in this unfortunately. 
Now at the end of this month it's his birthday,  so from the beginning my plan was to arrive back for his birthday,  to celebrate together.  
All good until this point,  we all arrive back on that day,   although quite late in the evening. 

One of my girlfriends lives in a different city and has no way of getting home that late so she asked me if she can stay at my place and a friend of hers will pick her up the next day in the evening,  I said sure,  no worries.  She knows since day one that when we arrive from the  airport,  I go directly to my boyfriend and I will be back the next day around lunch,  so we still have the whole day together,  we've done it before , she's totally fine with it.  ( we know each other for almost 10 years,  while my boyfriend only 1 year )

Now issue number one.  As I was organising everything for this trip, my last few days at home were quite busy,  so I forgot to mention it to my boyfriend,  that my girlfriend will spend the night at my place while I will spend the night at him. For some reason he really flipped out on this , calling me an asshole,  cause I leave my friend alone,  I shouldn't do that,  it's not polite, bla bla.  So he cancelled our date. As I said we know each other with my girlfriend for almost 10 years,  been through a few good and bad things together,  this was not even a point of discussion between us, if anything she was happy that she can have my big bed all to herself. 

Now issue number two.  I really wanted to make my boyfriends birthday special,  so I was prepared with presents, surprises, etc. Plus the fact that I miss him like crazy,  I couldn't wait to see him and land in his arms basically.  Now that he cancelled everything I also had to cancel something what was hard to arrange. Of course I feel hurt, more because  I miss him so much,  but in general my whole mood is different,  I don't feel doing too much for the remaining time of the vacation.   So of course now my friends are also calling me an asshole cause I'm killing the mood,  I'm overreacting , I'm letting all the stuff what needs to be organised to them. .

So really AITA in both situations? I should just act like nothing happened?  Honestly I can't understand any of it..

The time I went before was my first ever massage, and I was super excited about going again. When I got in, I got undressed, I laid on the table, yada yada, and the masseuse started my massage. But I mean, he didn't ""really"" start it.. he was just using one hand and moving it with way to much pressure up the side of my spine. My first thought was that he must be on his phone or doing something else that had him distracted and the real massage was about to start. But it didn't. He did this same move, with only one hand, for 40 minutes. I felt so uncomfortable interrupting him but it was just the worst. I finally spoke up and said I needed to use the bathroom. I stood up and got dressed and took my purse, phone, everything with me to ""use the bathroom"". I did end up walking over to the bathroom, and then realized that the exit was the other way. I tried to get up to reception sneakily, but my masseuse was waiting at the door of the room, basically standing in the hallway. I walked by him and held up a finger to say ""just a minute"" and headed on over to reception. I told the guy, ""I'm leaving and I don't want you to charge me."" He was shocked and apologetic, but I just hurried on out of there. It was such a weird experience and I wasn't going to waste my money by staying there. I realize I could have said something to the masseuse, but I was feeling so awkward about the situation, and I didn't know what to say. ""Uhh could you do a better job?"""	Asshole	0	0

c4k2f3	2019-06-24 08:12:24	Angels1732	AITA for not wanting to let kids cut in line	"Backstory: We are going on one of the most popular water rides at this amusement park and with it being so popular you are of course going to have your line cutters so they don't have to wait like the rest of us. Mainly little kids who say their family/friends are all the way at the front waiting for them. (... right.)

(Side note: The line cutting has gotten so bad to the point of them sometimes having employees to send them back or if you're caught they send you back) 

&#x200B;

storytime:

cast: friend 1 (F1), friend 2 (F2), friends brother (FB), me (ME...duh), little girl (LG), little boy (LB)

So my group and I  friends are waiting patiently in line for the water ride that has a really long lien since it was a hot summer day. We have already had one woman who has forcefully passed us to cut and we were not having any of it so we weren't going to let it happen to us again since that woman really ticked us off but that is for another story. Anyway a few minutes later these two kids, the LG and LB try to make it pass us. The LG looked to be about 11-14 years old and her brother, the LB looking to be about 6-8 years old. 

&#x200B;

They tried to get by us saying that they were in the restroom and their GROUP was up front waiting for them. This is basically how the situation went down:

LG: Excuse me 

F1: I'm sorry. This ride doesn't allow cutting

LG: We're trying to get to our family who are waiting for us

may I mind you they said GROUP at first and then changed it to FAMILY 

Me: I'm sorry but your family should have stayed with you or you with them.

LG: \*apparently crying\*

Irrelevant people in the back of us: COME ON. THEY'RE LITTLE KIDS. I GET IT IF YOU WERE TELLING THE ADULTS THIS BUT REALLY??? THE LG IS STARTING TO TEAR UP

LG and LB: \*walks past us after we were told off by people\*

F2: Now that kind of ruined the mood \*feeling anxious because of the attention of others\*

FB: Yeah.......

We did feel bad about what had happened but then...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*few minutes pass by....\*

&#x200B;

We see the two kids who were going to ""see their family"" being sent back to the end of the line.

A few years back my grandpa moved him and my grandma away without really considering her, and it always rubbed me the wrong way. He’s always been interested in talking to me, but since I was little he has also said pretty inappropriate stuff, but nothing obscene. I wasn’t a big fan of him for a long time, but didn’t have that strong of an opinion, however that changed when he started being openly mean to my father, and generally unpleasant when we would visit. (They moved to a really small town in the middle of nowhere, so when we visited, there is nothing else to do.)

Apparently he has some health issues, and nobody really knows how much longer he will be around. This came from my Dads brother, because my grandpa basically won’t communicate with my dad. So, I have to make the decision of going to visit him again or not, I honestly don’t think I am going to, but not sure if that would make me a giant ass. The combination of him not being too warm and being in such a rural area makes me almost scared to go alone. Would I be the asshole to not suck it up and visit?

c4jxh2	2019-06-24 07:55:25	valleoderso	AITA For Staying At The Cinema, While My Friend Ran Out?	"So this happened yesterday to me. Me and my friend (we are both female & 16, if that helps) went to the cinema. It was between half an hour and an hour away from our homes, depends on which bus you take. 

So we planned on seeing a specific movie, but then she decided that she doesn't want to see that one anymore and said she wanted to see a horrormovie. Okay, works for me too. So we went in that movie, everything went fine and we watched it. 

But after that movie she wanted to stay inside the cinema and sneak into john wick 3, a movie where you have to be 18 to get in. And first I didn't like the idea, but then she convinced me and we sneaked into the movie. 

Now here's the thing: Her parents are really strict, while my parents are not. She has to tell her mum nearly everything she does, while my mum is okay with me coming home at like midnight and just explaining then why i was late. But I still told my mum, that I was in that movie and that I'll be home pretty late (movie started at 7:30 pm, took about two hours and we had to take the bus home afterwards). My friend on the other side didn't told her mum. I get that she maybe didn't want to tell her, that she was watching that movie, but she not even told her mum that she'll be home late. 

So we were in the movie and I actually really enjoyed it. But then, maybe half an hour before the movie was finished, her mum called her. My friend ran out of the cinema to answer the call and I stayed in with our stuff and continued to watch the movie. When she came back, she said nothing and just grabbed her stuff and ran out of the cinema. 

I was perplex and didn't quiet know what to do. One side of me said, I should run after her and get home with her, but the other side of me told me to stay. Because that wasn't the first time she had to cancel our plans last minute because she didn't told her mum what we were doing. And I was always sad afterwards, because I really wanted to do stuff with her, but this time I decided not to let her ruin the plans, because I really enjoyed that movie and I wanted to finish it. 

So that's what I did, I stayed in the cinema until the movie was finished. I texted her after she ran out, asked what was going on. She said she had to leave or she would make things worse. And I told her she should get home safe and that I was staying, which made her mad. 

So yeah, that was pretty much it. I hope I didn't forgot any details.

c4jwmd	2019-06-24 07:52:14	myitaliantthrowaway	AITA for getting upset that my friends didn't invite me on a trip abroad?	"I'm (M25) introverted and I don't have tons of close friends, but in college, I used to frequently hang out with a guy I'll call A. and occasionally with his friend/dormmate I'll call B. They're both about my age, if that's of any relevance. We had fun, used to take trips together, and we still meet up every once in awhile to catch up.

I don't know if I'm being paranoid, but lately I feel like they've been spending a lot of time together without inviting me. Then I find out about their fun activities through Instagram, which doesn't feel great. I know friends grow apart after graduation, but we still live in the same town. It wouldn't be difficult to meet up if they asked. Not sure if they feel uncomfortable/like they're intruding because I have a girlfriend as of recent.

Anyhow, the thing that angered me the other day was meeting up with A. and B. for drinks and finding out that they'll be spending a part of the summer vacation in Prague (B. has some relatives there, we live in Italy for reference's sake). They've already made all the plans for the trip and for what they want to see. That really pressed my buttons because it's not just the matter of going out clubbing without informing another friend. They have actually planned out the entire trip to another country without thinking of asking if I'd be interested to join.

When I called them out, in a joking ""hey, I still exist!"" way, they got embarrassed and defensive. Started saying, we barely got B.'s cousins to find a spare bed for two of us, it would be impossible to include another person. Which is a dumb excuse, if I wanted to come with them on vacation, I would've paid for accomodation anyway.

Anyways, to the story,

So my girlfriend is super nice and has a variety of friends. One day last week, we were leaving school (we're graduating) and on the way out, one of her friends (a guy) says hi to her and they make small talk (she's moving for university). The problem with this is that I DON'T like this guy. We'll call this guy K. Long story short, he's never done me wrong (not something like backstabbing or anything), but I just straight up don't like K because of who he is, how he is as a person, and other stuff. They exchange words and she was about to walk away and then he awkwardly opens his arms for a hug, and she's super nice so she hugs him. KEEP IN MIND she met K two weeks prior to this, so they don't have much rapport, this also factored into why I didn't like them making any physical contact. While she hugs him, I made a disapproving/weird face. I'm standing at a distance waiting for her, so after the hug, she just runs up to catch up to me. We leave and that's it. 

&#x200B;

While we walk away, she asked me about the face I made and what I was thinking. So naturally, I told her I didn't like K (as a person in general). She just said ""ohhhh"", and that was it. Keeping in mind, she didn't know I didn't like K prior to this event.  


The part where I want to know if I'm an asshole or not is my disapproval feeling. The interaction between them was okay up until the hug. The hugging kind of bothered me for a couple of minutes immediately after. We haven't seen K since then and I feel like if we do/did, I would feel uncomfortable about them making any physical contact. I didn't tell her to stop being friends with him or anything like that, I just told her I didn't like it when she makes any physical contact with K.  A hug is harmless I get that, it's just that when my girlfriend hugs K, I really don't like it. 

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for not approving of their friendship and the fact that K hugged my girlfriend? I didn't overreact to it or anything like that, it's just the internal feeling of disapproval and me not liking K specifically. 

&#x200B;

The action of hugging isn't the problem, it's the fact that someone I didn't like hugged my girlfriend, and I didn't like how it made me feel."	No A-holes here	0	0
c4jthw	2019-06-24 07:40:02	Homebrewhoard	AITA for going back to a server I left to invite some friends?	"So, there's this discord server I used to be really active on. It's a public server, but I am a founding member, I made a lot of friends there that I value a ton. So, after leaving officially a week ago, I went back for about 10 mins so that I could Direct Message a few people I didn't have in my friends list. I didn't post any link on the server itself. Shortly after completing what I went back to do, I said goodbye once again, and left.

A few minutes passed and one of my friends said that the moderators were pissed off that I came back just to advertise my server, a private server. But I never posted anything on the server itself, just in DMs. I said ""oh shit, I see where they are coming from"" and wrote a long apology explaining that wasn't my intention, that I wanted a few of my friends on my personal server but I understand completely where they are coming from and why they are ticked off.

They banned me.
Said they had enough of my shit, I have had a few incident where I have made some bad decisions, but I thought this was a minor thing, a simple misunderstanding, they I feel have blown this out of proportion but I accept their decision, I can see where I might seem like a asshole, but I don't know if they overreacted, I asked a few friends and they are split, so, I am asking the unbiased opinion of you, my fellow redditors,

c4js98	2019-06-24 07:35:11		AITA for telling my boyfriend to stop being friends with someone he’s close with?	"This happened a couple months ago and I always wondered if I was being a controlling girlfriend.

My boyfriend and I are long distance.

One day, me, my boyfriend are in a discord group chat and about five of his other friends were there including the one I’m going to be talking about next. Let’s call him Jack. Jack started taking unnecessary shots at me, at first I took it as banter so I would joke back with him but then stuff started to get serious out of no where. Jack ended up telling me that if I killed myself no one would care and then told me to go run and cry to my boyfriend but then said I couldn’t because we can’t even see each other (plans got canceled) then made fun of how our plans got canceled. BF wasn’t at his computer during this brief time so the people defending me were the rest of the people in the group. I ended up crying and leaving.

My boyfriend went off on Jack, and blocked him on everything (knew him IRL), for two weeks. He brought up the situation on facetime and I didn’t want to talk about it because I knew I’d argue. Supposedly Jack had been really nice about our relationship now since he apologized (not to me or about me just to my boyfriend who wasn’t even there) and had ‘defended’ me once. I said “Idk people can change I guess.” I didn’t want to go on about how I felt like he wasn’t truly sorry & that if no one defended me he wouldn’t have cared. He took me saying that as an opportunity to give Jack a chance & be his friend.

He ended up getting really close with Jack. Practically best friends. Hanging out all the time and always doing stuff together. This ended up really hurting because I couldn’t understand why and how my boyfriend would be close friends w. someone that said that shit to me AND about our relationship. I brought it up to him and how I was hurt by it and how I couldn’t believe he could be friends with him after he said all that stuff to me, and about our relationship, and by being his best friend it was like excusing what he did and shoving it under the table and just becoming his best friend. BF disagrees and tells me that he hates Jack for what he said and will never forgive him for it and that he thinks about it but says I should know what it’s like to say something and not mean it because I have “experience doing that.” This was his only defense. I told him I don’t think he should be friends with him. He says, “Seriously?! After we’ve gotten close you want me to stop?!”

Him being nice about our relationship never felt genuine. He was nasty about it even before saying that stuff to me, and now he was nice about it? Didn’t feel right. Especially since I never got an apology since I was the one who should’ve gotten one.

BF ended up distancing himself from him after we argued about it, now he really doesn’t talk to him anymore.

c4js0e	2019-06-24 07:34:12		AITA for being annoyed with my sister for getting married the same time I graduated from college?	"So I just graduated from a four year University one week ago with a hard and competitive degree. Around this last Christmas my older sister got engaged and is now getting married in August. Originally she said that she didn’t plan to get engaged for another year or two because she recently went back to school and wanted to focus on that. Then next thing we know she is engaged. She and her fiancé then say they will wait until next summer (summer 2020) to get married. Then all of a sudden they’re looking at venues and decide to get married this summer, so they’ll have had an 8 month engagement. 

Originally my family from out of state were going to come down to see me graduate. Now since there will be a wedding less than two months after I graduated, they’re no longer coming down but will be down for the wedding. 
I have also only received one card from family for graduating while my sister has received many more for her engagement with money. 
Now I don’t want money or expect money. But it is staring to frustrate me how my graduation has been mostly ignored since the wedding is taking up most of the attention. Also my parents are paying for her entire wedding ($10,000), so there isn’t much extra money around in case I need help with loans since I am paying for my own college without help from parents. 

I originally didn’t care and made jokes how she stole my thunder, and how I’ve been working on my degree (4 years) longer than she’s been with her now fiancé (2 years).  But I guess since I made those jokes I realize it does bother my deep down. I am the first kid of my siblings to get a bachelor degree, and one of the few total on my entire family, so I thought people would be excited for me. 

I told my older sister how she stole my thunder (jokingly) and she said she didn’t even think about that and she was sorry. I know she wouldn’t intentionally do that to me. I also will not tell her I feel forgotten because I don’t want to make her feel guilty during her special time. 

But do I even have a reason to feel sad over this, or am I being selfish and need to move on?"		1	0
c4jrl0	2019-06-24 07:32:31	yupurt	AITA For getting mad at a girl I met on tinder for swiping while we're together?	"I 18m met this girl 19 on tinder about a month ago, and we started out just smoking weed together in her car for a week or two, and now its changed to me coming to her house like every day. We fuck like dogs and it's not just having sex we really vibe with each other, we kiss and cuddle and all that she falls asleep in my arms usually and then I leave later at night. We haven't really made anything 'official' but when I was there today we were laying in her bed watching a movie, and I started to make a lil bit of moves like I usually do, she moved away and said she was on her period I told her it was cool but she just leaned forward and picked up her phone, I just laid there for a good minute and then sat up to get a drink of water, I looked at her phone and she was just swiping on tinder. I left probably 20 minutes later because she had to take her grandma somewhere, I didn't say anything but I later sent her a snap and said, ""Why you swiping while I'm there that's wack""
 and she just told me she 'Didn't use it anymore' but I kinda know it's bullshit because I saw her open it out of habit a couple days ago and closed it because I was there I don't know how to feel about all of this and I haven't really responded since then."	No A-holes here	0	0
c4jqsh	2019-06-24 07:29:37	fakeaccts1234	WIBTA if I am less than sympathetic to my friend who complains about the low pay of her field that she chose?	"I have a friend that I've known for several years and we're just graduating college. She's obtained her masters degree in a liberal arts field and will be getting a second masters degree in a similar field after graduation. I'm graduating with a bachelor's degree in a chemical engineering.

For years we've had interspersed conversations about what we plan on doing after college. Recently these have been coming up fairly often because of graduation and all that.

Recently my friend has been going on long bouts of being ready unhappy with her majors job prospects and pay. Granted, I'd be unhappy too if I spent 7 total years in college and may only be able to work part time for a couple years out of college before snagging a full time position because the market is so slow. It's just frustrating because I feel like it's a constant and there's only so many ways I can say that ""that sucks"". I'm almost reaching a snapping point where I want to tell her that she chose this major and if she wants to do something that pays more she has the intelligence and ability to pursue it. Idk, I'm tired of her complaining about it and honestly I'm pissed because she's snapped at me a couple times because I expressed some dissatisfaction with the job I got out of college and she said I was ""wallowing"" in feeling not that excited about it and that I should be thankful because it pays a lot more than her field does. I guess issues with depression and moving away from all your friends mean nothing when you have enough money to pay the rent.

I didn't even get a single ""congratulations"". I know it may seem shallow, but I'm honestly really upset about the whole ordeal. It kind of feels like nobody I care about feels the same way towards me.

c4jq5q	2019-06-24 07:27:28	veera28	AITA for going to a pre-planned vacation with my family rather than my boyfriend's mom's funeral?	"I'm a teacher so I get about 2 months off every summer but my mom, sister, aunt, and cousin all work regular 9-5 jobs with 2-3 weeks off a year, so it's really difficult to organize time for trips where we can all go. We managed to schedule a girls trip to Cabo from June 1st to 9th. Made payments (almost $3K a person) several weeks prior to the trip and were all very excited to go to Mexico and bond -- I'm best friends with my sister & cousin, and my mom and aunt are identical twins so we're all a very close group.

My boyfriend & I have been together for 2 years. His family lives across the country so I only see them twice a year and it's usually pretty quick. No real one-on-one bonding with anyone in his family but we're all definitely friendly with one another. We like each other's posts on FB/IG, send happy birthday wishes, stuff like that. 

A few days before we left, my boyfriend's mom passed away unexpectedly. I spent days attached to his hip, supporting him, wrote the email to his work explaining what happened, cleaning the apartment, making sure he ate, called his dad & siblings and expressed my condolences, booked his flight, helped him pack, etc. He asked me to go to the funeral with him. I felt so, so, so bad telling him no. I hardly knew his mom and feel like I already committed myself to the trip with my family. He was heartbroken and begged me to go with him for support but I told him that his whole family is there and if anything it's a special time for them all to recount memories of their mother/wife/sister/daughter. 

He asked if he gave me $1500 ""could you go on the trip sometime later? you have two more months off. I know you won't get some deposits back, so I'll give you this money"" and I honestly felt so bad but the thing isn't the money (although obviously as a teacher, I'm not swimming in money) but it's about how this is the *one* time a year that the women I'm closest to can go together.

My mom & aunt told me ""we want you to come with us, but it's ultimately up to you"" whereas my cousin & sister were like ""you should definitely come with us, it'll ruin the trip for us if you're not there, just come, etc.""

My boyfriend was upset and left mad at me, I called/texted a bunch but he didn't respond until days later, anyways I went to Mexico and came back on the 9th and things have been weird with us. Sometimes he's really close with me like usual other times I can tell he's mad I didn't go with him. He said he's not furious at me but just disappointed and sad that I chose to go party instead of be there with him. Says he would've dropped anything for me, keeps emphasizing that I have 2 months of vacation, but he doesn't get that no one else in the group has that kind of vacation time, I really couldn't reschedule.


TL;DR: I feel really bad because I didn't go with my boyfriend to his mom's funeral because I already had a trip planned with my family. Did I fuck up?"	Asshole	0	0
c4jp0a	2019-06-24 07:23:16		AITA for not wanting to spend time with my parents, while not able to tell them why?	"There's not a lot to say, but to add to the situation, I'm 19 and living with my parents. I really don't want to be here and I'm currently working so I can move out as soon as I can. 

Why I don't ever spend time, whether it's eating with them or going out shopping, is because they're hateful and plain miserable to be around. I identify as part of the LGBT community, and they are very discriminatory of anyone like that, and many times when I'm with them it's a recurring topic to continuously talk trash about any LGBT people they see or hear about. Calling gay people ""fags"" in public, or when we were at the hospital once and the nurse was transgender, and when she left, they started laughing and saying foul things about her out loud like it was a big deal. There are other reasons why they are unpleasant but that's one of the bigger things that makes me upset.

But, I can't reasonably tell them about this because I am closeted about my sexuality and being trans. And I don't think I can even try to come out to them about that because they probably will kick me out and I'm trying my best to stay on their good side because I have absolutely nowhere else to go and not nearly able to afford anywhere to stay yet. When I was about 13, they found out I was bisexual and grounded me for over 2 years and verbally abused me because of it, and now they think that I'm fully straight, so that is my justification for believing that it wouldn't be safe to talk about. Also, they will bring up my birth name a lot more than necessary when I'm around them and that is a trigger to me because it brings back a lot of traumatic memories and it is a thing I struggle with daily that causes my depression and mental health issues in relation to my gender and wanting to be female.

And they do make me feel like a dick for never being around them but I don't think there is really anything I can do or say now, and I don't know if there will be a relationship after I move out but I will probably tell them my feelings after I know that I'm guaranteed to have somewhere to sleep."		1	0

Significant other: SO

So a little background:
My SO (18)has been having panic attacks for the past few weeks waking up in the middle of the night and the going to sleep. SO head also starts hurting pretty often which had been going on for a fairly long time. I suggest to SO to go see a doctor but SO always says that  it isn’t needed as SO will be fine the next day.

So today SO mentioned that SO had another panic attack in the middle of the night and then went back to sleep. I told SO that it was a good idea to go see a doctor and make an appointment. SO told me no and I asked why. SO told me that SO thinks about other people. By this I asked what SO meant.

SO said that other people go to see the doctor who have more severe things like asthma or they are in pain or injured things like that. SO said that SO wasn’t dying and that by going it would not be nice since as SO would be taking up a spot for someone else.

I explained to SO that it didn’t matter what other people went for and everyone was just as important. I said that SO’s reasoning to me didn’t make sense and was dumb. SO seemed kind of upset after this.

c4jmw6	2019-06-24 07:15:52	Skifer91290	AITA for lying/hiding i had a vasectomy?	"So, I got a vasectomy years ago. I am 29, and all of my relationships I've not mentioned it, simply acted like a normal ""not fixed"" guy. Condoms, etc. 
3 relationships ago a girl I had been seeing got pregnant and I dumped her immediately. She tried to drag me to court but her lawyer gave up the moment I showed my medical records on the vasectomy ( lol. The look on her face was priceless. )This thoroughly enforced my once "" reasonless"" anxiety about the possibilty of this particular situation happening. 

I dislike children, and don't want to have to enforce/force my thought on ""accidents"" if they happen. Maybe that will change if I end up with the right woman, but I wouldn't want to have a kid with anybody I've dated recently.  Plus, its a 10 minute procedure to ""unfix"" a guy. So...

AITA for lying ( by omission 90% of the time, an outright lie the one time it came up in a conversation.) And not bringing it up/avoiding it?

Edit: the procedure to reverse it is extremely easy for men, and I WOULD consider it for the right person. A variable I realized i should express.

Edit 2: Some Quick Notes. 
The kid came out a race that and she are not. Its obviously not mine so thoroughly that a dna test wasn't needed. 
I shortened the story on the legal aspects dramatically. Mainly because it/she weren't rly worth much more detail, beyond justifying my anxiety on the situation.

my mental health is not the best during summer (i’m a recovering anorexic and the loss of routine really messes me up,) and camp would not help at all. i wouldn’t be able to choose my own food, wouldn’t be able to eat whenever i’m hungry, and it would all just be a mess. i also suffer from depression, and a week of being lonely while surrounded by people would not be ideal at all. 

furthermore, i have zero in common with my fellow scouts. they’ve all invested huge amounts of time and really have a passion for scouting. i do not. in fact, i’ve wanted to quit for a long time, but haven’t, just because it’s been a part of my life for so long. most meetings i’m picked at and made fun of for not being invested in my group and my work as a leader.

c4jlkw	2019-06-24 07:11:22		AITA for leaving my friend at the bar?	"My friend (25F) and I (24F) have been friends for a good chunk of years. We were super close in the beginning, but life happened and we slowly drifted. We still remain friends and will get together and catch up every now and then. 

After a few months of unintentionally not talking, I reached out to her and wanted to see if she’d be interested in getting some drinks and playing some pool at this local bar we both frequent. She said yes.

That night, we met up, got a pitcher of beer to share between us and started chatting between pool shots. We were probably in our second game when two guys, both in their mid 20s, approached us and asked if we wanted to play doubles. I politely declined and said that we’d rather just play singles. 

When they left, my friend looks at me with disproval and goes, “but they’re cute.” I told her that I’ve recently started seeing someone and that tonight was really supposed to be just us hanging out. I also wasn’t in the mood to socialize with other people. I apologized for speaking for her, but my stance was still the same: I’d rather play just us two. After some back and forth, she agrees, but I could tell she was a little annoyed. 

The thing about my friend is that she really likes attention from guys. Which is totally fair, as I do too, but I’ve always felt that she really strived for it. I’ve noticed this about her from the beginning, but I’ve never had issue with this in the past. 

After another game, she goes to get another drink. She takes quite a long time, and so I left the pool table to go see what’s up. She’s chatting up the two guys who asked to play with us earlier. She waves me over and introduces me to them. I’m now awkwardly in the conversation while she chats them up. I try to shoot her some looks, but amazingly she manages to look everywhere but my eyes. 

So, yeah, I tried just socializing. The two guys were enraptured by her, and it came a point where I truly just wasn’t part of the conversation. I’d like to say I tried, but honestly I wasn’t putting my all into it. With two beers in a small body, it probably looked like a real lousy attempt. There came a point where I had enough of the whole thing and I just ordered an Uber and left. I sent her a text saying so, but didn’t get a read receipt until maybe 30 minutes later. 

Now she’s livid at me for leaving her at a bar with two strangers. Our mutual friend agreed with her that leaving her alone at the bar was a dick move. My boyfriend refuses to state his judgement. We both got to the bar via separate transportation, so it’s not like she was depending on me for a ride home anyway. Well I’m sober as a clam now, and I’d like to know.

c4jkt4	2019-06-24 07:08:36	CondemnThisMan	AITA for taking my FWB's condoms?	"This happened a while ago but it recently popped into my mind. First some background. A few years ago I had a FWB who I became really close friends with. We were basically dating in my opinion, but he had very religious parents and refused to acknowledge that ours wasn't a normal FWB relationship. We would hang out pretty much every free day we had and spent all day together, he frequently stayed the weekend at my place. We would constantly text, game together, or just hang out on Skype. I'd visit him at work, we'd buy each other food, we had pet names, hung out frequently with his friends to game. 


He would act jealous when I mentioned I was considering going on a date with some guy or another so I stopped bringing it up when I did. To be honest though I only ever dated a couple guys at the very beginning of our relationship, a few months in I just wasn't interested in anyone but him and didn't see anyone else until we broke up. We ""dated"" for two years and still remain fairly close friends today.


So, very early on he told me he won a contest with Trojan and gets a huge box full of hundreds of condoms every four months. He told me Trojan expected him to pass them out to his friends and on his college campus, I guess it was an advertising ploy for them. He offered me some saying I can take as many as I want since he has so many, but I declined as I had no need for them (a big reason I stopped seeing other people is that we weren't using condoms and I wasn't comfortable with the thought of exposing him to a disease on accident).


About a year later I was hanging out in his room when I read a LPT about how you should always have condoms on you for one reason or another. Can't remember what it said exactly, but I remembered my friend's literal closet full of condoms. I grabbed three, put them in my purse and didn't think about them again. About half a year later I was super bored and was cleaning out my purse with him, just going through stuff and telling stories about how I got them. I found the condoms, laughed and said ""huh, I forgot I grabbed these! Isn't that funny"" or something like that. He. Flipped. Out. He got so mad at me, he called me a thief and told me he can't trust me alone in his house any more because he was worried about what else I was going to steal. I was really confused and apologized and offered to give them back since I didn't use them but he wasn't interested. I think I started crying cuz I was so hurt by him calling me a thief and just went home and we never talked about it again. 


I felt so bad for upsetting him, but also angry because I felt like it wasn't something to freak out so hard about. I asked a friend what she thought and she said he was being completely ridiculous, that it was similar to taking a tampon or a makeup wipe which I agree with.

For context, I go to a co-Ed vocational training school that has communal housing. After a rough relationship and breakup I finally started seeing someone new. I’m really happy with them and they’re really happy with me. My friends seemed really supportive of this new relationship, until recently. 


Lately, when I try to talk to them they completely ignore me. Talking in person and text, nothing.  So I’ve taken to spending more time with my SO because my friends have been ignoring me and my requests to hang out. 

Everyone’s been ignoring us like the plague and then complaining they don’t have enough time to spend with me. 
I’ve approached them with and without my partner and I’m being ignored, but then when I ask about it they tell me I don’t spend time with them anymore, even though I’ve tried several times. 

Now they are just straight up ignoring me and won’t even try to sit down like adults and work this out. 

I’m super upset that they won’t tell me what I did wrong and if there’s anything I can do to fix it.  

Am I the asshole?

c4jbcj	2019-06-24 06:36:08	Nightwing73	AITA for not celebrating my birthday, while simultaneously going “all out” for other people’s birthday?	"I know this one is kind of lightweight compared to some dilemmas we get on here, but I wanted to get an outside opinion. 

I hate my birthday, I’ve never enjoyed celebrating it. I don’t like being the center of attention, and even have a vivid memory of hiding in the bathroom upset on my 7th birthday when my family tried to sing me the “Happy Birthday” song. I’m just not about it.

At the same time, I always make grandiose plans for best friends, family, and people I’m dating at the time. Just for a few examples, setting up scavenger hunts, surprise parties, and more than a few times buying gifts I probably shouldn’t have. I always plan them out and cater specifically to the individual. Friend 1 might hate what I did for friend 2, and their gifts would reflect that. 

Well the other night, one of my friends brought up that they’ve never gotten to do anything for me, and I laughingly jokes that they never will. Honestly out of the three roommates I have, I think only one knows the day, because he’s seen my drivers license.

He got kind of fussy, and said its not fair that I get to do big things for other people but refuse to accept the same. 

I’ve always told people that if they want to celebrate with me, just help me throw badass Halloween parties, as it’s the only holiday I genuinely enjoy. Again, I was told that was a cop-out.

I’ve been kinda thinking on that for a few days, and honestly it kinda stuck with me. Am I the asshole?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c4jaf8	2019-06-24 06:32:50	Mega_Meta	AITA for telling my bestfriend I will be mad at her if she starts dating a certain person again?	"So here's some important backstory. My now bestfriend and I dated pretty seriously for 5 years. We lived together, the whole deal. After a very amicable breakup, we kind of stopped talking for almost two years. 

After we started talking again, we quickly went back to being best friends. We hang out almost every day, applied for a job together and now work together, and definitely at least text every single day. 

We are both comfortable talking to each other about our dating and sex lives, and it's not weird at all. I dont get jealous nor weird around guys she has dated or hooked up with since we dated. It seems to both of us like a very healthy relationship. I even talk to and see her family every now and then (not like by myself, but if the two of us are hanging out). 

Now, one of the guys she dated for the better part of a year after we broke up is someone I have known for over a decade, and she had just met last year. I've never liked the guy, he used to bully me, he is irresponsible, an alcoholic, selfish, and immature. His other ex girlfriend is also a very good friend of mine, and their relationship was borderline abusive. All of the worst things about their relationship are things my friend has said were still present when she dated him.

Lately he has been texting my bestfriend late at night, like 2 or 3am, asking to come over. Obvious drunk booty-calls. On a couple occasions I have told her not to give in, and she has agreed with me every time that she really should just tell him to leave her alone. 

So tonight he texted her to hang out and I told her basically that I will always be her friend, but out of all the dudes she has been with since we were together, he is the only one I really dislike and think is bad for her. I told her that I will always be her friend but I will ""be kind of mad"" at her if she goes back to hanging out with him. She didn't get mad or anything when I told her this. She agreed. But also said she doesnt think she has the discipline to not go back to him. 

So AITA? I know it's her life and her choice, and being that I am her ex it may seem from an outside perspective that I am acting out of jealousy or being possessive. This is not the case and I just genuinely dont want to see my best friend once again fall for this dude who is a parasite and an alcoholic and is mentally and emotionally not fit for a relationship right now."

I have an 11 year old German Shepherd who is the love of my life. She’s a loving, light hearted, courageous creature who I’ve had the pleasure of calling “my dog” for 9 years. 

I recently had a daughter. She’s about a month old and they seem to like each other just fine. No issues. 

I had to relocate from a state where I own my own home with a yard to the Bay Area...moved my MIL into my home and packed my little family up into a two bedroom..

Am I the asshole for wanting to bring my puppy back to our home state while we live away? She’s not thriving in an apartment, she doesn’t have a yard to run in, and my work schedule and baby schedule keeps us busy most of the day. 

I feel like a horrible person for moving her into this and even more so for possibly “abandoning” her. 

I’d see her twice a month if I leave her at my house with myMIL, I’d save some money on rent and open up the possibilities for my family to live in nicer places. 

I’m worried about my first child aka my dog.

c4j71g	2019-06-24 06:20:41		AITA for standing up for myself?	"Let me start off by saying that this happened when I was still in high school. 

So I began the ninth grade with a bit of a difficult start. It was a new year, new school year, my grades were not that bad, but they weren't that great either (average). As someone with neurological/learning disabilities, I often found high school a bit challenging, but I'm grateful for the support I got from my mother, who at the time was the only one who took me seriously.

I joined one activity, Duke of Edinburgh's Award (International Award) at my school because I heard so much about it, and I felt I could've gotten a lot out of it. 5-7 months into the activity, I decided to leave it because I felt like I wasn't getting anything out of it. I told my mom about quitting it, she respected my decision, and I told one of my teachers to talk to the teacher in charge of it, and he did. From that point on, everything seemed to be okay.

My head of year somehow ended up knowing about this, I don't know how, and she began to lecture me for quitting the activity. She told me that I was missing out on a great opportunity and that I'd never get another chance at it. I told her that it's my decision, and there's nothing too big of a deal about it. Several minutes into the conversation, I promptly walk away because I felt that she was overreacting about nothing.

Now in the week that passes, my mother ends up getting several, annoying calls from my head of year. She told my mother that ""I'm missing out on opportunities, I'm making a bad decision, You have to stop him from making a bad decision"", and my mother told me that she was extremely annoyed with the constant calling and asked her to back off. I even end up getting called during class, and the same teacher that I spoke to about quitting the activity lectured me the same way my head of year did. In fact, my head of year also somehow joined into the conversation and continued to lecture me about quitting the activity I signed up for. I didn't fight back, but rather, I just listened to them and went on with my day.

I often found exams stressful because of the pressure to succeed. During one parent-teacher conference, my mother again ended up getting lectured about the activity I quit. and somewhere, my head of year butted into the conversation and told my mom ""I don't think your son fits in in our school, so we should consider other opportunities for him"". My mom refused to listen to this, and promptly took me away from the table. Little did I know that my mom later on got several calls about this from my head of year and my mom told her very firmly, ""My son will finish from this school, even if it's the last thing I do"". I recall my mother getting pestered with things like that even more after the calls.

Having had enough of this, I confronted my head of year and the same teacher about the calls and lectures. They told me I was being rude, but I said, ""then stop harassing me about things"". AITA?"		1	0

So about a year ago, I asked my dad about buying a new laptop. Now my work (cartooning) I found is best on this really specific laptop that cost about $800. My dad agreed, and said that we could look into one as long as I agreed to pay for *half* of the price of it. 

While looking, I repeatedly brought up that I did NOT want a Macbook (Not only because it’s terrible for my work, but because we have 4 other Macs at home) and that I wanted the really specific laptop. My dad knew about this.

Christmas time rolls around, and lo and behold, my dad bought me a MACBOOK PRO. I genuinely pretended to be really happy, but I was really kinda upset. The laptop was almost $1800 and my dad told me I needed to hold up my end of the deal, and pay for half ($900!!!) which is more than the laptop I wanted in the first place.

Now about a year later, after I have paid my $900 in debt, I have made countless cartoons on this thing. My Dad couldn’t be more proud of himself. One day recently he brought up, “See? Aren’t you glad I bought this Mac instead of that other computer?”

And I told him that no, I was not glad, because I had to pay $500 dollars more than I would have on the other laptop, and that I didn’t even need this one since we have a bunch at home already. I said that this computer has terrible performance, and has no support for some of my animating/drawing software that I was also saving up money for. 

I immediately regretted it after seeing the look on my dad’s face. He got incredibly angry, and said “Well then, you wouldn’t mind if I took it away then.” and I got grounded. My family is all telling me that I’m the definition of an entitled brat, and that I need to be more grateful that he was willing to spend that kind of money on me.

I feel really bad, but I still think I was somewhat justified. AITA?

Edit: I’m 13, and could not get a job and buy the laptop I wanted with my own money. My parents look after my spending, and I can only buy what they approve of (fair enough). My dad only approves of Apple.

Edit 2: I forgot to mention that I have tried to talk to him about it since I got the laptop. Not yell, but talk. He just told me that I needed to “give it a chance.”"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4j4c6	2019-06-24 06:11:31	mcfrosty000	AITA for living with my terminally-ill mom and not paying rent?	"About 15 months ago, after deciding/committing to pursue a career as an entertainer, I ran into some financial hardship, and asked my 73-year old mom if I could move in with her for 3 months, so I could live for free, while I continued to build my brand. She agreed, and we agreed that there would be no rent paid, as her rent cost did not increase by having me there, and as she had moved in with me a couple times in the previous 10 years (for months at a time) and I had never charged her rent to stay with me.  


About a week before I moved in with her, she was diagnosed with her second bout of cancer, terminal (survived a battle with it 22 years prior), at which point, gave additional purpose for me staying with her - to provide care, nurture a healthy environment, and have her spend as much of her remaining time with one of her children (2 others live an hour of town) and her only grandchild (my daughter, who I had split custody of at the time). The timeline for my stay became unknown, and indefinite - and I believed we had embarked on a mutually-beneficial living arrangement, as I was able to facilitate my mom's life, while her housing/financial support afforded me more time to put into following my dream.  


From that point on, on multiple occasions (I'd say once a month at least), whether it be from close/distant friends and/or siblings, I had been criticized and guilt-tripped into trying to make me feel bad for one, some, or all, of the following perceived issues/opinions of me:  


\- 36-year old man living with his mom  
\- No day job or steady income (""Get a job dude"")  
\- Taking advantage of my elderly, sick mother, to pursue a pipe dream  
\- Wasn't making much tangible financial progress to get back on my feet  


If it wasn't for multiple close people in my life suggesting that there was something wrong with the way I was living (my harshest critic was my sister, 8 years my senior, who we've had a historically hostile relationship), I wouldn't be questioning my possible douchey-ness... but, maybe I'm oblivious to the fact that I'm a big turd.  


My mom passed on May 2nd of this year (RIP) - I feel as though we maximized our final time together (which having a job would have impeded), and do not feel like an asshole for receiving her help - However, the familial tension due to the drama surrounding my perceived douchey-ness has resulted in no contact from my brother since her death, and an even worse and more hostile relationship with my sister (normal for us not to talk, but now there is hatred coming from her).

She had also been overstaying and working illegally (this is not the US btw). I was a bit upset after what she did. I contacted a local police station and told them her name and her workplace.

She got caught, and she knew it was me who reported her. Now everybody is pissed at me. Even some of my friends have stopped talking to me. Their thought process is simply ""OP ruined a girl's life because she loved someone else."" It's true that I went to the police as personal retaliation rather than out of genuine concern for the public. But besides the motive I don't see what I did wrong. She cheated and she broke the law.

c4j3ul	2019-06-24 06:10:02		AITA for not really giving my dad an answer on what the rest of the family did today?	"So for some context: I have crippling anxiety, my dad is a trigger for it. He always says something to cause an anxiety attack and to make matters worse I cannot explain this to him because he thinks mental illness is not real. I honestly feel like I’m trapped when he’s around and anyone who has observed the way I act when he’s not around compared to when he is around can tell I act way different. I can go from laughing and joking and actually being involved and once he walks in the door I’m almost dead silent and I usually leave shortly thereafter. I always feel like he’s going to make a comment about something I do that makes me feel like shit, put pressure on me to be a “true man” or even when that’s not happening it’s just awkward because him and I never really built a relationship because I differ so much from him and it’s just hard to connect. Anyway today he was away at work and while he was away at work the rest of the family went out and did stuff(not anything extravagant, he even called and told my mom to go out and do something if we wanted) so we did. We went to a fruit stand, the grocery store, and make a stop at a place for Mexican food that we haven’t had in a long time. All is well we come home and eat our food and go about our night, dad comes home and my mom isn’t feeling well by this time. She’s had stomach troubles as long as I can remember she probably would’ve felt like shit either way but my dad comes home and starts accusing the food we got as the reason she didn’t feel good. Which I mean it could totally be but the way he said it seemed like he was mad at all of us and conflict is my number one trigger so when he asked what we did that day rather than tell him I just kinda said “nothing” and left it at that. He didn’t seem offended by it but I still kinda feel bad. Sometimes I wonder if I don’t give him a chance to improve...

TL;DR: Dad causes me to have panic attacks, comes home after work, blames moms stomach ache on food we got, his tone seems angry and judgmental causing me to get anxious, I blow off question about what we did today, I feel bad"		1	0

We had our problems like any other couple, but overall it was a very healthy, respectful, supporting relationship. When we got together we were experimenting with drugs and whatnot. We both cleaned up and I went to college for engineering (graduating next year!). 

Anyway, her parents and never got along. They would do some weird manipulating things to her that never made sense to me and I pressed her to give herself a break from them for a little while. Example: They’d tell her about something not so significant (like her brother’s cub-scout pinewood derby race) 6 months or more in advance. Then, they wouldn’t say a word about it until 15 minutes before it started, expecting her to be there because “they’d talked about this”, and get pissed that she didn’t remember from half a year ago. 

After getting threatened by her parents because they disapproved of me fundamentally, being covered in tattoos, a couple piercings etc., I shut them out of my life and told her to consider doing the same. I mean, they threatened to kill me multiple times. 

We both wanted kids, but last month, she told me she couldn’t imagine a happy life with kids in the current state of the relationship between me and her parents, then had her stuff packed and moved in with them within 24 hours. Completely took me off guard. 

She’s taking this breakup a lot harder than me and seeks my comfort pretty often. I finally gave in and slept with her last night. Today she started crying and tried to take me back. I feel like a dick for potentially making her feel like she made a horrible decision, which she didn’t.

"For context, my friend had been dating his girlfriend for a little short of a year and until just last week she was all he’d talk about. He had told me things were going great and that he can see himself dating her for a long time. 

Then, a couple days ago, I was hanging out with some other friends when he texted one of the friends I was with, telling him that they broke up.  We didn’t think much of it because frankly, I was never close to him because of the fact that he’d only hangout with his girlfriend at school(we are soon to be sixth form or juniors in high school for any Americans) and we didn’t share any classes. 

Now this was also an emotional time for me because now that the school year has ended, I was planning to move to the US to further my studies meaning not only was it the last time I was going to meet the lads I was with, but I also had ALOT of paper work I needed to prepare(with the help of my mum and my sister). And not to mention a month and a half of exams just ended and as an introvert, I love spending time in my bed basically doing nothing when I get the chance to do so.

Also, this may be the nail in the coffin for anyone that thinks ITA so far but we are the only two students from the school that lives in the same area.

So WIBTA for ignoring my “friend’s” constant indirect begging to be with him during his breakup despite the fact that he is not even admitting he feels lonely and needs someone? Is it okay that I’m feeling used at this point? We rarely hung out before this incident and when we did, it was simply because we were the only ones living near each other and not because we actually wanted to in any way. It was also painfully awkward at times and I really want/need to stay home if he asks again...(I’m currently ignoring messages from him as I am writing this)."		1	0

Edit: thank you all for your responses. I have responded to many (so far) which got me thinking about WHY I don’t want to tell H. After much thought, I think the reason is his dad died. His dad died with in the past 6 months. He had never mourned the loss of his dad. I think I am afraid that this miscarriage situation may spiral him into a fit of mourning.

Here’s the deal. People are regularly working overtime (literally daily) and NOT getting paid. On paper time cards I write 5:30 to 1:30 but I’m often there until almost 2 am or after. Now 20 minutes one night isn’t a big deal, but it’s almost every night. When I was hired I was told some nights you leave early, some nights you stay late. It evens out. It most certainly does not! I’m owed at least another 10 hours per month I’d estimate, but again, can’t prove it. Others are owed just as much if not more. This unpaid overtime is expected. 

I’m not going to list my industry, but I have friends who say it’s like this everywhere. It’s most certainly illegal another friend told me. 

Friend A outside industry: Report it to the department of labor. This is illegal. 
Friend B in industry: Deal with it like everyone else.
Mom: Don’t be that asshole if it’s how things are, just get a new job.

Since I was told I can report this, WIBTA? I feel like I and the others deserve to get paid for the hours worked. 

I have been looking for a new job and working on my resume. 

Yes, I went into the wrong industry to begin with but I didn’t know it until I was too deep.

c4iyo0	2019-06-24 05:53:00	ChessieChessieBayBay	WIBTA for not going home for my cousins last days?	" WIBTA- My cousin Mike is an incredible man; funny, kind, intelligent, strong. The BEST dad. He once told me, “if you date a guy and he isn’t as cool as me, dump him”. God I love him! I was planning to head home in early September for a visit as it’s hard to get away in the summer. 
      Mike has a very rare form of cancer and took a super rapid turn yesterday and he may go at any moment.  
  My family is in Massachusetts and I’m in Texas. I am a dog trainer and I’m currently staying with two dogs who have behavioral issues (they are good dogs but not safe for just anyone and their owners are in Africa for two more weeks) and simply speaking, I don’t know if I can get there in time. I’m trying to contact them to see if they have a trusted friend or family member that can jump in..The roster is slim. 
   On top of this logistical nightmare, I come from a Waspy New England family and my mother is so proud and impressed with the strength the family is showing. “Stoic, pragmatic, appreciative, strong” are the words thrown around 24/7. I am not that girl. I can’t even THINK about being in the same room with ANY of my family members at this point without breaking down. My heart is broken and unlike the rest of my family, I don’t have the ability to bottle it in and shower cry. 
    When I asked my mother if I should come home she said “ you know what, he’s so loved and surrounded by pure positivity right now”. “He is so strong, he has a line of people waiting to see him”. “
  I think my presence and my ability/curse of not being able to contain my grief may shatter the emotional house of cards they seem to be so masterfully building. My visit and emotional response may make my family’s controlled pain bubble to the surface and I would hate myself for creating that waterfall.

c4iylj	2019-06-24 05:52:44	dontgotobedyet	AITA for insisting my sister go to the store to pick up cookie dough after she ate most of it? (and then eating the rest myself)	"So the other day, I (f20) felt like making cookies so I asked my sister (f17) to pick some up on the way home since she was already out. Initially, she said no but I told her I’d transfer some money into her account to pay for it. She agreed under the condition that she kept the change as a “delivery fee” which ended up being 5$. (I gave her 10$ and the cookie dough was 5$) 

So she brought it home and I told both her and my 10 year old sister that they could have ONE spoon full of cookie dough but no more because I wanted to make cookies again later in the week. I really stressed that part because my sisters are NOTORIOUSLY lacking in self control when it comes to eating cookie dough. They both agreed and that was that. 

Earlier today, I went to make cookies with the left over cookie dough (should have been enough to make 24 more cookies) and I only had enough to make maybe 3 cookies tops. I was livid and immediately blamed the 10 year old because I figured it was her. However, she was just as shocked as I was when i asked where all the cookie dough went and was even upset that she was “in trouble” for something she hadn’t done.  

So I confronted my other sister about it and she basically owned up to it and said that since she went and picked it up she was allowed to eat the cookie dough. I reminded her that not only did I pay for it, but I also let her keep the change AND made a big deal out of letting her know I didn’t want anyone eating it. She stood her ground and said that if the 10 year old and I wanted cookies so bad we should just make cookies out of what’s left (which definitely wasn’t enough). 

I said no and that she had to either go buy some replacement cookie dough or I would take the money back. After some arguing, she threw her hands up and said “Fine I’ll go get the cookie dough but I’m eating the rest of what we have when I get home.” So I replied with “Uhh no I’M going to eat the rest because I paid for it and you ate 90% of it. “ but she left as I was saying this. 

When she got home, she gave both me and my other little sister the silent treatment up until I went to the refrigerator and grabbed the nearly empty cookie dough container to give the rest to the 10 year old and she started calling me a “massive hypocrite” and threw another big fit so I instead spilt what was left and gave the other half to the 10 year old so that I could eat some too.

So AITA?

TL;DR:  Sister picked up cookie dough that I paid for and paid her a “delivery fee” but then she ate most of the dough despite me specifically asking that she didn’t. I insisted she went and bought more to replace what she ate with her own money and then proceeded to eat the rest of the other anyway."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c4iy9z	2019-06-24 05:51:41	ossyemate	WIBTA if i don't tip if i a visir another country? This post is long and confusing and i'm sorry for that.	Growing up I was constantly told the importance of money and that i need to save up every last bit because we are poor and need the savings. I have no job and my culture or social-ness is that we don't tip, I've never tipped before because of where i live and i don't want to tip, I need whatever i can get because i believe that money is important in case of emergencies. Anyways the reason I am asking is because i was on a cruise awhile back and was asked to tip or given a piece of paper to tip someone, i have dyscalculia so i don't know how much is too much and so i don't actually know the proper value? Like if theres a product for 2 dollars i'm told its expensive but in my head I get confused and think thats cheap? My family is weird and poor so i don't get how anything below 10 dollars is expensive. Anyways that's the gist, dyscalculia is dyslexia with numbers and i'm not sure how to properly give someone money without giving away too much and not realising that its way too much, i tipped the dude 1 dollar and i had to write down on this check thing, but the first time it was shoved in my face i put a 0 because i thought that was how much i was paying out of pocket when I already paid so i was confused and i got a dirty look.

c4ivad	2019-06-24 05:42:14		AITA for being mad that my mum wouldn’t take leave and fly interstate and to help me during my pregnancy?	"I’m 16 weeks pregnant with my second child. In my first pregnancy I had Hyperemesis Gravidarum, which is a severe pre-natal illness. This time I’ve been better medicated and not quite as sick, but still sick enough though that I’ve been admitted to hospital for fluids and other interventions. I’ve also been too ill to provide my 3yo with a high standard of care. My husband is FIFO (fly in/fly out) and on a 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off roster. He’s not been able to take time off work as he’s recently started at a new site and hasn’t accrued leave. Additionally, we can’t go without his salary as I cannot work whilst pregnant.

So, after braving the first 9 weeks I started to get desperate. I asked my mum who is enlisted in the military if she could take 2 weeks to fly interstate to look after my son while I basically curl up into the foetal position and cry. She couldn’t at first because she couldn’t get leave, but said she’d come at the earliest opportunity. 

Fast forward 3 weeks and she can get time off, she texts me asking what date my husband goes back to work. I let her know, wrongly assuming that she was asking in order to book flights. I call a few days later and ask if she’s been able to organise coming. She says no, that she’s flying to another state instead for a “personal course,” by which she most likely means a meditation or other spiritual course. I then found out, she also attended my nieces’ first birthday (also interstate), despite telling me that she could not attend my own sons (birthday parties one week apart) for financial reasons (she has never attended a birthday of my son’s, but has been to every one of my brother’s children’s).

I am really upset. Not so much because she didn’t come, if it was isolated to simply not coming I’d be disappointed but not hurt. I’m upset because she chose other priorities over me and my son despite my desperation. I feel like an asshole, because it’s her life and her decisions to make... but, she’s my mum and I’d love to have her support once in a while. I told her in a text that I didn’t want to speak to her because I was so upset by the circumstances. AITA?"		1	0

c4iuxv	2019-06-24 05:41:08	-AnxiousSloth-	AITA for not wanting to live with my S/O grandmother?	"My S/O's grandmother wants us to move in with her because she has COPD and breathing problems from smoking most of her life. Dont get me wrong, I feel bad for her, but we are about to have a newborn and neither of us will have the time to take care of her also. She says she will go outside to smoke, but she has said that to people she's lived with before and smoked cigarettes inside, including at the hospital when she was hospotalized because she couldn't breathe. My S/O and I are expecting our first kid in October. So it's a big deal to me right now. 


I feel bad though because we have lived with her before when we had no where to go. I feel like I owe it to her, but don't want to risk my baby's health or well being.


 She doesn't have much money, she only gets money off her social security checks and she receives food stamps I believe. She is getting a settlement soon and says she wants to buy a house and have us move in with the baby and then when she passes, leave the house to us in her will.


Edit: Yes, I could live with her and tell her once she lights up in the house we're out, but I feel like it's an unnecessary risk. When we had lived with her before, she would smoke while on her oxygen machine. She has to be on oxygen 24/7. I've told her countless times how dangerous it is and that it gives me major anxiety because I have had to escape two house fires before, but she never attempted to stop. Her argument is she has to have her oxygen all the time, no matter what she is doing or she gets choked up.


My SO is saying once she gets her settlement money, she will be able to afford a nurse to take care of her so we wouldn't have to. She has been waiting on this money for years now, saying she's going to get receive it soon, but nothing has happened. 


Another detail I forgot to mention, she keeps bad company (IMO) and that also has me worried. The type of people she has as friends I would not feel comfortable having around my baby. Most of them are addicts or recovering addicts."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I recently helped my roommates move across the country (I paid the security deposit and 4 months worth of rent by myself), and so far everything is fine. Previously, they had a very terrible roommate, and they complained about everything she did, including how loud her and her boyfriend were during sex. I'm a very sexual person and I made it VERY clear when we were first talking about moving in together. I'm bisexual, into BDSM and my boyfriend and are in an open relationship. I definitely get around. 

When we were looking for apartments together, they said that they wanted to make sure that the bedrooms did not share walls, so we found a floor plan where there is a master bathroom that separates the two bedrooms. I thought this was so that any sex noises would be muffled. Which is fair, no one wants to hear other people having sex. I've lived with at least 12 other people (during college one of my roommates subletted over the summer) and no one has every complained or told me that they heard me having sex. Before they moved in I mentioned that the walls were insulated well and you really couldn't hear someone masturbating or having sex through them. 

Since moving in, they've made it clear that they don't want me to have sex at the apartment with them there at all but they rarely ever leave the apartment. Had they told me about this before we moved in together, I would never have agreed to live with them. Before this was communicated to me, my boyfriend and I did have sex multiple times while they were home and no one heard anything. 

I explained that they couldn't hear through the walls if I shut my bathroom door, and I tried to compromise with them. I was fine with limiting my dates to the weekends, and only having loud sex with my boyfriend at his place, but they do not wish to compromise at all. I told my boyfriend about this and he is very angry because he thinks I'm being taken advantage of and he thinks I should be able to do whatever I want in my own home.

A few hours before closing tonight, a woman who appeared to be in her late 60s came into my store looking for a special kind of vitamin. She appeared to be completely coherent and aware of her surroundings. Fifteen minutes later, I started to notice that the restroom area smelled HEAVILY of human feces (more so than normal) and I went to investigate. There was shit covering every imaginable surface of the restroom. Toilet seat, floor, walls, sink... everywhere. I assumed it was some homeless person with nothing better to do, but as I walked out to inform my manager, I realized that the entire store smelled like a dirty diaper. 

I went back to the register, and the woman who asked about the vitamins came up with a sizable basket of cosmetic items. She was the source of the smell.

c4ipd8	2019-06-24 05:23:02	beleaguredgamer	AITA for not conceding games I'm probably going to lose?	"Hi all,

&#x200B;

So, my friends and I (all early to mid 20s, 6 of us in total) have gotten in to a real-time strategy game kick lately. We've been playing a lot Age of Empires, Supreme Commander and 8-bit Armies, fun games. Sometimes 1 on 1, sometimes teams, but always players vs players. I'm not terrible, but not great, so I lose more games than I win. That's alright with me, I'm just having fun and you learn the most from losses.

&#x200B;

The problem comes in, 2 of the players in our group are pretty intense ""professional"" gamers, very competitive. For them, they like to churn over games as fast as they can. So when they feel like they've lost, they just concede. I don't get this mentality personally, I like to finish the game, and give it my last stand, but to each their own. If they want to concede their matches, that's fine. When they face each other, they tend to burn through matches rapidly. The rest of us are more laid back, and don't really tend to concede unless it looks like it's going to be a long stalemate or a player is in a position that is literally impossible to recover from but is far from being fully defeated. Generally we play until the bloody end.

&#x200B;

However, more than once I've gotten complaints from those pro players when faced against them. Now, they pretty universally win, for me it's a challenge of how long I can hold out and what I can learn. Sometimes it's both of theme versus me and another friend as well. They have started refusing to play us and calling us assholes and other names in the group WhatsApp because we don't concede. They say that we're wasting their times. I just like to finish what I started, win or lose. Usually the moment it becomes clear we're about to lose is mere minutes from the actual defeat, and if I'm being candid, I know it's hopeless from the start because of skill disparity, so by their logic I should immediately concede. I'm worried though that they'll avoid us more and end up fracturing the group up, so I feel like I should just start quitting games, but at that point the whole idea starts to feel sour to me.

"This happened last year, and it still haunts me every night, so I want to know if I was really an ass or not. My ex and I dated for four years. It was a long distance relationship, but we saw each other multiple times a year and our families got to know each other very quickly. Even his mom treated me as her own daughter. We had plans for the future, which included me moving to be with him and finding a place together.

&#x200B;

After months and months of anxiety about our relationship, I ended it. I ended it for many reasons. He was hanging with more girls lately, he acted completely different between being physically together and being apart. He and I argued more over stupid things. I felt like he was a freaking sex addict when we were together. He was angry when I started seeking more alone time. He was childish and I was DONE with it.

&#x200B;

We were on discord with some friends, and I asked him to move with me into another channel. I told him that I didn't want to move states to be with him and that I can't stand the thought of leaving my mom and dad behind. I could see myself starting a future here, with my family, and I didn't want to leave. I would have been moving hundreds of miles away and I just finally admitted that it was too much pressure. I told him that I wanted to break up. He was in absolute tears, but I didn't cry that night. In fact, I felt relieved. I told him I was leaving the discord for a few days to let him grieve with our friends.

&#x200B;

When I came back three days later, I was banned from the server and no one would talk to me. He had told them all what happened - his side of the story - and everyone turned against me. He talked to me, angry and hurt, but I didn't back down. I told him I was done.

&#x200B;

Over the next few months, I was seriously depressed. The weight of what I did and what it had cost me was heavy; I was friendless and alone. The friends that he had always called our friends, not just his friends, didn't want to talk to me anymore.

&#x200B;

I asked him several times to talk to me through chat, but I admit that I also cursed at him when he did. I was furious. I know I hadn't handled the break-up well, but we can at least be friends right? No. He started dating one of his girl friends a week after and refused to let me back on the server- ever.

&#x200B;

Any rare conversation since has been through another mutual friend, who thinks I'm crazy because I thought my ex would be over this by now. It's been nine months, why is he still holding a grudge over this? I don't care about him anymore. I just want to talk to my friends again.

&#x200B;

Back then, all his friends believed I was an ass. He believed that I'm a heartless ass. I just don't know what to think of it, or why I still care. Maybe its a self-esteem thing; I honestly feel like I'm a terrible person. I haven't dated or even thought about dating since, because the experience made me feel that I don't handle relationships well.

They end up seperating and E moves back to hometown where i still am. E and I never got along or had any meaningful conversations, actually went as far as criticizing my music at a party once. L is a good friend but I feel he never wants to see me succeed or do better than him. Envy runs thick in his blood. Says hes fine from the cheating incident but I, and others in the group think otherwise. Not that L would ever admit it.

Situation: Being the alcoholic I am, got sauced up beyond belief two weeks ago and instagram dm'd E (we shared likes on every post since cheating incident, so maybe drunk me thought there was something there), I wake up with a message from her and instantly feel regret, i preceed to apologize and explain what had happened. The texts were innocent and she wasn't intrested anyways. Fast forward to last night on discord where L, another friend and I are chatting and drinking. L is poking fun at me and won't let up, Remembering the messages I say, ""Don't make me do something I know I'll like and you'll hate."" This triggers L and he's instantly curious to what it could be. Then he says exactly that, ""Oh what, are you going to hook up with E?"" I laugh and say no, play it off as if he wasn't right, but now I'm thinking E has already told L about the messages and my guilty conscious won't let me hold the secret any longer. I couldn't say it over the mic because who I was around in real life but I Facebook messaged, and explained. L leaves the discord as soon as the message is read.

L proceeds to joke about messaging my ex who had done the same to me (cheated), tells me he isn't the person I should be fucking with, and then says he isn't comming camping on our annual Canada's day trip, which has made other friends from the group ditch. I thought i was doing the right thing by telling him, but I think a grudge will be held for awhile.

She liked me, and though we did have sex, her feelings for me weren't romantic, and at that point neither were mine. She and I remained friends, and in a few months, this woman became my best friend. Then, I started to develop romantic feelings for this woman

 ""A"" was my closest male friend. 7 years at this point. If I had 2 best friends, It was A and C

Now I would talk about my feelings for C to try and work out how I felt, with A. I waited a couple months to make sure what I was feeling was real and not just some crush. I didn't want to risk ruining a great new friendship if all I needed was to get laid

At about 6.5 months, I realize this is something real. I tell her. She doesn't feel the same. Well fuck. Okay. I can deal. Sometimes the person you like doesn't like you back. I tell her I'm willing to remain friends if she wants to. I tell her I'll need some time to deal with my feelings. She's cool with that

About a month later, C decides she wants to get physical. Just sex. I tell her that I won't because I can't separate the act from my feelings for her. She stops talking to me for a few days then apologizes, says it was unfair of her to ask me to do that when she knew how I felt about her. We agree to just put it behind us

Skip ahead. It's my Birthday BBQ. I invite A & C who are crashing at my place cause drinking. As you probably saw coming, A & C fucked. At my home. On my birthday.

Now, C and A have the right to do as they choose, but I feel that it was ultimately disrespectful and a complete disregard for me, my friendship, and my home, for them to fuck at my house, especially when they both knew of my feelings

When I told her I thought what she did was reprehensible., she became defensive and declared that it didn't matter how I felt because I don't have any right to tell her who she can or can't sleep with. I agree, I  don't. But I do have a say in how I'm treated and I deserve better than a friend who will completely disregard my feelings while in my home. What they did together was disrespectful, and a betrayal of my friendship with both of them.

I didn't want to throw away my 7+ year friendship with A. So I talked it out with him, he apologized. I forgave him, but told him the only way I could do that is if he cut out C. Here's the thing. I still don't trust him anymore. He could tell me he's cut her out of his life, but I still won't believe him

Recently a mutual friend invited A & C to the same party as well as several other mutual friends. I feel like any of my friends who are willing to party with C are basically saying ""What she did is acceptable enough that it's not a deal-breaker to hangout with her"" I feel like my ""friends"" betrayed me by attending the party. 

I cut A & C out of my life, as well as all our mutual friends who are still willing to party with C

I really tried to look at it from her pov - i really dont see that im being unreasonable here. It's not like i don't want to go. So i brought up the fact that maybe its because its free? We can afford the tickets, not sure why we need to use the free stuff. I told her she can take family or friends for annabelle, but tomorrow for us is anything but that. That made her really angry and she told me to just shut up.

c4ilpr	2019-06-24 05:11:47	OceanPup	AITA for getting upset about my parents lying about my birthday at a restaurant for free stuff?	My family and I frequently go to this restaurant where if it’s your birthday, they give you a bigger serving (and I mean like 5x the size of the normal serving)  of the desert you get at the end of meal. And as the title says, my parents frequently use this and tell the workers there that “oh its OceanPup’s birthday, can we get the special desert for him?”. When I say this, I mean pretty much every time. Before I used to love them doing this, but recently I’ve found that I’m starting to hate it because, well, we’re lying about it. Its absolutely not a big problem or anything, but I really do get upset about this, and this is only one of the only restaurants where they do this. The only way this works out is if they don’t recognize us. They always laugh at me and tell me it’s not a big deal and stop overreacting. So, AITA?	Not the A-hole	0	0

"For context, this isn't the first time that they have tried to ""improve"" our property.  i.e. they planted a couple raspberry bushes very clearly on our side of the property while the other owner and I were at work.  We were not asked for permission and so the other owner ripped them out.  Their excuse was that they didn't realize that the land on that side of our house was ours.  This time they trimmed a tree on our property and took out a circle of grass surrounding it in a 3-4 foot radius in order to lay down rocks.  Again while the both of us were not home and made no attempt to ask for permission to do so.  That said, I do think the tree probably should have been trimmed and a ring of mulch around it instead of rocks.

c4ik4y	2019-06-24 05:06:38	throwingitaaay	WIBTA if I un-move-in with my long-term partner and their kid?	"MINOR UPDATE: My partner is seemingly more positive towards the idea of counseling, and we're going to start that. We've also had another conversation about living separately that went better than before with regard to our ability to continue on good terms as well as me seeing the kid if we end up breaking up. There's still a lot of unknowns and no guarantees, but things seem a little less bleak regardless of whether we live together and/or continue our relationship. Also getting some grounding as far as where I stand and whether it's reasonable has been really helpful in keeping our communication more sane and balanced in general. Thanks for your help, everyone.

Throw away account because they're on Reddit. This also might be a little choppy in my attempts to anonymize everyone involved, sorry.

I've been living with this person for several years, and we had moved in together quickly and at a pretty young age. Partner's kid was basically a baby when we started dating, and I've had a big role in raising the kid.

I'm a non-smoker and my partner smokes in the house. They know how I feel about this, and when we first moved in together it wasn't supposed to happen but there you go. Since then we've tried to have compromises about it but they all result in me being constantly congested and disappointed and our house stinking like an ashtray. My partner doesn't ever smoke around the kid, though, and usually doesn't smoke around me although sometimes does if I don't remove myself from the area.

We're not married and I don't feel confident that I'd be allowed time with the kid since legally it wouldn't be required. If I decide to move out and it results in an end to the relationship I may be essentially abandoning this kid when I've served as a parent (their other bio-parent has limited access to them).

We've been arguing a lot lately and my partner expresses the belief that I'm primarily responsible for the problem, while I disagree and we each cite manipulation as a problem in the other's behavior. Attempts to resolve this have gone nowhere so far although we are still trying.

I'm finding myself increasingly unhappy with the living situation, and ideally I'd like to see if living apart eases some of the issues and tension. However, this would potentially complicate things for the kid, as well as financially for my partner. At one point I expressed interest in living separately and my partner made it clear that I would be the asshole and that it would probably cause them to leave the relationship. Because of this, I have not brought it back up yet but I still feel like it may be physically healthier for new and emotionally healthier for both of us. Would it be an asshole move to (giving advance notice of course) move out at the end of our lease? If not, would it be to move out (again with notice) before the lease is up?

Thanks

I saw a guy sitting by himself listening to music, he was black and had a shirt of an indie band that I like, on. So figuring we would be able to relate and because this is kind of rare, i decided to try to make a friend

So I go up and i say nice shirt I like that band too, and he doesn't seem too standoffish to me approaching. He replied yeah they are pretty great. So I go, ""so..... that means youre an alternative black guy too?""

He replies: ""a what?""

Me: ""an alternative black guy.""

He then squinted at me like I just said something insanely bizarre. Here comes the part where I feel he was an asshole. And honestly I remember it word for word, its kind of burned into my mind bc I  think he was such an asshole

He goes: ""am i an alternative black guy? Honestly I'd slit my wrists and jump head first into a volcano before I called myself that... Thanks but look dude I dont identity on my proximity to some dumb norm... I just like shit.""

c4iizm	2019-06-24 05:03:04		AITA for leaving before I was discharged?	"I ended up in the hospital earlier for what I thought was a minor heart attack. 

I suddenly had chest pains at home, dizziness, shortness of breath and numbness. Rushed to the hospital and explained to front desk what's going on. At this time the hospital was pretty empty in the waiting room. Waited about 20-30 mins to go to get blood and an ekg. The nurse that took my blood said all the beds were full at the moment.

 So I waited in the lobby and by the time I got chest xrays my chest when to a dull pain that's more manageable. After I made it back to the lobby there wasnt a seat in the house, it suddenly became very packed. So after waiting such a long time I just wanted to see what the tests said and ask to leave if possible.

 I finally made it to my bed in a room that I shared with a family, who was pretty loud with 4 kids. I waited about an hour before the doctor to finally came tell me my results weren't conclusive and there was nothing really to do but he can give me a shot for the pain, he quickly took off as the hospital was very busy. 

Well by that time I was feeling much better but I waited another half hour before I decided I'll call for a nurse and see if I can be discharged. Waited another 10 mins and there was no nurse, I heard some gunshot victims just came in and I didnt expect much treatment and didnt really want anything for pain I didnt have anymore. 

I decided I was going to leave and just see a doctor tomorrow or atleast set an appointment. Well when went to walk out I seen my doctor come through the same doors I had to leave through.  He asked if I was being discharged I said no. Told him I was leaving and he asked me to stay and I asked why. He said he wanted to give me the shot for my pain and I said I'd be fine and he told me to do what I want he cant hold me there. So I left without discharge and came home. The doctor was very nice and very helpful trying his best but I didnt feel a need to take up a bed any longer and wanted to come home.

c4iiqv	2019-06-24 05:02:22	Tw21085	AITA if I refuse to have another kid because it means less sex with my wife?	"So my wife really wants another child. We have a few, all under 7, youngest still in diapers.

Each pregnancy has been harder and harder for my wife. This most recent one she had horrible sickness and physical pain, and her emotional stress was horrible. She was, justifiably and understandably, in an absolutely horrible mood. Even she freely admits that. 

Pretty much all that came out at me. I was at fault for everything. If I did the dishes, I did them too loudly and it woke her up. If I bought her a gift to make her feel better I was spending money we didn’t have on stupid crap she didn’t want. If I tried giving her foot massages or back rubs my hands were sweaty and disgusting and it made her want to vomit. 

Because of all this, she had absolutely zero sex drive. My wife has never had an orgasm. She was a virgin when we got married. She refuses to go to therapy about it, but that’s her choice. In her mind she just can’t, so no real point in trying. We had sex twice between when she found out she was pregnant and had the baby, then none for about 6 months after that. The two times we did it was miserable. She just laid there, silent and still, then got mad at me for saying we had to have sex and then not doing it. She had no desire for physical closeness or intimacy with me even of non sexual nature - no holding hands, no cuddling, no kisses even on the cheek. All of it was annoying to her.

Even after the baby was about 3 months old, she didn’t want to start having sex again. In her words at that time, she would rather have a loving roommate than a sexual partner. I feel she maybe had PPD, but she never went to a doctor about it. 

Flash forward a few months, and we had another talk about the lack of intimacy. She actually asked if maybe we should just get a divorce. I shut that down. She mentioned maybe I should get a friend with benefits but that’s not what I want. 

Several books, retreats, sessions and many months later her willingness to participate in sex is back, and she seems to genuinely enjoy it. Her body had returned to normal as well now that she is not breastfeeding, and she is back on her birth control which manages her horrible cycle, which I know helps. 

She told me she wants to have another baby. I told her no, and she insisted to know why. I finally told her it’s because I think our marriage can’t survive another pregnancy. She got very angry, for several reasons: 1) she feels as though I am blaming her for how hard her pregnancies are 2) she feels I am saying that me not having sex for a few months is somehow worse than all the crap she suffers through and finally 3) she feels I am an asshole if I think our marriage can’t survive a year without regular sex. To her, that places too high of a priority on it, and it shows a superficial requirement to our relationship. In her eyes, if I feel that way I very well might not think our marriage could survive if she got obese, got old, got horribly injured, etc."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c4ih5l	2019-06-24 04:57:32		AITA for not telling my family I got 15k bucks?	"Long story short, my mom died a year ago and I got 15k bucks from her life insurance. Also got a car inherited from her.


I'm currently living with both of her brothers who never had any children and are constantly fighting with each other because happily dysfunctional family. The ""least bad"" of them knows about the money because he helped me make the paperwork since I can't go alone to places because of extreme anxiety, and I was living in his house until he started to want to charge me for things because we got mad at each other. So I moved down which is everyone's property because it says so in my grandpa's will, and my psychopathic uncle also lives there but he doesn't know about the money. He drives me to university every day (no summers) and nothing more, in my car, and then he uses it for his purposes because his truck uses up too much gas. That's fine to me as long as he takes me to school and feeds me for free in the family's business which is a restaurant/hotel. Now, the family business is broke, this uncle only gets the bare minimum from it to maintain it because the property is so big and old, so money is actually scarce but we don't starve to death. This uncle is super manipulative, a legit psychopath with so many problems with his father and is obsessed with his own ""justice"", so if he finds out or I told him my #1 fear is that he will get mad (he gets really crazy when pissed off) and/or will want to borrow money and/or will charge me for stuff. 


I know they do NOT have any responsibility of feeding me for free and taking me to school because I'm not their kid and I'm already of age, but I still feel like they should do that for me until I can get my degree. Once I have a job I feel like I would financially help them if they asked me, but for now I want to save that money for when I go job hunting or maybe exchange programs while in uni. Also I sometimes pay for gas and snacks from money that I get monthly from my grandpa's inheritance's rents, which is not much (about 150-200 bucks per month since it's divided between 5 people.) Also note that they have NOT PAID A CENT for my car's maintenance, I'm paying it all myself despite them using it how they want (I don't even drive), and it required expensive reparations this month, over 700 bucks I will get discounted every month from the rent money and I feel they are being unfair with this. And also I have paid my (cheap because third world) university fees myself and everything, they literally have not paid anything for me besides food, Internet and electricity.


So AITA for wanting to keep the 15k a secret from my psychopath uncle and refusing to let my ""least bad"" uncle charge me for stuff*?

My SO didn't have the best childhood. Growing up with a narcissistic mother really messed her up in a lot of ways, including major trust issues. She's told me many times that I'm the first person she's ever really trusted, and she's confided in me a lot of very personal things.
I love her to death, but she does this thing that makes me really nervous. I have problems with anxiety, and my brain never wastes an opportunity to go wild with apocalyptic scenarios, and she knows this about me. So you can imagine I really dislike when she tells me something is wrong, and then says she doesn't want to get into it when I ask what's wrong.
Today I told her ""if it's nothing, don't make it sound big. And if it's something that can't be discussed just leave me in the dark, that's all I ask. I know I can't help with everything, and I know you don't want me to worry so much about you, so I don't want to over worry myself over something I can't know about or do anything about.""

I would suggest going to X, 60% of the time she’ll say, “why don’t you go by yourself if you wanna do X”. Me every time, “I suggest X because I want to spend time with you”. She’ll say, “I highly respect a person’s individuality to do what they want. If you want to do sometime I don’t, you go without me”. She also value her personal time. This means it’s normal for her to go for a walk and leave me alone for 30mins-1hr.

2yrs ago, she invited me to spend a week with her and her parents for her bday. During, she didn’t want to show intimacy when her parents were around or not. She would shrug me off whenever I went in to kiss or hold hands. On her bday, she told everyone she’s going for a walk. I asked if I could go with, she said “no, I wanna go alone”. She’s gone for 4-5hrs and I was alone with her parents. She comes back, had dinner, we went on a walk and fought. I told her I was mad because she invited me to this and just left me with her parents and shrugging me off whenever I wanted any intimacy. I thought the point of inviting me was to hangout on her bday. She said “I told you I was going on a walk, I think you're over reacting”. Long story short, the important part was we fought on her bday. 

Recently, it’s her bday. I planned a vaca for us, allow her personal time, all is great. On her bday, before dinner, over drinks, we talked about the next day. I suggested X and she goes “if you wanna do X, you should go by yourself”. I said “it really pisses me off when you say that”. She immediately, “I can’t believe you’re pulling this again on my bday”. I said “I can’t believe you’re bringing that up from 2yrs ago, I knew you held a grudge”. She said “I don’t wanna do this in public”. I downed my drink and said, “I’m going for a walk” and walked out. After about 2-3 mins, I calmed down, went back inside, and she was gone. I called her till she picked up. I asked her to come back and talk, I only walked away to clear my mind. She tells me, she left because I just got up and left, she doesn’t wanna have dinner anymore, it’s awkward after someone just up and leave, she can’t go to the restaurant and have dinner like nothing happened” (the bar and the restaurant is not the same place). I told her, I was mad because it really hurts my feelings when she tells me to do things by myself when it’s the whole point is to spend time together. Her bringing up 2yrs ago, I felt like she has a grudge about it. I was trying to explain why I was mad, to get her to come back, so I can make amends. She goes “well it’s a huge coincidence that you’re pulling this again in my bday, I need alone time right now”. I said, “it’s fine, take your”, we hung up. 

A lot happened after that. I don’t want to get into the details on what happened next, it’s drama I don’t feel like sharing right now. I hope ya’ll can understand.

So this happened over the spring semester, been a while now, but I hadn’t discovered this sub at that time or I would have posted it then.

Anyway, I’m at a restaurant late at night with friends after a night of drinking. Eventually, I have to pee. So of course I go over to the bathrooms. 

There are a couple girls waiting in line for the women’s bathroom and there was a guy there talking to one of them. I ask the guy if he was waiting for the men’s restroom and he says no go ahead, so I check it out and it’s open when a girl in the line said she was waiting for the bathroom first. I say this is the men’s bathroom and go in and she starts trying to fight back and tries to push the door open... I force it shut and get it locked.

Once I go out I say “go ahead” and she starts saying how I need to be more respectful... I was a little drunk so I started asking her if she identifies as a man... I mean in the situation it would have made a difference, but she never did agree and just kept telling me I should be more respectful. Thing is, the bathroom was wide open the whole time and no one went in it. Plus I had to go pretty bad.

To me it’s just annoying that she felt so entitled to the men’s bathroom. I get it, the women’s takes longer sometimes but like, deal with it? Life’s not fair.

c4ig4a	2019-06-24 04:54:22	ThrowawayCouchSleep	WIBTA cutting my mom out of my life for wanting me to sleep on a couch?	"So a little backstory before the couch issue.

When I was 10 my dad had a heart attack and triple bypass surgery. My parents fought often, and about a month after the surgery, my mom decided she wouldn't help take care of him anymore. So I started helping him. About 4 months after that she left on Christmas Eve and filed for divorce. My uncle and my aunt then moved in to help my dad.

15 years later my dad passed away from a heart attack. He had no life insurance and no will, but due to a foreclosure sale there was $27,000 in his name shortly after his death. Because of his death there was two people who could claim it. My uncle and my mother. 

My uncle, had been financially supporting my disabled father, their disabled sister, and myself (until I was 18). Because of this I thought he should get it. My uncle thought it should go to me, since I was my father's only child. My mother called me when she found out and wanted to talk about splitting it, telling me my dad owed her $20,000 due to unpaid alimony. And at another point on the phone said it was actually $40,000.  My uncle said the decision was up to me on what to do. So I told my mom I didn't want to fight over it, despite thinking she deserved nothing, and I said she could have $20,000 she claimed was owed of the $27,000. 

Three years later we have an upcoming family trip to Europe, and my mom volunteered to pay for a week of the family's stay. However one of the places she booked only has enough bedrooms for everyone but me. She left me a voicemail asking if I’d be okay with sleeping on a couch, and said on the voicemail she thinks I’d be okay with it because she is paying. I called her back and asked her why we didn’t get enough bedrooms. She said we needed a place with A/C, good reviews, a view, and under $200. Being 6’3” 300lbs, I told her I wouldn’t be okay with a couch and I would find possible alternatives and send her those. I found some with everything but the view, and sent them the next day. A month and a half later, she hasn’t gotten back to me and conveyed to my sister I’m being a choosing beggar because she’s the one paying.  

So I told my mom today that I’m just going to pay for my own place, I don’t need her to pay for me, it’s clear she doesn’t care about my comfort, and thinks I'm being an asshole. I’m also considering after the trip cutting off contact with my mom.  In my opinion she has been always been very self centered especially since my dad died, and I don't want to deal with her anymore.

Hello, throw away because you know. Title is more than it seems please read. 

So a while back I went on a long road trip across the country to see a friend of mine. I was really worried about having enough cash to get there because I had never been on such a long trip by myself and I didn't know what to expect especially because a big chunk of the drive was in the desert. 

Anyway, my BF at the time gave me a few hundred dollars just Incase with the intention is just pay him back when I could. No set dates ect. Pretty standard relationship stuff.

Anyway, I go on this trip and some stuff comes up and I ended up staying longer than intended and used this extra cash to stay in a hotel, fix a car issue, and fill my radiator which had leaked. A few days before I headed back home he dumps me unexpectedly. Barely gives me a reason other than he saw a video of me hanging out with people and got jealous because I was around a couple of really attractive guys including the friend I went to see.  (They were models but I had known them for a while and so we were taking photos for Instagram and generally having a good time in a public space.) 

Anyway. I go through the whole ""I got dumped"" depression phase. I cried. We didn't talk for a while and I felt pretty betrayed considering I was very serious about our relationship. I wanted to marry this one. 

So a week passes, I'm back home and my now ex messages me and says he'd be interested in continuing a sexual realtionship but not a romantic one. I being an idiot agreed and after it happened I decided it wasn't for me. I couldn't handle the emotional distress and I told him not to contact me again. I was completely civil but apparently he didn't like my response. He was short with me and before leaving told me that I needed to pay him.

We haven't spoken since. And I'm now in the position where I don't think I really want to pay him even if I could. I was homeless for a few months and it's been hard to get back into my feet. I'm currently trying really hard to get on state disability because of my mental health problems including autism. 

WIBTA if I just decided not to repay him? I don't talk to contact him ever again and am happy he's out of my life. I want to move forward with my own life and I know he's pretty well off and not aching for it financially. It's more of a spite thing I think for him because I refused to please him. Am I reading into this wrong?

Edit: for the record this did happen years ago and I never heard back from him. I just think about occasionally because I have a lot of debt I'm trying to fix but never really am able to crawl out."	Asshole	0	0

He seemed normal and all, but when I went back for the next year of school, something clicked in my head that he was not that great of a person to be around. For the sake of simplicity, I will call him, Ajit. 

When we where in elementry school we were good friends. But When we got the middle school Ajit started to get really toxic and not enjoyable to be around. He would try to drag me away from friends, that I knew for a longer time, to only hang out with him. When I would not talk with him, because I was trying to talk with other people, he started to fake being sad for attention. Ajit did this with more than just me. By the end of middle school really no one wanted to talk to him because of how distructive he was to others friendships.

c4id9m	2019-06-24 04:45:40		AITA for trying to move a nerd girl away from the mean girls crowd in my classroom?	"Background - I'm a teacher. In my class, there are many different groups. Cool kids, nerds etc. There's a group of ""cool girls"" in my high school class - pretty but the girls you see on ""Mean girls""

&#x200B;

One girl is kind of dorky looking and tries to keep getting ""in"" with these ""cool"" girls. However, it's very clear that the cool girls want nothing to do with the dorky girl and often ignore her or try to shut her out. They aren't overtly mean but it's obvious enough to anyone paying attention.

&#x200B;

Recently, I've been trying to move her away from the cool girls group into the nerdy girls group, which would better fit her. However, she gets annoyed whenever I make groups and put her with the ""uncool"" kids. I think she thinks she is too good for them but the uncool kids are much more welcoming. She's better suited to this group but resents me from moving her away from the cool girls group.

He seemed normal and all, but when I went back for the next year of school, something clicked in my head that he was not that great of a person to be around. For the sake of simplicity, I will call him, Ajit. 

When we where in elementry school we were good friends. But When we got the middle school Ajit started to get really toxic and not enjoyable to be around. He would try to drag me away from friends, that I knew for a longer time, to only hang out with him. When I would not talk with him, because I was trying to talk with other people, he started to fake being sad for attention. Ajit did this with more than just me. By the end of middle school really no one wanted to talk to him because of how distructive he was to others friendships.

We get along exceptionally well, she's funny, bright and extremely pretty as well. My first impression was that we had a perfect understanding when it comes to values and what we expect out of life, down to tiny details. We were both pretty hyped about it and the mutual sympathy was quite obvious. Also, we both are looking for something long-term and serious right now.

Thing is, she suddenly told me that she's a burlesque dancer. I know myself and my values. I know that I would mind that my partner reveals herself in suggestive ways in front of other men. So I suppressed all my excitement and told her that sadly, while I don't judge her at all, I know myself and this isn't something that I would be OK with. It just doesn't allign with how I feel about intimacy in a partnership and it would make me sad.

Personally, I expected her to be OK with this, since she made a conscious choice about her life. To own it more, perhaps. But instead, she started telling me about how tough it is for her to find a partner, how she liked me, etc. How burlesque is really ""just an art form"" and how it's not at all as striptease and other stuff. Which left me feeling kinda bad and doubtful for turning her down.

I started wondering whether I was just being superficial or insecure. I kinda have this insecurity about maybe being insecure. But regardless, even though everything else seemed to fit perfectly, I chose my own current feelings as my #1 priority and made it clear that I will not pursue anything further with her.

Yet still, this feeling lingers... am I an asshole?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c4i85a	2019-06-24 04:30:04	Bellybuttonlint_	WIBTAH if I asked my friend to pay me back after her grandfather died?	"Edit: thank you all for your replies, I texted her offering my condolences for her grandfather and left it at that. We’ll probably end up just doubling up next time I do her nails


Context: I do my friend’s nails once in a while. At a salon my services would cost about $40-$70, but since I am not a professional and nails are just a hobby, I’m fine with doing them for my friend in exchange for ~$20 worth of edibles. This has worked great for us since I don’t have a good way to get edibles myself, and she gets a good deal on her nails.

A week ago, my friend, came over to get her nails done. We had arranged it the night before with the usual, “I’ll do your nails, you bring me edibles.” When she came, I did her nails, she was happy with them, and then at the end she tells me, “By the way, I couldn’t get the edibles today but I’ll get them to you soon. Don’t let me forget, sorry!” 

No problem. I text her two days later and ask if she has the edibles. She reads the text and doesn’t respond. So at this point I’m a bit annoyed, but I assume she’ll text me back within a few hours when she has the time. She doesn’t. I wait another few days and hear nothing from her. 

Then I find out that her grandfather in another state passed away and she’s flying out for 3 days with her parents to go to his funeral. Now, I have no idea what her relationship with her grandfather was like. I don’t think she saw him more than a few times a year, but I do not know if they were close or not. Regardless, a death in the family is very sad and I want to be respectful of her and what she needs.

So my question is, should I text her again now that she’s back in our state and ask her to follow through with our agreement? It’s been more than a week now since I did her nails and she has said nothing to me indicating that she plans on holding up her end of the deal. If she were to say something like, “I’m grieving now and need a few weeks, can I get them to you by X date?” I would be completely fine with that. If I do remind her of our deal I will of course be very kind and understanding. She may have genuinely just forgot. So, if I texted her about this now, WIBTAH?"	No A-holes here	0	0

Well it was 11:15. We close at 11. I turned on the music to the same volume it had been all night and started stacking chairs. The two customers still in the store left shortly after. The manager proceeded to lecture me on how I cant be doin that bc it tells the customer we want them to leave. Notice I work in fast food and do this same thing every time i close and ALWAYS have the managers permission.  He actually gave me permission to close at 10:40 but we got a small rush of people and I got busy. When it cleared it was passed closing so I started the closing routine. After continuously lecturing me and I'm just sitting there waiting for hin to stfu I say ok whatever. But he keeps going and eventually I go ok I dont care enough about this  and he starts YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS ABOUT HOW WHY AM I FUCKING WORKING THERE and ""THIS IS MY FUCKING JOB AND I DUXKING CARE""  so I keep saying dont yell at me calmly and he keeps yelling at me  and when hes done I go boss? He goes nah I'm done talking to you so I go I'm officially giving my two weeks notice and he says I dont care and then we dont talk for the rest of closing. If he didnt have my tips I would have left that minute.

So I have a friend and I honestly really do care about her. She was someone that I could talk to about anything and vice versa. We would communicate quite often (long distance because we live in different cities).

When she got a boyfriend she kinda just dropped off the face of the earth and I never heard from her again. That is until they broke up and she came to talk to me about it. I was more than happy to do so. I talked with her throughout the nights where she cried and I even took a train ride to go meet her to cheer her up. 
(Sidenote - something that I get wasn't her fault, was that she told me she had plans later that day and wouldn't have a lot of time for me - I completely understood but still wanted to meet her to make sure she was okay, so I met with her for an hour then took a train back home). 

Fast forward around a year later and she has herself a new boyfriend and again doesn't contact me aside from the snapchat streaks she sends to everyone. Recently I tried talking to her saying that I'm going through a though time and I could really use someone to talk to. I got a rather short text asking if I was okay and that was all. It kinda feels like she just doesn't care about me all that much. I feel really awful about this but I'm thinking about just abruptly ghosting her and just deleting her from my social media because it's just not good for my mental health.

Along with the  family, my SIL usually has some of her friends over.   This year she is wanting to include one of my wife’s ex BFs.   To her credit, she went out of her way to ask if I would be comfortable with him being there.   My wife was open and honest (which I greatly appreciate).  

We have been happily married 8 years, and this ex has been in the rear view for much longer than that.    Apparently he has been married for some time as well. 

I know that the adult move here is to accept the situation and deal with the discomfort.     But I am being asked directly for permission,  and I would be much more comfortable if I didn’t have to deal with this,  especially with my daughter present and on a holiday.

Skip to today and I'm away celebrating my birthday, come back to my phone w missed calls and shitty texts.

Now at this point i think a lot of people would've apologised, however after the email confirming my other boss received the email of the dates I could not do I hadn't received any further emails from my work, including any updated rota or texts saying I had to work today from anyone.

Recently me(M15), my little cousin S (F13) and my older cousin R (M19) were hanging out and S pulled up a pic of some girl at school and showed R and asked if he thinks she's cute. R said yeah and she then told him she's 13. He was immediately weirded out and said never mind. Right after, we decided to give him a hard time so, S and I started calling him a creep (as joke. We used a different name to call him). He got real defensive and said for us not to call him that, even though we made it clear it was a joke. 

Fast forward to a few days later, we're (me, S and R) at R's sisters house for dinner and to stay the night. S began to mention how weird R (S and I told the whole story) is and started calling him a creep. I joined in since it was obvious she was joking.

I needed to ask a question to my brother so I just walk in and she scrambled to cover up and my brother starts asking me why tf I didn’t knock. Well here’s the thing, in my opinion it’s not my responsibility to ask if I can come in to a room its THEIR responsibility to lock the door if you don’t want someone in. So because of that I chose to never knock and walk in anyway. If it is unlocked that means I’m welcome and if it’s not I’m not and will walk away. It’s faster that way instead of waiting for an answer. My brother said my reason are dumb and that It’s always polite to knock and it’s not even hard but none of this is my fault.

The story is simple. Me and X girl were friends for years. I helped her study everytime she needed help (that means at the end of every semester) and I even studied things myself before teaching her since we did not always have the same subjects. Our friendship went to shit, however, after we shared a bed together during a trip and she decided to grope me and feel me up in my sleep. I woke up to it and had to push her hand away twice and turn around before she gave up. I could barely sleep but the next day I wanted to pretend nothing serious happened and that was it. I tried bringing up the topic later but she felt that saying sorry while smiling and staring at the floor was enough of an apology and I could never accept that. We parted ways.


The story got out. Most people sided with her because I did not have a good reputation in school. She was shielded from any possible consequence. I filed a police report, but since she was a minor and we are both girls, no one took it seriously and she and her parents were never called or asked about it. I always felt she got away with making me feel like shit and she managed to live happily ever after since she found a girlfriend and etc.


My boyfriend found out that our principal is still trying to get her her national diploma (our school gives both a national and an American diploma, but since she is staying in town, she would probably need the national one) because of her poor performance as a student. The principal knows I got late to class once because of filing a police report and that I felt uncomfortable at school because of having to see her and my peers every day.
