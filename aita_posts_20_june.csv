c35r0g	2019-06-21 03:53:04	OliveIsCute	AITA for coming to my ex-lovers husband's party to see my child - and not telling him we were together (or the child is mine)?	"I began seeing my (ex?) girlfriend 2 years ago while she had thought her husband was dead. He had been gone 5 years when we began seeing each other - and we had a baby boy just 6 months ago. Everything was going swimmingly...

The husband returned after 7 years of no contact from a warzone. My ex had told him that her daughter (14 years old) was the mother of the child - and requested I no longer see her ever again. I tried multiple times over the past month to convince her to tell him the truth while I stay at my families home out of respect.

I couldn't take it any longer, and decided to attend the party her husband threw yesterday for his mee business venture. I brought food (kind of saving the party) spoke to him and my ex. One of our drunk mutual friends really flipped her shit about the situation while I was still trying to give my ex space while waiting to tell her husband. Turned into a huge issue and I ended up leaving promptly.

I know showing up was shitty, but I wanted to see my ex and child - and I dont know how much longer I can wait for her to bring it up to him...

TLDR: Had child with woman with missing husband. He returned and she told him the child was her daughters. I showed up to his business party and all hell broke loose."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c35qlm	2019-06-21 03:51:45	account47382847281	AITA for bringing a cat to a friend’s house?	"Okay, let me explain the title. Please bear with details and confusing explanation. My SO and I were invited to a mutual friend’s birthday party. They are more my SOs close friend than mine, but we do get along well. Before we were invited, I had scheduled for one of my cats to have a major surgery. Both of my cats lived with my family about 6+  hours away due to not being able to keep them at college in my current apartment. I signed a lease there before my cats existed. A lot was going on at this time. My grandpa was dying of dementia, an uncle (son of grandpa) was going through chemo, and my parents were caught in the middle of it all. I was driving every weekend to visit everyone and help as much as I could. Now, friend lives on the way. Plan was to visit family as typical and stop for friend’s birthday. Drive back late or stay the night. The same day that my cat had major surgery my grandpa was rushed to the hospital unresponsive. Major surgery required someone to monitor cat more than usual. I worked it out so that I could bring cat to live with me for the week to recuperate since everyone didn’t have time to motivate to cat (understandable) and I had to go back to work or be fired the following week despite grandpa’s condition. SO still wants to stop by party but is hesitant because cat. We reach out and explain details. I offer to not go or sit outside with cat because friend’s mom is upset about cat. Friend eventually says he talked to his mom and it was fine. 

I found out years ago that she actually said I was “the worst friend she’d ever heard” and “she’d never met someone so rude”. Even when I got there, I thanked her for her generosity and kindness during such a rough time for me (obviously not being there full time during my grandpa dying) and asked once again if I should sit outside or just pop in for a few minutes and then head home.  It was on short notice, but I tried to accommodate in every way possible. 

This recently came up again and I’m wondering if I really am the asshole here? 

TL;DR - Asked if I could bring my cat to friend’s house for a few hours in cat carrier due to family emergencies. Allowed to bring. Then shit all over by mom."	Not the A-hole	0	0

His brother + other family members are at his bedside. They are guarding visitation and information kind of closely. I visited my friend once and have inquired almost daily about seeing him since then. I keep getting really nebulous responses. 

 I _know_ how hard it must be for them and that's why I haven't said anything, but I am _so frustrated_ because I feel like, if he's gonna die, I want to see him NOW.

 I keep having to text the brother for info and feeling like a pushy jerk every time I do.

I want to say also that my friend and I are pretty close, and I don't think his brother is 'keeping me out' because he thinks negatively of me, or any drama like that. I think it's more that the brother is being very tight with information because that's how he deals with things. But it's hurting me. This is my good pal whom I have known for almost twenty years. I want to see him and not be shut out of this. 

WIBTA if I said as much to the brother? Diplomatically? 
Or should I just back off?

ETA: I am going to call the brother tomorrow and apologize for being pushy. He (the brother) is a good guy and I'll just let him know that I'm here for them.  Hopefully I can see my friend soon.

Edit Two: Ha I am not going to call his brother. I will just try to wait and be helpful when the family needs me.

We all went around the room stating we agreed to this, etc.

Well my name was drawn. Now it wasn't abstract anymore and I panicked and got cold feet. Everyone else started insisting it wouldn't be fair and we all agreed, I almost left. I offered to pay for all the pizzas in the entirety but they insisted otherwise. In the end I ""compromised"", I answered the door and paid for the pizzas in my bra and panties.

While we were there I bought several keychains for a friend of mine who collects them. My father went home early from the trip, somehow ended up with some of my keychains, and gave one of them away to his girlfriend’s daughter as a souvenir. I went to his house before going back home in order to drop off my little brother, and saw that he had my keychains on his counter, along with a set of keys which had one of the keychains on it. I grabbed my keychains, including the one on the set of keys. Apparently they were his girlfriend’s daughter’s keys, and he had somehow thought the keychain was his to give away to her. Now my dad and his girlfriend are furious at me for stealing “her” keychain.

c35owy	2019-06-21 03:46:30		AITA for being put off by my friend saying she “wants a girlfriend next”?	"Hello everyone!
I apologize in advance for any spelling/grammatical/formatting errors. Here is my situation:

My best friend and I have known each other for many years, and in this time she’s gone though numerous relationships, all of them with men. About 3 years ago, she told me she identified as pansexual (being sexually attracted to people regardless of gender), but since then she has told me that she thinks she might just be heterosexual. We have talked about women before, and I know she finds women physically attractive, but she’s never shown any interest in or intention of being in a relationship with another woman. 

She broke up badly with her previous boyfriend about three months ago, and she recently began dating her new boyfriend. However, in that three-month time between relationships, she started saying things like, “I want a girlfriend next!” and “I’m getting a girlfriend next!” Even now, during her current relationship, I’ve heard her tell her boyfriend (jokingly, of course) “You ruined my plan to get a girlfriend!”

I understand that a person’s sexuality is theirs to explore and discover, but for some reason every time she says this a red flag goes up in my head and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. From my point of view (I’m in a same-sex relationship with another woman), it sounds very objectifying, like she’s planning out a grocery list. I haven’t said anything to her about it yet.

Her relationships are up to her, but I still die a little inside whenever she says it. AITA for feeling this way?"	Asshole	1	0

We aren’t quite far enough into the relationship where she would recognize my brand, and honestly this was way worse than my usual. She gives a look around the table asking who farted, and I slyly tried to blame it on the family dog. My girlfriends mother immediately corrected me, saying she knew what the dog farts smelled like, and this was way worse than anything she’d ever smelled from him. Just as I’m beginning to blush, GFs Dad chimes in and takes credit for it. Laughing, he saying he had sushi for lunch and it wasn’t sitting well with him.

On Tuesday, my little 6 month old boy threw up pretty violently about 4 times within an hour. My wife and mother in-law took him to the doctors office to see what was wrong with him. They recommend an X-ray and went to get one at the hospital. I wasn’t able to go because I was stuck at work. After work I went straight up to my in-laws and we all waited for the results of the X-ray. We got the call and they recommend going to an ER. As a family, we decided to watch him thru the night and see if he improved at all. He did and we decide to just take him back to the doctors the next day to get his opinion not just the opinion of the nurse. 
    I work up the next day and went to work and apparently that was the wrong move. My wife is now livid with me because I didn’t take the day of to go with them to the doctors even though he was doing fine. At the 2nd appointment, the doctor said we did the right thing by not going to the ER and that he just had a small stomach bug and my boy was already getting better. 
    I had to go into work. Things have been a dumpster fire at my job and I’m trying not to risk anything especially cause I’m currently the only one working.

c35mfg	2019-06-21 03:39:02		AITA for thinking I’m helping	"A couple of months ago my boyfriends ex wife notified him that she would like to move their kids to another state. He obviously wanted to fight this and keep them close. He started calling lawyers to get quotes on how much it would cost and found it could be anywhere from 6k to 10k. He asked me to help him pay it and I told him I couldn’t because I’m currently paying my way through school . He got upset and asked why I couldn’t give him money from savings, to which I replied we have no shared savings for me to give. He pays me less than half of our monthly expenses every month and asked why I was not putting that towards savings to which I explained that went towards paying his portion of the bills. 

The problem is I make a lot more money than him, maybe double, so it felt like there was an expectation that I’d be able to help. I do have a personal savings account with money but only me and my parents contribute to it. My parents do not want me to use any of that money for this situation, and I completely understand their reasoning because that is their money too and they are not responsible for this. 

We fought about it and I started trying to figure out a way I could help him. I came to the conclusion that I would cover his portion of our bills and he could put the $500 he pays me every month towards lawyer fees. At first he told me no but came around and realized how much that would help him. 

Fast forward to now and the relocation has been denied. They are going through the process of determining how much child support he should be paying and potentially giving him more custody time. A part of determining child support is finding out both parties expenses. He asked me to help him fill out the paperwork and I agreed but when it came to the section where it has you list other members in your household and how much they contribute, things got a bit heated. He normally pays $500 and I’m glad to put that down because that’s what he’ll pay me again once this is all done. I pay around $1000 every month. He is sounding like he wants to put more down than what he actually pays and I find that dishonest. 

This is the part that I’m really questioning myself on. We fought about it and he threw out that only his family is helping him with lawyer fees. I then asked if he didn’t see me covering his portion of the bills as helping and he said no because the money that he would normally pay me is going to paying back his mom for the money she paid the lawyer. 

I do feel like I’m helping in someway. Maybe not directly. Ultimately, I would just like it to stop being mentioned that only his family is helping because I feel like I am contributing in someway too. When it is mentioned, I feel like it is being thrown in my face.

I don’t really understand this rational because there’s a reason why minors aren’t supposed to drink in the first place? 
Anyways one of my really good friends threw this Halloween party and she invited a lot of her old private schools friends. They brought beer and vodka plus most people started drinking while her mom was upstairs the whole time. I was very, very uncomfortable and was kinda vocal about not being comfortable. My other friend then told me ‘oh you’re making good friend upset because you’re upset this is her party’ and I was like okay yeah I’m upset idc if I’m making her upset. So I did end up leaving with said friend and another friend and i cried and had a panic attack at Starbucks (sad ik).
 I know I can’t stop her and it’s her life but it just worries me. Last night she went to a party and got drunk there too. I come from a family of alcoholics and have had some family members die due to illnesses that were caused by their addiction. I just don’t want that for any of my friends.

At the end of the day I tell her that I'm going to leave around 7:30 because my dad wanted me home soon and before darkness. She got upset because apparently i was leaving soon even though i was there for 6 hours. So i planned on leaving at 8:00. Around 7:45 our other friends were packing to leave and I reminded her that I'm going to leave soon too. She snapped at me for not staying with her until the library closed and accused me of not wanting to hang out with her. I explained again that going home an hour earlier is not going to change anything but the tone she was arguing with me was so rude that I got really mad and stormed out.

Our friend followed me and asked me to come back to talk it out. We sat down to see why she was so mad at me for leaving to go home based on my curfew. She told me that she feels like I don't want to hang out with her and I am there only because our friend begged me to come. I told her I'm leaving because my dad wants me home and I DEFINITELY didn't come because of our other friends but for her. She continued on saying that when I leave I never give her reasons and most of the times it's an ""idc i want to go home"" situation. I told her again that I'm going home because MY DAD TOLD ME TO and I was already stayed there for so long. At this moment, she was literally yelling at me, telling me how her other friends always stay with her and I never do because I am a shitty friend, and how she always done so many things for me but I never have. 

Then the argument escalated to ""me being a bad friend"". As I kept reminding her I'm going home because my dad wants me to for the 10th time, she told me I don't know how to be a good friend because my x, y, and z friend have always treated me badly and the fact that I'm only friends with her because she the only good friend I have. At this point, I was completely silent because she was ridiculing me such a way I was not even able to process it. She basically discredited me for checking up on her when her friends betrayed her, helped her with so many things and driving her to her job and home. I told her that she hurt me by saying that I don't have any friends and I'm a bad friend.

On top of all this bs I had to listen to her say, she was yelling at me, aggressively interrupting me when I was talking, and crying because apparently I am a bad friend for meeting my curfew.

I told her that all the things she told me hurt me a lot and I don't want to talk to her anymore.

My parents said I’d grow out of it but I’m now a teenager and I haven’t. I am overly paranoid of germs on my bed. I won’t sit on my bed after going outside. I have designated clothes that I only wear in my bed and no where else. I will not put any object that has been outside on my bed- computer, books, sketchbook etc. I clean my feet before getting into bed. I wash my sheets and comforter twice a week (sometimes more). I won’t let any pets on my bed. And I will not, under any circumstances, let another person sit or even touch my bed. 

This bugs my family. They constantly do things that makes me upset. They pretend to touch or sit on my bed. They once placed dirty SHOES on my bed. They laughed as I cried and hastily pulled of the sheets to go and wash them. They said I was overreacting and didn’t understand why I’m so upset even thought I made it clear to them many times that I don’t want people and etc on my bed. Well today we got into a fight. One of my siblings pulled their shitty antics again and I snapped. I told them to please stop and explained that it upset me. They got PISSED. They began to say that I’m a hypocrite because they let me sit on their beds. I’m not good with conflict at all. To be honest, I’m very emotionally sensitive and cry when people yell or scold me. (Thanks fucked yo brain :)) Thus, through tears, I said that I always ask before sitting and they gave me permission. They raised their voice and claimed that I need to get over myself and stop being a childish little asshole for not allowing them to do the same and stormed off. I just cried in my bed until dinner.

Disclaimer: I love my mom so please, I don't want to here you saying that she is a bad person, this is just one problem that I have with her. I was downloading a game on my computer and we have internet tv so it relys on our internet. She complained and when she figured out ( this was like 9:45 pm so I was about to go to bed) she was not to happy so I turned of the download. She doesn't pay the internet and electricity bill so I don't think she is in the position to decide who downloads what and when. I like to download large things during the night to be as courteous as possible.ps I'm not 100% on my claim and that she doesn't pay the bills but my dad has the higher paying job so that is my assumption.

She addressed these concerns to me when she was in fifth grade about her unibrow and lady mustache which I happily shave off throughout the year using those dollar microblades, but now she had asked me to teach her how to shave her legs and arms like I do. 

Truth is I have no problem teaching her how to shave as she told me other kids have made fun of her for her excessive body hair and it kinda hit a nerve as I was often teased for it too at her age. The problem is that my parents wont allow her to start shaving until 7th grade. But mine and my sister's argument is that is a completely new school and she wants to start it off on a new foot feeling more confident in herself and having more control of her body. So wibta if I teach my sister how to shave to build her confidence?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

She recently told me that should was gonna quit talking to him because she wouldn’t be alright if the tables were turned (I was a little happy about this). I found out today that she doesn’t talk to him but she still has him on all social media and that he messages her occasionally. I wouldn’t care about all that, but she frequently brings him up and how she feels bad because he seems depressed that she doesn’t talk to him regularly now and whatnot (I’m pretty sick of hearing about it).

c35cht	2019-06-21 03:09:59	ThrowMeAwayBCLife	AITA for asking my 34 week pregnant sister about my parents advance care directive and will?	"I work in aged care and so does mum.

I began asking my sister about 17 months ago about what she would like to be part of. (Power of Attorney, Guardianship care etc) She replied ""You don't need to think about it at all yet, they are fine. They are alive it is all good."" and completely disregarding the point of view.

I've constantly been asking about it since. She's replied ""I don't want to talk about it.""

It came down to today where I have finished talking to mum and dad and have a map out of who would get what and hope to split it evenly after the person who has had injury or passed is financially mapped out (funeral, cost of care etc) and I went to my sisters house to talk to her about it. She was invited to come originally but never did. Mum and dad agreed to sorting things out their wills and everything but want my sister involved as well. Me 24, Sis 20, Mum 57, Dad 61.

The decision so far: Their care if they are unable to make decisions themselves goes to me to ensure they get what they want (Except dad goes to mum first then me.) That the house sister is living in goes to her and the other house will go to me once Mum and Dad are finished with it as Dad (House is in his name) does not want it to go to non-family people. They would only sell the house if the costs of their care is more than what they can afford.

Here's the problem. The house values are drastically different with one house being worth maybe up to $200,000 more than the other. The house Mum and Dad live in are worth more than the house my sister is in.

When I told my sister the current offer, she got angry and frustrated because ""That isn't fair, it is not split down the middle at all."" I've replied. ""I can't split a house into 3/4's to make up your difference because dad doesn't want to sell it and will only sell it if he needs the money for his care"" She's replied that ""I shouldn't talk to her when she is baby brain."" I replied ""I have been trying to talk to you about this for a year and a half, and you've turned away at all possible outcomes.""

She got more upset and began yelling, saying her opinion doesn't matter here and that she wasn't consulted when it was good for her to be talking about it. And that when the house is in her name (As mum and dad intend to pass the lease down to her name) that she should get a payout equivalent to the difference of the other house that mum and dad own as well because that is fair, or at least the difference when the house is sold. Note, dad took out another house on that mortgage as she ran away from home to be with her partner. 

I personally don't want the house, if anything I just want mum and dad to be comfortable and honour their wishes while I am able to know what they are at this moment. I have been wanting sis involved for a while but she doesn't want to think about the mortality of mum and dad.

She then forcefully told me to change the subject.

I'm sorry for any mistakes. I am very upset at the moment.

c35cbm	2019-06-21 03:09:28		AITA for not wanting to be around my best friend when her gf is around?	"Im in a bff group of four. Me, R, S and M. R dates this girl J. J plays favourites and our other friend S is her favourite out of the group to an uncomfortable extent. She always makes comments about how she's ""threesome dating"" R and S and how S is their third girlfriend and gives her weird preference and leaves me and M out.

J doesn't like when experiences are shared with my best friend R without her. A while ago R took molly for the first time with me and we got close over it because of the funny aspects of it. J got so jealous she went into a rage about how molly ruined R's brain and how im a bad influence. R is a regular stoner and I barely smoke but I have a weed pen for special occasions. At pride I let R take a hit and about an hour later she passed out from dehydration (it was a really hot day and she didn't drink water). We went to the hospital and J called her and R's PARENTS and told them it was my weed pen's fault and convinced R that was what made her pass out. The doctor said it was dehydration but she made me feel like shit.

Later on, R had a bruise from passing out so I offered her some arnica (well known homeopathic relief for bruises). J snatched it out of my hand and goes dont take anything she gives you let me look it up. I would never hurt R she's my best friend for 5 years and she has only dated Jill for 1.5 years. My gf even noticed how J was treating me and stood up for me saying that R is a regular smoker and there is no way my weak weed pen made her faint.

During the same weekend we went to a party and S is single so I played wingman and introduced her to a girl she ended up going home with. When we got home J REAMED me out for sending S home with a random stranger and how it was dangerous. Then the next morning when S got home talking about how happy she was, J gushes about the girl she went home with saying how cute she was and how happy she was that S got laid. 

We all also went to a brewery and J asked me where the water was. I pointed towards the water and said btw there's also really good beer! and she goes ""I said water."" Later I joked about killing a bug and she goes ""WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU"". She's so controlling that one of R's other best friends, cassie, and R dont even talk anymore because once they made out during truth or dare and it pissed J off. 

M and I talked and we feel like J is edging us out of the group and wants it to be just her, R and S. R doesn't even seem to notice how badly J is treating me. My gf said she hates J now because of how she is treating me. Am I overreacting? M told me she thinks R might have said something like she finds me attractive or something that made J see me as a threat. The worst part of all of this is that its making me resent R for not noticing how J is treating me. AITA for not wanting to be around my best friend when her girlfriend is around?"		1	0

(He's not turning anything big like 50 or whatever) We already said we were free the day they were planning on having it. They tell us the day and time and we agree but then he says we can come over earlier and that that time is when all of his friends and neighbors are going to come over. We thought it was just going to be our family. (Dad, stepmom, stepsister, older brother, and my family) 

We don't mind his friends or the neighbors it's just that whenever there's a get-together with them around they usually hang out with them more and we are just there to be shown off or whatever. Me and my brother usually just sit by ourselves and chat. 

There are many other reasons why I don't want to go. We are moving next week and still have packing to do. It's a 40 minute drive and our son is only almost 2 so it's a long ride for him, also our car's air conditioner is broken so that'll be fun. Not to mention how he was a pretty terrible father to me and my brother. (I can explain this more if needed) Also he and my stepmom put on a huge wedding for our stepsister earlier this year while they did absolutely nothing for me and my wife when we got married. Also my son is his first grandson and he's only seen him about three times this year.

c357p1	2019-06-21 02:56:11		AITA for telling a woman that her depressing Facebook posts about her dead daughter probably negatively effect her son?	"So my old high school English teacher had a baby about three years ago that had a fatal heart condition. She knew before she even had the baby that it had this condition and would die, yet she chose to have her anyways, and ultimately, after numerous operations and health issues, her baby died at 6 months old. 

I can’t imagine her grief or pain, but I honestly don’t feel that bad for her because this was honestly self inflicted. She had the chance to terminate the pregnancy but chose instead to have this sick, sick little baby that spent the majority of it’s life in the hospital, hooked up to wires, needlessly suffering (because her condition was fatal). 

She runs a Facebook page to raise awareness about the condition her daughter had, and she does some fundraising/awareness things, but 80% of the page is just this dark, depressing, scrapbook of her dead daughter. She has a infant son now and every post she makes about him is comparing him to his dead sister. Literally. When he reaches a milestone, she documents it but instead of it focusing on him, it ultimately ends up talking about his sister and how she did the same thing, but it always overshines what she said about her son. She’s an English teacher, so all her posts are extremely narrated and dramatic as well. 

I understand she probably thinks about these things a lot, and I even understand, to an extent, posting about it, but at this point it’s ridiculous. Every day she has some new depressing post on the page! I know I’m not the only one who feels weird because her posts don’t get many likes or comments of support any more, because it’s like SOOOO depressing and dark...and repetitive.

Anyways, today I saw a new depressing post and I messaged her and said “I hope you’re okay. I’ve noticed your posts are extremely dark and negative, and I just wanted to say that I don’t think it helps the grieving process to constantly be obsessing about it like this. You have an infant son that needs your attention and love and I feel like he’s neglected and negatively effected by you constantly comparing him to his sister and just being negative in general. I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but I just honestly don’t think it’s healthy for him, or you, especially to post on a public awareness page.”

She never responded but the last post she made was deleted. I unfollowed the page as well. AITA?"		1	0
c356zb	2019-06-21 02:54:06	Throwwwwaway_6942069	Aita for making my fiancée cry this evening about her family?	"My (35M) Fiancée (35F) has an emotionally abusive brother. It doesn’t happen often as we live 6 hours away from him. He is an alcoholic and is bi polar. Within the last year he has made her cry twice and made her question her relationship with him. 

A couple months ago while my fiancée was visiting some family out of town he called her and began belittling her and being an asshole. My fiancée called me visibly upset and crying not knowing what to do. Fast forward to today her brother decided to text my fiancée like nothing ever happened and she was excited that he was texting her and that things seemed ok. He didn’t apologize and my fiancée has not set any kind of boundaries or terms with him. She acts as though nothing ever happened.

I told my fiancée that he can’t treat you like that and come back like nothing ever happened. I told her that he is family by blood and that is it. He isn’t treating you like family. He has no respect for you and he shouldn’t be allowed to just come back into your life after these episodes without any repercussions. She got upset with me and told me that her family has been like this her whole life and what else is she supposed to do and it’s the only family she has. I hate seeing her treated that way by her “family” and her forgiving him over and over. 

I’m tired of her being treated like this by her brother and her not putting her foot down. AITA for saying “just because they are blood doesn’t mean they are family.” She said I don’t have to like him or put up with him because it’s not my problem, only hers.

c356o8	2019-06-21 02:53:12	idkwhattoputhere2319	AITA for telling my cousin that I didn't support her wedding	"Background: my family has always been one of those big tight-knit ones that do everything together. My cousin (19F) and I are the same age so we grew up together in matching clothes. The whole deal. We were close. When she was a junior in high school, she dated a senior boy the last two months (her first boyfriend) who was immediately shipped off to the military. Before he left they went on a bunch of trips and did a whirlwind romance because they knew he was leaving and he gave her a promise ring. He came back once that December (her senior year) and then back during summer where he proposed. From there my aunt planned a huge wedding for my cousin and they got married the next time he returned. When she was still 18.
She's now moved across the country (couple months after wedding) to live with her husband.

Now I don't inherently dislike this dude. He seems like a good guy. And I'm a supporter of long distance relationships and making things work if you want to.
BUT. During the entire wedding planning you couldn't even speak to my cousin about concerns about marrying so young to a guy you only dated in person for a couple months (when you were doing a bunch of crazy stuff and not the day to day routine.) She would just get offended and upset and cry (which showed me that she was too immature/young to get married.) Nobody could speak to her about wedding plans. Not even her mom. And again, close family.

And I'm not saying she doesn't love him! But she had to quit school to move with him and doesn't really have a new solid plan and I feel like she put her life (and goals she's had since we were kids) on hold for this guy.

So when she asked what I thought about it all, I said that he seems nice but personally I would've waited a little longer to get married as I would be concerned about what the normal routine and living with him would be like since they've almost exclusively texted. She only just turned 19 and is already married. I only said this since we've always been so close and she asked.

And now she's upset that I'm not supporting her marriage despite me telling her that I obviously wish her the best even if I had personal concerns. I support the relationship. Just would've held off on the wedding bells a little longer.

Of the few coworkers I speak with most often, one is a guy that can sometimes be flirty. 

Over the course of a year and many different conversations, I have gathered that I am “his type” and he has said he would’ve asked me out when we were younger.

Many of these conversations have been sparse and spread out over months, and have taken place with multiple coworkers present. From what I have seen, he talks to other girls the same way he talks to me. Because of this I’ve never felt singled out by him, or that he would try to pursue something more with me.

Recently, he openly shared with me that his marriage is not one based on romantic love, but more of a friendship and they are together for their kid. He said it so matter-of-factly and without much emotion that it seemed like something he’d say to anyone. 

Today, he told me that he wanted to make sure that I wasn’t offended by him; that he doesn’t want to piss off my husband, and he wants to make sure I don’t feel harassed or go to HR. He was overly apologetic and said he didn’t want my husband feeling uncomfortable with our conversations.

I told him I had never thought of our conversations as “over the line” but rather typical banter, so I didn’t feel it necessary to even mention to my husband.

He said that if someone talked to his wife the way he talks to me he would not be happy about that. He would find it inappropriate and wonder why his wife would be OK with someone talking to her the way he talks to me.

It completely threw me for a loop. Now I’m questioning myself as to whether or not my conversations with him are inappropriate, especially considering that he thinks they are.

I plan to talk to my husband so that the guilt I now feel it does not stay with me, but also feel as though it would cause unnecessary concern and doubt in my husband’s mind as to the types of relationships I have with the people that I work with.

If my coworker feels that he is being inappropriate with me, that is on him, right? Am I the asshole for allowing him to flirt with me?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My friend who is pregnant, didnt have a choice in being poly, and still doesnt, (obviously she does but will choose to stick by him because she loves him, we will call her ""S"") S and her boyfriend (He will be W) have been seeing each other ever since high school, they moved out and I guess shit got hard along the way and it went down hill, which leads to the poly decision. 

W (who is 24) is now in a relationship with a 17yo who he found on a sperm donor site. She has no idea he is poly and that he is still seeing S behind the scenes. She thinks W is committed to her. 

S is pregnant now, and although she has tried multiple times to pull herself away, W actually manipulates her to come right back as soon as he is done spending time with his 17yo. S doesnt wanna tell W, shes scared he wont do anything and probably just try to completely block her. But she also wants him to help out because she doesnt have the funds to get the abortion and thinks he should at least help. 

S is also thinking about threatening telling the 17yo so she could get her way. Which is the big part to the story really.

Since we're both tight on cash we didn't exactly exchange insurance info since our rates would go up. Eventually I replaced my tail light, and we both used paint pens to cover the scratches on our cars. He still has a dent in his passenger door, though.

She accepted this and we had a long conversation in which she described some of his behaviors. These included: restriction of talking to friends he disagreed with, refusal to engage in a conversation about issues, possessiveness and trust issues, he became violently angry if she talked about a friend he didn't agree with, and that he would frequently go on long tangents in which he trashed her friends to her face.  


At the end of the conversation she asked for advice on what she should do. I in the politest terms I could come up with discussed how these actions were not okay and that she should try to handle the problems again or leave him. At this she became angry and dismissive of the very behavior she had just described. I didn't know how to handle that so I made up an excuse and left the conversation.  


Since then, she has asked for advice on both small and large problems involving her boyfriend and has proceeded to respond the same way to my advice. Last night, we called and discussed issues at length again at her request. After giving my same advice for the 6th or 7th time she became angry again and accused me of trying to break them up for my own benefit. I at this point, lost my cool and explained how that wasnt true and that I was only trying to help her escape her very obviously abusive boyfriend (IMO). She hung up and has not responded to my two attempts to contact her following it.  


So, am I the asshole for being angry at her because of how she has handled my advice?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c353ax	2019-06-21 02:43:52	Tinyiksar	WIBTA if i asked that my sister is excluded from one part of our future inheritance	"Okay i know it sounds bad but hear me out. My grandma lives in a nice 2 bedroom house with a yard and a tiny garden. My mom lives in a 2 bedroom apartment with a slightly smaller yard but it has electric heating while my gran's house doesn’t. Both my grandma and mom live in the same city and own their homes. 

When i was small i always expressed wanting to live in my grandma’s house when she moves out. She was very happy to hear that i want the house. My mom and I moved around a lot (about once a year) before my sister was born so my grandma’s house is the closest to a childhood home i have and i’ve lived there on and off throughout my life. I also enjoy the tasks that come with the house, like having to keep firewood for the winter. 
When my sister was born my mom settled on the apartment she lives in now. It’s where my sister has lived all her life. So my suggestion is that my sister gets my mom’s apartment and i get my grandma’s house. My grandma was the one to originally suggest this and my mom agreed. 

My sister has a very wealthy dad and will be inheriting 100% of what he leaves behind. I don’t have a dad at all and our mom is on the lower end of middle class. We’d be splitting everything from her 50-50. But i don’t want my sister to get 50% of the house i’ll be living in. My sister is still in her early teens and i’m in my early twenties so we haven’t talked about any of this to her. 

It’s not necessarily urgent as my mom and grandma are alive and well, but my grandma told me she’ll probably be moving to a smaller, easier place in a couple of years bc she doesn’t wanna deal with the house anymore (its a lot of work), so that’d be when i get the house. 
i suppose i just feel kinda weird about doing all this without her even knowing what’s going on yet so like am i being a jackass here?


edit: alright it looks like i’m an asshole but i don’t really know what to do then? thank u all regardless, i’ll try to figure it out somehow"	Asshole	0	0

c352wb	2019-06-21 02:42:38	bear_tamy	AITA for cleaning my mom's room?	"Ever since my mom, my siblings, and I moved in with my grandparents six years ago, my mom has been letting stuff pile up in her room and other various spaces in the house. You can't even see her floor because it's covered with clothes, papers, and, frankly, trash. 

It's gotten worse this past year since I moved out for college. She's piled more stuff (including new stuff she's bought and hasn't done anything with) on the floor of my room so now you can't see my floor anymore. I'm gone throughout the school year but my poor sister has to deal with it since we share(d) a room. And it makes me hate visiting. 

I'm getting fed up with it, and today while she was at work I picked up some papers, sorted through it, and threw out anything I didn't think was important. Most of it was my siblings school work from years ago. This barely made a dent but it was something. You could actually see the hardwood. When she got home she was upset because she wants to be the one to go through everything. She said that she doesn't tell me what to keep or throw away so I shouldn't try to go through her stuff. 

My logic is that anything that was on the floor getting stepped on for years can't possibly be important or sentimental enough to keep. And if I don't get her started, she'll never get rid of anything. I get not liking people going through your stuff but honestly it was all trash. It's not like I went through her clothes or anything. It was literally just paper. Am I the asshole?

c352ss	2019-06-21 02:42:23		AITA for blowing up at a fast food employee for messing up my order in the most colossal way possible?	"This is probably better suited for a throwaway account, but honestly, I'm too lazy to make one. Feeling especially lazy today, I decided to order myself dinner instead of making something for myself, and I settled on a local Dairy Queen who's partnered with GrubHub for delivery, as they're a favorite of mine and I was craving. I end up ordering a six piece honey BBQ chicken strip basket, with Texas toast, fries, and a Chocolate X-Treme blizzard. 


When my food arrives, I open it up and find that my order has been messed up in the most colossal way I can image. 1st, there's no sauce. Anyone who has eaten dairy Queen chicken strips knows that the sauce is usually smothered on very liberally unless you're specifically ask them not to. Not only is my sauce not on my strips, it isn't present at all. Upsetting, but not rage inducing.


The second thing I notice is that my Texas Toast has been buttered, but not toasted. Now I'm angry. It's Texas TOAST. The fries are undercooked as well, but that's not my immediate problem.


At Least I can enjoy the blizzard with my naked strips and Texas bread. (I can't stand the taste of raw or undercooked potatoes).


Except I can't. There's no silverware with my food. No spoon for my blizzard or fork for my chicken strips. I have silverware, so it's not too much of a problem, but it's ice cream, it needs a spoon. It's supposed to be covered in sauce, it needs a fork. Imagine if a restaurant required you to bring your own silverware.


So I call the dairy Queen, give them my name and order, and ask to speak with the employee who prepared it. She's out on the phone, and I explain to her that I'm upset with the quality of my meal and tell her exactly why. I used to work in food service, so I know that people make mistakes but this could be a learning experience for her.


And I'm remaining calm until she tells me that the issue is in my end, for ordering plain chicken strips. In the interest of the benefit of the doubt, I pull up my GrubHub app, and lo and behold, I did not. I ordered the honey BBQ, just like I have 100 times before. Even if that were true, no spoon? Untoasted toast? Undercooked fries? Maybe they're busy, sure, but that can all be double checked. 


I don't remember exactly what I said, but I know I blew up at her. She prepared every aspect of my meal gave it to the driver, and sent him on his way. And I let her know that this was unacceptable. I did my best to avoid swearing at her, but I let her have it. She took down my phone number and told me the manager of the store (who I'm decent friends with) would call me in the morning.


I replaced the order because I'm still hungry, and 30 minutes later, it arrives with all the same mistakes made again. I'm waiting on a pizza now instead.


I talked to a friend and he doesn't think I'm necessarily in the wrong, but feels I could have handled it better. Am I the asshole?"	Asshole	1	0
c3523t	2019-06-21 02:40:33	Environmental_Friend	AITA for asking my family to pay me back for groceries?	"A little backstory here: I am a poor college student. I just finished my first year of college and have been having a hard time finding a job since, which I will admit is my fault because I am super picky. That being said, I had enough money saved up for my car insurance, gas, and other necessities like groceries until I got my new job. I just started my new job on Tuesday and will not be getting paid until at least 7/5.

&#x200B;

I am living at home for the summer until I move out to be an RA at the college I attend. I did not live on campus this past year, so nothing has really changed. My family consists of myself, my 2 younger brothers, and a mom and a dad. My dad works super hard to provide for us and my mom does not have a job. Though my mom does not have a job, she spends her day doing anything but grocery shopping or putting meals together for us. We have been mostly ""on our own"" for meals, provided that she actually gets to the store once in a while.

&#x200B;

I just started a job at the mall that pays very well, but not well enough to feel good about shelling out $10 a meal, even after the mall employee discount. I spent $40 I didn't have to buy groceries that would last me 2 weeks for work meals. Just the essentials like veggies, pasta, bread, lunch meat, etc. I specifically told my family that that was my stuff (nobody shops at Trader Joe's but me), had it in a separate area in the fridge/freezer, and tried to make sure that I only ate it for work days. I had not eaten anything that I had bought.

&#x200B;

When I went to make my lunch this morning, I realized that ALL OF MY GROCERIES WERE GONE. I was furious. My parents are calling me selfish for asking them to pay me back because ""the fridge is household property"" or my personal favorite, ""I own everything in this house, including the fridge and all of the food inside of it"". I know these arguments are silly, but I do kind of feel like an asshole for at least wanting reimbursement for what they ate. I would be more than happy to take over the grocery shopping for my family so that they could have stuff to eat, but I am upset that they took advantage of my planning ahead and money to go out of the way and knowingly eat my stuff.

So for a bit of background, I work in tourism, in a team setting where we pool tips. Tips make up a pretty significant portion of our income and the “rules” for tipping aren’t as clear cut as other industries, so the amounts we get tipped vary a lot. The other day, one of our team members had a birthday and I mentioned it to the tourists so they could wish her a happy birthday on the way out. Not only did they do that, they also handed her a lot of money. Since then, our team has pretended that it’s various people’s birthdays, and sure enough, we’ve seen an increase in tips. I feel a tiny bit conflicted about it. On the one hand, lying is wrong, but on the other hand, nobody is really being harmed by it, and it’s not like we’re forcing people to tip. So AITA for my team and I pretending it’s our birthdays when it’s really not?

c3507v	2019-06-21 02:35:33	alyssafey	AITA for dating my best friends crush?	"I’m going to summarize this the best I can because it’s a long and complicated story. If you have questions please ask and I’ll answer them. 

 I’m friends with these two girls Sam and Nicole. Sam has a cousin named Andy that visited every other year. I always had a crush on him growing up but told nobody about it. The last time he was here (three years ago) my friend Nicole told me that she liked him. I still hadn’t told her that I liked him and it definitely didn’t seem like the right time to do I didn’t and I told her to go for it. She said she couldn’t because she was to shy and that was that. 

Six months ago Andy added me on Snapchat randomly and we started talking, a lot. Eventually we started dating but I decided not to say anything because we weren’t sure if the distance would work out. Also keep in mind Nicole was in a serious relationship with someone else while I was with Andy. Sam said one night that she’d stop talking to any of her friends who dated Andy so that night I ended things with him and we haven’t talked since. 

Now flash forward to today. I was hanging out with Nicole and told her about me and Andy. She jokingly (or so I thought) called me stupid, we both laughed and started talking about other things. Sam came to hangout a little later and one of the first things Nicole said was that I dated her cousin. Keep in mind I hadn’t seen or really even talked to Sam since the night I broke it off with Andy. Sam wasn’t mad at all and told me she only said that because Andy’s a “fuck boy” and she didn’t want her friends getting played. 

  Then Nicole’s attitude changed. She started freaking out telling me I was a horrible friend for doing this to her. She said that she couldn’t believe I’d tell her this right when she was going through a break up with her long term boyfriend and that I would date the guy she was in love with. First off, she didn’t tell me until that moment she broke up with her boyfriend otherwise I wouldn’t have said anything then. Secondly, IN LOVE??! I had NO clue she felt that strongly towards him. Nicole told me THREE YEARS ago that she liked him and nothing more after that. I tried explaining that but she just said I “should’ve known he was off limits”. Now I feel horrible.

c34ze7	2019-06-21 02:33:14		WIBTA for setting a rule at my mom's house before i visit?	"Long story short, i recently graduated highschool and I have been finding excuses to get out of the house. My mom and dad are divorced; mom remarried to a guy im starting to have second thoughts about. Independence day is coming up, and she invited me over to stay a couple weeks for a mother/daughter bond. Small problem- the place is disgusting and uncomfortable overall.

So i was thinking- if i say something along the lines of ""Hey, I'd love to visit for a couple weeks, but can you get AT LEAST the extra room cleaned up?"", Would that be better than saying, ""No, id rather not come"" or ""can you possibly come stay here in a hotel for a week?""

More info; We are about 4 hours apart from each other. Me and dad go near the area on all the holidays- its her choice to make the 30 minute drive to visit me during that time. last time i saw her house, there were trash bags on the ground, opened, bugs everywhere (even on dishes in the sink) and i think the room i slept in gave me the sinus infection when i returned home. She has only twice (i think) came to visit me from the 4 hour trip, second time idk if i should count because it was for graduation and she stuck around for dinner then took the 4 hour drive back home (guess she wasn't off work). The guy she married to was accused of something bad and i didn't really believe he would do it, but my family (especially dad) refused to let me go near the guy (still worried, but can't do anything since i turned 18). He has turned into a stranger to me and didn't go to my graduation. I'd be really bored if i don't get out of the house. Lastly, i liked the neighborhood when i visited, but i still don't know then that well. I thought maybe, instead of forcing her to clean, I'd camp in the front yard. No idea how that would go (forest area, beautiful sights). With and without this information- WIBTA?"		1	0

c34ymo	2019-06-21 02:31:15	SnowShimmer150	AITA For snapping at my mother over the consistent comparisons of her toxic crush to Marching band?	"Okay so before I get murdered in the comment section I need to give a little bit of context, my mother works at a thrift store similar to Goodwill, they process clothing and items and sell them for reduced prices. The environment there is very toxic and draining mentally and physically, the ac isn't working where she is, it is physically taxing moving all the objects and they are put under extreme stress to fill quotas by management. I also love marching band, it is basically my life currently and all my friends are apart of it. I may bitch about it a lot but I love every second of it.

I also do not live with my mother, and I am not particularly close. Please be nice in the comments.

She was telling me about another worker she had a crush on that treated her like shit. He was really rude and made her life hell then suddenly acted very nice and she caught feels. I'm not sure if this is normal to tell your kids but I have been dealing with her go on and on about this man who is a complete asshole on multiple levels and tbh I'm kinda sick of hearing about it.

I am a straight forward person but recognize that is not an excuse to be mean, so as gently as possible I tell her that she needs to get over this man and that she is obsessing over him. (She at least mentions him twice a day) I am glossing over a looooot of stuff here but in the end she justifies her crush by comparing it to the heat and stress marching band building a sense of shared labor.

This ticks me off slightly because I do not appreciate my favorite activity being equivocated and used to justify her toxic work environment crush on an asshole. So gently I say, hey, could you not compare those, I understand both these activities are taxing but there is a very big difference between those two things.

This makes her double down on my comparison and ignores my justifications on how marching band is a voluntary activity honing my passion for playing instruments and satisfying to put so much work into a show every one participates in, it builds bonds and has helped me make some truly amazing friends I would die for. Her job on the other hand, is a hard job you must put a lot of labor into for a paycheck. 

They do have similarities, I won't deny that, but I feel they are fundamentally different and I appreciate her trying to use my passion to communicate, I told her so, but also stated please don't compare the two. Again she keeps on stating they are the same and I get riled up over her dissing my favorite hobby. If she had let it go I wouldn't be writing this but over and over despite my objections she kept comparing the two until I said shut up and left the room.

I feel bad for snapping but I also feel she should've respected my stance. Just, am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Also, first post on my new alt! Starting things off strong lol. I apologize for any mistakes in advance because I’m writing this late at night on mobile :/ 

My little brother has severe autism, and for his 13th birthday, my family took him to Disney World in Orlando. The journey was long and the weather was sweltering, but he had a lot of fun and I think that’s all that matters. Also, it was the first time I’d been invited on a family vacation since I moved out. I’m 20. I appreciated it. 

The hotel we stayed at had a small arcade with one of those card point systems ( unsure how to describe it otherwise :/ ) that you could exchange for prizes at a huuuge electronic kiosk. Upon entering the arcade, I wheeled my brother to the machine and had him pick out a prize he wanted so I could figure out how much money to spend and how many tickets to win. It’s our little system. Set a goal, reach it.

He picks one of the prize doors, it’s got one of those shitty phone VR headsets in it and a faulty kid’s ukulele. Whatever. He wants it, I’ll get it for him. So as I’m buying the points to play the games, this other little boy in the arcade, couldn’t be more than ten, tugs on my sleeve and tells me something along the lines of “excuse me, that was the prize I was going to get.” So jokingly, I tell him it’ll have to be a race. He glares at me and goes back off to play the games. Okay, well, now it’s really a race. 

Within an hour, I had enough money to get my brother the prizes behind the door, and it looked like the other little kid was nowhere to be seen, so I went ahead and got them. As we’re exiting the arcade, who do I see, but the other kid who’d gone crying to his parents. The mother reprimanded me and told me that as a grown man I should’ve known better. That was the end of the conversation. 

Looking back on this now, at like 10:30 at night, I’m starting to think she was right. My mother always taught me to put others before myself and that kindness gets you places in life. There were plenty of other prizes for my brother to choose from.

c34vqx	2019-06-21 02:23:51	Lilac41214	WIBTA if I made a complaint about how employees of a theme park near me act outside of work?	"Apologies for mobile formatting

Background: I work in a retail store that has a money center where we can send money to other countries, states or the can receive money. A local theme park has an exchange program where people from a certain foreign country can come and work.

This is only from April to October but a common problem for sending money is that they only bring a passport which has their work visa stating they work at the theme park but we always tell them that they need to bring the housing agreement they have with the theme park so that we know they live on site because they can live elsewhere if they so choose hence why we need confirmation of address. This applies to everyone, not just them. Now the problem is how they treat us at customer service when we tell them they need to bring the housing agreement, I have gotten yelled at, I have had them demand I get fired because I am not doing my job right (I am, it says they need proof of address on the form that they fill out). Management does nothing because we charge a fee for sending so the store makes alot of money off of them in the summer from them sending their paychecks back home.

What I want to do is file a complaint with the theme park and just ask if they can have a talk with their employees about respecting us or just explain to them that they need to follow our policies just as we would if we went to said theme park. I have policies I need to follow otherwise I could fired or depending on what I just let 'slide' as they ask me to I could get arrested. So WIBTA if I just simply call or send an email because this is not just like 10 emplyees it's hundreds, and they are also very disrespectful to our staff in general, whether buying stuff or sending money."

c34rnl	2019-06-21 02:12:59		AITA for not attending my sister's graduation?	"Disclaimer - I 100% do not think my sister is at fault in this situation, I'm just here for judgement on my own behaviour.

So my sister's graduating (PhD - so proud of her!) in about a month. The original plan was for me and my husband to go with parents and grandma to celebrate with her. The trouble is the graduation is happening the other end of the country (UK) and parents aren't able to pick me and husband up on the way as the car is too full.

I have a chronic illness (fibro, if you're interested - it's basically constant pain and fatigue) and travel, especially long journeys and especially by train are difficult and painful for me. I can't walk long distances, often use a wheelchair for days out and many places aren't great at being accessible. 

Originally I was planning to suck it up, take my wheelchair for the weekend and deal with the crash afterwards. Then my medication was changed and not only did the poop hit the fan, it turned the entire room brown. You know the list of possible side effects drugs can give you? My body turned that into a checklist. I've been unable to work for the past couple of months, and I've barely left the house. I'm better now I've stopped taking the drugs from hell, but recovery is slow and the thought of that train journey fills me with dread. 

I'm also worried that by going and therefore being ill the whole weekend because of the journey, even if I'm being wheeled around, I'm going to distract the focus from my sister. My husband and I decided it wasn't the best idea for me to go so I messaged my sister. It's been two weeks and she hasn't replied (she is chronically bad at responding to messages that aren't direct messages - it's almost endearing). I'm worried I've offended her - my message was in response to her letting me know she'd got tickets for us to come to the ceremony. I'm worried that she thinks I'm making this into a bigger deal than it is. My sister has been very understanding and supportive about my illness, even when I had to cancel a previous trip to come visit her for the weekend, but according to my mum she was really excited for me to be at her graduation.

i told her I'd still go out with her but couldn't stay, she got really upset, said to forget it and when we make a plan she structures her day around it and it helps her cope with her ocd and bpd and also that I've triggered her bpd (abandonment issues)

c34kxx	2019-06-21 01:54:53	throw983	AITA for avoiding someone because their anxiety has made them a shitty friend?	"I met this friend in college along with two other girls, and the four of us were very close ever since. I’ll call her Carly.

For years, we would all make efforts to see each other at least once a month and to celebrate special occasions. The three of us were even bridesmaids in Carly’s wedding, after which, she started exhibiting symptoms of severe anxiety.

It’s been about a year since then and in that time, Carly’s anxiety has driven her away from us. She has missed many important events (birthdays, my wedding, housewarmings, etc.) due to anxiety attacks or just flaking. On the rare occasion that she she does show up, she never stays long. The other three of us are all going through some pretty serious health/family issues too, but she never calls, texts, or checks in. She hardly even responds to our group messages or to jokes we send to each other. Plus, her anxiety has caused her to lash out at one friend in the group on a few occasions.

She’s very successful and has a crazy work schedule, so we’ve been very supportive in the past and have always made every effort to drive to go see her or to support her achievements. 

Her anxiety and her work control her life. She doesn’t have many friends outside of her family, whom she is close with, but who seem to make her anxiety even worse. As far as I know, she has been tested (and hospitalized) for her anxiety but refuses treatment.

I know that it’s her mental health, not her, that has caused her to snub us so many times, but I’ve become extremely jaded. The three of us now frequently hang out without Carly and I’ve stopped making an effort to keep up with her life.

I feel like she’s the asshole for not making any effort to maintain our friendship, especially after so many years of giving her our support.

But on the other hand, I know she’s sick. So am I the asshole for cutting her out when clearly she could use a friend or support during this difficult time in her life? Am I being a shitty friend for abandoning her in her time of need?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c34knm	2019-06-21 01:54:07		AITA for being disappointed after friends cancel plans	A few of my close friends planned on going out for lunch with a few people we know(a bit less well) from one of our classes. The plans were made around two weeks in advance and everything is going great, I’m excited and so are the people we planned on going with. About one week before the lunch one of my friends says she doesn’t want to go and never planed on going. I was a bit upset and tried to convince her to come since she said she would. I eventually got over it and didn’t care. Fast forward to the day before the lunch and friend number two says she can’t go because she told another friend she would go with her to a show she was doing. I don’t really care but I’m upset that she made a second commitment knowing that we already had plans- sorry that this story is confusing but I just want to know if I have the right to be a bit upset or frustrated with them?		1	0
c34kks	2019-06-21 01:53:53	Perth_ScottishWA	AITA for not letting uncommitted player take the field?	"I coach a kids (average age 8.5 years) sports team. We train once a week and play a game every Saturday morning.

There is a particular kid who has a complicated background (I don't know the specifics) and is enabled to quit every venture by parents.  This kid invariably walks off half way through each game and refuses to continue. Same child either does not attend training or doesn't take part properly.

Child hasn't played for three weeks now but is designated captain (they all get a turn) this week and is apparently (according to parent) excited about dishing out oranges at half time and jelly snakes at full time.

I'm going to put child on substitute for the whole game because;

- They can't be relied upon, 
-  It isn't fair on the other kids to have to be reshuffled every week or play one short,
- I write the position charts each week and it annoys me that my preparation is wasted.
- I find it irritating that child and parents are so uncommitted. 

Am I being an asshole by doing that? Should I try and deal with it and try harder to make a positive difference to kids life?

** Update 1 **

Ok. Thanks everyone for all the advice. 

I'm a first time coach this season so I have basically no idea what I'm doing other than knowing what the kids need to do to play effectively. I REALLY appreciate the feedback because as I mentioned before I want the kids to get something positive back.

I have decided to let child play, have a plan B on standby and also politely talk to the parents. 

I was too concerned about the impact on the other kids when in reality they are happy just to play win lose or draw.

** Update 2 **

Child in question didn't turn up to game (rain forecast). Plan B used, got hosed 20  - 1 or something ridiculous.  But, kids had fun and I saw it in a different light."	Asshole	0	0
c34kjo	2019-06-21 01:53:48	Wyliecoyote22	AITA for telling my bf to uninvite his friends?	"So this is kind of long but I’m going to make it short as possible. My (F) 21st birthday is Saturday. I’m not super excited because I don’t really drink and I hate loud places but oh well. My older sister planned a party for me where we have a pre-party at her house, go to a local club for a while and then post party back at her house. I was involved in basically none of the planning like picking the theme because honestly I don’t really care about what Colors we used or what food we have but I wasn’t too worried because I trust my sister. (I trusted her to plan a theme I would like and pick a smaller, quieter club since you know I haven’t been to any in there any to pick a good one) 


However, she found out that my 2 best friends aren’t able to make it, which does really upset me. It’s not the end of the world though I have invited plenty of other friends who are coming. My sister started a Facebook group to invite people but since my friends and I are cool we don’t really use Facebook. Instead I just texted them all the details and they’re coming. This part is my fault but nobody had asked me if I knew how many people were coming or if I had invited anyone myself so to my family and sister it looked like nobody was coming.  Essentially They freaked out and texted my boyfriend who we’ll call Scott to have him invite people. Now Scott and I have been together a year and 3 months and he still hasn’t met any of my friends. I’ve met almost all of his and he has a bad habit of agreeing to plans that involve both of us with his friends without asking me first. My sister meant for him to invite some of our friends from the part time job we share (we both work 2 jobs) since she doesn’t know them. For some reason he invited 2 girls he’s really good friends with from his other job who I’ve literally never met before. He did this without asking me first.

 I got upset that my family talked to him behind my back when it wasn’t an emergency. Not because I don’t trust them but because I know my boyfriend and you have to spell stuff like that out for him. He has CTE from playing football his whole life. 

Basically, I don’t want strangers at my party and it feels like he invited his friends so he wouldn’t have to spend the night with my friends for ONE FREAKING NIGHT after over a year of dating me! So I told him to  tell them there was some miscommunication and that I want the party to be close family and friends only. I can tell he’s a little mad about it and said I’m putting him in an awkward position but come on if he had just asked first like we’ve talked about a million times this wouldn’t even be a problem. Plus who invited strangers to someone’s birthday party?!

ETA: agrees to stuff without asking me like... letting his buddy live on our couch for a month rent free. Getting a dog that I now walk 4 times a day because he’s too busy with work and I have a schedule that lets me go home for an hour a day between shifts. Making plans for the 4th of July for us with his friends without asking if I had any plans or if that was something I wanted to do. One night on our date night after the movie he got a call from a friend who wanted us to meet him at a pizza place. Without asking if I was tired or if I wanted our date night to be just us he agreed and we spent the night with his friends. He puts me in a position where I have to go to stuff with his friends because he already said I would go without asking me. If I say no or I’m too tired I’ll look like the asshole since the other party thinks I’m ditching last minute. I don’t do that to him."	Asshole	0	0

c34iqp	2019-06-21 01:48:52	Danieljk46	WIBTA if I went the the NYC pride parade instead of spending time with my girlfriend?	"For the last month, my GF of 7 months has been off on a big trip exploring Europe. She will be coming back late Wednesday, June 26th. I recently got invited to go visit my best friend, who I haven't seen for over six months, in NYC during the pride parade. I've never been to the parade and think it would be a really fun, interesting, and educational experience. I would really enjoy going, especially with my best friend, who happens to be gay. I've known him since middle school, saw him come out, had a bunch of conversations about it and his experience, and I would also like to go to show my support for him.

The problem is I would have to leave Friday which would give me and my girlfriend only one day to spend time together before I leave, and I would have to go to work that day as well. I just told her today that I was thinking about going and she is upset. The end of her trip has been pretty stressful and she said that she was really looking forward to spending comfortable, quality time with me when she got back. To be fair, I have been telling her to get excited about a big date I had planned for the weekend she got back before I was invited to NYC.

On top of that, I have a weeklong family vacation planned in NY the following week, so I would be going directly from NYC to visit my family and wouldn't see my gf for an entire week. 

My gf isn't forbidding me to go, she agrees it's my choice, but she has made it clear that it would really bum her out. My friend will be in NYC this entire summer and I could probably find another week to visit him, but it wouldn't be as cool of an experience as going during the parade would be. 

So WIBTA if I chose to go to NYC?

TL;DR: GF is coming back from month long vacation and wants to spend a couple days together, I want to go to NYC to visit and support my best friend during the pride parade a day after she gets back."	Asshole	0	0

Nothing is said about money , then yesterday she texts my wife again saying if we could reimburse her for the trip that would be really great and insinuating we should pay her back since she bailed. I said no way , I would have to eat the cost of her vacancy because it's already been paid for. She was asked multiple times if she was 100% sure she was going.

There are a few spots where the vegetation from someone's yard is overgrown onto the public sidewalk and you have to duck or move off the sidewalk. 

I suggested that we knock on a couple of people's doors with the overgrown lawns and politely ask them to trim their vegetation. George thought that this would be rude and it wasn't a big enough problem to bother with. I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask, as long as we were polite.

I ended up knocking on one door while George  waited around the corner. The man that answered was very polite and apologetic. He said he had been meaning to trim it and just hadn't gotten around to it. He said he would get it done this week, tomorrow if he had time.

I thought it went great, but George still thought that I shouldn't have said anything. I think asking once to solve a minor inconvenience is reasonable - if nothing got done I don't plan to escalate. George thinks that we should just live with the problem since it's their property and not a big deal for us.

c34fcl	2019-06-21 01:39:37	AcademicNumber	AITA for not wishing my bio father a happy father's day?	"  

I'm 25f. I've always known that the man who raised me (henceforth called ""dad"" because that's who he is to me) was not my biological father, but my mom has never said a word to me. (Even as a kid, there are clues that you pick up on and start to piece together). A few years ago, I confronted my dad about this and he told me my bio father's name (henceforth ""Eric"") and we both agreed that it doesn't change our relationship at all. He's a good person and will ALWAYS be my dad. He didn't really know anything else about my father except for his name. 

&#x200B;

This past Christmas, I found a blank profile on LinkedIn with Eric's name and correct city on it so I reached out. I just wanted to know the truth -- I honestly expected him to tell me to go away, and I was okay with that outcome. He responded nearly right away saying that yes, he was my father and that he had only known my mom a month when she got pregnant. She originally told him that she was going to end the pregnancy but called him 6 months later saying she was still pregnant. He visited me a few times after I was born, but my mom started dating my dad and he (Eric) got uncomfortable. So, he walked away. He faithfully paid child support to my mom, but I grew up not knowing him and my mom never told me a word about it. (In case it needs to be said: Eric is my confirmed father thru a court-ordered paternity test. There’s no doubt that I’m his kid.)

&#x200B;

Eric expressed to me that he deeply regrets walking away and has often wondered how I ended up. He told me that he wants to form a relationship with me but knows that it’s going to take some time because we are strangers. I’ve met him a few times in person and every week without fail he calls me on the phone and we chat for about an hour. He has been extremely forthcoming with information and about answering any questions I might have, even if it’s a hard one or if the answer isn’t very pleasant. I’ve also been introduced to a whole family that I didn’t even know I had (but who all knew about me and who have been MORE THAN  welcoming). It’s definitely the best possible outcome for a situation like this. I’m extremely lucky.   
 

At any rate, overall I would say that knowing Eric is a positive. But, my dad will always be my dad. Knowing Eric doesn’t change that. I’m glad to know him and plan to continue the relationship, but at the end of the day, he’s the person who donated half of my genetics and then CHOSE to walk away. He’s making up for it now and for that I’m grateful, but it doesn’t change the past. So, when he called me this past Sunday for our weekly chat, I didn’t wish him a Happy Father’s Day, even though he brought it up in conversation. At the time, I just felt uncomfortable saying it to him; but now, I worry that maybe I should have just sucked it up and gone with it since he’s clearly making an effort. 

AITA?

c34euq	2019-06-21 01:38:23	throwaway1583921847	WIBTA If I told my girlfriend how I felt after noticing she has notifications from me muted?	"A little over an hour ago I (21m) noticed my girlfriend (20f) has notifications from my text messages muted.

Seeing that my messages to her were muted kinda stung considering we’re coming up on our two year anniversary and we’re talking about getting engaged (she is 100% for this and got really excited when I initiated the conversation for the first time today).

I also didn’t snoop through her phone to see this. She was deleting a spammy text message about college loan repayments when I noticed I was muted.

I do understand that sometimes other people need a bit of space from their partner, but seeing that she doesn’t receive notifications from me hurt. I also don’t think I text her too often and generally give her some space. I do however respond to most texts from everyone fairly quickly (usually within 5 minutes) unless I’m asleep or working. However, I don’t usually spam messages. I might send one text and a meme or just a single text.

All that I’ve sent her today was “good morning, would you like to come over tonight for a bit”, “lunch now hun” and after she said she would be coming over “let me know when you get here so I can let you in”.

I don’t think that I spam her, but now I feel really sad that she felt the need to mute my notifications. I know that she plays games (fortnite and other mobile ones) on her phone fairly often and that notifications can be annoying. But I feel hurt that she muted me.

I am 100% up for talking to her about boundaries if she doesn’t want me to text back so quickly or if she feels like I’m spamming her.

They’re having a dance recital in a couple weeks. Last year I helped with the stage curtains so I was asked to help this year again doing the same thing. It’s not that simple for me to do it. Let me explain.

-Last year, there were like 5 other dudes back there helping with that, it kinda felt like I really wasn’t needed.

-I have anxiety disorder, it’s not that severe, I don’t need medication per se, but I stress out very easily and I cannot work under pressure, that gives me panic attacks. Last year, the curtain stuck as I was closing them and the dancers were stuck in the same position waiting for the curtains to close. Someone else there had to finish the job for me. I had a panic attack, I tried to handle it by myself because I don’t want people to know that I have anxiety. My wife of course knows, but still, I don’t want to be put in that place again.

I told her that if they need me elsewhere I’d gladly help, she told me the director already had everyone else assigned and that that’s the only place they needed me.

This last week they insisted a lot and I just keep saying no, and I really don’t want to explain them what’s the real matter here, my wife is not mad with me but she’s kinda upset about me *not wanting to help* so I kinda feel bad.

Edit 2: shit hit the fan, I'm moving out

A couple weeks ago my roommate texted me and told me that her guy friends are coming over to do laundry since the one in their apartment complex ""isn't really working"". Even though she was telling me rather than asking, I was still fine with it. A couple days ago, she texts to tell me that they are coming over again to do laundry. I had planned to do laundry that day but since she didn't ask me I felt uncomfortable trying to speak up so I said okay. Her friends were there for about 7 hours doing laundry. 

So that's the background but I have three main reasons for why I don't want them to come over:

1) They stay way to long and it makes me uncomfortable as these guys totally ignore me

2) When I finally got the chance to do my laundry, I pulled several strands of animal fur out of the lint trap. I asked my roommate if the boys had any pets and she casually said they had a cat and a dog. I am ALLERGIC to those animals. Not life threatening but there have been several times where I have struggled to breathe around cats and dogs. She knows this, we've had fights about it in the past, but she didn't think to tell me

3)  After I finally worked up the nerve to ask her to check with me first, I proceeded to ask when their laundry units were going to be fixed. She looked away and started mumbling before I caught the words ""...it's in their complex but it's stetchy and they feel like their going to be murdered"" So that makes me think she lied and now they are just going to keep coming here from now on, which will not be ideal for me when school picks back up and I want peace and quiet.

So would I be the asshole to tell them to stop coming over to do laundry? Are we all assholes here? I hope I what I wrote makes sense to y'all."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I have done a lot more than her, like coming up with ideas and names and connecting with other organizations. She usually is like a yes-man, so like if I have an idea she usually is like yes or ehhh. However, we both have the title of president, even though the work is definitely not equal. It's been extremely frustrating because my belief is that you should get what you have in life based on what you deserve. I'm really scared to talk to her because I don't want to be aggressive or power hungry, but I just think if I was the sole leader then I could do what is best for this club. I can make decisions without checking with her and be a lot more energetic. Part of me says that it's about the impact that counts, but another part of me says that she doesn't deserve this. Sometimes I feel like she's not even passionate about this and just needs a resume stuffer.		1	0

It is his first year in, so he isn’t amazing at it, but it has been great for him to be on a team sport, and he’s getting better every game. 

When we first signed up, we were told this weekend would be play offs. My partner and I discussed if he should book this weekend off work, and decided against it. He has already cut a lot of his shifts, and he would just attend what he could, and I of course would attend all of them. 

Last month his best friend’s girlfriend made him aware of a surprise 30th birthday party being hosted. He said he would attend, and really wants to go. I didn’t know the date of this party, just that it was on a upcoming Saturday in the afternoon towards evening. 

2 weeks ago I was in a car accident that has left me unable to sit or stand for any period of time. I am off work and going to doctor appointments 3 days a week. I am both without car, not able to drive, and definitely not able to sit through 4 two hour long baseball games this weekend. 

My partner informed me that this weekend is his friend’s birthday party, and he is working on Sunday. This would mean he wouldn’t be attending any of the games. We would then have to rely on other parents or the coach to bring our son to all four games, and he would not have anyone there cheering him on during them. 

This breaks my heart. I want to be there, but I can’t. I feel like my partner should be messaging the girlfriend and asking if there will be anything going on around 7:00/7:30 (time the last game Saturday would end) if he could come by then to hangout in the evening. He feels like this is a milestone birthday for his best friend and he should be there. 

He has justified that he doesn’t feel like our son is that into the game. I told him what’s most important here is that he feels like he is important to his parents - and not second his parent’ friends. He has worked hard all season for these playoffs. 


Last we spoke my partner told me I should “figure it out”. He is quite upset that I would be putting him in this situation. I am quite upset that this isn’t a no brainer for him. 


So, AITA for expecting him to not attend the surprise birthday for his best friend turning 30?

She's either 15 or 16 now, even he's unsure of her actual age. He's abroad for work right now and won't be back for another week.

The dog began acting funny and started to wimper and limp for seemingly no reason. Being alarmed, I brought her to the vet and was told the dog has pneumothorax and eventually (soon) her lung may fully collapse and she'll die a painful death. She's on some medication now to help with pain and hopefully reverse what's going on but I was advised it'd be best to put her down.

I told my husband and he was adamant in not putting her down until he's home.

I'm 21f
my sister is 24f


last week I got a phone call from my sister telling me that if she did not pay this weeks rent she would be kicked out and that she is 70$ short, so I was asked if I could lend her the 70$. I've had minor issues with her and paying money back but I was not going to let my sister be homeless so I transferred 70$ to her account. 

a few days later I decided to message her and ask about the money and could not locate her Facebook profile, turns out she blocked me. 
I tried messaging her on my 2nd Facebook account but she blocked that one the minute she read the message. 
I figured that she would block any other account that tries to message her so I was unsure what to do. 

so I made a Facebook post telling people to not lend my sister money and explained why, my mom spotted it and now my mum and my sister are mad at me for airing out the family drama (I had no clue it was drama) on Facebook. even though all I said was, please do not give (sister) money, she blocked me after I asked for the 70$ I lent her. 

they are now super mad at me and have called me an asshole.

c3495j	2019-06-21 01:23:29		AITA for arguing with a cop about a traffic stop?	"I Put my phone on a mount practically below my eye line. I use Android auto while driving with Spotify open. 

I decided to skip a song, I took my right hand off the wheel tapped the screen twice and put my hand back on the wheel. 

A few seconds later I see a speeding car in my rearview. It startles me, I pull to the next lane and he also follows, the blue and red lights go on. 

He asks for license/Reg/Ins the usual. I ask him what I did wrong. He says I was texting. I was shocked and my reaction must of been obvious. I thought I was speeding, or maybe didn't use my blinker on the lane change. 

Nope, he said I was texting. I made the argument I actually just was using the radio. I can actually control both Spotify through phone and car touchscreen. I told the officer it was easier for me to tap the phone since it wasn't as far a glance as the radio, maybe 10 inches higher.  He didn't care, he said if we wanted to argue about it we could go to court. 

I lost my cool, I don't remember what I said but basically I made the argument he was not only wrong about me texting, but I was just using the radio through Android auto. The app stays open and all I have to do it tap it to change songs, I can do the same exact thing on the radio touch screen it just takes longer. Which I argued actually keeps my eyes off the road longer. 

I wouldn't be able to prove it but I'm certain he was looking to write a ticket just because, he said it would have been 200 dollars. 

I gave him a PBA card. My dad is also a cop. He called him and complained about how rude I was (I got chewed out) but I still don't care. 

He gave me two written warnings and told me to thank my dad. 

I know in my state using the radio is considered distracted driving, but how can you honestly write these tickets. 

I'm in NJ if anyone cares. Im still baffled that some cop went of his way to get me on that, it felt like he was trying to get me for any little thing and he found it."	Asshole	0	0
c348na	2019-06-21 01:22:13	josh1424	AITA For not letting my co-worker take my truck to buy a baby crib?	"preface: me and my coworker (let’s call him V) have been working together at subway for 2 years, i’m 20 and he’s 22. no prior friendship before, became friends at work and have been work friends since then. he also has no vehicle as hi lives right across the st., and his wife is also 9 months pregnant and about to pop. 

this happened on father’s day (out of all days, lol)

father’s day was on sunday and i already had plans to be with family till after lunch that day since i had work at 4 that night. the friday before father’s day V came in to subway just to chill because he has another job at Frito lay that morning and just works at subway saturday and sunday. we were talking about how little he works here and that he really should just quit as his checks are not worth it here. he said he probably will the next week and i say “well i could come in at 2 sunday, just for the extra hours” (he worked 10-4 on sunday originally), and he said ok. 

fast forward to sunday around 12:30, i get a call from V (which i didn’t answer because i was having lunch with family, it was father’s day after all), which i didn’t answer because everyone i work with knows that if it’s emergency to text me (i’m weird about answering calls). so a minute or 2 later he texts me saying his wife was in pain and to hurry and come in asap, so i assumes she was either having complications and he had to leave or she was going into labor. 

long story short i hurry to work (which is a 30 minute commute btw) only to get there and he seems fine and i asked what the fuck he was still doing here to which he says... “she’s always hurting but she’s fine i just wanted you to come in so i could use your truck to buy a crib because -wife- wants it today.” i start arguing with him about how that was a shitty way to get someone to come in early for him and that i was already coming in at 2 which was earlier than my scheduled shift, and he says the place where they want the crib from closes early on sunday’s . which was a bs excuse, and i asked him why he couldn’t have just asked me that morning or the day before and he didn’t have an answer. he then said he would give me gas money but i was overreacting. i refuses the money and said he wasn’t taking my truck and i didn’t talk to him for the rest of the time he was there (which was maybe 30 minutes after i had gotten there)...

am i the asshole for saying no? 

TL;DR: my coworker lied about his pregnant wife being in pain so i could come in early and he could use my truck. i said no and he got mad and said i overreacted. haven’t talked to him since that happened."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c34898	2019-06-21 01:21:11	alltreesdeserveahug	AITA for wanting my neighbor to buy me new shoes?	"NE: my neighbor 
RM: neighbor's roommate 
DD: satan in dog form

I am close friends with both RM and NE. 

A few months ago, NE decided to adopt an adorable great dane puppy (DD). NE spent a lot of time with DD, even tho she was working two jobs. 

Then NE started dating multiple people.

Now, NE is hardly ever home, never takes care of her animals (just let her two dogs free roam the house and poop everywhere), and leaves all the work to RM (buying dog food, toys, cleaning supplies, etc.).

About a week ago, RM sat down with NE and explained that she was being abusive and neglectful to him and her dog. NE said that she'll stay home and 'discipline' DD and began to do so... by locking her in a crate 24/7 and only letting her out every few days. This means that DD has to sit in her own feces for however long until NE gets back (but RM hardly ever lets that happen). 

So today I'm over at NE&RM's house and RM tells me that NE has been gone since yesterday and he's had to do all the dog-related chores (surprise surprise). DD was acting well, so RM let her out to run around the house. Neither of us think it's fair to keep a huge great dane puppy with that amount of energy locked in a crate. 

About 1 hour later, I notice a trail of debri on the floor. RM and I follow it and find a pair of my flip flops totally mangled. There's a shoe rack in the living room right beside the door that DD must have jumped on to get my shoes. Then I notice that DD has grabbed another one of my shoes (fancy ones) and taken it into her crate. This time I lose my sh*t.

I've never been attached to clothing (especially shoes), but this pair specifically had a lot of sentimental value. My last relationship was abusive and my boyfriend would control every aspect of my life, including what I wore. He would constantly shame me and my body, especially my feet. I got these shoes as a symbol of freedom from my ex. This was the first pair of open-toed shoes I'd ever bought. 

RM and I took it out of her mouth, but it was already beyond repair (she had eaten almost half of it). I broke down and cried for 20 minutes until I was able to explain to RM that there was no way I'd be able to get another pair (they were expensive and I'm a broke college student). 

So RM calls NE and NE apologizes for what happened. RM explains that the shoes were very important and that NE needs to pay me back for both pairs of shoes DD tore up.

I heard NE respond, ""It's not happening. Look, I'm sorry, but YOU'RE the one that let her out of the crate, not me, so I don't owe you anything."" 

RM apologized and said that he would buy me another pair of shoes, but I told him that I would only accept money from NE because it was her dog that tore everything up. 

Edit: RM is moving out and taking DD. I guess I didn't specify enough but DD has an excellent life WITH RM... spoiled rotten. Leaving her in there for days was NE's PLAN. She never actually got away with it. RM and I have been her adoptive mothers for a few months now. It would be ridiculous to be concerned about a pair of shoes when there was a dog's life on the line."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"For full context: My gf's (of 3 years) grandmother was on her final days last week. We were both in a foreign country (her country of origin) spending some time with her (I had to work while there as well) during her final days.  


I headed back last weekend, early, since I still had to work. She was supposed to head back this week, but extended her trip onto the weekend (Because she lived longer than expected). We were supposed to move this weekend, and I'm starting to feel extremely annoyed at the trip extension.  


For one, I feel like I've made a lot of accommodations regarding my own job. I am the primary earner in our household (by over 2x) and the travelling forced me to make quite a few accommodations to begin with, but to top it off, upon return, I had to take care of our own shared responsibilities here by myself, including documents, cheques and other outstanding stuff for our upcoming move alone. I've also had to take care of our pets alone, and do all of the usual stuff we do as two (i.e house cleaning) by myself as well.   


It just feels like quite a lot, and I feel some personal bitterness/annoyance at this situation. I understand there's been a death/passing and I've done quite a bit to help, but it doesn't put the rest of our lives on pause, and I've had to deal with a much higher responsibility load. I spent a few hours running around doing errands today and I'm not even close to being done all I have to do, on top of catching up on work from the trip.   


AITA for feeling sort of bitter at this? I haven't acted out on it at all, I've tried to bottle it for the most part because I understand her loss, I just feel like a dick for harboring these feelings."	Asshole	0	0

c345hd	2019-06-21 01:13:50		AITA for not making more of an effort when my friends dad was concerned for her safety?	Hi so I’m a 16 year old girl which I feel like is a necessary thing to include because if I was an adult my take on the situation would be a bit different. Recently I was hanging out with my friend at my house and she left to hang out with this guy she wanted to to hookup with, dick move but whatever her decision not my place to stop her. However, she’s gotten into some pretty risky situations involving drugs and alcohol so her parents have been keeping tabs on her more than usual. Because of this she told  them that she was going to one of my friends houses and that I was coming with her. I had previously told her I would come with her if she wanted me to but she really did not want me to. Around an hour after she had left my house her dad called me (I have never met him and didn’t even know he had my number) and he asked if he could talk to her because she was not answering her phone, in a moment of panic I told him that i would call him back shortly because i was on the phone with my parents. Kind of a stupid thing to say but I did not want to rat her out. Immediately after I hung up I called her five times and when she did not answer I called my friend who is friends with guy she was with and asked him to call him and see if she was ok and to ask her to please call her parents back. My friend immediately called her parents when she saw their missed calls and all was well. My friend reached out to me later that night after I texted her many times and she did not apologize for putting me in that position or thank me for not tagging her out. Instead, she told me that she had ended up telling her parents that she lied to them and she said that her dad thought it was rude and he was diss appointed that I hung up on him. AITA for hanging up on him even though I 1) knew she was safe 1) she wasn’t with me 3) immediately reached out to other people to make sure she contacted her parents? In my opinion it wasn’t even my problem really to begin with and her parents should be more concerned about their manipulative daughter than me.		1	0

"Backstory:  I was friends with my SIL prior to dating, then marrying her brother.  I've never liked her husband.  His is a narcissistic, bully that treats everyone he deems beneath him like garbage(which is pretty much everyone). My SIL and I were friends for 7 years, and 6 1/2 of those her husband and I have had not gotten along. He was fine with me, then suddenly he was not, and began saying things about how I'd be prettier if I lost weight, suddenly making fun of me while I was in the middle of speaking, calling me names, etc.  When he decided bullying me was his favorite thing, I stopped hanging out with our group of friends when he was around.  It worked for 6 years.  When her brother and I married 4 years ago, I took on a parenting role at the same time and became a step parent(I hate that term because they are my kids, but its the easiest way to say it what my role is).  She was so excited that I was part of the family, told me constantly how great of a mom I would be.  I prided myself on the strong relationship I built with my bonus kids, who are 13 and 14 now.  

A few months ago my kids were at my SIL home, and her husband decided to insult me nonstop, especially while the kids were in his presence. SIL also made a comment, agreed with him, and never asked him to stop acting like that in front of the kids.  This was the first time we'd let the kids go their house without one of us, or a grandparent with them.  The husband had been acting ok for a few years, so I thought maybe he matured, but obviously I was wrong.  
My kids became upset enough that after 2 hours of nonstop insults, they called us to pick them up early.  They love me, and couldn't stand how he was bashing me for fun, and doing it purposely when they were in the room. They really wanted to hang out with their aunt, but just couldn't take it.  They told us later about everything.  None of it surprised me.  I am very upset about how it impacted them though.  They had tears in their eyes, and one of them was shaking.  The youngest said,  ""I thought you were friends with her?  Why wouldn't Aunt ******* stick up for you?  I thought friends did that? I thought SHE would do that?"".  That was tough.

I decided to call my SIL about what happened, and how it impacted the children.  Her response, ""I'm sorry they thought they heard that."".  I couldn't believe she wouldn't take responsibility, and made her own nieces seem like liars.  I've dissolved the friendship, and we've made changes on how the kids will see her in the future.

She and her husband are obviously assholes here. My husband and I decided it is not ok for the kids to be around her, or her husband, unless one of us is present. This new stipulation had caused more drama, and even though we are trying to protect the kids, are we also being assholes?  Some of the family wants us to just ignore it, but I can't."

c343u5	2019-06-21 01:09:34	TheScottCharm	AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend for going skinny dipping with a group of people?	"This is my first post on this sub. I found this place a while ago and KNEW I was going to need it.

This happened just a few days ago. My girlfriend works for an organization that takes people on camping trips. while on this trip, some of the participants were talking about going skinny dipping. She told me this exactly: "" I wasn't sure if i even wanted to go in the first place but then of the participants where asking about going before we came back from yellow stone so i decided to do it. I was only naked for a few minutes before i jumped in. It was dark so the other people couldn't see me nor could I see the other people. I didn't touch anyone nor did i look in any else's direction.""

Honestly, I believe what she says and I believe that she wouldn't cheat on me or do anything to mess up our relationship. BUT its bothering me because SHES IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME! I believe that when you get into a relationship with someone, that you shouldn't be naked in front of other people. That's my expectations. I feel like i have that expectation because I've been cheated on before by girls who've said literally the same exact thing that my girlfriend is saying now! I am not saying that i am going to be a stalker bf who will follow my gf around everywhere she goes, but that doesn't mean that i don't have my own insecurities about other guys doing shit without me knowing. I know that i can't be in control of this situation but i feel like you should at least try and be responsible to say ""although i have a set of values that differ from my significant other, i respect my significant other enough to cross their boundaries."" Am I crazy for thinking that? It hurts me to know that my girlfriend is willing to cross my boundary just because she wants to have fun. I just don't believe that fun should come at the expense of your significant others feelings or vulnerabilities. Am I the asshole for believing that?

Update: 

So just from the few conversations I've seen in the comments, it seems like I am trying to be controlling/possessive. That's not my intention at all. I try and tell my girlfriend all that time that anything I say is not to be manipulative or crazy, because (Just based off personal experience) i know what it feels like to be in a manipulative relationship. At-least that's what I believe. I just feel like if I'm in a relationship, i like to know that i'm not sharing my partner with anyone else. Is that really the wrong way to see this?

Update #2 - 

Let me just put this out there to keep the record straight. I didn’t blow up on her. I always try not to yell at her, even if I’m hurt because I know that words cut deep and I never want to be the person to say the wrong thing when I’m angry because (just like I told my gf) I know what it feels like to never be able to let go of someone’s words. 

So I talked to my girlfriend about this whole situation. Reddit, you’ve humbled me. I won’t go into all the details but I’ve had traumatic experiences with women, and to say that those experiences don’t find their ways into my thought process would be a lie. I’ve unfortunately been cheated on, I’ve been played, I’ve experience enough bad situations to know the red flags. This is probably something you all see happen a lot here. But with that all being said, the more that we talked, the more that we came to an understanding about each other boundaries in this situation. She told me that, although she didn’t expect this reaction from me, she was understanding enough to see that there is more of a story behind the pain that I try to hide. I’m not perfect, not even by a long shot, but honestly, to everyone who read this and commented: I sincerely was not trying to manipulate or control my gf in any way shape or form. That’s the absolute truth. I have high hopes of marrying this girl one day soon. But that’s exactly why I brought this whole situation up. My own Insecurities were driving me crazy thinking about all of this and trying to come up with a resolution that works for my gf and I. I was wrong though reddit, I was wrong because I didn’t take into consideration that she loves me and wouldn’t do the stuff that’s happened to me in my past. I didn’t trust at first that she would make the right decision and that I wouldn’t get hurt again. I jumped to conclusions and assumptions and just fell back into my defensive ways just to make sure I don’t get hurt, which I dono if everyone will understand but hey that’s why I am here now trying to explain this. I am the asshole, but the least I can say is I am an asshole with a good enough heart to learn from this and I learned a lot so thank you reddit, you’ve proved me wrong, taken away the little karma I have and made me a better person!"

c342ii	2019-06-21 01:06:14	DeliriousDila	AITA for getting mad at my friend for texting me everyday?	"Hi there ladies and gents. For sake of anonymity, this guy’s name is Sal. Sal and I are in the same program in school and I commutes all last semester. This summer I got a job in my field and moved near work and school. Sal told me about the apartment complex I moved to, and he also lives in. He lives in the next building, but with no windows facing me. 

Sal helped me move in, then I went back home for a week before work started. From the day work started and I was living here, he’s texted me everyday to hangout. Not exaggerating. Maybe once he missed a day. I try to hang out when I can but I always have errands to run after work; there’s always something I need to get for my new apartment (I needed a swiffer and pledge tonight lol.) 

One day I had a package outside the door, and before I was done picking it up, Sal texted me, “You just got home.”  Creepy, right? Last night, he texted me, at around 10, “Why’d you leave for work so late today you didn’t leave until 6:55?” 

He put me in a group chat at the end of last semester with some other classmates, which I silenced, because all they do is share memes about SpongeBob jerking off. I. Shit. You. Not. So last week my girlfriend was coming to see me. He texted me right after work to hang out and I told him I couldn’t and why. He puts in the group chat, “You know what’s sad? DeliriousDila is probably getting head from some girl and I’m going to bed.” Number one, it’s my business not to be broadcast to the world. Number two what if she saw it? 

I tried explaining this to him tonight and he got mad and came up with excuses like he was just getting home at the same time as me, the thing with the girl was funny, etc. eventually he got even more mad and said I changed and walked away. 

To be clear, I thought it was cool moving someplace I already knew someone. I’d have someone to hangout with and if we ever needed help with something (moving furniture, etc) it’d be really easy. The constant texting, and stalking me is really what irritated me. So, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

" I need your opinion on a situation...Alright so i live with my boyfriend and his two sisters and we get along famously most of the time. But today one of his sisters up and decided she was going to adopt a super hyper poorly socialized destructive 2 year old dog without telling the three of us. Shes dead set on it, she literally will not listen to us...We live in a small apartment and already have a big dog that doesn’t like children and doesn’t get along with other dogs. Shes not considering kennel training and has shot us down every step of the way. She does home care and works about three shifts a week for about 3 hours each shift and would certainly have the time but i’m unsure about the funds. She already has two rats and is planning in getting two more as well. None of the other roommates think its a good idea and we really don’t want another super hyper dog in an apartment we are not even supposed to have dogs. Im not sure what to do im beyond stressed im a foster kid that had recently got   out of foster care and up and moved to another province and moved in with my boyfriend about a year ago. I have no say and im expected to just go along with it 
and im scared if i put up to much of a fight she will just kick me out for the dog. Even though i pay bills (the utilities internet power and heat and lights) i have no family and finding a place short notice is extremely difficult for me as im in a province were i dont know anyone. How do i make her see reason? Also despite my situation it would be cruel to have a puppy in the apartment this small with the sort of stoner lifestyle she lives she wont even talk about it with out saying shes “stressed” like if you cant even talk about it why are you getting a dog? i dont know what to do or how to move forward. 

i have all my name on the utilities but i really don’t want this dog and nothing is getting through to her? would i be the asshole if i just disconnected and left? Her dad that was living before had been paying the bills and hes an awesome dude so i dont wanna screw him over but im super uneasy. 

edit: I don’t mean just not pay my bills i just mean disconnect and stay in a hotel i guess. Although as you can see that would he hugely inconvenient and my average work week is about 80 hours.

edit: Also no technically her dads name is on the lease and i pay utilities and they send rent to there dad for the apartment itself i just pay the other stuff. Plus me and my boyfriend share a room so our rent is combined the  anyways lol."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

My girlfriend’s Mom has been dating a guy for about 7 years and he is a big part of their family, she sees him as a step dad. Well my girlfriend’s “step dad” has an adult brother who is having a birthday party this weekend on Saturday night. I have never met this side of the family and won’t know many people there. This also happens to be the only night that my girlfriend and I have the house to ourselves in at least 6 months and we probably won’t get that opportunity again anytime soon. We both told girlfriend’s Mom we were going to go to the party a few weeks ago but totally forgot until today. I asked her if we could skip it and enjoy the night in together since it is a rare opportunity but she is pretty dead set on going and cancelling our planes of making a fun dinner and staying in together. So I honestly don’t know what the best way to go about this is and am not sure if I am in the wrong. AITA?	Asshole	0	0
c34267	2019-06-21 01:05:21		AITA for telling my girlfriend to build credit?	"TL;DR : me and gf argue over credit. I say it’s important and will help us find better rental. She says it doesn’t matter and we could live the same without it. I laughed at her opinion.

Me and my girl are 18, we have been together since we were 16 and lived together for a year. We are currently in the process of moving out of our SHITTY rental to get something slightly better. The reason we got such a shitty rental in the first place was because we were two 17 year olds fresh out of high school (we turned 18 at the send of summer after high school) we had nothing besides our jobs to show to landlords. no credit, no rental history, no cosigner.

So we move in a roach infested house with cracks in the walls, plastic floor tiles, moldy walls, you name it. It used to be a basement so parts of the floor are damp in the winter too. 

Anyway, I never want to live like this again and have been working hard to better myself. I have 1500$ in stocks, $1000 in savings, and managed to get a credit score of 710 after I got my credit card on my 18th birthday. 

My girlfriend however REFUSES to build credit. I normally wouldn’t care what she does but her finances effect me too. In the process of trying to get another rental (which I am in charge of doing) I have had to skip multiple places who wouldnt except no credit. I feel like i have to  vogue for her and hope my credit score is enough to get the landlord to rent to us. We already don’t make a lot of money and it’s hard meeting 3x rent, in my eyes, her having no credit is just another blow we don’t need.

But she took a financial class with the teachings of Dave Ramsey and now she thinks she doesn’t need credit. We got into a discussion *argument* about it and it was basically just a back and forward of her saying you don’t need credit and me saying that you do. Of course I know you don’t NEED credit, it just makes things a lot easier. And I told her that I agree with her in the case that you have enough money so that no one is worried about you paying back what you owe. 

But of course we don’t have money like that, and if you saw my bank account without my credit score you would hesitate to loan me half a bag of dirt.

Anyway, it ended with her saying “life would be the same if you have credit or you don’t” and I strait up smirked and laughed at her. I know it was fucked up, but I swear I couldn’t help it. Just thinking about all the extra challenge I’ve had finding a rental because she doesn’t have credit made it blatantly obvious to me that she is wrong."		1	0

My girlfriend is great, she’s sweet and caring and very intelligent. She moved in recently and I briefed her about how I have a large dog who is aggressive towards other dogs/strangers. We have a large stockade fence in the backyard that protects him from getting out and he mostly stays inside. She woke up this morning to let him outside. Every day, like clockwork I usually let him out and always glance at the fence gate to make sure it’s shut. (It doesn’t just open on its own unless there’s a tornado or something or if the yard workers come and open it). My dog got out, because she didn’t check. I freaked out, this dog is my everything. I was yelling and literally having a panic attack because I knew if he came in contact with anyone or anything he could get hurt or hurt someone. Luckily nothing bad happened and we got him to come back inside, but my girlfriend was really upset at how mad I got and left the house for a breather and to “think”. My dog has never gotten loose in 6 years, and just the thought really upset me. AITA?		1	0
c340to	2019-06-21 01:01:49		WIBTA if I left my job before I said I would?	"Hey, I have a pretty specific situation, and just kind of need to know if I would be the asshole. Couple of name/location changes in here, but I tried to keep the meat of the situation the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

About a year ago, I was offered a job for a close relative (Peter) doing tax work. This came at a really good time because I had just graduated with a bachelor's in accounting, but I couldn't get any interviews with local firms. I needed to move from Philly to Boston in order to accept the job, but my wife needed to stay in Philly in order to complete her bachelors. She was on a very specific academic track at the university she was attending, and we realized it wasn't realistic to transfer her somewhere else. After a really hard conversation, we decided I'd take the job and just make the long distance work.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Since Peter understood I'd need to pay for the Philly apartment, He allowed me to live in his home -- rent free. I tried to say no, but he insisted, and I honestly did need the money. Then, when my car broke down in October, he allowed me to drive his son's car for three months -- also no charge for that. During my stay there, he also fed me. I moved out and have a roommate, but I know that it was no small cost for them to house me for nearly a year.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, when it comes to work, Peter and I don't get along at all. I'm subject to his mood swings, and I have discovered he is a bad teacher. While we don't have screaming matches, he cannot help but 100% broadcast if anything is bothering him. If a client frustrates him on a call, he slams the phone down, and just rants. He will do similar actions when frustrated with any of his employees-- just completely broadcast his disapproval and make an ass of himself. This interrupts the flow of the work I do. In one moment I'm allowed to ask him anything, and in the next making eye contact with him feels like I could set off a bomb. The kicker is, I have a gentleman's agreement that I will 1)Give him around 4-6 months notice before I leave (I kind of understand this, he has to plan his year around how many people will work for him) and 2) I would try it out for two ""busy seasons"", and that ends in April.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was recently scouted by another firm here in Boston, and they're offering me a much higher compensation package. I'd be receiving healthcare, a CPA Exam reimbursement (around $4.5k), and a considerable raise (like, from $25k to $55k). My wife is saying I should just leave Peter's firm, that I'm not paid enough for the stress I'm under. I've already decided to leave the firm by giving my notice around November and staying through April (that way the promise is fulfilled), but would I be the asshole if I just took this job and ignored the original agreement?

I don’t wanna know your opinion on the validity of the relationship, I hear enough of people telling me it’s not real already.

He lives in Europe and I live in America. We want to meet, and his well off parents have offered to pay for me to come visit as his birthday gift. I really want to meet him, and as a bonus it would help get me out of a very toxic home situation (emotionally and financially abusive home I’m basically a prisoner in). There is only one small problem.

Planes gives me extremely bad anxiety. I’m not taking “sometimes I get nervous on airplanes” kind of anxiety I’m talking full blown suffocating panic attacks for the entirety of the flight. I have been on planes twice in my life for extreme family reasons, and on both occasions it was 10+ hours of pure misery and my own personal hell. I couldn’t think or breathe, my sleeping pills weren’t working, I felt trapped and terrified. I was hyperventilating for hours, throwing up everything I had and dry heaving while sobbing and struggling to breathe. They were some of the worst experiences of my life, and I am genuinely terrified of planes and flying.

My boyfriend’s family say they will only help if I come to Europe, since they understandably don’t want to send their son to America (although he was born here and has citizenship) alone to meet a complete stranger. I understand that, but I’m also so terrified of the 16-20 hour flight I’ll have to be on to go see him. I kept trying to tell myself I could do it because it’s worth it to meet him, but as it stands now I really don’t know if I can do it. I’m scared. I would feel awful if I couldn’t end up going. He spent weeks convincing his parents and we talk a lot about what we want to do when we meet and we’re honestly both impatient to meet. But I really don’t think I can make it through the flight."

My aunt storms in the house and screams for me to get my ass out of my room and told me its too fucking hot outside to leave them outside for that long. I showed her my timer and it showed 4 minutes and 15 seconds and she kept repeating that i couldve killed her dogs because its hot outside but it was legit nearly 5 minutes and they have full water bowls and food bowls but apparently its totally okay for her to kick my cat outside on all types of weather and its apparently not too hot for him to her. 

So redditors, am i the asshole for this?

I live in a touristy sort of area so we matched when she was  here on holiday here, she lives about 2 hours away and funnily enough  I'm relocating near her for work soon.

Okay  we were talking for a while and I got with another girl, nothing  serious, one night stand sort of thing. I don't remember how but we were  on facetime talking about the subject and I just sort of mentioned it  as a passing comment. I didn't think much of it. She flipped and went  crazy at me but we hadn't clarified if we were seeing eachother or  anything like that so I can't understand why she was mad.

We  didn't talk for about a week but I managed to sort of smooth things  over. But whenever we talked about NSFW stuff she jokes about it saying  stuff like ""Oh like you did with that girl you fucked when we were  talking"" and stuff like that

**Bare in mind we haven't met**

We were pretty poor.My dad had another kid &this time the woman abandoned him&the kid.When my brother visited him he came back really sad that my father was an actual father to that kid but he couldn’t be to us.It hurt me to see my big hard brother so vulnerable.I started having more resentment towards my father.I would regularly sent him money including Xmas gifts to his kid (my half brother I’ve never met)but also had my own financial struggles so it became harder to send him money.As the yrs went he’d contact me through my aunt that he needed money so I’d sent him some but never regularly.Even my brother would too sometimes.So now he’s really old.All his other kids have pretty much stop helping him I guess.The last one he raised moved away.He’s old sick& needs financial help.He’s been asking my aunt to get ahold of me& my brother to tell us he needs money.We sent him some last month.Yesterday my aunt messages me that he asked her again.Honestly I can spare it but I’m not going to be doing this regularly.Why the fuck should I help him when he never helped us. That’s my way of thinking.It really always was but my family would guilt me into sending him money-my mom’s family btw.They knew him &they feel sorry for him.My mom tells me to do what I want.That regardless he’s still my father but ultimately not to let anyone push me into doing anything cuz only I know how I feel.I once got into this huge fight with them &pretty much told them to fuck off that they had no idea the damage he had caused us.They never told me shit again.So now my aunt sends me passive aggressive messages like “I’m just passing along the message, he’s old &sick but I’m no one to judge just let me know what you want me to tell him”.So finally aita for feeling that it’s not my responsibility to help a man that didn’t help me/us.I feel like I’m not but then sometimes I feel like I am cuz he’s my father regardless.I don’t mind sending him money every once in a while I’m just tired of him &my family thinking it’s my responsibility as his daughter.When the fuck was he a father to me or my brother?So aita		1	0
c33vqb	2019-06-21 00:48:33		WIBTA for asking to not be the only one to haul ice?	"For context, I work at a gas station, and ice is brought by a company and put in a freezer outside and then has to be brought into a freezer inside. Only one other guy works at this gas station, but he is only there on Fridays. 
There are lots of jobs to do on our list for employees at the gas station to get done each day, some tasks can only be completed at certain times, while others can be completed anytime. 
Hauling ice inside can be completed at anytime, but is always left for me to do when I come in. I presume this is due to me being the only guy. I know it isn’t a coincidence that it is always on the list for me, as even if there are very few things on the list, and even when the other employee says it’s been really slow all day, hauling ice is still on the list. And often if I don’t come one day, they simply let it get really low and let me do it the next day.
Don’t get me wrong, hauling ice isn’t super terrible or something, the bags are only 20 pounds. So I’m not annoyed that I haul ice, I’m annoyed that The other employees think I’m the only one who should have to do it. I want to ask about it, but I fear that if I did ask, they would grudgingly do it sometimes, but then neglect to do anything else leaving me with more jobs."	Not enough info	1	0

His mom, while nice and I pay rent to, is a super clean freak and anal about having things her way, which is very very particular. I go along with most of it, but the way the bed is made up is becoming my breaking point.

Boyfriend and I occupy one of the bedrooms and have a reversible comforter. Half of the time I make the bed up in the morning before work and use the ""cream"" colored side. Boyfriend will use the ""green"" side. Our personal preferences. I will leave my small throw pillow on the bed and fold my blanket and drape it (neatly) on the edge of the bed.

His mom goes into our room each day (annoying to me because of lack of privacy) and when I make the bed, she'll flip it to the green side and take my pillow and blanket and throw it in the closet. There is a bunch more she'll do, like remove anything I have on the nightstand (a book, glasses, etc), rearrange things in the room, move stuff around in my bathroom, etc. But the bed thing is driving me nuts!! 

AITA for thinking she is being ridiculous or should I simply conform to how she wants it done (like everything else... and that's a lot)? I can't even sit on the comforter without her complaining.

c33vfq	2019-06-21 00:47:49		AITA for feeling hurt that my boyfriend has an anxiety attack when I masturbate?	"This cuts deep for me because I was raised extremely sex negative in a very Catholic household. I used to feel so much guilt and shame during and after when I first started doing it around age 15. My current boyfriend was raised with total (some might say too much)  sexual freedom and has slept with around 4 times as many people as i have. However apparently these girls never masturbated around him?
 I could understand if it was linked to trauma or he just didn't know what he's supposed to do but he's obviously very sexually experienced so i dont get it.  And neither does he apparently. All I know is that he first told me that he enjoys watching girls masturbate but then when i do he acts like i just shat the bed! Which then makes me feel as gross as Catholicism dictates i should. I'm not religious any more but the guilty feelings remain, I'm sure a lot of ex-religious folks can relate.
I've sworn off doing it in front of him just to save myself from feeling gross or selfish. Personally I can't imagine being with someone in a sexual relationship while also needing them to not touch themselves in my presence? It'd help if he knew why he behaves like this but he's basically only just realised, having stormed out of the room after telling me it was okay to go ahead last night. 
I'm confused, hurt and anxious about hurting him with my sexual needs. It's not like he doesn't want to have sex, he does a lot.  If its just me ringing the devils doorbell then that gets him all stressed out..."	Not the A-hole	1	0

	Last month, I was able to get an internship in Tennessee, but room and transportation was not included. There were two other interns, and I was hoping I could room with them. I found out that they already got a place, and it was a guest house that served breakfast and dinner. I would have to get a single room but it lot more than I wanted to pay so I scrambled to find a place as it started in two weeks. I was able to find a place for a lot cheaper after stressing for a week and a half. I decided to bring my car down because I am from IL and did not want to pay for Ubers and there were no buses or trains. 

I drive down on Saturday and get settled. The internship starts on Monday, but I have to meet up to fill out some paper work on Sunday. The next day I go to the place I work and fill out the paper work, and I meet the other intern. He seemed outgoing and nice from the short time I spent with him. This is where the problem starts. At work he is complaining all day about how bored he was and that we should leave. All we had to do was listen to people talk about the company and we got paid. After work we ended at 5 because of training. He lives with other people who work at the factory, but they are line workers and we are interns. They are able to drive him in the morning as we all start at the same time, but they get off at 5:30 and we get off at 4. He would have to wait about an hour and a half. He asks me if I can drive him a guy I barely know. If it was a buddy of course I would drive them. As I was already annoyed with him, I told him no because he lives the opposite direction from me and my 20 min drive home becomes an hour drive. I also barely know the roads and not a confident driver. If I drove him the first time he was going to ask again and again. He should have figured his transportation on his own. He asked me all week and I said no each time. He was able to find one who lives closer to him. Also, he ends work at 4:30 as his department has meetings while mine doesn’t, so I would have to wait even longer. He never even mentioned he would pay for gas.

I am arrogant as fuck. I'm convinced that if i tryhard i win no matter in what domain.

Honesty is super important between us, i and he think that it's a win of time

I tryharded some games and as a result of 6 months of full tryhard (i have no life) :

2100 ELO in Lichess.org




I love my friend, he always knows how to make me feel good, he's like someone that always holds me before i fall. and i don't understand how his my friend, i feel i don't deserve him as a friend.

This happened three days ago, in my parents house (we're i live) we we're playing video-games and i've always beaten him. i won some chess games and I felt at this moment he wanted to tell something that came from the abyss of his heart and he told me :

""Do you think i'll beat you someday ?""
I answered : ""Maybe if you train enough""
He : ""... you know i can't right ?""
(...)
Me : ""Can you please shut up ?""

I said this and he understood what it meant : ""I don't wan't to talk about this it really makes me feel bad cause i think that you can't.""

After this he told me it was late he needed to go ...

I saw the opposite of hope in his face, i never saw him like that.

We will not be allowing anyone in, but my in-laws will be the problem, not my family. We are a gay couple that will be using a surrogate. Between my family and his, there would be 20 people in the room and a surrogate laying on the bed.

There’s a couple reasons we talked about doing it this way. When our baby comes, the woman who birthed her will be right there. We do not want to go to another room outside of hers. We want to spend that moment after - instead of saying, thanks for the baby, bye. After the birth there will be 20 people she doesn’t know thanking her and paying attention to the baby. It might also be hard to separate seeing her as the mother rather than us bringing home a child. I’m having a little trouble describing the emotion of what I mean, so please ask questions if this was not clear enough for you!

I know they will be furious. AITA if I don’t let anyone come to the hospital?

Edit: Thank you so much for so much feedback. You have all been great! I’ve gotten a lot of questions about the surrogates situation and thoughts.

First, I am the biological father in the situation. She is not the biological mother. We are going through an agency which does allow myself and my partner there, as well as my family. Also, the reason her feelings about people there are not being questioned is because we will not have anyone there even with her being happy to do so. I probably should have explained this, so sorry!

EDIT2: There seems to be some confusion about the process. When we started working with the agency, we let it be known that we would like the be in the room when our child is born. In this case, the agency would never match us with a surrogate who had a problem with us in the room. Of course we respect her! Which is why we are asking family not to be at the hospital. To respect her privacy. I’m sorry I got defensive to some of you, I just never want someone to think I have no respect for the woman who is doing something this amazing!

This isn’t a validation post. Just because you are doing right by one party does not mean someone else is not allowed to be hurt (even if they understand). My question was to help me determine whether I should feel guilt or understanding about the situation or move on and say, it is what it is."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c33rio	2019-06-21 00:38:11	sweetgemberry	AITA for asking someone to speak quieter in a public place?	"My parents, brother, and I went out for father's day dinner. We went to this Korean restaurant and we always get a grilling table. We were seated in a semi-private area. The ""rooms"" are separated from the rest of the restaurant in that each one has a doorless entry so we still hear a lot of the sound, but aren't surrounded by it. The ""rooms"" are partially separated from each other in that there's a straw-like shade curtain thing that falls halfway to the ground from the ceiling between each ""room"".

Halfway through the meal, another family is seated next to us. Then I can hear someone initiate a FaceTime call. Through the ambient noise, I can hear it very clearly. Then someone answers and the father starts talking really loudly. He doesn't stop for at least 10 minutes. I try to zone him out, and I'm mildly successful until my parents make a comment about the language he's speaking in, wondering what it was out of curiosity bc they'd never heard it before. Then my brother says the guy's being loud.

With other people paying attention to it, I pay more attention to it and then I got more annoyed by it. I lifted the curtain slightly and right as I was doing it, my dad and brother make a face and are basically like stop, wtf are you doing.

I ignore them and say nicely and in a quieter voice ""hi, sorry, would you be able to speak a little quieter?"" And the dad is surprised and looks embarrassed and says ""sorry, yes"" and that was it. We enjoyed the rest of dinner and we didn't hear someone yelling by our table anymore.

My brother said ""why'd you do that"" as if it was wrong of me to ask someone to respect the public space we're in. I said I didn't ask for anything unreasonable and no one got offended.

c33qre	2019-06-21 00:36:17	0utsiderThrowaway	WIBTA if I stopped hanging out with my boyfriend’s friends over personality differences?	"My boyfriend (I’ll be referring to him as “R” for brevity) and I are both in our early/mid twenties, and recently moved to another state together. R is also an active gamer and has a lot of close online friends all over the world, and a few just so happen to live in the state we’ve moved to. R has been really excited for me to meet them because it’s sort of his dream for all of us to be one big happy friend group. I wanted that too!

Only now that I’ve met these friends, I’m starting to realize that they aren’t the sort of people that I’d ever hang out with on my own. Two of the friends, N and V, are just really... obnoxious, in my opinion. They’re loud and sort of disrespectful, like rebellious teenagers. They’re decent enough but also very off-putting to me as a more introverted person.

Another friend, C, just sort of makes me uncomfortable. Sometimes he says some pretty “insensitive” things, like calling people f*ggots in a joking manner or saying gross stuff about women or the entire continent of Africa for some reason?? It’s very bizarre to me. N and V laugh it off though and R just ignores it, and I’m the only black person in the group so I’m just too nervous to speak up on my own.

The only other female friend, A, is friendly and mellow, but apparently R told her that I was bi (she’s bi too) and so she constantly flirts with me, or makes sexual comments about my body and tries to touch me. I try to latch onto R when she’s around (again, I’m terrible at asserting myself) but he either plays along or doesn’t react. A has even suggested that the whole group go to a strip club sometime which I’d never in a million years want to do (and I admit that it sort of hurt my feelings when R didn’t immediately decline either), but it sucks being the odd one out who would constantly be raining on everyone’s proverbial parade.

So now I’m just thinking about not hanging out with any of them any more, even though it might hurt R’s feelings. I know I’m a sensitive person to begin with so I figured it’d be best to just remove myself from any future uncomfortable situations instead of expecting everyone to change for me. But when I confided in a family member about this, they thought I was being too judgmental. I admit I’m pretty sheltered, so I can see where they’re coming from, especially since R’s friends all already seem to like me.

All of these “incidents” have been quick, minor things that aren’t really all that noticeable until they start building up in my mind. R is also very adamant about putting me before other people and I’m afraid he wouldn’t hang out with his only irl friends as much anymore if he knew how I felt about them. I don’t want to socially isolate him at all. I don’t want to be “that” girlfriend.

TLDR: Boyfriend’s friends aren’t really my “type”. I’m considering just not hanging out with them anymore even though it might hurt boyfriend’s feelings."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c33n5z	2019-06-21 00:27:55		AITA for telling my boyfriend I didn’t like my birthday gift	I want to first clarify that I loved my boyfriend very much and have always been grateful for everything he’s done for me, that being said this feels like the exception. My boyfriend tended to generally date women that he perceived as “girly “, and although I’m not really a tomboy, I’m not much for feminine things either. When I say “girly” I mean along the lines that he’d prefer me to wear dresses or shorts as compared to jeans and a T-shirt which he once referred to as “manly”. Just trying to cover up in 30 degrees dude, but okay. When my birthday came around my boyfriend asked me what I would like as a gift, and I told him that I would just like to go out and have a day together. Although he agreed to this. He insisted he get me a gift I could open and so he suggested jewelry. I told him I don’t really like jewelry and I didn’t want it to be a waste of money because I more than likely wouldn’t wear it. When I told him this his response was somewhere along the lines of “That’s ridiculous, every woman likes jewelry”. I told him clearly it wasn’t every woman because I don’t like it. He argued with me a bit about it, but I told him I simply wanted to go out and enjoy a day with nature or go to a wine and paint night. He agreed, but when my birthday comes around and he picked me up for our date he hands me a small black gift bag, and I’m sure you can guess what was in it. If you guessed a necklace you were right! He seemed genuinely excited about the gift so I didn’t tell him I disliked it and I let him put it on me anyway. We went on our date as usual and the evening was lovely because despite him not listening to me about not getting jewelry, he did listen about what kind of date I wanted. It had been about a month since, and I didn’t always wear the necklace. When he would come to see me as soon as I got in the car he would look for it, and if I wasn’t wearing it he insist I put it on. For a while I agreed because he spent a good amount of money on it and I didn’t want to complain, however eventually I got tired of him asking me to go back inside and put the necklace on, so said “I didn’t want the fucking necklace anyway, so I’m not going all the way back inside to put it on”. I immediately felt bad, and I could tell it really hurt his feelings. I would have loved to tell him in a nicer way or not at all, but I got frustrated with the constant demand to put it on that I reacted the way I shouldn’t have. It has been a while since my boyfriend passed away and I still feel regret from that moment. He genuinely tried to get me a gift and I told him I didn’t want it and thinking about how disappointed he seemed really breaks my heart. Although I’m sure I know the answer to this I would still like to ask, am I the asshole?	Not the A-hole	0	0

My mother is pushing for me to do counseling or parenting classes, which I don't agree with. As I've told her, I know he's having a hard time, and I know I'm having a hard time figuring out how to help him. However, I'm not willing to waste my time for someone to tell me what I already know. It's not the knowledge that I am lacking, it's implementation. I would rather spend the time with my kids, not have to worry about a sitter, and just keep trying new strategies.

I was driving home from work and the final stretch has this turn I hate.  You will 100% be stopped at this light at least 2 times, even in mild traffic if you want to turn left (30 sec green arrow, single turn lane that splits from the main two lanes, can only fit about 8 cars in the lane before the backup blocks the left lane).  On bad days this light can catch you like 4-5 times, on those days I usually pass the turn and go to the next light to reach my destination, adds about 3-5 mins but it's worth it if the light is backed up, because going straight at that light is always clear.  This is where problems come in.  Since going straight is always clear, sometimes we have lane jumpers, and I have no issue not letting those guys in for the most part, but then there's today.  Today was more mild traffic, but I knew I would wait at least 2 stops.  Sure enough, after waiting for the first round of lights to cycle, i'm the 3rd car in the turn lane.  A car from the left-most straight lane rolls down their window and waves to get my attention.  They want in.  I never want to let someone in who is just trying to cut the lane in their own self-interest, but sometimes I understand there are exceptions.  Maybe she was new and didn't realize she needed that turn, maybe she doesn't know about the out of the way turn to get to the same place, but takes a little longer.  I thought for a sec, and just shook my head ""No"".  The reason I feel like I might be the asshole, is because they were very polite about it.  Got my my attention, asked to get in because it appeared they missed an opportunity to get over, and even when I said ""No"" they looked dejected and just rolled up their window and that was it.  They weren't rude like other drivers we've all seen.  I feel bad, but I was thinking, if I let them in, that's someone else that was going to make the turn who isn't because they followed the rules of the road and you didn't.  So, AITA?"

So if you don’t know what charro is, it’s a Mexican attire, with the boots and hat. My child will be baptized this Saturday so I sent my brother in law a photo of a baptism outfit in charro and said, this is what we got him. Well he showed it to his mom, she called her sister in Mexico and told her I got that outfit. They got excited and when I told them, just kidding I didn’t, she called her sister back and now I’m the asshole. She told my husband she doesn’t like jokes, and she’s upset about it. I now feel uncomfortable because the joke wasn’t for her in the first place. I feel like she’s blowing it out of proportion. So AITA? Or is she blowing this out of proportion? I’ve always known she doesn’t like jokes, but I sent the message to my brother in law not her.

So quite a long time ago I met one of my closest friends, Sarah, through our mutual romantic interest, David. Sarah and I got along amazingly despite both having a crush on David, and in the end David chose to pursue me and things didn’t work out due to my own toxic behavior and we had a horrible ending to our relationship. Sarah remained one of my best friends during the entire exchange and I love her dearly. For years her and I remained friends and David was just an inside joke between us. 
I recently began counseling and was able to identify my own toxic behaviors and began to make amends at the recommendation of my therapist. David was the first one who I extended an olive branch to. He gladly accepted due to our previously close friendship and our friend group (Sarah, David, and I) came back together. 
Everything was all fine and dandy until David asked me if we could spend more time together because he had ended his previous relationship and wanted to try to fix our romantic relationship. I rejected because I felt that our relationship should not be romantic because of how our relationship had ended and he accepted this. Flash forward to yesterday. Sarah is over the moon because David and her have spent more time together and are choosing to pursue a romantic relationship together and they are both extremely happy. I was ecstatic because I wanted them to both be happy, and I always felt that they would be a good fit for each other. Then Sarah informed me they had started dating the day after David tried to mend our romantic relationship. I got very uncomfortable and kind of panicked, so I didn’t mention it to her because of how happy she seemed to be. 

I’ve been feeling like a huge asshole, and I also feel like I would be creating unnecessary issues by telling her. My best friend told me she would want to know in Sarah’s shoes, but my other close friend told me that they weren’t technically together at the time and I did not know enough to get involved. I’m starting to lean towards keeping it to myself because of how happy she is.

"I can't go into exactly what the situation is due to privacy and my own reasons but, basically I did something that my boyfriend thinks is rude (that we've joked about before) and he got really mad about it. I told him I didn't personally see what the issue with it was but I wouldn't do it again because it obviously hurt him, but that's not good enough apparently.

Pretty much what I am going to say, to finalize it.

""I'm sorry I did what I did. While I don't fully understand why it was wrong, I'll be sure not to do it ever again because it put you in an uncomfortable situation and I don't want to do that.""

Sorry if this isn't the right place for this...

EDIT:
I realize you can't get a proper grasp without info... I'm just embarassed about it.
Asdgdkfhs okay here goes. He caught me touching myself (absentmindedly, I was horny and it just sort of happened) next to him.

I was understandably embarassed and tried telling him that I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be doing that. I immediately stopped when I realized what I was doing.

We're in the comfort of our own room, he's on his phone and watching tv, and so was I.

I wasn't like, hardcore masturbating next to him. I said I was sorry and that I was going to go take a shower, which I'd been meaning to all day.

Immediately he holds me back saying ""no you're just going to go finish in the shower.""

I thought he was joking so I joked back ""yeah I am.""

We've joked about stuff like this before, and he's never serious with me. Add that onto the fact that I'm autistic and terrible about knowing if he's ever serious in the first place....

So I was hanging out with my friends and we were bike riding and we had stopped at a drug store for some drinks. As I walk in, I notice this one girl was also in the store who sat in front of me in math class. The thing about this girl is that she had been super annoying all year and she’d always be rude to me because I’d discuss my opinions with my friends, and she didn’t exactly agree, but she’d never keep it to herself. (I lean to the right, her to the left) Anyway, I knew that she’d always get offended and super mad when people said things like retarded or faggot. So as I walked past her, in a voice just low enough for her to hear, I told my friend. “Man, this aisle layout is retarded. Why are the condoms next to the Gatorade?” She then pounced and said how what I said was “ableist” and how it’s not ok to say blah blah blah.

A while later we were sitting down for lunch, and he said to me that he couldn't find himself the confidence to break up with her, and was instead going to have sex with her, and THEN break up with her. I told him this was a bad idea, but soon enough he ended up following through and ditching said girl after supposedly having sex.

  
 Lately, he's been crushing on more and more of my friends, asking me for their Instagram, Snapchat etc. All times so far, I've lied and told them I don't know what their Insta or whatever is before trying to segway back to regular conversation. So far he's crushed on three of my friends, and all times I've warned them to be careful around him and told them of his past relationship's downfall.

 Last year a few weeks before Thanksgiving, two of my friends (Katie and Jess) had brought up the idea to spend the holiday at one of their houses. Katie decides that she wants to do it at her house.  She lives in a different state than Jess and I, so flying was the best option. Flying during the holiday season is very hectic and expensive. I told them from the very beginning that I had just started a new job a few weeks ago and said didn't think I could accumulate enough time off to go. Also, I was short on money due to the holiday season and starting new said job. 

The following week, Jess calls me and tells me that she spent $500 on a plane ticket for me to be at Katie's house. I was a little upset she did that because I did not ask her to do that, but didn't voice it in our phone call. 

The week of Thanksgiving comes around, and my work schedule is locked in tight. I tried to see if I could work something out for the days, management won't budge. I can't go. I call Jess immediately. She calls the airline, then texts me a picture of the receipt saying ""They won't let me cancel it to save my life."" At this point I already knew where this was going. I didn't respond initially because I honestly didn't know how to, and forgot all together. The next week she's asking me when am I gonna pay her back. I told her I didnt think it was fair I had to pay her being that I didn't ask her to buy me a ticket. We argue, and I decided that to end it, I would give her half. I was livid to say the least, and that was the last time I talked to her. She texts me now and then, but I can't get past it. Katie reached out to me today and said that I was acting childish and should make amends.  I feel like Jess didn't consider the fact that not everyone has money just sitting around to spend at any point in time, especially during that time of year.

TL;DR: My friend bought me a plane ticket without asking me, knowing there was a strong possibly I couldn't go. Then gets upset when I can't and asks for her money back."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c336c9	2019-06-20 23:55:47	PiPstein	AITA for wanting a better computer at work?	"Hola friends,

So, long story short, I work in IT, moreso on the business side of things (business analyst) but because we're running a skeleton crew and we're small anyways, I wear a lot of hats, including IT support at times.

I've been at this company for about a year and I finally, *finally* got my manager to agree to let the others teach me more support related stuff so that I can take our on call phone and help out (because it's basically three of them right now passing it back and forth and two have smaller children, so it's hard for them to take it so often - they've been begging him to have me start taking it, too).

However, the only thing holding me back is my work laptop. The one I have is a 6 year old Windows 7 machine that was turned back in to us because it has a lot of problems; I got it simply because I needed a Windows laptop to run certain software when I'm not at my desk sometimes (some of the keys are broken, it crashes at times, and it dies the instant it's off a charger).

To do on call support, I need a better laptop with Windows 10 for the software we use for administration, but he keeps dragging his heels on it. Like he'll say he'll put through an order for one, but he always ""forgets"" and says he'll be sure to do it. Or he'll go to our main hardware guy and be like, ""Isn't there *anything* we have spare that's new enough for her to use?"", even though the guy keeps telling him there's nothing we have that would work.

Normally I'd think we're just tight on money, but here's the thing: I'm the *only* one in my department that doesn't have a brand new one like this. My main computer is a mini desktop that's like 4 years old and almost no one company-wide has anymore. Additionally, everyone else got three brand new monitors each in my dept and I'm still on two (partially broken - one has to lean on the other to stay up) older ones that had gone through two people before me.

Additionally, it's not just my position that is stopping him; there's another guy in my dept. that has the same exact title as me that got brand new everything and they had him start on call support the moment he asked.

c335z3	2019-06-20 23:54:18	iamathrowawayAITA	AITA for telling my friends ex she was arrested?	"Okay kinda long and this is a throw away acct obviously. 

Two months ago my friend was arrested for possession of meth and paraphernalia that was positive for thc. This wasn’t her first time something was meth related to her. She failed a court ordered drug test and tested positive for meth last year. 

Well a couple of months ago I was looking up the arrest record for the guy who broke into my house. He has the same last name as my friend and I just typed “mason” into the last name search bar and my friends name came up. Totally and accident to find her. They were in jail for meth possession and had been for about a week cuz they couldn’t post bail. 


Now my friend has a child and she has been known to smoke pot and drive with said child in the car. Or drink and drive with their child in the car. She has been for the last 2 years her child has been alive. I’ve tried getting her into rehab or telling her to get her head out of her ass. No go. She refuses help and acts like everything is everyone else’s fault. 


So I use a fake profile on Facebook and search up her ex’s name because he’s the father of this child. I let him know that she was arrested for possession with another person. This isn’t the first meth related incident but it is the first arrest. But I wanted to know if she had their daughter or he did during the incident cuz that would have been a pretty traumatic thing for a 2 year old (almost 3) to witness. 


He apparently did not know she was arrested and then sued my friend for custody. Well turns out the meth isn’t my friends and she actually passed a drug test. She’s clean except for thc. The other person was the one who had the meth, and ended up trying to tell the cop it was my friends instead. So they both were arrested. The meth charges were dropped but the thc paraphernalia isn’t cuz pot is illegal in this state. 


Her ex still sued for custody and got a no contact order. Court was supposed to be today and my friend forgot about it and did not show. She lost 100% custody of her daughter. She can’t see her daughter for 12 months. She can’t even video chat.

But At first he was just like “fuck off.” And when I asked why he sent the image back to me. Now, I still didn’t get why he was mad about it. 

So I said “oh is this image to cursed for you” and he basically said “read the name”. And then I relied with “OH SHIT!!!” Thinking that he was joking around. So then he continues acting annoyed so now I asked why he was annoyed. I’ll just send pics of the discord chat so u guys can decide for ur self. https://imgur.com/a/PqIzxkN

Now, I’m basically saying “I did nothing wrong and your being sensitive, just because it had your name doesn’t mean it’s related to you”

So now basically, he’s mad because I didn’t catch on what  he was mad about to begin with.

So now I’m refusing to take the post down, and I’m just wondering

He bought a boat a couple years ago now retired and we plan to go from Spain to the carabians in a couple month. My wife and i are trying to conceive a second child. She thinks i am an asshole for risking my life and potentially leaving her a window. I feel like she is preventing me from reaching my dreams. Additionally my dad and is an experienced sailsman along with my uncle who will be part of the trip .

Edit: Since im getting some questions. The trip will take about two weeks. My wife will have to take of our kid with the help of her parents. I offered for her to come and have her parents babysit in that time. She thinks its too dangerous i dont. I would let let her go on a two weeks trip without me an take care of the kids...

c334w0	2019-06-20 23:49:47	InternationalCar0	AITA for how I ordered my toast?	"This has been haunting me for about 10 years.  I went for breakfast with a large group of friends.  I'm pretty shy and quiet and when the waitress asked for my order it went like this:
Waitress: ""What can I get for you?
Me: ""I'll have two eggs over easy and toast""
Waitress: ""What kind of toast would you like?""
Me: ""Just brown please"".
A few seats over and across the table sat a girl of east Indian descent, and she repeated unimpressed ""just brown?"" and kind of scoffed at me.  

I swear I made no racial connections to her and my toast.  I often minimize the things I do by adding ""just"" in front of it.  Example, ""oh its just me calling"", or ""just hanging out with friends"".  I swear if I was ordering rye toast I would have said ""just rye please"".
 
I think I (unintentionally) hurt her feelings or offended her. Afterwards I just kind of froze up and didn't know what to do.  I sat quietly and ashamed of myself for the rest of breakfast.

c334u7	2019-06-20 23:49:34	IFIFIFIFIFOKIEDOKIE	AITA For Buying a Car?	"I’ll try to be as brief as possible. My wife and I had a kid 1 year ago and moved into/bought a new house with the help of both parents. One gifted us a sum of money, and the other lent some money which we are paying back at 500/month.

In the new community we’ve realized that there would be a benefit to having two cars especially with the kid and I always knew it was coming. I work from home a lot during the day,but I also travel from work a bit with the car. My wife works evenings 4-830 with the car. So basically whoever is home with the kid is STUCK as you might imagine in a american style suburb. Would be nice to go do something, or know that if there was an accident she could get immediate medical assistance.

So the idea of a second car got into my head and I started looking around. Then my nostalgic youth came back and I remembered, as I often do, how badly I want to own a sporty car. I’ve wanted a Camaro for literally 20 years and I fantasize a bit. But to my amazement the car of my dreams all these years was actually about the same price 1 year used as getting a new honda civic or something, which is what we would have done. We already have one practical car (mazda 3) for the ikea runs and daily driving. It’s worth noting there are two years f payments left on that car and we do have debt but only mortgage, line of credit, and to my parents for the loan. No credit card.

Anyway, I first thought it was that this idea was insane insane. But I took it for a drive and the baby seat fit fine, it was fun, comfortable, and my wife actually liked it too. It will be a stretch for the budget, but I don’t want to pick up some clunker that’s going to need a bunch of maintenance. The idea of owning my dream car just seems too great, even if it means driving differently in winter and that it’s a bit more crowded in the car.

I know what you’re thinking, right? Wife shut me down. No, she is tentative about the finances but actually liked the car a lot.  She says if I want it I really should do the things like this while I’m young and still want them before life has me too jaded. I agree in a way... Obviously we also agree she can use the car too when she goes to work by herself so I’m left with the more practical car.

So... all seems good. But my wife made a comment that everyone might be “making comments” and her mom will be “upset” about this and it got me thinking that maybe this is just too selfish at this time and we should live with one car until my parents are paid back. It’s worth noting they did this to help us and said as long as we paid the interest on the loan there was no term to pay it back.

Long sorry... but AITA for getting a second car (that I have wanted since I was 12) in light of all this? My gut isn’t sure. I want the car and it feels attainable which is so hard to shake... but I don’t want to look like a total dick either. Regardless, I think we will need a second car so it seems like I should get something I will truly enjoy.

My sister just informed me she was getting induced and due on Saturday. She lives about a 5 hour drive away. Coincidently, the regional manager in my former department is having a BBQ on Saturday.

My former supervisor, who I idolize, told me he wanted me to attend the BBQ (for career development and politics etc), and kept saying “are you the one giving birth?” when I said I wanted to be there. He is fully career oriented and it’s almost stepping on his good will if I don’t attend.

Some more background: my grandfather passed this year and this is my parents first grandchild. Its pretty much the shining light on this year. I seriously want to go. 

Option 1: be there for my sister before and after she gives birth, and miss this BBQ.

Option 2: attend BBQ and head there Sunday after she gives birth.

I don’t know anything about childbirth or about what happens before/after/if I even have a place.

"I work two part-time jobs, one of which I work with my mom at a family owned retail store, and the owners are out of town on vacation. This has given me an additional 9 hours, bringing my grand total of weekly hours between both jobs to 53, and I'm runnin on empty. Lately, however, so has my bank account since my husband has been losing hours at his job. 

The stress has been getting to me, and I let my mom know how rough it's been. Her response was to tell me that I need to at least try to be stable. I told her honestly, ""I don't think I can do that, but I can sure as hell fake it!"" 

We then proceeded to get into a knock-down drag-out during work about how I needed to TRY and about how I really can't try. At the peak of this argument, she told me she's asked my dad to come in to work for me tomorrow, to which I said, ""Stop, that's not necessary; I can do that myself. I appreciate the offer, but I need the hours."" She said, ""That's fine, he'll come in under your code so you won't be working, but you'll still get the hours.""

I don't know about the laws on that or anything, but that just feels straight up wrong to me. It makes me feel pathetic when I know I'm capable of doing it. It's help that I didn't ask for. 

She pulled the ""I'm your boss"" card multiple times (she's the manager) and kept saying I was putting her ass on the line if I came in a sour-puss and was rude to the customers. I have NO IDEA where she got this idea of me from. I have always been kind to my customers regardless of my feelings or how bad my day has been. 

On top of all that, I think it's important to mention that my mom has been helping me and my husband out by giving us $20 for food here and there, and I've been super appreciative, but I feel indebted to her. I'm an adult (21f) and I should be able to do this on my own. This situation has just added to Mnt. Help-that-makes-me-feel-bad. 

I feel like an asshole and this whole situation is really pressing on my pride. I'm thinking about coming in to work tomorrow anyways and telling my parents that I can handle this on my own, but that I appreciate their offer. Would I be the asshole if I did?

c333k9	2019-06-20 23:44:18		AITA for not wanting to spend all of my money	"This is my first post so I'm sorry if I'm breaking any rules.

I go to college and live with my boyfriend since he's a student too. With my class schedule and homework, I can't really get a job as I do not have the time, but I have applied for a few positions at the school. Every month we get a stipend to pay for food and necessities. Since I have to make loan payments for school, mine is only $350. But I don't have to pay for rent or a car, so it's not too bad.

My boyfriend gets this amount every month, as well as extra cash every week, so they have about twice as much money per month as I do. When we go shopping, we try to alternate who pays for groceries, but it's usually him as he has more money to spare. As well as this:

He normally has me spend most or all of my money before the month is over (around week 2 I usually have less than $100). This is okay to him because he has his own money and can cover us for the rest of the month. But this makes me incredibly uncomfortable because I don't like needing to rely on him for my food because I don't really have other options other than to starve. Lately I've started trying to save my money so it can last closer to the end of the month (everything is spent by the next stipend), but every month it causes an argument which sometimes escalates to a larger fight. Sometimes during fights, especially if I already spent most of my money, I'll be accused of making him pay for everything.

About two years ago, we moved to our current town and my wife got herself a job.  We were and military family for six years, so she insisted that I be stay at home dad while she works this time around. 

We drink over at a friends house most weekends, and she invited a few of her work friends.  Now, I love my wife dearly, and she is soooooo beautiful...but when (we’ll call her) Debbie walked through the door with HER husband (who is now MY friend), my heart just flew outta my chest.  I did the typical “ah don’t worry, babe, she’s not hot” thing that people do and went about my night. 

Then Debbie started talking.  I was hooked on every word. The way she was so fun and funny and outgoing just gripped me.  Now, every time they come around, I find myself using up most of my conversation with Debbie, even though everyone is around.  I haven’t crossed any hellworthy lines, but it’s so bad that I think about her more than a few times a day. 

To make matters worse, the girls at her job were talking about how Debbie “looks at me way too much” and “they can tell Debbie has a thing for your husband.”

Still, I can’t bring myself to stop thinking about her, catching each others eyes when everyone’s around, talking to mostly her in social situations.   I’ve never touched her, but...I shouldn’t even be able to feel that way about somebody, yeah?

My mom and dad officially divorced a few months ago and it was messy to say the least. When everything went down I hated my dad with every fibre of my being and refused to talk to him for months before my sister pressured me to come visit him and we have since crafted a semi functional relationship, when things went down my mom encouraged me to have a relationship with him telling me I would regret it later in life.
In saying that...she’s recently been trying to stop me from going to see him, his fiancée and my step sisters. She often reminds me hes kind of a jerk and a tad transphobic (through hes fixing that and using proper pronouns and not dead naming me as much) and I cant entirely tell if its cause she dosent like dad or if she’s just trying to look out for me cause Im not the best when it comes to people being jerks.

I wouldn’t have called him a  friend for the duration of that time, In fact we didn’t exactly get along up until about three months ago. He’s one of my managers(Fast food) So we’ve exchanged numbers  but we didn’t start texting until after he broke up with his girlfriend. 
He’s started calling me darling and hun which I don’t really mind, I kind of rolled my eyes at it because It seemed a little silly.  he asked me out to hang with our mutual friends/Coworkers and we started drinking, he got absolutely blasted and kissed me on the lips, I need to specify it wasn’t coerced I simply wasn’t feeling it afterwards. The next day he didn’t even remember.  
Two weeks later he asked me out on a date which I agreed to, it was nice we watched a movie and ate lunch. That’s the extent of our relationship. So I went on his Instagram the other day and noticed that a couple of the descriptions on his post were changed to things like “I adore you” out of context. I thought it might have been directed towards me but then again I might be flattering myself a tad bit, but Then I looked at a couple of other post which were also changed to similar little affections. And lastly I found an entire love letter describing how great and beautiful i am and how he appreciates having me in his life. I don’t want to post the letter because it seems rude. My friends are telling me I’m being cold/callous for being a little creeped out. 

It just seems like I’m being hit with a truck instead of romanced and I’m a frankly irritated that he’s putting this much pressure into a brand new relationship. Am I the asshole?

So I have a college student friend who just moved into an apartment. Let's call her Alex. Problem is we have been planning a trip to California and now that she moved out into an apartment she has no money to go and the trip was cancelled because of it. The trip was supposed to be in 2 weeks. 

She has always been bad with money and is spending money needlessly. Before she moved out l, she and her boyfriend bounced around form each other's family's houses. Needless to say, I was really looking forward to this trip and am super mad about not being able to go. She wasn't kicked out of the house or anything. Just decided to move out now. (After the move, she left herself 17$ in her bank account).


So we have a group chat in Instagram, where she announced she couldn't go and we subsequently cancelled the trip. I asked why she moved out and told her to stop buying things that aren't important. (She is into making cosplay outfits and eats out all the time). I told her to stop making all these dumb purchases and she got mad at me and became defensive. I myself don't have a job but I am taken care of by my significant other. She pointed this out to me. I told her I was just trying to help. 

They went on a vacation a few months ago randomly one day and never asked me about it or invited me. They hang out ALL THE TIME and NEVER invite me to things. When I confronted her about this she said I made the 2 other friends who  were with her cry. It just annoys me because it's summer and I'm a college student and my boyfriend works so I'm home alone alot of the time.

They are super bad with planning and I hate how it made me lose the vacation as I was really looking forward to it. I think I'm still in the right I just got mad and went overboard. My boyfriend says I went WAY out of the line. AITA?

EDIT: first I tried to get an idea of her financial situation to see if we could budget for the trip and she got snippy with me. Then I got upset and later told her to stop needlessly spending money."	Asshole	0	0

I've been very public and outspoken about this for about a year, and this is something my friend has full knowledge of. I know that if I go see this movie, I'll be in a shitty mood from start to finish. I brought it up in the group chat my friend made for logistics, and another friend said it was a matter of loyalty in a half joking manner. My friend didn't seem to mind if I skipped out on this one, because we see each other all the time anyway. I thought it was fine, but now I'm feeling like maybe I should go.

"For context: I currently live with my parents and just got a decent job within the last year ($3000-4000 take home pay per month, which is decent for the cost of living in my area). I’m saving up for a down payment, and should be able to move out into a nice starter home before the end of the year. I’m not hurting for money. My situation is damn good compared to many others; my family has never been “can’t put food on the table” poor, but we’ve gotten by with a lot of scrimping and saving. Suffice to say, I’m used to being frugal. Part of that involves shopping at thrift stores; there are a lot of surprisingly nice items for dirt cheap, and I don’t feel the need to buy overpriced stuff from “regular” stores even though I now make a nice wage.  


The situation: I was trying on a pair of running shoes at Goodwill and felt a crunch in the toes. They looked pretty new, so I thought maybe it was the paper they stuff into shoes when they’re new in the box... But it was actually a $20 bill. I looked around to see if anyone had seen this happen, and there was nobody around. I pocketed the bill and I’ve felt ridiculously guilty about it ever since.  


The shoes were priced at slightly less than $20 at the thrift store. It’s possible that maybe someone donated them and legitimately forgot about the emergency cash they stashed inside (yet nobody from the store checks inside shoes before putting them out for sale, I guess?) But it’s also possible that someone hid the money as a charitable act, so that someone who maybe couldn’t afford the shoes would now be able to buy them. If that’s the case, I feel like I stole the money from someone who could have used it more.  


I did end up buying the shoes, they fit like a dream.  


I know it makes no sense logically to feel guilty about good luck. If I had seen that same bill fluttering down the street, I’d think nothing of taking it. But the setting makes me question whether I “deserved” that money if it was left intentionally for someone who couldn’t otherwise afford the shoes.  


AITA?

she starts singing and I automatically notice how generic her voice is, it has nothing special that would make her stand out and I do not think that she could get famous from her singing voice. you could also tell that she was trying to emulate christina Aguilera's voice. 

she then asked me what I thought and so I told her that her voice was lovely but very generic and nothing different, I also told her that she needs to stop trying to copy other singers and find her own style, but if she practiced and found the right singing coach she could be amazing. 

turns out I hurt her feelings and she is now not responding to my apology. 

the reason she sounded so generic was because she was trying super hard to sound exactly like christina aguilera.

TLDR at the bottom

Background: I’ve been with this guy for a while and it’s been amazing. I haven’t been with someone who treats me this well ever, and it feels like every time we are together, there’s this magic between us. He is patient and loving and absolutely incredible. We’ve been together for about a year now. We don’t talk about our past relationships much, mostly because I’ve been so guarded in sharing with what I’ve been through. 
About 3 years ago, I fell madly in love with a man who I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. I’ve never believed in love at first sight, but it was so immediate and powerful I couldn’t do anything but fall into it. After a year of dating long distance, we made plans to move to Colorado so start a new life together. A week before we were supposed to move, he got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and our future was shattered. I instead moved to where he was living, where he also had family to support him. It was the scariest period of my life, but fuck I loved him so much. 
After a few months of him facing his terminal cancer diagnosis, he ended things with me, and after some time wound up getting married to his childhood best friend. I was left in a new city, heart broken, and wondering if the person I loved more than anyone was going to live or die. I was alone. 

Fast forward 3 years, I moved on and created a new life for myself, a somewhat successful one at that. I finally started to heal and dated someone who is incredible. We rarely argue about anything, but I recently received news that my ex passed away from his cancer, at 26 years old. As I was mourning, I revisited all of the pictures on my phone of our time together, reminiscing about a very special period of my life, and letting myself grieve over this person that I lost. My boyfriend is starting to get frustrated over the fact that I’m spending so much time looking at these pictures and getting so  emotional, and feels like I’m not present in our relationship anymore. 

I know I shouldn’t be so hung up, but I genuinely loved this guy. I’m at peace with our relationship ending, because I’ve learned he wasn’t the one, and have a much healthier relationship now. But he was such an important person in my life, I can’t help but try and treasure the impact he had on me as well. 
 
TLDR
My ex recently passed from aggressive cancer and my current bf feels I’m not invested in our relationship because I’m mourning. I revisit our old pictures together to help cope, and bf feels I’m stuck in the past instead of focused on our future."	No A-holes here	0	0

c32r82	2019-06-20 22:55:08	Spooky_Doom	AITA For not answering my phone on the toilet?	"I, 29M, ignored a phone call from my boss while I was on the toilet at work (2nd floor).   When I finished up, I went downstairs to the office to see him, maybe 2-3 minutes later.  Boss told me my coworker ""90"" had fallen and he wants me to help him pick him up.  Coworker is over 90 years old, so it's a big deal.  He is fine as I write this.  No broken bones, will be kept overnight at the hospital.

&#x200B;

I find 90 on the ground.  Coworker ""X"" has a rag pressed to his head.  90 is talking and in relatively high spirits considering.  Boss is on the phone, so I get a chair and X helps me lift 90 and set him onto it.  While I'm doing this, coworkers begin asking where I was and why I didn't answer my phone.  I said I was upstairs, which is the polite version of saying I was taking a dump.  90 is bandaged and then driven to the hospital by my boss.

&#x200B;

Now I ask AITA?  I said I didn't want to answer my phone on the toilet.  They said I should have since it was an emergency.  I said I didn't know it was an emergency, how could I have?  It should be noted that I have been working there for a year and not once have I answered the dozens of phone calls I received on the toilet because it was never an issue.  I always cleaned up and went right to the boss.

&#x200B;

My defense:  I was taking a crap and didn't want to reach into my pocket.  90 is about 130 lbs, if that; I think 2 women in their low twenties can help him onto his feet together.  The boss, male, about 60, took a phone call instead of rushing to help.  90 is the boss' father btw.  And I could have never been born and I think this 90+ year old man on opioids would have fallen today anyway.

&#x200B;

Their defense:  I'm on my phone too much.  I should have answered the call.

I've had the app deleted for a while now, but my profile still shows up on there. We live in a small town where everyone knows everyone and I just don't like it being on there. I know I only want to be with him, so I thought deleting my account would be a sweet thing to do.

I asked him what he thought and he got really angry. I told him I would download the app delete my account and uninstall the app. He thinks I want to try and cheat. I told him I would wait till we were together and he could watch me delete it. He was still angry and I even gave him the log in info so he could go delete it, but he didn't have room to install the app on his phone. He's still mad and convinced I want to cheat. So Reddit AITA?

Edit: I had my tinder profile for about a year before I met him and dated around a lot. Some of the people I met are still on there and he thinks I want to redownload the app to talk to one of them or something. I just want to be done with that part of my life, which I told him.

c32q2x	2019-06-20 22:51:03	onetimeuserxx	AITA for telling my boyfriend I won’t hangout with him if he’s high	"So my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now and about two years ago he got into smoking weed which I’m totally not against, but recently it’s been all he does. His parents were always kind of strict growing up and he doesn’t really have any other hobbies or passions. 

At the end of the day I’m glad he has something to look forward to, but he smokes every day and every night. He doesn’t just have a few tokes, he gets stoned out of his mind and can hardly hold a conversation with me. When we go to the grocery store for example he will get hyper paranoid or act like a ten year old and I feel as if I’m babysitting. I go to school during the morning and work at night 5 days a week and when I come home he’s always super high. We haven’t gone to bed at the same time in months, I go to bed at around 11 or 12 and he will stay up until 2 in the morning some nights just getting high and watching Youtube. What is most frustrating to me is he will get stoned on the weekends or on dates we have. I feel like anytime we spend together he’s counting down the minutes until I go to sleep so he can get high uninterrupted. I think I could be more understanding if he would lay off a bit and just do it when he feels stressed out or needs a pick me up. I feel like a prude nagging mother or something so I hate bringing it up but I’ve expressed to him many times that I wish he’d lay off and find something else to do and he gets defensive and says it’s how he likes to relax after work and makes me feel like I’m over reacting. 

I snapped on him tonight and told him if I don’t want to hang out with him because he’s stoned and that I wish we could have an adult conversation for once. I went as far as comparing him to a ten year old and he got really offended by it. He is absolutely miserable sober. He is irritable and distant, and then when he’s high he’s clingy and babyish. I understand it makes him happy but at the same time if it was anything other than marijuana people would say he has a problem. I truly don’t know if Im just being a complete bitch or if I’m justified in being so annoyed. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c32oul	2019-06-20 22:46:24	throwawayui98	WIBTA if I Confront my Co-Worker on Faking OT	"My coworker and I have been working on the same project for the last couple months. While she's been moved (more-or-less) to another subsection of the project, there's still a lot of work to be done on the main project. All that being said, I've been working a pretty decent amount of overtime (no problem for me, I can always use the extra money) but recently I've noticed on our company's 'skype' that my coworker is staying logged in, well past the time I see her leave for the day (an hour plus, at least). Now, normally that wouldn't be too much of an issue, but our boss has been pretty clear that we aren't allowed to take our computers home with us/work from home unless there's a specific emergency. On top of that, we need to clear OT requests with her. Before I ramble on too much, I just want to make a couple points in my thought process clear:

1. I work a pretty hefty amount of overtime right now finishing up the project
2. A not-so-small part of what I'm doing right now is cleaning up after my coworker's mistakes thus far
3. She has been logging in from home, and doesn't do any work that I can see
   1. Granted, this is subjective, but I've tested it out by sending emails shortly after she gets up from her desk for the day and when she logs back in for an hour or so, no response. Again, I get that this isn't super bad, but it still bothers me
   2. She owns a personal laptop that is similar but distinct from our workstations. She will leave this at her desk each day and cover up the most glaring difference between her personal and work computers (the dell logo is silver on our work stations and just black on her personal computer)
4. My concern is that the more she pulls this, the sooner it'll be before the boss discovers this and then I feel like the entire team (me, her and another girl we work with) will be met with heightened scrutiny and it will just make the overall work enviornment that much more uncomfortable (it's actually pretty nice as it is right now, all things considered)

So, WIBTA if I confronted my coworker about claiming she's working overtime when it appears she's not? Or am I just grasping at straws and being paranoid?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c32nje	2019-06-20 22:41:12	gruppyluppy	AITA for pestering someone who just lost their job	"Okay so, last night I bought a used Apple Watch from someone in my community. We work for the same company but in different departments. I found this girl and her watch through a Facebook marketplace type deal.

She told me the watch was a series 2, and said there was a minor crack. I bought it for $80, and figured that was a decent price. When we met up, I didn’t bother thoroughly inspecting the watch.

When I got home, I realized that it was series 1 and there wasn’t a “minor crack” there was a HOLE in it. It was in terrible shape.

I messaged the girl and asked if I could give the watch back tomorrow. She said sure.

So tomorrow comes and I message her twice. She doesn’t answer. I wait a couple hours and start to panic, thinking that I’ve been scammed. She then messaged me and says she’s lost her job and she’ll have her roommate meet up with me to take the watch back.

This sounds super suspicious to me, but I said “oh my god I’m so sorry! And sure I can meet up with your roommate.” She never answers me. I waited a few more hours and then texted her like 5 times over the course of the day, asking if she could at least give me her roommates number or an estimate of what time she could meet with me. She doesn’t respond. Again, I think I’ve been scammed. 

It’s now nighttime and she sends me a very short message asking me for my phone number for her roommate. She acted like I’m being an asshole, and reminded me that she lost her job today.

So was I the asshole for messaging her multiple times?

Edit: y’all I know I’m a dumbass for not inspecting the watch when we were making the exchange, I just want to know if I was an asshole for pestering her

UPDATE: she’s not answering again, and I was able to sell the watch to someone else (I knocked money off the price and was upfront about what series it is and the giant crack, of course). I’m just not going to answer if she does finally try to get back in touch. I’ve learned my lesson!"	Asshole	0	0
c32ngx	2019-06-20 22:40:57	blovefest	AITA for letting the owner of the store I work at know that the GM has been absent and not doing her job?	"Some background, I work at a sub shop that delivers. It is fast paced and requires a fully staffed schedule. The last two months my GM has pretty much checked out. She won't show up to work most days. She forgets to order things, i.e. we ran out of stickers required to close sandwiches, etc. We are short staffed constantly because she won't hire people and when people do show up for interviews half the time she is not there or makes them wait forever to actually interview them. We can never get a hold of her when needed. She lies about why she isn't at work and we know this because she snapchats regularly. 

Monday I took it upon myself to reach out to the old GM to get the owners info so I could let him know the store is being run into the ground. I never directly spoke to the owner, he did however call one of the shift managers and he told him what was going on.

Literally everyone has been saying that something has to give. I bit the bullet and did what I thought had to be done for the better of the store. I would have spoke with our GM directly but she wouldn't take anybody's calls. 

Am I the asshole?

Edit to add: I quit. She was telling my coworkers that she was going to gang up on me and the shift manager that spoke to the owner. I don't deserve to be treated that way for trying to make a better workplace."	Not the A-hole	0	0

A couple weeks ago I started a new class and was giving them a tour of the building. We have two rooms for breastfeeding only, for new mothers to fill up bottles. The sign on the front says ""MOTHERS ONLY"". So while giving the tour I showed those rooms and then joked ""so obviously no men should ever enter these rooms.""

Some girl in the class piped up ""That's not true. Men can breastfeed."" (Tone was annoyed and harsh, not joking.)

Me: Well in rare circumstances but these rooms are only for mothers with young babies.

Girl: Men can get pregnant and give birth too.

I realized she was talking about transgender people. I just shifted the convo back to the tour.

The girl quit before the end of the class (not for this reason), and the class remarked after that about how they didn't like her, she was very shrill, humorless and difficult to work with in general. A very poor fit for our casual environment.

c32mai	2019-06-20 22:36:33	WarmPay1	AITA For Pushing Away My Classmate/Friend?	"Alright, so for a little bit of backstory.

&#x200B;

I met this girl, let's call her M. We had a lot of our classes together and we had mutual friends, so it was only natural we became friends too. I think it's important to mention I had no romantic interest in her whatsoever.

Also, some notes on my personality. I HATE it when people are clingy. I get this feeling in my chest like I can't breathe, even though there is nothing physical preventing me from doing it. It's like the feeling you get if you're claustrophobic. I try and be understand when I get uncomfortable, and I also try to subtly let them know to back off a little. However, in this case, it didn't go well, I suppose.

&#x200B;

Ok, back to the story. M and I were good friends for most of the school year, choosing each other to work on projects and such. We actually became such close friends that I felt comfortable telling her about self harming in the past. There were no issues until about the middle of the school year. Her behavior suddenly changed towards me, and she got really clingy. Like, she would subtly try and sit next to me, find random reasons to go near me, walk over to me as soon as she walked into the classroom, etc. It got to the point where I couldn't be in a class with her without me feeling like I had no personal space. As mentioned before, I got a tightness in my chest whenever she did this, so it was really fucking annoying. I just thought she liked me, even though I made it clear I had no interest in relationships right now during our casual conversations with other friends. I tolerated it for a while, but I was just at my limit. I started to kind of try and move away from her, push her back a little if she got too close, and straight up ask her to stop doing what she is doing. I remember one time when we were finished a test and everyone was on their phones or talking. I was reading manga on mine, and she tried to talk to me. It got really irritating, and I said ""Hey, I understand you want to talk to me, but I just want to read and relax right now. Could you please leave me alone?"". But even after telling her this, she still tried to talk to me. Then, it escalated to ""Dude, leave me the fuck alone. I just want to read."" and she persisted. In the following days where we continued testing and I was reading, she tried to talk to me and I always said the same thing. It got to the point where I would STRAIGHT UP MOVE WHEN SHE TRIED TO TALK TO ME because I was so fed up, and she FOLLOWED ME AROUND THE CLASSROOM. I just wanted to relax and she literally didn't care. 

&#x200B;

After that, it spiraled out of control. I started being pretty mean to her, honestly. I would not acknowledge her existence if she tried to talk to me, cover my ears, or tell her to shut the fuck up if I got really pissed. But, even though I would do these things, she still continued to just invade my personal space. I would tell her to shut the fuck up and she didn't care. I couldn't focus in class anymore. I dreaded going to those classes, and my grades started to drop. I had to work harder in them to keep my grades up. Eventually, I let some of our mutual friends know when we had only a couple weeks of school left, maybe a little more, and they told her to back off. She started to give half-ass apologies, but this whole thing got to the point where I would tell her to shut the fuck up every time she opened her mouth. She had no regard for what I had to say in this situation, rather what other people said. To me, this had gone on for so long that whenever she came around me I had trouble breathing. It shouldn't have gotten to this point, and I'm really afraid of what can happen in our friendship if she doesn't know when to stop. 

&#x200B;

I just don't want to be friends with her anymore, but what happened on our last day of school is kind of making me hesitant. She finally gave me a formal apology and said ""Back when we were all good friends, I wanted to be closer friends with you so I could tell you that I was cutting myself. So I'm sorry."" I don't know what to think anymore, because it seems asshole-y of me to not want to be friends with her anymore when this whole time she wanted to tell me about her self harming. As far as I know, she isn't doing it anymore, but I don't know if we can go back to the close friendship we had without me feeling uncomfortable. I just don't think it is possible.

c32m1u	2019-06-20 22:35:41	this_b_empty_YEET	AITA for losing my best friend over an instagram comment?	"I’m posting here because I have lots of mixed outside opinions and I feel like all my friends are just trying to make me feel better about it so here I am.

So on a group chat with my past class before I moved to my next school I ‘roasted’ a guy. He was a really horrible person, bullied my brother, broke up with my friend cause he saw someone prettier and basically harassed me before I finally got to leave. We were talking about significant others and he said he had a girlfriend ; since I knew he had a sister or like 3 I said that they didn’t count. He, justifiably got angry, texted back a pretty heated response but at that point I went back to talking with my other friends. 

Later, like the next day, I find a comment on an Instagram post of a bard face and some...... choice words from none other than douche kid. So I respond back, rather harshly but tbh I was on my period then and didn’t want to deal with him, and take some screenshots. I send these to a chat with some nice friends from my old school and on a chat with my new friends. My former best friend is on the second chat. The people from my old school congratulate me basically for putting him in his place, I didn’t get any responses on the other chat. 

About a few hours later, best friend is online and typing something on the chat. I go to say hi but instead is greeted with ‘apologise to him’. I respond with saying how terrible he was and justifying my actions but she wasn’t having any of it saying things like ‘it doesn’t matter, still shouldn’t have been mean’ and stuff like that. At this point I’m getting pissed and upset, my best friend seems to not trust my judgement on someone she has never met but has been told how terrible of a person they were. Things escalate and I decide to spare my friends on the chat and go to our private one. And a few minutes in she says ‘ do you want to know what I thought when I saw those comments? That your a b****.’ ‘That if that was someone I knew I would not be your friend’. Already emotional from the fighting I end up telling her if she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore she can just tell me. She doesn’t respond. 

On the shared chat she calls me a snowflake, for those of you who don’t know what it means it’s basically an entitled brat who gets too emotional over nothing. I take this personally as my family does not have much money at all so I physically cannot be entitled when I have to make sure I’m not speaking too much money on food from school or at events. I go back to our private chat and we start fighting again. She ends up calling me a lot of other names and I blocked her. I also kicked her from the shared chat I posted the instagram stuff on. This was during the holidays. Next week at school we fight again and I ask her why she couldn’t just trust me about my judgement, she came up with some bull excuse like ‘ I did but still being mean is not nice’.... you don’t say? Some of you may be thinking why not just ignore her and stay away? I can’t unless I want to be alone for the rest of school. She dates one of my friends and is on good terms with all of my other friends so as much as I would like to I can’t.

He keeps breaking up with me over almost every argument we have. I'm doing my best to be the person he wants me to be and to keep our relationship together. He has a lot of trauma and anger issues stemming from his childhood but I've been helping him deal with it. Despite everything that's going wrong, we love each other a lot.

We have a shared apartment, but I spend half of my time at my family's place. My siblings are still teenagers, and I want to help out and be close with them for a couple more years.

Because of my rocky relationship with my boyfriend, I've been an emotional wreck at times. This has made my parents resent him a lot.

Now for the dilemma: We have a family tradition to go to my uncle's summer place for midsummer (I'm there at the moment). I would have loved to bring my boyfriend too but can't because of his relationship with my parents. He just sent me a text saying he wants to end things.

c32jkq	2019-06-20 22:27:04	tarajxoxo	AITA - fighting my dad over “his” beach house.	"Backstory- my grandpa built a beach house (literally with his own hands over the course of 2 years in the 70s). He had three boys, two are still alive. My dad is the youngest and the most responsible. Growing up we were told it was always being passed down to the grandkids/saved in the family. There are 2 sons, I’m 1 of 5 adult grandkids. 

Well my grandpa passed away about a year ago. Last conversation I had with him was about the house. He asked if I was using it and “it’s suppose to be used by everyone not just certain people” The house is in a trust (so I’m told). My dad spend “trust” money to update it. My step mom has been over all summer and many weekends helping with the renovation. 

Well my dad had been in control of the house for awhile but has become extremely controlling and entitled. A few examples, it takes many texts/phone calls to get a date that’s free. We aren’t allowed to let anyone but family use it. Refuses to tell us what dates are open. Won’t allow one cousin to use it at all due to a party he had 6 years ago. 

It has become a hassle to even go over. My step mom, myself and my cousin are all teachers so we fight for the same vacation days. 

Two different occasions, my sister was told it was open, drove two hours with her kids, and showed up to find someone else there. Not family, but a friend of my uncle (who is a drug addict). 

So here is where I might be the asshole, I finally was told the last two weeks in June were the only time available this summer. I asked for the last week, he agreed. Well when asked what exactly my days were, I kept getting the run around. Finally he said Monday -Thursday. I was upset. That’s not even a full week and no weekend, which meant my husband can’t go.  Turns out his wife (step-mom) decided she wanted the weekend that was suppose to be mine for more renovations. 

I had enough and called him out. Suggested we have a shared calendar, nope didn’t like that. Suggested a yearly “draft” with family, nope shot that down. He told me it’s his and his brothers house, they can use it whenever they want and they deserve more time that everyone else. I said well pick whatever dates you want and let us pick the ones that are left. Again, shot it down, cause he “doesn’t plan like that” 

Well, I went off. Told him he is being controlling, and unfair. He told them those days/weeks were open. He said he used his own money to renovate it and he wants to rent it out to recoup his money and they I need to follow his rules if I want to use it. I told him that my grandpa wanted the house to be used by family and is probably rolling over in his grave. Also, how disappointing they must be of him and how he is treating his own family. I called him some ugly names and brought up some other things I was mad about (not being involved in his grandkids lives). I also brought up that I knew the renovation was paid out of the beach house account/trust (i saw the bank statement) called him a liar. 

He said well maybe I shouldn’t be allowed to go over. I told him I didn’t want it. And hung up.

c32jkh	2019-06-20 22:27:02	Jessotto	AITA for talking about my weight loss in front of my brother's overweight girlfriend?	"I've always been average weight, but due to some health issues the last couple of years I gained around 15 kg/30 lbs. This year I've managed to turn things around and lost it all again, plus some. I'm proud, and finally feel good about myself again.

At a family dinner we were talking about my weight loss, and I spoke freely about it. This included mentioning how bad I felt at my heaviest. I hated the excessive sweating, how easily exhausted I was, that no clothes looked good on me, and that I can't stand looking at pictures of myself from that time cause I look so huge.

The next day my brother calls me, saying that it was really inconsiderate of me to say these things when his girlfriend was present. She is overweight, and bigger than I've ever been. I honestly didn't consider it at all since it was only my own body and self image that was the topic. Apparently she felt bad all night and started crying as soon as they left.

My brother says I'm an asshole that should have known better. I think I should be able to talk about my own weight loss experience, and if she feels so bad about herself that she can't deal with it she should do something about her own situation.

c32jbq	2019-06-20 22:26:14	58295674Aa	AITA for not wanting my boyfriends friend to stay in our house?	"Some context: my boyfriend cheated on me almost 3 years ago and I’m still processing it and learning to trust him again. He was drunk when it happened (there’s more to it than that but for the purposes of this post I think that’s more than enough detail on his infidelity). 

I also should mention that I have anxiety and depression, and since his cheating I feel I need to know any plans which involve alcohol ahead of time so that I can mentally prepare myself for the irrational thoughts that come up when he goes out drinking without me. I want him to have fun, I just need to prepare myself for the dumb stuff that will go on in my brain. 

Today, the day before our only evening off together, my boyfriend announces that he is going out with his friends drinking tomorrow night. I had just come back from a short holiday with my mum and this is his only weekend off this month (he works nights). I know he doesn’t get much time to coordinate time with his friends due to work, but we hardly see each other even though we live together and he hinted that we would spend some time together tomorrow evening as I have to go to my other job on Saturday. 

I was maybe a bit cold with him when he told me, but as I mentioned I know and he knows that I need time to mentally prepare (which I’m sure to some of you sounds really dumb). We had a minor fight and I went to go to bed. I came out after 10 minutes as I could hear him rapidly typing away on his computer and this is when he announces one of his friends might stay over - this was not him asking - and I kind of lost it a little bit. Our house is a mess (not even a cute ‘oh my house is such a mess’ it’s gross rn and very very small) and I don’t feel comfortable with him staying here. The thing is, my friend is coming from abroad to stay in 3 weeks time for a couple of nights. Obviously this then looks like a double standard but we will not be in the house when my boyfriend is sleeping, nor will we be drinking and coming home at a time when he needs to sleep for work. Boyfriend shouted over the top of what I was saying and the argument kind of didn’t end as I decided to go out for a drive as he was leaving for work.

He’s now at work and I’m lying here trying to sleep but all I can think is: am I the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c32gxg	2019-06-20 22:18:07	hightimes45	AITA for not speaking to my roommate anymore?	"This is my first post so take it easy on me, trying to be as clear as possible.

Long story... let me introduce the players...

ER - Roommate I no longer speak to

ERG - Roommate I no longer speak to's GF who has her own apt, but is always at ours. (Sleeps,Eats,Showers,etc.)

JR - Roommate who moved out 

SR - Roommate who moved in

Me - Potential Asshole

&#x200B;

I (26M) moved into an apartment with 2 of my friends from high school (ER,JR), both 26 M about 2 years ago. I was/am still very close friends with JR, never really hung out with ER in school, but JR did. We had a great first two years in the apartment, no issues to my knowledge and everyone got along.

&#x200B;

Queue 4 months after we signed the lease for the 3rd year. JR lands his dream job and tells us he is going to move out and help us get a sublet to finish the lease. No problems, we get a sublet, who is SR (also went to high school with us). He moves in, no issues. 

&#x200B;

This is where all the drama begins.....

&#x200B;

St Patrick's day is right around the corner, ER wants to have a party at the apartment. I say i do not want to have one but ER is free to have one if he wants to. SR says he does not care. ER says he wants to have the party but is going to be unable to clean, decorate, buy beer, and invite people to the party because he is going to be at work. ERG works with him so she is unavailable also. He asks me and SR if we can do all of that for him. I say no, as i do not want to have a party. SR says no as he simply does not want to. ER and ERG are upset, ER has the party anyway and is upset the apartment was not cleaned for it. The only people to attend the party were ER,ERG and ER's sister. (this section comes into play later in the story)

&#x200B;

Fast forward to one month ago, we have all started a fantasy sports league. ER brings ERG into the league to replace people who left last year.  ER attempts multiple trades with ERG that are clearly one sided in ER's favor, and he does so with 2 other members in the league. His final attempt to do so gets vetoed by the entire league and some trash talk ensues..

&#x200B;

I say in the fantasy chat ""Look's like ER is f\*\*\*ing ERG both literally and figuratively"". I.E. in the trade and because they are dating. 

&#x200B;

ER texts me outside of the chat and states i should not talk about ERG like that. I say that i was joking and then i text ERG and apologize for the comment, ERG states she was not even offended by it. 

&#x200B;

After i apologized, ER then starts to rip into me stating that i show zero respect for anyone, that no one even likes me, and that it should hear what everyone says about me. I felt like I was talking to a teenage girl. I told him i did not care what anyone says about me behind my back and that he is clearly not my friend if he is not defending me from whoever he's talking about. So i stop speaking to ER as there is clearly an underlying issue, because ERG wasn't even mad about my comments... Queue the f\*\*\*ing St Patrick's day party. 

&#x200B;

I find out from one of ER's friends (who, according to ER, doesn't even like me, but still texts me to hangout?) that ER was still pissed about me not doing all the prep for his party, and that he was going around telling all our mutual friends that he is mad because i never clean the apartment. Which is not true, i just did not want to clean for the party he wanted to throw.   So now there is no communication in the apartment, i have apologized for my comments, but have not received one. So i do not speak to either ER or ERG. 

&#x200B;

Does this make me the asshole for my comments towards ERG? I honestly didn't think it was that bad and from my experience, trash talk in a fantasy league was free game and no one is safe. 

&#x200B;

AITA? 

&#x200B;

TL:DR - Roommate held a 3 month grudge over me not cleaning for a party he wanted to have. Used my comments from fantasy league trash talk as an excuse to blow up on me. I apologized for my comments, yet to receive one from him, so now i do not speak to him."	Asshole	0	0

c32emf	2019-06-20 22:12:02	jg1114	AITA for not checking up with my friend who has mental health issues enough?	"So I have a friend who I've known for close to 10 years. We went to elementary and high school together. Through most of high school he suffered from depression, and I knew that but didn't bring it up much.

In January of this year he started acting off. He would go on about these conspiracy theories about how MJ was alive and everyone's the same ethnicity. Idk what he was on about so I kinda just brushed it off.

But it kept getting worse, and in February he ended up totalling his car and hinting at it saying he had to kill ""the real him."" Obviously I got worried and told my parents and his parents. His were already aware of what he was going through. Along with this he's called the police on his parents for no good reason, stolen 100s of dollars worth of electronics, and his personality went from easy-going and funny to arrogant and paranoid. 

In April he all together stopped contacting my whole friend group, and we haven't heard much of him since. His parents say he's doing better, and he's going to therapy every once in a while. However what makes me feel bad is not checking up on him enough. But whenever I do it veers off track and right back to his paranoia and theories.

Idk I'm just torn because he's been my friend for almost half my life but at the same time nothing comes from contacting him except me worrying. It's like I don't even know who he is anymore."	No A-holes here	0	0

c32e89	2019-06-20 22:11:12		AITA for freaking out on my mom’s boyfriend’s sister when she got up in my face?	"From the title, it sounds excusable, but now I’m not sure and I almost feel bad about it. I’m going to college for the first time tomorrow. The campus is three hours away from my house. Needless to say, I’m extremely stressed out over the moving process, financial issues, and leaving my friends and family behind. 

Just today, my mom’s boyfriend’s sister came over to say goodbye to me and to see what things I had purchased to decorate my dorm, which I was excited to show her. However, when she asked me if I was ready to go, I said that I was extremely nervous and I told her it was because my mom decided that she no longer wanted to help me move to campus and left me to do it on my own. When she asked why, I told her it was because earlier that week, I had gone out to the mall with my best friend and bought a Kate Spade bag which was on clearance for $100. (Obviously it wasn’t the smartest idea as I’m supposed to be saving money for school, but it was the last time I would be out enjoying time with my best friend. She’s staying local for college.) So my mom was infuriated and started yelling at me and reprimanding me for my ‘poor decision’. I got upset and asked her, “Why are you always on my ass? I was just enjoying the day out with my friend for the last time.” And that’s when she decided to no longer accompany me. 

So when my mom’s boyfriend’s sister discovered I had bought the bag, she started demanding I return it and telling me that it was a horrible idea to buy it, hounding me religiously about it. She said “Why would you Buy a Kate Spade bag? I can’t even afford it.” At this point, I’m extremely annoyed and I reply with,”Yeah, but I also wasn’t the one who decided to have 6 kids.” (She recently just had her second child, but she’s extremely burdensome about it to the entire family.) This set her off and she got up in my face, cursing at me and tries to tear my phone out of my hand. So I slap her hand away and she got angry and said,”I don’t know who you think you are. I don’t care how old you are. Don’t you dare disrespect me like that.” And I said,”I don’t care who you think you are, coming into my house, getting into my face and touching my sh*t.” Then she turned away and said,”Good luck with college. I hope you don’t need anything.” And stormed out of the house, talking sh*t to my mother as they both walked out. 

I feel bad because she bought me a microwave for my dorm room and was very kind to me about moving away. I just hate the way she acts. She treats everyone with the same disrespect, is extremely rude and thinks she can get away with saying and doing anything that she wants. 

Another thing that bothered me was the fact that my mom sided with her even after she saw the way she got up in my face and screamed at me when I was being completely calm up until she grabbed my phone."		1	0

Im in my mid 20's and my entire life is filled with similar experiences on both ends of the spectrum, for example when i tell someone im happy for you, on the inside i don't feel anything, when someone is telling me a bad experience he had i act saddened but im not, it's like im just a hollow shell incapable of sympathizing with other human beings. 
And regarding my own self i rarely feel anything, I've won swimming competitions and science fairs through out my life but while getting the reward i couldn't feel any sense of achievement, i also failed many exams (like alot), but every time i see my grades I'm empty inside.

c32ckw	2019-06-20 22:07:22	SarcasticDogOwner	AITA for refusing to let my friends on a private camping trip?	"Like it says in the title. My boyfriend 26M and I 25F have decided to go to my family's remote wooded property and camp for a week. There's no electricity, no running water, and it's a two hour hike to the spot we want to go to. We went earlier this year with my family for a trip and now want to enjoy it by ourselves.



My friends, all nine of them, heard us planning it and have suddenly decided they're going. I woke up today to being added to a group chat titled ""Camping Buddies"" where they were discussing what they'd need to bring with them. Oh and can I cook for all of them? Or go shopping with them to find them gear? Oh and can we use both mine and my boyfriend's work trucks, since they have more space?



I am not gonna lie, I got mad. We had planned this trip for our one year anniversary, want it to be just us (for what should be obvious reasons), and all we had told them was we were excited to go camping for our anniversary. We told them this a week ago. It seems in that time my cousin, who is also friends with them, told them about how awesome the family trip was and they all decided they were just gonna tag along. At least, that's the response I got when I asked what the group chat was for. Apparently they'd all already asked and gotten approved time off work, without me telling them when we were going on our trip. Oh, and they'd already talked at length about borrowing some of my expensive gear without even remotely thinking of mentioning this to me a week ago.


I posted this; ""Hey guys, this trip with (boyfriend) and I is private. We aren't taking anyone with us. This is for our one year anniversary. If you had asked, the answer would have been no. You guys can plan a trip for later in the summer and I'll see if you can use the family property for that trip, but you guys aren't coming on this trip. End of discussion.""



I got responses like ""Wow! How f******* rude! We just want to go camping."". And ""Way to be an a****** OP. We already all took time off work."". And my personal favorite ""Why the hell would you guys want to spend your anniversary alone in the woods?? F******* ridiculous.""


I basically just unfriended all of them, set up their texts to go into archive, and their calls to silent. They're on FB just bitching a mile a minute about how much of an asshole I am about refusing to let them come after they'd already taken time off work, they just want to go camping and it shouldn't be a big deal, and that I'm being a selfish asshole.

"I was driving two of my cousins to get a coffee and had to wait for 15 minutes in the parking lot for the handicap spot to open up.  Both of my cousins are permanently in chairs and we require the handicap spot with the extra space on the side to open the ramp up.  
The FJ taking that spot did not have a handicap plate and finally we see two high-school aged girls walk out with their frappuccinos and hop in.  I honk at them and gesture impatiently.  They reach onto their dashboard and flash a handicap placard and laugh.  
I have often wondered why any disability other than a physical one would require a handicap placard, AITA for flipping those girls off?

Edit: I should have mentioned there were several empty (non-handicap) spaces right by the entrance which the FJ could have parked in, but we could not because we need the extra ramp space.  Trying to understand what invisible handicap would warrant parking in the actual handicap space? 

Also, my 'impatient gesture' was sort of a hands up in the air and pointing to the other empty spots.  I didn't flip them off until the responded the way they did to us."	Asshole	0	0
c32bca	2019-06-20 22:04:36		AITA For avoiding her?	"So there was this girl that I befriended this year in college. We had a class together in the Fall quarter and another this Spring quarter. Well we started studying pretty frequently together this past quarter and I started to like her. I eventually mustered the courage to ask her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she politely refused. She texted me afterwards and said that she was sorry and that she hoped we were still cool. I replied back letting her know that she had nothing to be sorry about and that we were still cool.

I did see her once after that, but she was acting really really weird. She was extremely uncomfortable which made me really uncomfortable as well. I thought I had creeped her out but I guess she just didnt know how to act around me because she stopped showing up to class for a couple weeks but she would still text me. I would text her back and things were fine. I hadnt seen her for a couple weeks and although I think I handled the rejection gracefully, I was still pretty embarrassed and didnt really know how I would act around her. So we had a final this past week and we had texted about it a bit beforehand.

Long story short: as I was walking to class for the final I notice two people walking behind me and I even look back and make eye contact with the guy for a split second. I dont really look at the girl walking with him. I think nothing of it, its just two random strangers (or so I thought). I walk into the building and head to the restroom. As I walk out I see her at the doorway saying bye to the guy she was walking with, she was facing away from me.. Well my body went into fight or flight, so many thoughts ran through my head and I ended up turning a corner and walked towards the classroom... I should have said hi or something :( ,

I'm pretty sure she saw me. I feel so bad, she was a really nice girl and now she probably thinks I'm an asshole for avoiding her. She didnt text me after the exam and I havent texted her because I dont wanna bother her.

I'm thinking the best course of action is to just cut my losses and move on.

PS. I accepted her rejection and I wasnt/am not pursuing her anymore but she was really chill so I feel horrible aboutt what happened."	No A-holes here	1	0

c328hq	2019-06-20 21:58:21	qweasd12321	AITA for telling my boss I want to see him alone when his wife was in the office?	"It always drives me NUTS how whenever I want to meet with my boss his wife is at his office. His wife is the “co-owner” but doesn’t have a damn what this company is about and just sits through meetings and nods as if she knows what I’m talking about to him. I think because their company is successful they’re a little over their head and think they can freely break professional boundaries. His wife is useless and doesn’t really contribute anything to the company besides sitting beside her husband looking pretty. Usually I’m annoyed but don’t say anything when she’s there during a meeting. Today was the last straw because as I opened his office door I saw her giving him a shoulder rub. It was enough for me and I said “i want to see you alone and I’m not meeting with you if she’s there” and went home because I was angry. My boss emailed me that he wants a meeting with me tomorrow as soon as I come in. Can I get fired? Was what I did an asshole move or am I justified?

Edit: since I’m apparently the asshole, should I just quit or go in tomorrow to see what he wants??

UPDATE:

What a joke of a company. If you thought I was the asshole last time just wait to see who the new asshole is. Today I went in to see what my boss emailed me about. When I walked in the office I found his wife, and 2 HR managers there and asked her where her husband was. She said she was meeting with me instead and asked me to sit down. So basically my boss didn’t respect my wishes from yesterday and decided to not only have his wife in a meeting AGAIN but he also didn’t show up himself. She told me they were letting me go and that the HR manager will walk me to my desk to pick up my stuff and leave. Notice how she thinks she’s too good that she needs another employee to walk me to my desk. Also, how unprofessional is it that she has 2 other employees with her (probably because she’s nervous to have her first one on one meeting). I felt humiliated because she could’ve done this privately. I tried to explain myself but she kept telling me that this was not a negotiation and this was a final decision. So she didn’t let me have a chance and was being a bitch. I couldn’t believe that my bosses wife was firing me and he wasn’t even here or didn’t care to see me on my last day at work. Every time I tried to discuss it with her she wouldn’t let me speak and said this was not up for negotiation. When I asked to see my boss his wife told me “I can’t discuss other employees with you”. I gave up. When the HR manager walked me to my desk I tried going to my e-mail to talk to my boss but I realized I had already been locked out of all the company’s network. So I couldn’t even send my coworkers goodbye messages. Honestly what an asshole company. Who’s the asshole now?

Update 2: I also want to mention that sometimes her and her husband do things besides the shoulder rubs like touching each other’s legs, hugging, and kissing at work. I know they’re married and all but in a workplace that’s just wrong."	Asshole	0	0

"Walked into a small neighborhood gym to do an hour on the treadmill. Look, I understand gyms can get loud and I do my best to mind my own. I often have headphones to cancel out the noise around me and get into my own zone. No headphones today, but I don’t think that matters.

2 minutes into treadmill I hear this slamming of weights from a machine behind me. A girl next to me and I kept looking back like “Why is she doing this so aggressively?” I started to think maybe she had a bad day and is blowing off some steam. Either way not really respectful to the equipment. The noise starts to pick up even more. She was using that hip abductor machine and just letting the weights SLAM down. It really seemed like there was risk of damage to the machine, or perhaps even she could sustain an injury from the jerking motion. We kept turning around and eventually I had enough and exclaimed “Excuse me! That’s not how the machine is meant to be used and you may damage the machine.”

She turned around and I realized it was a 10-13 year old girl. Let’s keep in mind she was not being supervised and couldn’t have been older than 15 max. Age restriction at gym is 16 unless parent or guardian present. She said “What?” And I said “There’s a risk you’re going to damage the machine and that’d be unfortunate for all the other residents who might want to use it.” 

She quickly scurried out of the gym as did the girl next to me on treadmill (potentially her sister, appeared similar in age). 

I feel bad not realizing she was that young, and I’m nervous I’ve deterred a kid trying to better themselves in the gym and not knowing how to use the machine appropriately. I jumped the gun assuming it was someone just being selfish, rude, and disrespecting neighborhood property. 

AITA? I did not yell, but people have different thresholds of what yelling is. I turned around and firmly stated “Excuse me?!” More like a question asked in an annoyed tone."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I'm  a 25 year old Audiovisual Technician who works nights. Last summer, I  moved into a house to rent with my brother who goes to college. Two  weeks ago I awoke to loud crashing noises in my yard and to my surprise  my neighbor had driven into my yard and was ripping out a tree in the  yard with his truck. I was pretty bewildered because nobody had talked  to me about this but I figured since I'm renting he must have just  talked to my landlord (he's not a very neighborly type, always ignoring  me or my brother when we say howdy takin out the trash).So at the end of  the day I just check with my landlord via text because I had never had a  notice and anywhere I've lived I've been notified about anything like  maintenence to the property. He says it's fine, the neighbors gonna take  care of it, he's redoing his fence and wanted to take out the tree. 

One  week later the tree is still downed in my yard. I see him while I'm  getting groceries out of my car, he says he's letting it dry and will  take care of it. Two weeks have now passed and I see him in his yard and  I approach him and ask what his plan is to remove the tree.

He responds ""It's ok you can take care of it.""

Confused I respond ""You want me to remove the tree?""

Neighbor responds: ""No you can work around it""

I don't get it , and I say ""No that's not what I'm asking, when are you going to get the tree out of my yard that you removed?""

He says ""I'm not going to remove it, you need to mow your yard! You dont care about about your yard look how overgrown it is!""

Now  I haven't mowed in a while,I have already once this summer, but I  haven't been able for 2 weeks because of the tree, and seeing as I need  to rent the equipment to mow I'm not going to rent twice to mow the yard  fully. Its not a giant tree I could mow around it but thats besides the  point.

I point at his yard neatly  trimmed and mowed saying ""You obviously care about your yard why would  you think its ok to leave your trash in someone else's for over two  weeks?""

He snaps "" You're lazy! Your  parents pay for this house. You don't care about how your yard is! I'm  not going to touch that I had a deal with (landlord) and thats the only  person I need to talk to you dont own this property!

I  respond ""you don't know me! I work for my rent and I work too hard to  have someone disrespect me and my space like this! I'm your neighbor - I  am the person who is living in the house with this yard, you DO need to  talk to me""

Neighbor: ""This is my yard get out of my face before I snap"" and he goes inside.

here I am with the tree still in the yard, grass  still growing..wondering if I handled this the right way

"So a few weeks ago my roommate brought home a huge, 50's style reefer madness poster and asked if he could hang it out. I said sure, I also smoke weed sometimes, it doesn't bother me but he'll have to take it down when my parents visit. Then I came home the next day to discover he had permanently glued it to the wall, in a frame, with industrial strength mounting tape. 

My parents are coming to visit next week and I can't have them seeing this shit because I'm still sort of financially dependent and don't want them to think I'm a huge stoner. I asked him to take it down and he said he can't because, again, it's *fucking glued to the wall with industrial strength mounting tape*. WIBTA if I take a crowbar and pry it off the wall, probably damaging the wall and breaking the frame in the process?

Edit: it's also permanently crooked

Edit 2: I've looked around online and apparently it's worth a shot to cut through the tape by sliding razor wire behind the frame

Edit 3: okokok I get it, I'm TA, I'll do my best the take it down without damage and if I can't I'll just cover it. But still, WTF DUDE. Smh."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"TLDR: Casually talking to my mum and then it came up in conversation that my teacher takes random pictures of the class and sends them to other parties, mum said she wasn't happy about it and is going to call the school.

So in my science class at school, we have this teacher who is always on her phone (which is against the school rules even for teachers) and always takes pictures and sends them to her boyfriend and 'friends'. Some back story between me and this teacher, she doesn't like me very much and always puts me on detention, even when I don't do anything wrong. 

At the time the pictures were taken I didn't feel comfortable and I still don't when she's on her phone during lesson, but didn't tell anyone about it until now.

She's early-mid twenties and always talks about her and her boyfriend. If it matters I'm 13m and class is mixed of 12/13 years old and m/f.

c31yqx	2019-06-20 21:35:39	throwawayabagochips	AITA for asking my roommate to follow through on an agreement about accessing his room?	"When my two roommates and I moved into the apartment, everything seemed perfect, except for one thing: the living room. It used to be a large room that faced the street, but when the apartment was renovated, they put up a wall that split the room in half. The half with the windows became a bedroom, and the other half became a living room with no windows at all.

I predicted that this might be a problem, because 1. having sunlight is nice in the common spaces 2. having air flow is important and 3. during the summer it would be impossible to cool the space without a window to put an AC in (there was no central air). One roommate grabbed dibs on the room. I made sure to say that I'd be totally fine with that, as long as we could use his AC to cool the living room when necessary and we could leave the door open whenever possible to let sunlight and air through the apartment. He said that was fine, because it was the biggest and best room anyway so it was worth the tradeoff.

I work from home, and he has an office 9-5 job. During the day, I have been either opening his window so the apartment would have a draught of air through it, or turning on the AC when I want to use the living room.

He's now decided he doesn't like having the window open or coming home to a cool room or having us in his room at all, so he wants to shut the door and have us never use his room. This would obviously be okay if we hadn't EXPLICITLY agreed on our prior arrangement from the beginning. Now the living room gets so hot it's unusable, and it feels like a damp cave with no light or air. He's not even home most of the time, but I'm now stuck only in my bedroom 24/7.

AITA for insisting he follow through on the arrangement we made when we rented the apartment?

c31v9p	2019-06-20 21:27:33	sarahsaurusrexxx	AITA for not wanting to wear a hijab to my mom's wedding?	"***UPDATE 1:*** I let her know that I was uncomfortable with wearing it on Thursday night (2 days ago), and she said she would ""see what she could do"", I haven't heard back since. I will update again next time we speak. 

***UPDATE 2:*** I finally heard back, about 5 days later. She told me that fiancé wants/expects me to wear it ""out of respect"". I told her I wasn't comfortable with that, and that if she was having any sort of celebration later when I wouldn't be required to wear it, I would like to be there. She told me that that really disappointed her. 

Side note, she has (seperately from this issue) decided to have the muslim ceremony in July, and have the ""official"" wedding in the fall be like any other wedding. She will be wearing traditional garb to the nikkah (I will not be in attendance), but will be wearing a wedding dress in the fall. She has since asked me to be her maid of Honor for the wedding in the fall and I will be wearing a traditional bridesmaid/MOH style dress. 
Thanks to everyone who responded! This will likely be the last update unless shit hits the fan! 
*Case closed!*

**THANKS FOR THE REPLIES EVERYONE!**
**I WILL UPDATE AT A LATER DATE**

Backstory: I was raised Catholic and went to Catholic school, however I am not a religious person. My mom is also Catholic, her fiancé has relatively recently converted to Islam (5 years or so approximately). 

My mom is getting married this fall, just after my 25th birthday. The man she is marrying is Muslim, and while my mom hasn't converted and isn't planning to.

She told me today that they are expecting me to wear a full Kaftan and hijab. My first reaction was that I didn't want to, but didn't know how to respectfully decline. 
I don't want to offend anyone, or be disrespectful. I have absolutely no problems with the religion, and tend to take a live and let live approach to life. However I am not a part of any religion and don't feel like I should be forced to wear one, anymore than someone should be forced to remove one.

In the end I will likely do what makes her happy. 
I tried to keep this short and sweet, but I would be happy to provide more details if you guys want/need them.

Thanks in advance!

c31uj7	2019-06-20 21:25:47		AITA for refusing to feed my fathers dog?	my father got a sheep dog to use on the farm about six months ago. i have 2 dogs of my own as well as another dog that belongs to my sister, all of whom i feed everyday. before my dad got his dog, i made it very clear that this dog was not my responsibility to take care of, and i specifically made it clear that i would not be feeding this dog as it is not my dog, i do not have a bond with it and frankly didn’t want to get him, he is my fathers dog and therefore my fathers responsibility. i do feed him occasionally if my dad forgets to feed him as my dad is to put it simply a complete child and will throw a temper tantrum and refuse to do it if he is tired, and i don’t want the dog to starve as a result of his owners laziness. recently though, my dad has been asking me to feed his dog every single day. tonight i had had enough and told him that i wouldn’t be feeding the dog from today onwards as it’s not my responsibility. my father, being the jackass that he is, screamed at me that i’ll “do whatever he tells me to do”. i fed the dog tonight and came back in visibly annoyed (my dad wasn’t in the house when i came back in) and told my mother and sister that it isn’t my responsibility to take care of my fathers dog. here lies the issue: since i am still too young to get a job where i live (16), my mother agreed to pay me €15 a week during the summer to do more household chores like cleaning, doing the dishes, etc (i was already doing these before without being paid, before all of you want to comment about how i’m a baby who can’t help around the house - i’m just being paid to take on more responsibilities). i haven’t actually been given this money at all since the beginning of summer which was over a month ago but that’s another issue. when i told my mother and sister that it’s not my responsibility to feed this dog, they replied that i’m being paid to work and therefore i should do as i’m told. HOWEVER, when we discussed the chores i would be doing to earn this money, i explicitly told my parents that feeding my fathers dog will not be one of these responsibilities and they both agreed. now they have turned around and ignored that and say i should just do it bc it’s not a huge job. i just think that because it was agreed that it wasn’t my responsibility, i shouldn’t be expected to take it on now.

c31tdl	2019-06-20 21:23:06		AITA is this guy being ass-ish or am I being overly sensitive?	"I'm chatting with a guy on a business networking app and well, the title says it all. Let me know your thoughts, thank you.

Chat Log:

Me- It's more professional, but it seems everyone wants me to sell something

Guy- It depends on what your perspective is, [name]. That's life. In school/college you sell your time for knowledge and get institutionalized. In your job you sell your time and knowledge for money. In a business someone sells a product or service. 

At every level productivity in your life comes with a price. 

If someone is offering you a job, they want you to sell your time, and to sell something for the company. No matter what kind of job it is. Naive people don't understand that simple fact. 

Me- I just feel like it's wrong to sell garbage products to people who don't know better, in order to make a profit for a businessman while receiving a commission myself.
Now if it were something valuable that worked, like maybe nutrition planning vs a wrinkle cream that does nothing a $2 bottle of lotion can't do, then I wouldn't mind.

""Time is money"" is starting to make more sense

Guy- Time is money yes. But how you perceive that statement is also important. 

And garbage product is very vague. It all depends on the person. For a high school dropout, high school was garbage. For a high school teacher however, high school was the only way they could feed their kids. Welcome to the real world of grown ups."		1	0
c31t64	2019-06-20 21:22:39	Jvalker	AITA for lashing off against my coworkers despite their attempt to help me?	"This is an episode that happened a couple of years ago,  at my old workplace; it returned to my mind this morning while talking about our old workplace with Luke, but my memory is blurry and I don't remember all the details

&#x200B;

I used to work at a programming job, and one day I had a problem I don't remember exactly, but it was something I had been wrestling for way longer than I'd have wanted to. I thus sent our slack group a message that went pretty much like this: ""guys, I'm having \[problem x\] with \[Joe's tool\], do you know a solution that isn't \[solution y\], since I've already tried that?""

&#x200B;

Seconds later, a coworker sent me a link explaining how to apply \[solution y\], and I ignored it. A couple of minutes later, another coworker, Luke (the one I was talking with this morning), whom I'm on amicable terms with, suggested me to try out \[solution y\]. At that point I started getting pissed, and told them (via slack) I felt like they weren't paying any attention to my questions.

&#x200B;

At that point I saw Luke getting up and leaving the room, and shortly after returned with Joe, the creator of the tool himself. Which opened with, verbatim, ""I read your message, did you try \[solution y\]?"". At first I laughed thinking he was joking, but turns out he was bloody serious; I remember clearly I answered ""quod erat demonstrandum"", then the memories get seriously blurry.

I only remember it devolved inot a screaming contest, and I may have been the one that started it. Sure thing is, at some point Joe said he wanted to bash my face in (Luke's words), and immediately after a few other coworkers came in and helped defusing the situation. The problem turned out to be Joe's fault, with the solution not being \[solution y\], if that matters

&#x200B;

So... AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit, since I forgot to add the obvious:

I think they're the ones in the wrong, but they both think I'm the asshole. And while I don't really care about Joe's toughts, Luke is an extremely rational guy."	Asshole	0	0

c31sn3	2019-06-20 21:21:30	haleyhurricane	AITA for not feeling equipped to help raise my deceased ex's son?	"I'm going to try and keep this as concise as possible.

&#x200B;

Some points:

* My ex and I split up 6/7 years ago and for the last few years before he died, we had lost touch but were not on bad terms
* During the time we were out of touch, I grew very ill and am now permanently disabled

A few weeks ago I received an email from my ex's brother informing me that he took his own life. My ex and I always held a lot of love for each other, even after splitting up, so I took the news rather hard. He left two sons behind, aged 13 and 8. The older son has a mother that isn't in the picture and is now in the custody of my ex's brother, while the younger son had always been in a very healthy co-parenting situation and his mother plans to move across the country to be with her family where they will help her raise her son.

&#x200B;

My ex left me a letter explaining how his love for me never diminished and how he would love nothing more than for me to be very involved in his older son's life. He also left a letter for the older son explaining that I would always be there if anything was needed and to never hesitate to reach out to me. I have now been in almost daily contact with both him and my ex's brother. Understandably, the son is having an extremely tough time. My ex's brother is my age, 28, and has no experience with children so he's very overwhelmed.

&#x200B;
  
I've stepped in to be someone that the son can call and text as often as he wants throughout each day. I am more than okay with this and actually very much enjoy talking with him. However, he's been telling me more and more often that his dad never stopped talking about me as well as using losing me as a lesson to his son to never give up on/hurt the person who's right for him. Years of this has had the son putting me on a sort of pedestal and since the death has considered me as a new mother figure.

&#x200B;

  
I've reached out to his uncle (my ex's brother) and explained that, while I'm happy to be in the son's life, being very ill and having been apart from my ex for so long has made me feel like I cannot be the son's mother figure. A friend? Absolutely. However, I am not physically, mentally, or financially equipped to have a heavy hand in raising him. The uncle absolutely understands and believes that that would be asking a lot of anyone, regardless of health.

&#x200B;

This poor kid has lost the only parent he had left and is just looking for a toehold. Am I betraying my ex's wishes and disappointing his memory by not stepping into the role that he wanted me to? I believe he felt confident that between his brother and I, his son would be well supported and taken care of, and while I'm happy to take a part...I'm worried that the son putting me on this super high pedestal just puts him at risk for more pain.

&#x200B;

If this was confusing, I'm so sorry. It's a very emotional topic for me and I worry maybe I should've created aliases for everyone so that maybe names would be easier to follow. I'm happy to answer INFO questions.

c31sgx	2019-06-20 21:21:08	ILikeTheHigh1s	AITA for wanting my SO to change their plans to give me a ride?	"Currently having car issues. Called Tues to make an appt & earliest spot was Fri. Was going to drive the car only to work the next few days. Got to work Wed, the issue got worse & I feared breaking down or ruining my engine if I continued driving. Looked at Uber which would be pricey, on top of the fact that I have 2 kids that I need to drop off & pick up before & after work so logistics are complex. Trying to find & pickup a rental after work to be used for 1 day (Thurs) would be costly & difficult.

&#x200B;

I live with my SO. My job is on the way to their job and we've carpooled before since they start later than I do. SO told me Tues night that on Thurs morning they were taking our dog to their mom's house b/c the mom wanted to spend the day with the dog. I had that in mind when doing my research to get to work. Emailed SO the car update, my options, said I wasn't sure what to do & asked about the possibility of SO taking me to work Thurs. SO said no b/c of the previously mentioned plans with the mom & offered to pay for Uber. Said I understood it's their decision but b/c of my kids, Uber wasn't ideal & I was hurt that the ""plans"" with the mom were just b/c mom wants to see the dog, which she can do any day, & my current situation is unexpected & urgent. I'm just asking to get to work & figured helping me would be a priority. When roles were reversed, I've done the same. (SO's car got towed -I took the morning off work to take them to the tow yard when they asked even tho they could have Ubered)

&#x200B;

SO remained steadfast, said they made a commitment & the mom has been planning to have the dog that day. Asked SO to explain the situation to the mom & I'm sure she would be understanding & not see it as blowing off a commitment. It pained me to have to explain this b/c we are supposed to be helpmates & it doesn't seem like a big to deal to see the dog another day. SO asked why both parties can't be happy & why they had to sacrifice. SO said it's important to their mom and they're trying to please both of us. I wasn't even insisting that SO take me but I didn't understand why they were so gung-ho on taking the dog & not understanding my feelings about their unwillingness to bend a little during a stressful time. SO wasn't even entertaining the idea of telling the situation to the mom. SO didn't consider to work anything out with her. SO was trying to please mom only - at the cost of hurting me.

&#x200B;

Told SO I would use my vacation time to take Thurs off of work & not inconvenience anyone. I wasn't trying to expect or demand SO bend over backwards to accommodate me to unrealistic levels but I was hurt over the fact that I thought the situation did call for understanding and willingness to be their for your partner. Instead I felt like I was put on a back-burner and just had money thrown at me to handle the situation on my own. Was I being unrealistic? AITA for expecting too much out of this situation?

I really tried to make it work but the atmosphere in our house was awful, there was no love or respect and you could cut the tension with a knife. I tried to make it work for the kids then realised this was a horrible environment for a child so we broke up.  I took nothing with me and was paying support.

Shortly after she told me she was pregnant again, which was a surprise as she'd previously told me she was on the pill.  Turns out she'd stopped taking the pill without telling me.

I said I'd still be there for the kids and help through pregnancy, but for all the reasons I couldn't be 'with' her.

So yeah, I abandoned my pregnant wife.

My wife (not yet ex at that stage) told me that I couldn't see my kids unless we got back together.  Bear in mind that I'd provided a huge amount of the care to my son at that point as she'd struggled to bond with him, but she was the primary carer as I was working.

I said that wasn't right, you can't do that to our kids, we need to put them first, her response was silence, and for a few weeks I thought it was ok.

Next thing I knew she'd moved across the country and sent me a letter telling me not to follow her.

I uprooted my life and followed her, insisted on re-establishing contact, she stopped me for a while by accusing me of some really horrible stuff which I managed to prove myself innocent of in court (won't go into that here, but I have scars that will never heal).  I won, contact restarted, then she ignored the contact order and moved again, uprooting our children.

The courts here are toothless in enforcing contact orders, I realised that if I kept on pursuing and trying to force contact they'd keep getting uprooted.

My childhood was very unstable, always moving from place to place, no stable friendships or life, I didn't want that for them so I decided that the best thing for them was to give up till they're older, which I did (I've always paid child support though).

I reached out a while ago as it's been several years and they're old enough to start having a say in decisions, they hate me, which I thought they would, them growing up with my ex I was always going to be a monster.

What I'm scared off is that I've screwed them up for life with abandonment issues, that I was so traumatized by the court case that I made the selfish decision to give up (because there's no doubt that giving up was the right thing for me emotionally) and rationalized it with some thin justification.

This isn't something I talk about with anyone really, it's too raw and there's nobody outside of close family I trust enough to talk to, but I think I've stripped enough details out here to be anonymous.

So, have I messed up my kids with a selfish and weak decision, AITA?"		1	0
c31mdi	2019-06-20 21:07:04	loveandplanet	AITA for being creeped out but my(14F) neighbor(50ishM)?	"I think I’m ta but here we go.

My neighbor is weird- and I mean weird not “ wanna see my bug collection!” Like stares at me and only me, like when me and my mom are walking our dog he’s staring and at first I thought it was our dog cause we have a pug. 

But when I was walking her by myself he was staring again and I thought it was my dog, than I was watering my flowers and he’s staring at me and, so I just ignored him but then he cat called me, now if you don’t know that’s like calling a cat but to a female. I instantly cried and ran inside reason? I was cat called before and was “violated” at a young age. 

Now I walk my dog in the back. I told my mom and she said I was overreacting cause he’s old, my OWN MOTHER told me I’m overreacting!!! I told my friends and that said I’m ta so I’m asking you, Reddit AITA?

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words and advice I don’t plan on calling the police that’s what my dads for. ;) I talked to my mom and she said she was sorry and will help me through this. 

Edit2: I’m literally crying thank you all for the support it means a lot to me. In case you were wondering he will move his head in MY direction to look at me and this has been going on for a week.

c31m84	2019-06-20 21:06:43	jayhatesbeingannoy	AITA for expecting privacy from my wife ?	My wife is very nosy and likes to stick her nose into my personal life and my business. When my family or friends calls me, I go to another room to take the calls. Its not because I have anything to hide, it's because some conversations are too personal and too embarrassing. The conversations are either about their personal problems and they trust me enough to tell me or my own personal problems and business. Why can't my wife stay out of my business and butt out ? Not only that but when my parents calls she always want to talk to them most of the time. The reason why I don't tell her my business is because she is got friends of her own and she is close to her sisters so she may end up gossiping about me and my family so I'm not taking any chances but she is very nosy. am I an asshole for expecting privacy and space ?

A couple of days ago he told me hes been having misgivings about the relationship for months. 
In response to this we decided to try slowing down the relationship and try to give each other more space to think.
Hes coming down to visit me again, and it could be our last week together. I know it would hurt me if we were to have sex only for him to tell me at the end of the week that it's over. It would emotionally destroy me.
I want to tell him that I dont want any form of sexual contact if hes going to end things afterwards. 
Will I be the asshole?

Edit: I just wanted to say thanks for all the advice and talking to me about similar experiences, I really appreciate it. I also feel like I may have misconstrued some thing when writing this with out realizing. The main thing is he feels like we've gotten way too serious for his comfort and we decided to try being more casual to see if that helps.

c31h2j	2019-06-20 20:55:12	Ceanatis	AITA for not driving this girl to her exams after she ignored my messages from before?	"Couple of weeks ago, my parents weren't home and I had no way to go to school, but I had to go for something important. 

I asked this girl in my class who lives nearby, we don't know each other that well but we get along, we're friendly. She said ""I'll ask my mom and tell you what she says"". Alright.

Couple of hours later, still no response, and I had to sleep soon. I sent her a message, ""so, what did she say?"" and she opened it but didn't answer. Next day, in the morning, I asked one last time to make sure. She left me on read again.

I saw it coming the evening before, so I found another way of going to school in the meantime and kinda forgot about it since I rarely see the girl. Couple of weeks passed and still nothing from her, no apology for the flake, nothing. Mkay.

Well this week in my country is the national exam week for highschoolers. An hour ago or so I see I have a message from her. She said her parents aren't home and she needs someone to drive her to the exam tomorrow. I fucking orgasmed when I saw that.
Obviously I left her on read because I'm petty as shit lol.

Then I see I have a call from a friend of mine, with a message, ""urgent."" Is he in trouble? I immediately text him, and he says ""[girl] asked me to tell you to check your messages"" fuckin lol.

I don't plan on responding. I'll do the same thing she did; I'll open her messages, not give a shit, and will carry on with my life.

However, I started thinking about it 5 mins ago. I mean yeah it was a bitch move from her but eh it wasn't exams. If she misses this she could have to redo the whole year if she can't find a way to go to school. But on the other hand I HATE this kind of disrespect, and intend on teaching her a lesson.

c31gms	2019-06-20 20:54:16	BakaOokami24	AITA for proving my English teachers I'm smart?	"   Back when I was in high school I would often be lazy about my English classes so it's funny that I should write this because I'm not sure if this falls under here.  
   During my final years of highschool, I set to finish English II and IV but I ( at the time) thought it was unnecessary to take English seriously (I had already passed ((barely)) my English II STARR exam and had half credit in each English class due to prior been moving from district to district.). So as baka that I am, I rarely did any amount of work provided by my English teachers and that often lead to conflict as to inquire how would I even pass their end of course exams (EOC). Although their words at that time were to be professional, I had an unusual feeling of been looked down upon.
  So on the day of their EOC (English IV was actually a credit by exam test) I arrive and as quickly as I could, answered all the questions on the sheets of paper and with a semi-smug look on my face I turn them in.  Come to find out by my English II teacher and IV asking me this million dollar question to me, '""If you could easily pass this test, then why would you ignore all the work I had given you during the semester?""' and what was my reply?  '""I just wanted to proved you wrong for saying that I was going to fail'"". So Am I the Asshole for doing something so petty?"	Asshole	0	0

c31fq9	2019-06-20 20:52:19	AvocadoPip	AITA for telling my boyfriend I can’t listen to his problems anymore?	"So my boyfriend and I have been through a lot over our last 8 years together, including him slipping into depression due to emotional abuse by his parents coupled with him failing his degree. I have never blamed him for these problems but the problems are self feeding in that he’s so miserable he can’t find a full time job and so he’s stuck in his abusive home.

I’ve tried everything to help him but it’s been 2 years since we left uni and he’s still at home part time and this is frustrating. I have a full time job as a teacher and I want to build a life with him and a home together but he’s so far behind. My job is demanding as I work in an autism school and my brother is also autistic requiring constant support. I feel like all I’m doing between my students, brother and boyfriend is supporting others and I’m feeling very alone. 

It all came to ahead tonight after I just finished a long 24 hour shift and finally got home from our school residential trip and my boyfriend blows up my phone with the same broken record problems of how horrid his parents are and how unhappy he is. I lost it and told him I can’t listen to it anymore, that I can’t fix it and that he needs to cope better as it’s the same everyday. He called me selfish and said that his problems are valid. The problem is I don’t feel like his problems are valid as I don’t see many attempts of him trying to leave home and better himself. In fact I’m even applying to jobs for him as he says he has no time between his part time job and looking after his parents house to apply. He also said his depression makes it harder. 

Am I the asshole for thinking he’s using his problems to stop himself growing up and finding work and for not wanting to listen to these issues anymore?"	Asshole	0	0
c31fkx	2019-06-20 20:52:01	Annasyara	AITA for not wanting to do all of the cleaning even though I’m home while my boyfriend works?	"My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, living together for one. I am 20 and he is 21. I am home most days because I am currently only a student while he goes to work. 

I pay 100% of my fair share when it comes to rent and groceries as well as other home supplies (if you must know why, I have a college fund set aside to pay my living expenses while I’m going to school.)

My boyfriend and I have had a continuous problem with the cleaning of our household. I tend to do 100% of the cleaning but every once in a while due to stress I don’t clean for a few days which results in him coming home and being very angry at me. He says that since I am home all the time while he works that I should be doing the cleaning. 

I would understand this if we had a breadwinner/housewife situation but I am paying my fair share as well as extra when it comes to our animals and vet appointments, food when friends are over, and extra grocery runs. 

We have friends over a lot so I am not only cleaning up after the two of us, but many people and it gets draining to clean up the same exact things every single day with no help from anyone. 

I feel like even though I am home more, I shouldn’t have to do 100% of the cleaning. I’m tired and I want help. I’m not even saying he has to do 50%, I just wish he would help me clean the kitchen sometimes or put his shoes on the rack I bought him instead of right next to it. Or put his trash in the can instead of next to his chair. Or his cereal bowl in the dishwasher instead of the sink. 

I’m one person and I’m tired of cleaning up after 10+ people every day with no help from anyone. I feel exhausted. I feel like I’m dating someone who treats me like his mother when it comes to cleaning. I’m tired and I feel like it’s not fair. 

TL;DR - My boyfriend works while I stay at home as a student and he wants me to do 100% of the cleaning even though we split all bills and other finances equally. I’m tired and want help."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c31fes	2019-06-20 20:51:38	MrTsuckah	AITA for waking up my university dorm at 5 AM?	"  

I willingly went to a religious institution for university. They tend to be more structured with mandatory hall meetings happening every week and prayer meetings shortly after. Another interesting rule here was that quiet hours began at 2100 but they ended at 0500 so that students could worship at some of the chapels dotted around campus. Not many people did, but those were the rules. I was a ROTC/national guard nursing student. The rigors of nursing school are pretty well known as it contains both complex academic and clinical components. On top of that, I was waking up at 0600 three times a week for military stuff or I was gone for some weekend drill. There were of course people who had it much worse, but I had to bust my ass to make ends meet and that's where trouble began.

The other students in my dorm were nice and well intended but they would be making all sorts of ruckus (no relation) late into the night. I had been suffering the juvenile tomfoolery of my younger dorm mates for a few weeks when I decided to ask my RA if he could step in and try to calm everyone down. He was people pleaser though, and didn't have it in him to do it.

I made my appeal at the next hall meeting. It worked for a time, but sugar is one hell of a drug to a newly liberated high schooler who has recently discovered that mom and dad won't stop them from downing a case of mountain, and soon after I was back where it started. I reminded them that quiet hours began at 9 and I appealed to their pity a second time. They ebbed and flowed again.

It was around this time that I discovered the rule that quiet hours ended at 5am. Because I had to be up for a 740 class or a 6am physical training, I decided to go vigilante. I gave them one last warning that there would be repercussions for keeping me up. I went to Walmart and bought an air horn used to warn boats on the water. I apologized to my room mate and set my alarm for 0455.I waited until it was 0505 before sounding the air horn.

The first small bleurp procured no response. I had expected this. Continuously stimulating them was the key. Keep sweet sleep just within their grasp and yank it away at the last second. I would sound the horn on 5 minute intervals until I had to go to leave. People would groggily lean out of their rooms and stare at me hatefully through squinted eyes. Some were guilty and some were innocent. One student grumbled that ""that's not very Christian of you"" as he trudged to the shower room. I smiled at all who came out and wished them a good morning over my book on obstetrics and gynecological studies.

I only had to do this act three times. After that, I never had a problem until that one day they cancel classes right before finals. I still look on my actions with pride but my wife thinks I was just power tripping and off the rails. Help me reddit by humbling me or giving me the ammunition to shove this in her face!"	Asshole	0	0
c31e27	2019-06-20 20:48:38	HeyyoooitsRico	AITA for hogging the TV?	"My sisters (20 and 22) dont live at my familys home but theyre staying in the living room until next wednesday. 

After school I usually like to watch a movie on the tv in the living room. Maybe a couple episodes of the Office. 
My sisters were watching an anime when i went to the gym and when I returned 2.5 hours later they were still watching it so I went to turn on netflix but they said they wanted ro finish the episode
After the episode my sister grabbed the remote and we played tugofwar with it until she finally put it down. I turned on netflix and turned on my movie but 2mins in my sister turned it off. 

Then i went to the store and when i got back i turned on my movie but my sister turned it off. 
I saw my sister take the remote. I went to tell my dad but he said it was dinner time so we ate dinner and when i was done i went to the living room but it was locked. 

When everyone was done I went outside to ask my sister where the renote was and she shrugged and said she didnt take it. I saw her take it. 

Then I used another remote that works with the TV and started watching netflix when my sister turned on her loud music. She claimed I took her headphones. I did not. 

Then my dad turned off the internet and said it was too late for a movie. 

Ive been trying to watch this movie for r hours at this point and Ive gotten 8 minutss in. I started yelling at my suster which she then broke out saying I get away with everything and Im a hypocritical jerk and that all of my siblings hate me and im a problem and everyone thinks Im mean and my dad called me a spoiled entitled brat and she claimed i hogged the TV. Keep in mind thsy spend the night in the living room. They could watch TV anytime in the night and when im at school for 7 hours. 

So my dad yelled at me to get out of the living room and he took my computer away and said i could aatch the movie but I couldnt watch any the next day. 

But when they said I was a hypocritical entitled spoiled jerk that none of my family liked I got really sad because I dont try to be mean.

c31dzt	2019-06-20 20:48:27	GoatTheKIdd	AITA for not inviting a group of girls to our party?	"This is my first post so I hope i'm doing it right. I know my problem isn't as heavy as some others, but i'm really conflicted.

&#x200B;

Let me preface this by mentioning a few things. My friends and I are all in high school, and we aren't much the party going teenagers. By this I mean that we don't go to a lot of parties, and we don't throw a lot of parties. That being said, my friend (we'll call him B) is throwing his first party later this week, and we are all pretty excited. We're throwing one because it's the end of the year, and we want to give it a try. B wants to keep the guest list small and the party under wraps, so that it won't get out of hand. 

&#x200B;

Some more backstory: my friend group and I have been together for a long time, and there is another friend group of girls in our school that have mirrored our experience of being longtime friends (we'll call them the Ladies), and our two groups are friendly because we've all been at the same schools for so long. The Ladies have thrown a few parties over the year, and we've been invited to most of them. These parties consist of my friend group and theirs, so relatively small. The thing about those parties is that me and my friends don't usually have a good time, because the Ladies seem to always ignore us and go off on their own to do their own thing. They would leave sporadically and go to the hostess's bedroom, leaving me and my friends alone in the basement. They always seem uninterested in engaging with us, and never take initiative to talk to us. Stuff like that kept happening, and eventually we just decided to not go their parties anymore. Because of their behavior, we didn't show up to their most recent one which was a month ago. 

&#x200B;

Now here's where the conflict arises. We didn't invite the Ladies to our party. We barely talk to them at school anymore, and our party experience with them is not very positive. The news of B's party is got around to the Ladies, and now they are angry with us that we didn't invite them. We already filled up the guest list with people that we are better friends with, and we felt no obligation to invite them. However, they brought up the fact that they always invite us, and it's unfair that we didn't invite them, so now I'm having a moral dilemma. Are we assholes for not inviting them, even though they always invite us?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c31b0a	2019-06-20 20:41:58		AITA for asking another person's kid to pipe down?	"I was at my child's swim lesson. The way the place is set up, there is a pool area connected to a locker/bathroom area connected to a front entry area that is part cash register/offices, part waiting gallery where you can see the pool, and part indoor play area for kids as they wait.

I'm halfway watching my kid, halfway surfing net when I hear this noise of a 4 or 5-year-old: ""Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaahhhheeeee!""

On one hand, it was a sound of glee. On the other hand, it was about the loudest, sharpest, most obnoxious, out of control sound of glee imaginable. I won't say for certain that the little girl was making the noise just to be loud or to get attention, but it was one of those spine-cringing, blood curdling noises, even if it was a preschooler having the time of her life.

I thought her parents might say something as she continued doing it, and then again as she made the noise again, but louder and longer. ""WWWWWWWWAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHEEEEEEEEEEEE!"" It was a screech, a long, nails-on-chalkboard-style screech. I couldn't believe no one was saying anything.

I waited, and again she let one out, it grew in volume, filling the whole gallery. I could feel the entire space cringing as this girl's parents did nothing. I finally had it. I stood up, walked over to the little girl, bent down on one knee, looked her straight in the eye and said, ""This is indoors. Could you please use a softer voice.""

Then I went to sit down. She stopped making the noise, but almost immediately after, her father stormed over to me, ""Why don't you let me parent my own child.""

To which I replied, ""By all means, do"" and returned to watching my kid at his lesson.

My father is adamant I follow in the family’s footstep despite the fact that I have little interest in either field. My true passion is  entrepreneurship but I’m borderline confident my dad will cut me off if I don’t go into either field. Every time I express my dislike of the field he brings up how long ago my ancestor lives in poverty until one of them worked hard and became a lawyer and then mentions how if I don’t go into the family business I’ll be tarnishing our reputation and according to him all the money he’s spent on my education would of been a waste. I have shown him my determination and on my own worked as a waiter and eventually bought and operated  several vending machines during summer of my high school junior year but he still wants me to go to Med or law school. I truly do think that even if I have to go into debt I may go to business school anyways which is my true passion. It’s like he thinks I have to do this or I’ll somehow be unworthy.

c3193x	2019-06-20 20:37:51		AITA for asking my friend to get back to me about making plans?	"So been close friends with this person for almost four years, and a few weeks ago on a Monday or Tuesday she asked if I could get dinner with her and her mom.  I said sure wanna do Friday, to which she responds I'll get back to you.  She doesn't get back to me so on Thursday morning, I text her hey what are we doing about dinner tomorrow? No response till the next day on Friday night when the dinner was supposed to happen asking to schedule for Monday.  I said sure I'll make time for you but please next time could you get back to me, cuz other wise I just wait around and I could make other plans.

&#x200B;

To give some background, many of my friends and I know that she is a notorious flake and constantly either dips out last minute or doesn't respond even when she softly commits to something.  This is definitely a chronic situation, and I actually had a civil conversation with her a few months ago and I dropped it.  But this time, she gives me a myriad of excuses of ""I'm never on my phone / I didn't get your text (shows delivered) / I'm stressed out / I don't really go out anymore / I'm always waiting for new gigs (jobs)""  I get frustrated and very bluntly say ""I know you're on your phone... you're posting Instagram stories and hanging out with other people. That's fine but I think you can take five seconds to not leave me hanging. It's also okay if you say no.""  She took this as very aggressive, and I admit that next time it'll probably be better if I have this conversation in person.   

&#x200B;

She then follows this up by saying she doesn't want to speak to me if I'm going to ""be like this"" till after she finds a job to fulfill her visa requirements (she's foreign).  I definitely understand that the job search is quite stressful, and more-so for an immigrant trying to stay in the states.   That's why I feel kind of conflicted on this, because I've begun to wonder if I'm just not being empathetic enough to her in the moment. Maybe I could just let it slide. However, I am kind of offended she double downed and leveraged her presence as a way to drop it. I mean, this has been happening before the visa thing became an issue and I feel like I'm not asking for much?  Just a ""hey I can't make it"" text with a reasonable amount of time ahead (even morning of). In addition, I always prioritize her and work around her schedule and my schedule is pretty tight as well.   I told her I would prefer she tells me ""Hey I'm super busy and waiting to look for work. Can't hang out"" rather than commit lightly and not respond.  It sometimes feels like she's shopping around plans with jobs and other people before committing to something. 

&#x200B;

Idk I feel like this is very trivial but at the same time on principal it's more about overall respect.  She hasn't spoken to me in a month even though we were very close."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c318u3	2019-06-20 20:37:14	tatarake	AITA for snapping at my parents and sister for letting her go on vacation	"So today during dinner I got in a discussion with my mom and sister since she told me that she was going to Bali this summer (we spent our childhood there so it’s not that weird).
I went last year when I graduated but I had to save up 2 years for that for the flight ticket and hotel and stuff.


Now I hear that my sister suddenly is going to Bali in July even though she still hasn’t bought her ticket. Last minute tickets are over €1000 while my mom was mad at me that my ticket was €700 (bought it a year upfront).


I got annoyed with the obvious favouritism and kinda snapped at them since it wasn’t fair but my mom said that I was being a bitch for snapping like that. I told her that it was unfair because my mom is paying for everything while I had to save up.

c318t5	2019-06-20 20:37:09	newpersons12	AITA for not telling my uncle about a job interview I had until after I finished the interview.	"Recently, my uncle has been trying to help me get a job for the summer in the same hospital where he works. He recommended a job(clerical work) to me about 3 weeks ago and I have been working on trying to get that job, he also recommended that I try to apply for other jobs as well if I don't hear back for the clerical job.

Last Monday I had a phone interview for the clerical job and it went well, but they didn't message me again and were vague about when they would contact me. This Tuesday, I sent an email to the person I had the phone interview with as an attempt to follow up with them and remind them of me. 

On Wednesday(yesterday) afternoon (2:30ish) I received a call from a asking about my availability for an interview. I told the person that I'm free next week and this Thursday. We decided on Thursday(today) for the interview at 2pm. It was fairly short notice but I didn't really mind.

So Thursday(today) I had the interview and it went very well. When I got home I told my dad about it and he said I should call my uncle and talk to him because he helped me with the job. To my dad had called my uncle already about 30 minutes after my interview was over he didn't pick up. My dad said he thinks it because I didn't call him earlier. My uncle calls me back a few minutes after the conversation with my dad and I tell him about the interview. He says ""You didn't need to call to tell me that, my people already told me"". I don't know who he was talking who told him, I'm guessing one of his friends in the department or my dad. He then said that I should be the one he hears things from. I apologized, but he said that I don't need to apologize. He said that he was happy for me, but his tone and the things he said earlier suggested that he was upset.

I wasn't aware that I he had other informants and didn't think that the interview was urgent news. I can somewhat understand why he's upset but I don't think I did anything particularly wrong. Was it wrong of me to tell him about the interview after it was done, rather than earlier?

"A bit of a backstory here: last night I was extremely ill at work and I had to have my boyfriend come and take me home. He has been very kind and helpful while I haven’t felt well, but today he mentioned that he wanted to leave town (3+ hours away) to visit some friends, and I’m not allowed to come with. 
We just moved to the state he grew up in, and I have not one person to talk to, visit, or even a house to live in, so I will be stuck in his childhood bedroom if his parents’ house until he returns some time tomorrow. 
His friends are very adamant about not wanting to meet me. We have chatted online and even played video games together before my boyfriend and I started our relationship, but since we’ve been together, the insist on not ever meeting me in person because they are nervous.
I’m feeling very conflicted because I don’t want to keep my boyfriend from his friends and having a good time but I also feel like this is super unfair???

c3182s	2019-06-20 20:35:28		AITA for being blocked over a joke?	"So basically I have this female friend, that I’ve known for 5 years. She’s been acting weird for the past 2 years, like not talking to me for no specific reason, not saying happy birthday to me, giving me a laminated piece of paper with a couple of pictures (after I gave her an authentic fan from China that cost 20 bucks with her name and everything), she says she’s busy, then gets a boyfriend, and just being an overall jerk. I’ve told her a couple of secrets about my crush, and she ended up telling my crush that I liked another girl (I kind of did like that other girl, but it was obvious that I didn’t like her anymore)

Yesterday, I sent her a picture (on purpose) that said “Your future spouse is currently walking around making memories they’ll tell you about someday” then I said I accidentally sent it to her (I don’t really know why), then she said something like “wow” and as an inside joke, I told her “Are you flirting with me?” (My friend told me that one time he played a funny sound in her ear and she thought it was flirting?). Her last text to me was the middle finger emoji and said “no”. She clearly didn’t get the joke, and didn’t ask what I was talking about. She just blocked me over a joke! I even asked her boyfriend (who is also my friend) and he saw that she blocked me and tried to stop her, but she refused.

What’s going to be funny is that her parents are so fond of me for some reason and now they’re probably going to be wondering why she blocked me, because they’re eventually going to find out. I’m honestly curious as to what she’s going to say.

c3155r	2019-06-20 20:29:12		WIBTA if I complained to my supervisors about another person getting preferential treatment?	"I'm a guy in his early 30s and recently took an AmeriCorp position vaguely related to my career interests. It has been quite a sacrifice living on the AmeriCorp stipend and has required me to often live off the kindness of my wife and mom, however I thought the potential for future opportunities would be worth it. The program I'm in is pretty small and, when I first began, I was only working with one other person, a girl in her early 20s. Almost immediately, our main supervisor began responding to her much more than me. As the program has grown over the past 2 months, this quickly turned into him quietly advocating for her to take on a leadership role. I didn't mind this at first as I just assumed it was because she was younger and the organization running our program thought she would benefit more from the experience. I decided that the best way for me to proceed was to try and build my own opportunities within the program by coming up with different proposals and ideas for ways we could engage the public (the program is conservation-oriented and I'm a grad student currently studying conservation outreach). Much to my chagrin, my proposals have been universally met with the bare minimum level of enthusiasm from our supervisors while my co-worker has continued to receive tremendous amounts of support and opportunities. 

Today it was finally announced to me, as well as the other people that have since joined the program, that my co-worker would now be our official leader. This would make more sense to me if she had demonstrated greater competence, ability, or enthusiasm for the role we perform, but, for the most part, we have been equal in our efforts. At this point, it seems that our supervisors just have a general preference for her over me and furthermore, there really isn't any opportunity or other benefit waiting for me at the end of this 6 month position. If I resigned now, it would really screw the program to the point that it may no longer be able to function. This isn't something I really want to do to them. That being said, I am having a difficult time justifying sticking with the program and being a financial burden to my family if there is little actual benefit in doing so. Would I be the asshole if I brought these concerns up to my supervisors?"		1	0

c3150w	2019-06-20 20:28:54	RetiringIn321	AITA for Refusing to Provide Financial Advice to my Boss?	"Background: I (30M) day trade as a hobby and for the first few hours of market open, I make quite a bit. A few hundred USD one day, a few hundred another day. Over time it adds up to quite a sum, and I've been quite proud of myself. My co-workers know this because some of us talk about our finances, and how we make money with side-hustles in addition to our main full-time jobs. It's gotten to the point where, in the short-term, I make far more day trading than my actual job.

My boss catches wind of this and starts buttering me up. She then pressures me to give her tips, teach her how to day trade, lamenting how she hates her job, and how she wants to get rich in order to stop working and afford other luxuries.

She's maybe mid-40s to early-50s. She works the day shift so she can't be there when market opens, so she says I could teach her and she could teach her husband, who could sit at home and day trade.

Personally, I don't think that's a great idea because she's nearing retirement age, can't afford to wait out market downturns, 'claims' to have a 'high' risk tolerance, and says she won't blame me if she loses money (She will blame me, which is why I only trade with my own money, and no one else's).

I am not a financial advisor, and I have ZERO background in financial matters. What I do is technical analysis, and SO FAR, it's working out. I usually try to side-step or avoid talking about day trading too much near my boss but she refuses to take the hint. I even outright say it's a bad idea and I don't wanna tell her but she presses on.

One day, I get fed up with her pressuring me so I just go on a 5-minute rant about what I do (including jargon that she won't understand - and I know this) in an attempt to indirectly show her out-of-depth she is. I end up directing her to a site I used in the beginning in order to understand the basic principles of technical analysis.

It took me a YEAR to figure out what works and I'm glad I didn't wipe out my account like most retail traders do. I'm currently far out in the green, but I recognize that may change at any time which is why I kept my full-time job (night shift).

I personally believe she does not have the attitude, time, or resources, to be a day trader.

c314dh	2019-06-20 20:27:33	ThrowawayNerves98	WIBTA if I canceled my husbands birthday dinner?	"Weeks ago, I asked my SO what he wanted for his birthday (Friday - tomorrow). He said, “steak, margaritas, and sex”. I was like, cool, I can do that. 

The original plan was to have my mother babysit (we have 2 small children) so we could grab dinner and have fun. 

Fast forward; 
On Monday, I came home from work and he told me, hey, I invited your mom to the Steakhouse Friday. I asked if he was sure he wanted her and the kids to be there. He said yes, I said okay bc family. 

On Wednesday, I came home and he told me he invited my sister, BIL, and their 2 kids. 

Today, Thursday, my sister texted us both and said they invited a mutual friend of SO and BIL. SO is completely fine with it. 

Here’s the thing, for the past few months I’ve been dealing with a lot of anxiety issues that are exerbated by large, loud, crowds to the point where I have panic attacks and need to leave. The place we’re going to isn’t quiet by any means but instead of just the 2 of us, we’re now 10 deep and just thinking about it makes my heart race and palms sweat. 

I know if I talked to him about it, he would probably say yes to something else but I would feel bad about canceling because it’s the only thing he’s asked for and he’s adamant that it’s what he wants.

Edit: the anxiety stems from being surrounded / trapped by the noise and crowd. The only seating the restaurant has to accommodate a group this large is right in the middle surrounded by booths and other tables. 

By cancel, I mean cancel at this specific  restaurant, party at another place, but it wouldn’t be steak.

Edit: I probably am TA. But it’s a moot point now because I came home and he told me we’re scrapping the dinner idea and going with a bbq and swimming. I didn’t influence this decision. He said, “the drinks are cheaper, we can invite more family, and (others) can smoke”."	Asshole	0	0
c31447	2019-06-20 20:26:58	Throwawayfriends123g	WIBTA for ending friendship with bipolar woman?	"Throwaway account.

Backstory: I have a friend who I have known for almost 8 years. She is bipolar. She has been prescribed medication that she doesn't take. Is not in therapy, either. To each their own, no judgement, etc etc.

We have always had an agreement that we won't lend each other cash. If either of us needs something (within reason) we buy it for each other. We also take turns paying for dinner/smokes/food/etcetc. I'm really non-judgemental so she takes advantage of that by wanting to hang out when she needs an emotional sounding board but it's kinda not fair because it's one sided.

We also share our personal lives. However, over the years when she has gotten mad she has thrown it it my face, and told other people my secrets. I tried to be understanding, because she has a mental illness, but I really don't want to deal with the backstabbing anymore. She has said some really foul things, and has done some really petty things as well. She has also made a point to offer help, and then yank it away at the last minute. (Example: my phone was dying and I had locked myself out of my apartment. I called her to help me get in, she said she would be omw and don't call the landlord -he charges a lockout fee-. Last minute, she messages me saying I can't help you right as my phone is dying) 

She also tries to guilt me into giving her money for things like her car brakes, or her car payment once. **Edit I don't mind helping if she needed something, but she spends her cash and maxes out her cards at the casino and spends any cash I give her at the casino and scratch offs, which isn't my place to say, but I feel like I'm throwing my money away when I give her money for gas cuz she's on Empty but she doesn't use it at the gas station* She is a habitual gambler, it is an addiction at this point, but she denies it most of the time. It's gotten to the point that I really don't like to hang out with her because she always has to stop and get scratch offs, and wants to go to the casino, and I used the excuse that I couldn't go to the casino because of my job, but that excuse has lost its steam because I don't work at the same place.

Anyway, this is kind of all coming to a head because she messaged me saying she had a personal injury, I asked if she was okay, if she wanted me to come to the hospital etc and she said no. I said hope you feel better soon, keep me updated. No word from her for a while, a week goes by of her posting things about her doing fun stuff on Facebook and being active on messenger, and she left me on read during that time. 

WIBTA if I just completely ended this friendship? I'm really kind of sick of it all and it feels toxic.

To be fair, he does have a full time job, and he helps out with a bill or two here and there, but he doesn’t pay any kind of rent. 

A little background: My mother made a promise to all of us: if we get a license, she’ll help us get a car.  Well, my brother and I got our licensees two weeks apart, so she bought me a little car (it was 800 bucks from a family friend) and gave him 1k to get his own, seeing as he was 26 at the time and working. He used my car while I was in school to get around my junior year of high school, which I allowed, and I used it during the summer to work, while he rode his bike to his job (it was that close). It’s an old car (like 1995), so any maintenance it needs, he pays for, and any accidents that happen, he’s caused (and has had to subsequently pay for). 

Well, issues started to arise my senior year of HS, where I had the opportunity to drive to school instead of having to walk to the bus stop every morning, but he wanted to use it to get to work. My mom told me that I should have told him then to back off, but I figured that he was working towards getting a nice car for himself. I stopped working after school to accommodate his schedule, and walked home (roughly 2 miles) after school every day because of my after school activities. The year was a little rocky but it’s okay (in retrospect, it’s not).

Now, this summer, my brother can no longer bike to work while I drive, because he got a promotion and works a state over. I’m stuck in the house this summer, and I can only work weekends (when he’s off), which is barely enough to cover the household netflix and hulu (that i pay for - which, in my current state, is like a quarter of my pay), let alone enough to have some pocket cash to spend with friends for my last summer. To compensate, i’ve started working 10-hour shifts on those two days, which leaves me exhausted. I can’t hang out with my friends for the last summer before we all split up, because he’s working. I’m getting fed up, because my mom and I have told him repeatedly to get his own car for the past two years now. We honestly have no idea why he’s not doing so. 

I want to know if I would be the asshole in this situation for just removing his access to the car completely. 

TL;DR: My brothers use of my car to get to his job is preventing me from chasing a bag and hanging out with my friends. WIBTA if I just cut off his access entirely?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Her dad had no idea that I made it and wanted to know where I bought it. He was astounded by my partner's revelation that I make quilts like this all the time.

Partner suspected that the quilt was for his niece and was also pleased at what I had done.

Thank you all for commenting.

I  make quilts to give away. If they are for someone special I put a lot  of time into the design, the quilting, etc., usually close to 100 hours.

I  am not close with my partner's family. In fact they have not invited us  to any family function in  20 plus years although I encourage my  partner to stay in touch since it's me they don't want around.

His  young adult niece was diagnosed with a serious illness and we are not  allowed any information about her or how things are going. Her father  threatened to cut communication with any family member who talked with  us.

On my own I decided to make her a  flannel quilt and sent it. I did not tell partner what I was doing and  the note included specified that I was the one who sent it. I tracked it  to be sure it was delivered and have confirmation that it was. I did  not expect to receive a thank you note or any other comment as I wanted  to send it as a means of support and comfort not for a thank you.

"Today my girlfriend [f26] told me [m25] that her brother [m24] will come living with us in our apartment. He apparently had a drug overdose. He had been doing drugs for years and never got clean and has never been able to keep jobs for more than a couple months. He is currently living with his parents for free basically. Since he does not have a job he is suppise to keep their house clean but he is not even doing it. I don't want him to live with us and here is the back story...

 He already lived with us for about 7 months last year. He was suppose to give my girlfriend 40$ (half his welfare per week) and he did for a while before he stopped because he complained to her that he can't do shit with 40$ a week. During the day while my girlfriend and I were either at work or school, he wouldn't do anything to keep the apartment clean. He would just watch TV or play Xbox all day while smoking weed and eating a shit load of food. He was also stealing money/cigarettes and other stuff and lying about it. Once he said the dog ate the weed... Sometimes he would take off for a couple days and come back all fucked up. He was living with us for free taking space and eating all our food and my girlfriend would not do anything because she was scared that if she would kick him out it would ruin their relationship. He finally found a decent paying job across the country and left. He kept it for 5 months and lost it somehow and got back at his parent's place.

I don't want him living with us because I do think he should get to detox because he has been on drugs for years and never got clean. If he lives with us he will be the same as he was when he lived with us last year. Right now money is tight and I don't want to struggle because of someone who does not want to change and can't take care of himself."	Not the A-hole	1	0

c30we8	2019-06-20 20:10:20	MaliciousAITA	AITA for leaving my parents unaware of their grandchild	"Throwaway because coworkers don't need to know about my drama. 

So 6 years ago I came out to my religious, Polish parents, although they moved to Germany before I was even born. 

I knew their reaction was probably going to be bad and my relationship with them was on the line. But they took it even worse than expected.

About the worst thing they said was that homosexuals should never have kids because they would just be abused by their parents. One day they saw me as a wonderful future father and couldn't shut up about it, next instance they act like I'm completely changed and I, their own son, would do something like that. I was speechless and really upset and they followed it up with ""If you ever have a partner or kids, don't ever think about introducing them to us."" At this point I just told them that I'll remember that one and that they'll get their will and left.

Shortly after that I met my partner, down the line we decided to have a kid and his sister agreed to step in for surrogacy. His family is incredibly accepting (duh) and a constant reminder of what I don't have, so this whole thing was the biggest emotional roller-coaster, from her offering, to child birth to now. The biological mother is an angel and with us every step of the way. 

We are the proud parents of a boy who just celebrated his first birthday. While this may seem petty, I held them to their word and didn't introduce either hubby nor grandchild to them. Partially because some months into my relationship my brother decided to drop the news in the hope they might come around, but it was just a big shitstorm all over. This was one of several occasions over the years where I repeatedly demanded an apology, they always said they have nothing to apologize for and eventually I stopped expecting it. 

For obvious reasons after birth my visits became even fewer and the excuses got worse, so I guess they knew something was off, they put my brother on the spot and he eventually caved in and told them. 

They went hysterical, called me to confront me and I just calmly told them I was executing their wishes to the dot of the i, that they are to blame for it and that they also know how to make it right again and hang up. They still can't understand how I could treat them like that by not introducing their grandchild and ever since I've been getting messages from extended family basically calling me the biggest asshole on the planet.

My partner respects my decision, his parents aren't fully in the picture but shocked and so are friends until they learn more. Also I know that I've also put my brother in a terrible spot, but he gets it. 

**Tl;Dr: Came out, parents said some vile shit. I demanded an apology multiple times and over years they didn't come around, so I did what they asked me to and kept me becoming a parent from them.**

3 yrs ago: Everything started of when we tried to talk with each other. She saw me using instagram so she told me that I could follow her. That night, yk when you just followed a new people you tend to check out their following or followers and so yeah i went to her followers to find anyone i knew in that school to follow (since im new there). Then the time i scrolled down i just hit that follow button unknowingly on many random accounts (i assume that it just might be some people in my school or probably just her friends). Subsequently, for few days she texted me and said that i stalked her due to me actually following her relatives. So to make up for that i gave her my account details and permission for her unfollow her relatives. After that i changed my password. The next day she knocked the door of my room said that there are still some people that i need to unfollow so i gave her my phone. Well i dont really understand what's the big deal with that?

Then she started to pick on me

I received a text message with no profile picture or info. It said ""can you not smack your lips when you are eating its annoying"" and im like wtf, when did i smacked my lips!?? Then i found out that this is her. Well i actually did smack my lips it was during dinner time. I was actually imitating a guy from a videoclip testing icecreams towards my friends at dinner table. She sat at different table a little bit far from mine. Her words doesnt bother me much but what bother me is she's been watching me.

I have must blurt out things accidentally that triggered her (hell i know what it were). I've been talking to her friend of why does she despises me. They told me that she finds me awkward (but i see her getting fine with other awkward people) and i triggered her somethin.
__________
So this one happened last month, it was an exam period for all of us. So we all were studying in area called the ""common room"". It was divided into 3 sections and 2 of em has this sliding doors. I was in the one of this sliding door room studying while she and her friends being really loud at the next room. I was getting irritated and i slide shut the door (it was janky and loud) and i hope this give them a cue to lower down the volume. While shutting the door she instead laugh out loudy close to yelling as if she's provoking me. After few moments she was fake coughing and said ""oops sorry didnt meant to be rude"". Idk if that is genuine.

To see on +ve side, ppl liked her and she is a lot better than me in many ways anyways.

c30t2g	2019-06-20 20:03:00	spiceepirate	WIBTA for canceling RSVP to a wedding my BF isn’t invited to?	"Hi all. So I just rang my friend to RSVP for her wedding for myself and my BF, but she let me know that he’s actually not invited. The lines to add names on the RSVP cards were for “families” and there isn’t room for people to bring plus ones. 

For clarity, my BF and I have been together for over 4 years and live together. He has met my friend and her fiancé on several occasions, and has even been to their apartment and various other parties and outings over the years. They aren’t close by any means (I’m not super close to her either) but I was shocked to find out my BF isn’t invited. 

I would 100% invite the SO of someone in my situation if roles were reversed. I’d invite her and her fiancé to my wedding even if they weren’t married! 

My boyfriend and I already made plans to attend (request time off work, etc) and now I have to tell him he’s actually not invited, which is just going to make him feel awkward and unwanted. 

All of my friends will be there and I was really looking forward to going, and my BF was looking forward to another opportunity to get closer to my friends (something I also want). Now it’s just awkward. Several of my friends will have their SOs there as they are engaged or are both friends with the bride/groom, whereas my BF is an “outsider”. 

My gut reaction was to angrily say “well I take back my RSVP then!” But I calmed down and told her I need to think about it and consider travel arrangements. WIBTA for canceling my RSVP and not going? More importantly, WIBTA for being angry at her? Confronting her even? I will and do see her very often.

c30t1c	2019-06-20 20:02:56		AITA For getting upset at my girlfriend for tickling me? (I'm a male)	"So a little bit of background--I absolutely hate being tickled. It's annoying and regardless of it making me laugh at times, I absolutely loathe it. It all started when I was a kid and my dad, granddad, and older cousins would hold me down with a blanket or a pillow over my head and just tickle me under my arms, my sides, and on my neck vigorously while I would try to escape. It didn't help that I was extremely claustrophobic so all in all, it was pretty fucked up as a kid. 

Fast forward to today, I cannot stand being tickled. Well, I've never been able to take it but it hasn't been the biggest issue since no one really tickles me...other than my girlfriend. She knows I hate it and I tell her to stop but she just does not listen. 

It's one thing when I'm standing up and she just pokes my sides--it annoys me but it's not as bad as when I'm in a compromising state (like laying down or when I park the car). For example, I'll be laying on the bed on my stomach and she'll jump on me and just go to down on my sides and then moves to my arms depending on how I squirm. I'm bigger/stronger than her so I usually don't struggle getting her off of me but sometimes she'll have me in a position where the tickling just has me laughing and moving around so much that I just kind of succumb to it until I eventually get my away out.  

Every now and then, I will get really upset about it and she will say I'm being dramatic and a baby. This past time it happened, I ended up cussing her out and she said I overreacted and that I needed to apologize for flipping out over something so ""minor"" in her eyes. Needless to say, I didn't apologize and we both moved on.

Am I the asshole for getting to the point where I flip out on her over this?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

So I am a 21(F) and work as a teller at a small local bank. Today at work I was approached by my manager who asked me to please stop addressing customers as ""sweetie"" and ""honey"" because she received a complaint about me specifically. I have always used these in service settings and I've never had anyone say anything. According to my boss it was an older lady who informed her that she calls her grandkids honey and that's why she finds it degrading. AITA For using phrases like these or is she in the wrong for asking me to stop?

  


Couple of quick edits: 

1. I of course stopped using them as soon as she asked, I'm not beholden to it or anything, just something I say

c30rpu	2019-06-20 20:00:15	throwawayaoza	AITA for 'pointing out' to the coffee barista that she didn't charge my good looking friend, and subsequently making him pay?	"TLDR - I (22 male) am best friends with John (not real name), who is also 22 male. Now here's the thing, he is incredibly good looking. He's 6''5, muscular and has the face of a greek god. Obviously he gets a lot of attention from girls, and it's not uncommon for servers (usually female ones) to reduce prices on things for him (e.g. drinks, food, etc) or just sometimes not charge him at all.

Well this time we went for a coffee and I ordered a coffee and brownie. I pay for it. Fair game. But then John goes to order the same thing after me. The barista is giggling and flirting hard with him, but what grates me is that she charged him for the coffee but not the brownie. She winked at him and at that point I just saw how unfair it was that I got charged and he didn't, I don't want to sound jealous, but why should I have to pay and he doesn't? 

So I interrupt and say ''Excuse me, you didn't charge him for the brownie''

She looks startled and says ''I'm sorry what?'' so I look her in the eye and tell her ''You didn't charge him. Why not?''. She looks embarrassed and says ''Sorry you're right'' and subsequently charges him.

I'm not the type to say ''Can I speak to your manager please'', and I'm happy that my friend John got a date with that same girl, but I just wasn't going to let him get away with that free brownie whereas I had to pay. John was a bit pissed tho and called me an asshole, AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

c30qe4	2019-06-20 19:57:24	BirdSyndrome	AITA - I deliberately spend my birthday alone every year - what is so wrong with this?	"35F; no kids, family, or SO to consider; I'm not really sure when it happened, but my birthday evolved into a day where I spend it alone - deliberately - whether it was a day spent locally or traveling to some destination. Each year I plan what I will do, on my own, and I generally have a blast seeing things I might not otherwise get to see, going as fast or slow as I please because I'm the only one I need to worry about on this day. I've been doing this for at least a decade. 
To be perfectly honest, this all likely started when I would travel to family and friends locations to visit with them during or around my birthday. While this is what I may have wanted to do I'm confident that these locations were deliberately selected as I knew they didn't know it was my birthday. This is essentially how this whole tradition, of mine, started. Furthermore, I was raised in such a manner that you don't tell people when your birthday is, because it's like asking for handouts or special treatment. If someone asks, I will always be honest and tell them (well maybe not on the internet... for security reasons >.>), but not before.
I've never liked the pomp and circumstance associated with birthdays. I don't want presents, I don't want a birthday cake or birthday dinner; I just want to go do what I want to do. This year I especially didn't want a cake (although there has always been a cake, I'm not sure my mother can resist herself...) as I've adapted a keto lifestyle and cake is just too much sugar for me anymore. It is my birthday, not their birthday. I've been told this before, but the person wasn't particularly close to me so I never thought much of it. This year, however, my nephew told me I was being selfish. Anyone who calls or texts me on this day I respond to, and chat with willingly. Why is the social obligation that I must a day that is designated as ""my day"" the way everyone else thinks it should be spent, and not the way I want to spend it? What blows my mind is that I'm confident if I stayed home and made myself available they wouldn't plan anything with me beyond cake and dinner anyway (even if I made it clear that I wasn't going anywhere).

TL;DR - I deliberately spend birthdays alone, away from everyone who knows that it is my birthday. This is what I want for my birthday. Am I being an asshole?

My mother isnt my favorite person right now for reasons outside of the story, which partially explains why I reacted the way I did. It was her birthday yesterday and I was called downstairs to eat dinner. I was expecting a meal but we were having leftovers which is fine. She started asking if I wanted food that she knew I disliked (I'm not really picky) and I got frustrated. She had been babying me before and I felt that this was just another example of this. I got annoyed (I was already feeling like shit) and didn't answer one of her questions bc if she heard how I felt she would get mad. She confronted me and asked what was wrong. I tried to explain how I felt about the situation and she got angry and sent me to my room. I felt totally powerless in the situation. I heard them sing Happy birthday to her alone in my room.
She later walked into my room(seemingly drunk) and took my guitar, that was a birthday present, without saying a word. I cooked dinner for myself later and cleaned almost all of it up besides a cast iron pan which was incredibly hot at the time. About 20 minutes later she yelled at me about how dirty the kitchen was, saying I was pathetic. I went down and clean the pan.
This morning she told me to write an apology letter, I tried but couldn't think of what to apologise for. She wrote back that I was being disrespectful for not answering and that I should work on being empathetic. She didn't respond to my questions or criticisms.

"My boyfriend Steve (27M) and I (27F) have been together for 4 years, we have a 1 year old son, and we have lived together for 3 years. We talk about everything, and that includes my girlfriends. Most of my girlfriends are single and casually dating around trying to find Mr. Right. They also happen to be horny sometimes and enjoy sex. In my opinion, Steve has a messed up view on sex and women. He has only had sex with a handful of women including me. I have had sex with a lot more partners than him. When we first started dating, this was a really big deal to him. He is pretty insecure about it to this day but it doesnt come up very often. 

He is mostly over it now, but only because in his mind I am a smart, respectable woman, the mother of his son, etc. He still lives life thinking that women who have had multiple sex partners in their lifetime are ""sluts, skanks, whores, etc"". It makes me really mad because I'm not about shaming women for enjoying sex, also it's 2019 ffs. He said that he ""knows girls like that and that they're stupid and knows guys who would pass them around like they were nothing"". 

One day we might have a daughter and I obviously plan on keeping him out of those conversations that I have with her about boys and sex but I dont like knowing that if he did know, he would think less of her. So whenever he starts to get heated about women and promiscuity, I gently remind him that I too have had many dicks inside me besides his before he came along and that the way he thinks about women and sex is outdated and silly.

My mom calls me (24F) and my siblings (28F,14M) to come say our goodbyes to my grandpa (90+) today. We go to support our dad and to say goodbye. However we are not really close to our grandpa. We see each other less than once a year even though he lives in the next town. Growing up I remember him being there and visiting him but we have a language barrier and it was more something that we dreaded doing. It's not the most loving relationship as in my culture everyone has a hard time showing love and affection.

My siblings and I got to my grandpa's house and about 10 of my older generation extended relatives were already there. We were the only grandchildren there even though there are over 50+ grandchildren/great grandchildren. We saw my grandpa in a very sickly state. Basically just being kept alive by a ventilator. We left the room and went to the living room where everyone else was. They were all talking very loudly and over each other like it was a party. We stayed for an hour. I had plans to the cemetery to visit a friend as today is his birthday then I had to work. My sister is a pharmacist and is pretty busy as well. I figured there was not much we could do by sitting around and waiting for him to pass as it could be minutes or hours, so I told my mom that we were leaving and she said ok. As we were leaving we were stopped by an older relative and he told us to sit down and listen to him. An uncle started translating for us but I could tell by his tone that he was chastising us for leaving. He basically said that we should just stay until my grandpa passes because if we stay we will get blessed and basically that because we are not staying we are bad/unfilial grandchildren and that we might get cursed. My siblings and I aren’t superstitious. I was visibly irritated but didn't want to say anything out of respect for my dad. My dad didn't say anything because he was more preoccupied with my grandpa and he didn’t want to disrespect this relative. If my dad did want us to stay we would have but he did not ask us to. My mom came out to try to diffuse the situation and said it was okay to leave. I was very angry but didn't say anything and just got up and left. He was scolding us like we were children. I felt that he just wanted us to stay and didn't take into consideration that we may have things to do. I also feel that by being there I/we are not contributing towards emotional support and therefore us being there served no purpose other than to show face. I know I may come off as heartless but I do empathize with my family but since we really don't have any emotional connection to my grandpa it was not completely necessary for us to be there. We also have a TON (100+) of family who weren't there and I don't see him complaining.

A group of guys walked in and naturally, I felt a tiny bit intimidated, but whatever. I continued doing my own thing. When I looked up, one of the guys was eyeing me and then said “hey, how’s it going?” Or something to that effect. 

I had a delayed reaction for some reason and didn’t process what happened so I just kind of ignored him and went back on my phone. From my peripheral vision, I saw him waving his hands at me. So I continued to stick to my guns and stared at my phone lol. 

I think one of his friends told him to stop bothering me and he was like “I’m just being polite!” And then went on a tangent about how he sees all sorts of people in the city. Then his friend said “you win some, you lose some”.

My floor came, so I got off. I feel a little asshole-ish, but at the same time, I don’t feel like I owed the guy a conversation just because he wanted to talk to me. There were other people in the elevator he could have tried talking to instead if he really felt like being chatty.

For example one of my more justified times was when someone who I'd met a few times and was sort of friends with asked for a £100 loan for food for the month... while we were out drinking. I do what I always do, say no, then he began pressing saying he'd pay me after the month etc etc but I just say 'I dont lend money'. Now, he has a habbit of sporadic spending due to mental health issues, which obviously aren't his fault but I refuse to get involved.

Basically, wether it's covering cinema tickets, meals out or anything like that, unless I planned on buying it for them I won't lend it to them (with good friends I'll just buy it for them, as I know they'll probably get me something in return and if not it's not a huge deal).

I come from a family that was always having issues with finance and even when they were careful with where they put their money, they were often fucked over. Fortunately they do well now, mostly due to this no nonsense attitude. 

I'm in uni and recieve financial help off my parents, and I have borrowed money for a deposit once, but this was under the agreement that they take that out of a payment next week, so they were guaranteed not to lose the additional money. This is the only time I've taken a non-contract based loan.

We live in a relatively small city, and people definitely know that he used to be with my older sister, it's kind of uncomfortable sometimes because we get those ""looks"" from some people. When we got engaged it was a surprise to everyone but one comment bothers me to this day, my sister said: ""I had him for 8 years, you can keep my leftovers now"" she was obviously tipsy and she said that she was kidding, she even said that laughing but it was cruel... I don't want her at my wedding because she is his ex, who invites their SO's ex to their wedding anyway? I want my wedding to be perfect and a day that i will remember with a smile on my face, she is my sister but i don't even care, it's my wedding day. My mother and i are arguing non-stop about this, am i the asshole?.

c30mvs	2019-06-20 19:49:45	SD_Native760	AITA for suggesting to put the dog down?	"Heres the scoop, my SO has a dog that she has had since he was a puppy (last 12 years). I have no issue with dogs whatsoever and actually get a kick at watching him ""waddle"" instead of walk because hes fat. When I first met her, he would hack and hack when he got excited because he has a collapsing trachea. Vets have told her hes too old to have a major surgery like yo repair it but yet that's the only thing that can repair it. The surgery itself is very expensive and to pay thousands of dollars for a surgery for the dog that may not even make it a year or two from now I find is a waste of money, considering we're trying to save to buy a home. 

This was 2 years ago, fast forward to now and he has gotten extremely worse. It went from that to where he would hack just from walking from his dog bed to the kitchen to now hacking non-stop even while laying down. He'll go on for 10-15 minutes before taking a break but will start up again a half hour later. Not only does he do this when everybody is trying to go to sleep (including our 16 month old that wakes up here and there when he does it because he is very loud) and at 5:30 in the morning which again wakes up our 16 month old sometimes. 

From my standpoint, its causing me to lose sleep and get piss poor sleep which is affecting me at work and in general, its disrupting our daughters sleep and makes her cranky and irritable some days because she didnt sleep and it's annoying to constantly hear it while I'm awake. There is no medicine to fix it, just suppress him to make him sleep which lasts about am hour but his medicine is expensive. 

From what I consider a humane standpoint, hes old and it's going to get worse. He has a hard time going to the bathroom because hes hacking trying to go pee and my humane opinion is to put him down to stop his suffering. 

I've mentioned this to my fiance and as you can imagine it wasnt something that was a light conversation. I get her point, shes had him for 12 years well before she met me and she considers him one of her ""babies"" even though we have a real child. I didnt say we have to do it today or this week but I said based on his regression and what its affecting that we should consider it in the near future. 

AITA for suggesting to put him down for the dogs sake and ours?

Edit 1: Based on comments already received, the dog had issues prior to me being in the picture so I had no choice in even mentioning it two years ago. I had just noticed his hacking when he got excited. For those saying I'm inconsiderate, you have your opinion and I thank you for your opinion however I feel I have to add more detail. Yes loss of sleep is affecting my work, my job which works with executives and hiring managers on a daily basis. Me forgetting information, late to meetings and not sending projects on time affects the job because I'm drowsy and fatigued. When you start playing with your livelihood, I'm sorry but that pays bills. To address the emotional part, yes I am someone who does not regard animals as family members. I know some do and that's perfectly fine but I dont which is why I haven't really had pets throughout my life. I understand her point which is why I wrote it and some apparently didnt read. But again, reality says of you cant afford the care (which we cant) and it is affecting your own livelihood (which it's starting to) then that's a concern."	Not the A-hole	0	0

There were a couple representatives from my employer and everyone else was from the acquired company.

Everyone was getting along great so we decided to do dinner(on the company). After dinner was through I suggested we head out for drinks at another local spot. 3 out of the 15 people from dinner decided to join. 

During dinner I only had a couple drinks as to stay level headed and not to get too loose in conversation. Once we got to the drinking spot I had a couple more assuming this group was going to be a little looser. During this time we got into a couple debates about some PC topics. At one point I referred to an excoworker as a cunt (something I typically don’t say and quite frankly just slipped out). The kicker here and yes I do know I fucked up, is that the 3 people that chose to follow along were woman. I immediately regretting saying the words.

c30jyq	2019-06-20 19:43:28	Annamal0326	AITA for asking my parents to buy a car seat?	"Update since there are some similar comments:
1. We are not asking them to buy us a car seat; we already have our own.
2. They have insisted on being the emergency contact for daycare and were very angry when we suggested using a friend. 
3. You all are correct in the fact that their money is not relevant. I guess I was just trying to make the point that it’s not an issue of not being able to afford one and that they choose to spend more on other things. 
4. You are correct that the toy comment is not relevant. I just thought it was odd that they talk about wanting to be more involved in him but won’t even buy some toys from Goodwill for when he comes over to see them. 

Original post:

My son is almost 18 months and will need to be in some sort of car seat/booster for the next 6.5 years. My parents are our emergency contacts for daycare but currently have no way to pick him up. They have expressed interest in spending more time with him and doing things, but my husband and I have pointed out that it’s hard to do so when they don’t have any of the required gear for a tiny human. I found an inexpensive (at least in the world of car seats) car seat that would be good until my son can ride with just a seatbelt for $150 and mentioned this to them. They refused to buy one because they claim it’s unfair to expect them to buy one. Information I feel is relevant here: 1. They have lots of money and have no problem spending hundreds of dollars on him at Christmas and randomly buy him clothes that he doesn’t need in addition to shopping all the time for random junk 2. They refuse to buy any toys for him for their house and insist that we bring toys over to their house to leave for him to play with.

c30htn	2019-06-20 19:38:50	WonderingAITA	AITA -- putting my garbage next to a neighbor's garbage	"Last night I rolled out my garbage can to the curb for the weekly pick-up. I’m on a corner, so I have a choice which street to place my can. After I’d come back from a quick errand this morning, I realized I'd forgotten to clean out my fridge. As I went to add that new, half-filled, thick, black bag to my can, I saw it had already been emptied.

The Sanitation Dept’s route picks up the sides at different times. I’ve never left garbage on that side b/c I’m the only home on that side, (school overflow parking lot). There are several homes on the opposite side of my street.

I made a quick decision to put my bag on the ground next to an across-the-street neighbor's can. 

A little while later, a man knocked. He had a piece of my mail in his hand. ""Is this yours?"" I thought it had been delivered to him by mistake and thanked him for bringing it over.

“Why did you put your garbage on my property?” He was clearly annoyed and frustrated, but his voice wasn't raised. I politely explained that I usually put my garbage in anotehr place, (motioning where), and, as I went this morning to add one extra bag, I saw that street's had already been picked up. He said, ""Well, that's not my problem,"" I said I was sorry but I wan't sure if the garbage would be picked up in front of my home on the street where he also faces. I thought it would be okay to place next to his. 

He continued, ""How would you like it if I put my can in front of your home?"" Without hesitation, I replied I wouldn't mind, especially if he was in the same situation re missing pick-up. I apologized and said, ""Please give me just a moment to put my shoes on and I'll move the bag."" He stormed off. 

In the time it took me to put on shoes and walk across the street, he'd gone inside, closing his tall fence. I noticed a slit at the top; he must've looked through it until he found mail with my name and address.

I created another knot so the contents wouldn’t spill out and took the bag.

Yes, it’s frowned upon for neighbors to do this. I thought he'd never know. NEVER done this before. I didn’t want the contents of that particular bag for a week, wanted to be sure it was picked up.

c30h4p	2019-06-20 19:37:20	ChanceBodybuilder3	AITA for getting annoyed because a company did not follow up after accepting their job offer?	"Hello, 

Background story:    

I was looking for a summer job, handed cv, got interview which followed with an offer via email a week later.

&#x200B;

A week later:

I get this offer on Friday and have till Monday noon to accept. The email also includes a background check form and medical check form but does NOT specify when those have to be completed. The nature of the job mean't I could be working in a number of different locations so I respond along the lines ""Yes I am very happy to accept depending the location for suitable transport.""I did this with email before Monday. I did decided not to fill in the background check or medical form just yet as I believed I would hear back from them very quickly where I was working and make the decision then. Also the medical would cost 120 euro/dollars/pounds refundable when I start working also being another factor as to hold off completing it just yet. Again they did NOT tell me when this had to be done.

5 days after Monday:

I have not heard anything from them at all. I get concerned and consider phoning but friends tell me ""person in charge could simply be away or they clearly haven't forgot about you."" 

10 days past and I phone them after getting tired of waiting. I am told they assumed I was not ""interested"" anymore since they did not receive any background form from me, even though i emailed them saying I was happy to accept???? And they did not tell me when the forms had to be back. So all in all now, they ""might"" be able to have me start in a months time(6-7 weeks) now as background checks take a while and they had other stuff to sort. I have yet to hear back from them now but they told me to consider if it would be ""worth my while"".

Conclusion,

I really don't feel like I am in wrong being perfectly honest. I'm pretty annoyed with the amount of days wasted and feel they should of said when they wanted the forms back, but company is saying its my fault that I should ""know"" to fill up those forms straight away. Friends have mixed opinions about it. What do you think? Am i the asshole? thanks very much."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c30gwd	2019-06-20 19:36:49	Kawasae	AITA for considering breaking up because my current partners child support increase?	My M[36] boyfriend got an increase in child support today that will literally leave him with about 15 bucks left over to survive after all said and done. He will automatically have to work 70 hours to even yield anything, he works 50 hours already at the moment and because of that we don't really talk or see each other. Increase in child support came because ex-wife was upset that he got visitation rights and is attempting to make sure that he somehows falls behind on obligations. I'm supportive and understanding but now I just feel like I don't necessarily see a serious relationship or a way that our relationship could be. Yes I have my own income etc, but a relationship where I pretty much have to shoulder everything unless he somehow gets a higher paying job just seems a bit miserable for me because I come from a background where I've had to pay for my family because they were horrible with money.

The AC in the waiting area was out when we arrived at 5 and apparently went out in the older wings (maternity wing) around midnight. It was still out when I came to visit them again at 9 am this morning. It is Texas and the temperature was somewhere in the high 90s. 

Being the badass dad and husband I am, I went out and bought my wife a fan. It was like 60 dollars and blows enough air to make the room a bit cooler for her. My wife was sharing a room with another woman, who we’ll call Didi.

Well, Didi asked if we could point the fan her way for a bit. Sure. I didn’t like it but my wife agreed. New mom solidarity, whatever. I go out to grab lunch at 12 and come back at 1 to find the fan still fucking pointed at Didi and my wife sweating. By now, the temperatures starting to climb. So I fucking take the damn thing and point it back to my wife and tell Didi she’s lost her fan privileges for not giving it back.

10 minutes pass, she starts to whine that it’s too hot. 15 minutes, she’s got a nice bottle of Gatorade to sip on. Great. 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and she’s full on panicking saying she’s too hot, she feels like she’s going to vomit. I’m not falling for it, so I offer to call a nurse. She says no. 5 minutes later, she calls them herself saying she’s close to fainting. As they’re rubbing her down with a few wet rags, she goes limp. None of the nurses seemed upset but my wife is freaked and feels bad. I do too, a little bit, but still not enough to let her have a turn.

We were still work friends and I genuinely enjoyed working with her for the most part. I expected her to mature as the job went on, but she never did. She was very much into gossip and drama. I never really engaged much in it but also never told her to stop, as it wasn't really my place. I am very close with a different coworker who works in a different department, and the teen always made jokes about him and I. I repeatedly told her they weren't funny, and then we got a new worker and she proceeded to tell her that I had slept with the coworker in the other department and he had taken advantage of me. This is wildly untrue, as we were just close friends. I had to go to the new worker and apologize for her saying that and explained how untrue it was. I then texted the teen later (its our works way of communicating) saying that I wanted to sit down and talk to her with our boss present. She asked what we had to talk about and I told her how she was talking about me and another coworker was very wrong. About an hour later, she ends up quitting. I honestly don't think she was going to get fired when I told my boss, but that's what she probably thought was going to happen. I feel like the asshole but things had just gone too far.

&#x200B;

Some backstory: my (23f) parents got divorced about 10 years ago. It was pretty nasty from what I remember. Since then my dad has treated me and my mom horribly and so when I was 18 and he no longer had partial custody I cut off all ties with him. His family took his side and I no longer consider them my own; I am not invited to family weddings or hangouts any more and don't talk to any of them.  They are very judgmental of my mom and I because we are atheists and don't let men tell us what to do (they are very ""traditional"").

&#x200B;

My paternal grandparents have always overstepped boundaries and are the most judgmental of all my family. As a kid growing up, they would visibly get mad when I said I didn't believe in God and I found out my parents were getting divorced through an email from them and not my parents (found out that wasn't supposed to happen via my mom years later). My grandfather passed away about 7 years ago and I didn't contact him towards the end very much and I have no remorse about it.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now. Out of the blue I get a long text from my dad saying he's used to me ""being cruel"" to him but I shouldn't be cruel to my grandmother, who is 82, close to death, and might not even remember me, and I should contact her to talk before she dies. Because I didn't have remorse about not contacting when my grandfather died and I hate my dad and don't want to do what he asks, I'm leaning towards not contacting my grandmother. But because of his language I am wondering if I am being an asshole and I should be nice and contact this woman before she passes on to the next life, and if I was an asshole for not talking to my late grandfather also.

Almost every time I’m washing my hands after pissing or the like, someone will just head straight from the stall to the door and skip washing their own hands. Onsies or twosies, doesn’t matter. I get it, maybe you’ve got the cleanest junk in the world. But genitals are still genitals, which are in close enough proximity to the bung hole. It’s also a convenient time to wash your hands in the middle of the day. I mean, look — you don’t *have* to wash your hands if you don’t want to. 
But It happens often enough and I’m irked to the point of saying something. **There’s not any good reason to not wash your hands.** Most people pretend not to hear, but a few dudes have laughed it off and washed their hands and we became best buds. So, AITA if I call random bathroom boys out on their spotty hygiene?

Edit: Ah, maybe this’ll clarify a few things. That’s my bad. I’m not aggressive about it, just imploring. I’m not going to lecture someone if they say, ‘nah, I’m not going to wash my hands’. And there are a few things that help me sleep at night, but being a jerk to people in the bathroom isn’t one.

Him and I talk every single day but we don't see each other often even though we live in the same city because neither of us have a car or anything, but even though I've tried to make plans to see him he's always said no, or cancelled on me last minute, so I stopped making plans to see him and settled on just texting. 

Though lately he's getting all pissed at me for not ever coming to see him, but I don't see him extending any effort to see me either. He's always saying ""Don't worry, I'm used to being hated."" And telling me that he doesn't trust me as a friend because his depression and anxiety don't let him trust people.

I have those things too, and I don't use them as an excuse to not let anybody into my life..

She said she’d give me a ticket for free because she had a spare one after just breaking up with a guy she was seeing. So I was like, okay sure, thinking this’ll be fun, a free ticket, all we’ve got to do now is book flights and accommodation and split it.

So we get to booking alights and talking about accommodation. She decides that because she wants to save money we should go via another country and stay the night in that country. I’m completely fine with that so we get to talking about accommodation for that country. Suddenly she puts forward the idea of me paying for both of us the two nights of accommodation in that country based on the premise that she’s giving me a ticket.

In effect she asked me to pay for the ticket which is not what we had agreed to initially. I said no, we should split it as I thought the whole point of me coming with her was that I could just come to the festival for free. Now she’s mad at me and has ended the conversation.

So I want to tell my friends about this boy, but I don't know if it's the right thing to do since he doesn't want anyone to find out that he's gay/bi (he doesn't even look at it that way because he doesn't fall in love with the person's gender). But my friends wouldn't tell anyone, I completely trust them.

c304x7	2019-06-20 19:09:48	HatefulBagel	AITA for telling my sister I'm over my father's passing?	"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 
English not native language, sorry for mistakes :( 

2 years ago my (23M) father's died from cancer. We definitely didn't have the best relationship (he provided for everything but was a very tough father) but somehow we got along. I never loved the father but liked the person. 

Anyhow, as of today my mother still isn't over his death and it's completely understandable. However I didn't feel like telling her I was completely over it and didn't share her pain. So I talked about it to my older sister (26) because always gives me great guidance.

But she told mom. And mom isn't happy. She can't fathom how someone can be over a family member's death, according to her. She judged my grieving process. She can't accept the fact Dad made many mistakes and that's the reason why I'm over it. 

(I'm not angry at sister tho, she just didn't wanna lie about such a sensitive topic when mom asked abt me, she's an absolutely wonderful person and I love her to death) 


 But she just told me over and over ""You don't give two shits about your father so I know you won't give a fuck about my death too right?, why didn't you tell me about that?"" And i answered ""so i wouldn't hurt your feelings cause you wouldn't have liked if i told you I don't share your pain. And I actually don't, and now I told you and you're hurt,see?"" 

I tried to tell her her passing would hurt me as hell, but she wouldn't have anything. 

So AITA for telling my sister that I'm over my dad's death causing her to tell mom and causing mom to be really hurt by how I feel or should I have just shut up and went about my life?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3030w	2019-06-20 19:05:35	TitsMageeYo	AITA? GF(28f) of three months is livid with me (25m) for telling her I want to go to one of my good friends wedding alone	"So one of my best friends is getting married in October and I am a groomsman in the wedding. This is my first time being in a wedding and the first wedding of one of my friends to attend. 

Now my best friend is an ex coworker of mine so we don’t see each other as often as we wish we could however we have a great friendship and keep in touch and hang out every now and then. 

The girlfriend has met said friend and fiancé and attended their St. Patty’s day party they hosted. She didn’t really bond with them as she had too much to drink and crutched on conversation with her friend she brought to the party. She also went to an Eric Church concert that I bought 6 tickets for and invited my friend and his fiancé. I thought this would be a great chance for them to click but in reality she really only spent the night doting on me while I was trying to have fun with my two friends and their significant others. 

Fast forward to this past weekend. She knows about the wedding and that I am a groomsman. She already assumes that she is going to the wedding as my date but asks me to confirm. I tell her rationally that I would prefer to go alone and give her several reasons that are logical in my mind:

1). She wouldn’t know anyone there and I, being in the wedding, wouldn’t be able to spend that much time with her
2). I want to give my full attention and time to my best friend on his special day

In the past when I’ve hung out with her and old friends I don’t get to see that often I get caught up in conversation with them and she feels neglected and takes it personally. 

That is why I want to attend dateless. So I can roam freely and enjoy myself while celebrating my best friend getting married without having to worry about if she is having a good time or her getting upset over me not having my full attention on her. 

I told her all this but she is still pissed. After three months of dating I feel like looking at an important event (to me) four months in advance and getting upset about my decision is irrational. 

AITA?

c301hv	2019-06-20 19:02:11	sloth788	AITA for expecting everyone to clean up together?	"I started a new job, and part of this job involves working on a setup whose primary user is currently on leave. 

Now... before he left, he trained me up to work on the setup, but since he left, there has been no primary user, point of contact, or person in charge of the setup. 

And because there is no single ""responsible person"", clutter has started to accumulate. 

Now, about 1/2 of that clutter is mine, but the other half belongs to god knows who, but more of it keeps showing up. 

So yesterday, someone sent around an email, asking whoever the ""primary user"" is to clean things up. The problem is that there is no assigned primary user for the moment. 

Long story short, I go to one of the other people who works at that setup sometimes and say ""hey, how about we get everyone together and we can figure out how to keep this thing clean"", then, that person's direct superior accuses me of ""telling his employees what to do"", and literally starts yelling at me. 

He tells me he ""doesn't give a $asf"" whether or not my boss is happy, and yells at the other employee to ""shut the Fasf up"" when he tries to talk.

He tells me that I should clean up everything perfectly after I use it, no matter if the mess was mine or not. 

Later, he sent an email apologizing to everyone who was there, saying that he knows he messed up, has been trying to work on it, and that it's not the first time it's happened.

Now I have a meeting with him tomorrow after lunch to touch basis and figure out where to go from here, but I'm really uncomfortable with the whole thing, and I ended up feeling bad just for asking for people to clean up together. 

Am I the asshole for expecting everyone to help clean up, or should I really just clean up other people's messes to keep the peace?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c301bh	2019-06-20 19:01:50		AITA for wanting to support human jobs by using a cashier at Walmart instead of self checkout?	"The store in my town recently took out the majority of cashier stands and replaced them with self checkouts. I went to buy groceries the other night for dinner, and even though it was going to be an extra five minutes or so standing in line I wanted to go through an actual human’s register because I’d like to support keeping jobs in my small town. 

When I was making small talk with the cashier I told her how I’d rather support keeping the cashiers employed than have everything be replaced with automated systems and not interact with anyone. Apparently this was the wrong thing to say to her because she then started to argue with me. 

She said that actually they weren’t firing anyone but instead it was creating more jobs because they recently had to hire ten new people for “up front.” I replied with how that may apply now but the long term retail trend was advances in replacing human workers with cheaper robotic labor. Again she came back with me with an angrier tone about how things change and people just need to get used to it. Mind you I am only early thirties so I’m not just some grumpy old person. 

For some reason I thought I could still converse with this cashier. I replied that things only change if we agree to them and how if enough people decide to not want to use self checkouts then corporate would get the hint and replace them with more human employees. 

This must have really piddled in her Cheerios. At this point as she was handing me my change she turned flat out rude and told me that technology was the way of the future and if people don’t like it they will just have to be left behind and sink. 

I get that she probably has been told by her managers to tell people the self checkouts are good and not bad. She’s probably had to listen to people complain about them all week. I worked at Walmart and remember how awful it gets. But we were never allowed to be that mean to customers. We just stayed silent and smiled. 

But I just don’t feel like IATA for trying to support low level jobs in my little town instead of having them replaced by robots. I know the overlords are coming but I want to fight them off as long as we can. 

Btw, in the following weeks since they put the self checkouts in there have been less and less human cashiers at the front of that store."		1	0
c3016z	2019-06-20 19:01:31		AITA for using a $100 gift card I found on the ground at a fancy clothing store?	"Not a juicy post, I know. Just wondering if I can calm my anxiety a bit. The situation:

I was browsing for fun with my mom in an expensive clothing store, and found a gift card in the ground that has mostly likely not been used and says “$100”. There’s no “to:” or “from:” or anything else left around it. I looked around the store and no one was even nearby or seemed to be looking for something they dropped. There was no way of telling how long it had been there. 

My mom said I should just use it. My first reaction was to take it to the register and let the salespeople know I found it. But we were on the far side of the store and still browsing so I stuck it in my pocket while I decided what to do, and my indecision led to me just walking out with it (didn’t buy anything, didn’t turn it in)

I thought, if no one came looking for it, the sales person would just take it. I would have done my good deed, but...I also like free stuff and finders keepers? I have a wedding to attend this weekend and need to buy an outfit anyway, which this would definitely help with because I’m pretty poor. 

There’s no way the original owner would get it back now since I stalled so long deciding what to do. But I could still turn it over just to have the piece of mind that I didn’t unjustly get someone else’s gift for free. 

Or is it not really that big of a deal and I should just use it and enjoy it and pay it forward some other way?"	No A-holes here	1	0

"I (16F) was a complete accident, conceived during a ONS between my birth mother and some dude she met abroad. She didn't really show until much later, and at that point she had no clue who this guy was and even less of an idea on how to find him. She decided to keep me anyways. 3 years later she met Layla, my other mom: Layla legally adopted me, and they got married as soon as it became legal in my country. Although I often call her Layla, she is absolutely my mom, and I love her just as much as the one who birthed me. 

Almost 5 months ago, my aunt bought me a 23 and me kit for my 16th birthday. I was never particularly interested in or plagued by questions about my parentage, but as I am a bit darker than my very, very Swedish mom, I thought it would be nice to know what that extra melanin was. I found out I was a quarter Mexican, which I supposed came from my dad, and honestly didn't think much about it. 

Until 3 weeks ago, when my mom was contacted by my dad via Facebook, and asked for a paternity test. I didn't want to, but I agreed if it would give him some peace of mind or whatever. But as soon as it came back positive, it just became worse.

He really wants to have a father-daughter relationship with me, and has been messaging me nonstop, practically begging. I've blocked him on social media and refuse to give him my phone number, but I know that my moms still have contact with him, and that they also support him. They think that, because I don't have any uncles, I need a father figure in my life. 

I want to clarify that I'm not remotely mad at or blame him. He couldn't have known, and my mom didn't know how to let him know. But I don't want any more parental figures in my life. I have two whom I love dearly, and I'm fine with that.

If you were already married, but someone else proposed to you, nobody would expect you to have two spouses, right? So why should I need to have 3 parents? I'm saturated, thank you. No further applications."	No A-holes here	0	0

c300fq	2019-06-20 18:59:52	dogzrgreat	WIBTA if I asked my husband not to accept a job on my team?	"  

My husband has been unemployed since early March. We are in our mid-30s with no children. I have worked for a large corporation for 3.5 years, in which I have moved up quickly and received a lot of positive feedback from my leadership. 

Husband has spent about 4 days applying for jobs in the last few months and spends most of his time doing hobbies and starting up a new business (spends maybe 8 hrs a week tops at the latter). This will probably take a couple of years to become lucrative, and his unemployment won’t last forever. He has spent the majority of his career (last 12 years) working for his dad. This option is no longer available since his dad sold his company. Husband has very little “real world” job experience- his dad was VERY flexible with him, and he has never had a corporate job, let alone a “real” boss who wasn’t his dad, aside from retail positions when he was younger.

We went out for dinner and drinks with my boss this week, when my boss offered my husband a spot on our team since he knew my husband is unemployed. I was not involved in this conversation, but it was confirmed the next day at work when my boss asked me how I felt about it. I told him we would have to talk about it. My husband said it feels like it would be crazy not to take it, that it’s just “being handed” to him, and that it has been difficult to find another job.

Neither of us would report to each other, but I’m still not totally comfortable. He would start this job at the same salary I have now (which I’ve doubled since I started due to merit increases and promotions). I’m scared that because my boss is a man, he may favor my husband. My husband only views this as a temporary job, maybe 3 years max, while this is my career that I’ve built on my own. I feel like it would be bad either way- if he does poorly or responds negatively to having a “real” boss, it could negatively impact my career. If he does great and gets promoted over me, I’ll feel bitter because this is my career that I take very seriously, and this would just be a temporary thing just for the money for him. He has 0 experience in this line of work, and I have a Bachelor’s degree in it.

WIBTA if I ask him to keep applying for jobs and to turn down this opportunity? We could save it for a last-ditch option if our financial situation gets too bad, but I feel like this would be too much strain on my career and our relationship. He feels otherwise and doesn’t want to keep looking for jobs on his own."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2zz5i	2019-06-20 18:56:34	js-strange	WIBTA If I dont invite my grandma to my wedding?	"Okay so a little backstory. My dad's mom has never been really involved in my life and I recognized it at an early age. She left my grandfather and my dad and his brother to move to California (we live in NJ) to go live with the guy who I think she was having an affair with (not sure about this my dad has never told me the full story). She married that guy and still lives out there.

She rarely came to visit when I was younger but I understood that. She lives across the country and it's not easy for her to come out here. But when she did visit she would make a quick stop at my house to say hi (1 hour tops) and tell me she would be back before she went home. Then she would go to my cousin's house and stay there the rest of the time. She never came back when she said she would. So around 12 I said something to her in an email. I told her it hurt me she never wanted to see me...blah blah blah. She promised she'd make more of an effort and told my parents about the email. They weren't happy I did that but I didn't care at that point. She never ended up making an effort and she disappeared from my life until I was about 23.

When I saw her again I was excited to give her another shot and maybe reconnect. We talked and I told her about what was going on in my life and we were getting along well. She gave me her phone number and email and told me she prefers email because she doesn't always have her phone on her. So I sent her a few emails asking how she was doing and she responded at first. I sent her emails on her birthday and holidays but she stopped responding and started telling my cousins I never emailed her. So I showed them our exchanges and they confirmed it was the right email. After that she stopped responding to all my emails so I stopped sending them.

Anyway I'm 29 now and she is still not involved in my life. I see her come out here and still visit my cousins but makes no effort to reach out to me or my parents for a visit. She doesn't know I'm dating someone or engaged or anything as far as I know. But I'm making up my guest list and I honestly don't think I want to invite her and my dad told me I can do what I want.

c2zyta	2019-06-20 18:55:48	tartislav	AITA for telling my sister to chew with her mouth closed?	"I have an intense dislike of mouth noises. I hate hearing anything related to other people eating, and sometimes it can be so bad as to make me unnaturally uncomfortable and even physically nauseous. Unfortunately, my parents come from a country where chewing with your mouth open is the norm, and I don’t think it’s fair to them to try to get them to change habits that are culturally ingrained in them. I don’t blame them for it, I just blame my terrible luck and try to ignore it.

My sister, on the other hand, was born in America and is six years younger than me. Since she was 12, I taught her that it’s rude to chew with your mouth open but really I did it because I don’t think I can stand a cacophony of three people creating mouth noises at every meal.

I understand that it’s entirely her choice and that I shouldn’t force it. 

I know it’s selfish and so I have a suspicion that I might be being an asshole here, but I justify it by telling myself and her that mouth closed eating is the norm in the US, which is where she will probably live for the rest of her life.

"I’ve (27F) been with my partner (30M) for 5 years and over that time I have really got on with his family. We’re on a family holiday and his sister Kirsty (23F) who I do like is being a bit brattish as usual. We are all chipping into the holiday equally - if we weren’t I would have less of an issue. She has done less than anyone. 

My partner says I’m part of the family but I’m not really - you can tell from little cues like not being offered stuff or not being ever put first. I’m absolutely fine with it - it’s just what happens. 

What has happened is that I feel as if out of the younger people on this holiday myself and my partners cousins gf have done the most. 

In the day before last - we cleared away the meal just me and her, May (after 10 people and 3 dogs). Then yesterday I went upstairs in the evening and was called down to clear away again. This was after I had confirmed with my mother in law that it was bf and his sisters turn. However - everyone was joining in this time and I joined in too. His sister was angry for confirming this and was muttering about me where I could hear her. 

Then today my mother in law said “right it’s (me) and (my bf) clearing today”. I half jokingly said “Well me and May did it all by ourselves the other night but I’ll do it because that’s the kind of person I am”. 

I instantly regretted it and now my bfs sister, who was angry with me before when I had mentioned it is now peeved. 

I’m embarrassed that I’ve made a big deal out of nothing but I think that because my bf is my life partner and we will get married one day I’m kinda wanting to set boundaries where I haven’t before. 

It’s worth saying that my mother and father in law are extremely generous and have paid for meals and all kinds of great things - also including me. They are great people. My annoyance is at my sister in law who is a good person but tends to just do what she wants."		1	0

"I moved in with a friend and his girlfriend to get away from family, and I was extremely grateful to be brought in for cheap rent. It's 600/month which is basically nothing in the Bay Area. He is the little brother of a close friend of mine, and I've been told by his older brother that he is bad with money. But he makes 80k, and he's subletting from his uncle for 1100/month. I pay a little over half of it, and in return I don't worry about utilities, Internet, food, or anything else.

To express my gratitude, I've been cognizant about being the best roommate I can. I clean when I see something out of place. I don't have guests over. My bedroom door is always open, the room is always clean. I'm diligent about my living space.

But yesterday, he told me that his uncle wants to move the rent due date to the 15th instead of the 30th, and that I would have to pay him $600 now, and $600 on the 15th of July. It made no sense, because I paid on the 30th of May to cover until the 30th of June. I explained to him that I would effectively be paying 3 months of rent for a little over 2 months of living with him, and that it would make more sense to pay $300 now to cover the first 15 days of July, and the full amount $600 on the 15th. He eventually agreed, but it was like pulling teeth.

I do believe it was a genuine misunderstanding, but the reason he was so adamant about early payment is because he paid the rent two months in advance without consulting anyone in the house, and is now in a tight spot financially, so me and his girlfriend have to deal with the pressure.

I only moved in a month ago, and I want out because I don't trust his judgment, and I don't think this will be the last time something happens. WIBTA if I started browsing for apartments?"		1	0
c2zv4z	2019-06-20 18:47:07	DukeMaximum	AITA for applying to jobs I don't really intend to accept?	"In the last five years, I've been laid off a couple times, and had a couple of contract jobs end unexpectedly. Each period of unemployment was difficult, to say the least, and I've developed a bit of a phobia of being out of work again.

Despite having been at my current position for over a year, and being very happy here, I find that I'm compelled to apply for other positions regularly. I don't really intend to leave, I just find it reassuring to have something else in the works all the time. When the process reaches a certain point, I graciously decline to proceed. It's never gone as far as an in-person interview, but I've often taken phone interviews.

Recently, I confided this to a friend, and he said that it wasn't right of me to apply to jobs that I really didn't intend to accept. He said that I was wasting people's time and money, and I might be distracting from other candidates who really did want the job.

My position was that these companies certainly had no hesitation in wasting my time and money, and that, if I were the leading candidate, they could always move to the next best candidate after I excused myself from the hiring process.

Am I the asshole here? Is this wrong to do?

EDIT: When I mention the companies ""wasting my time"", I was making a pretty general statement. I suppose in the last several years I've gotten really sick of things like:

* Making me upload my perfectly formatted resume, just to then require me to enter it line-by-line anyway just so that their algorithm can reject me.
* Run me through the whole process of applying and interviewing, just to tell me that they hired an internal candidate.
* Ask me to travel to interviews only to ask me excluding questions that are clearly stated on my resume.
* Get hostile and short when I bring up salary earlier in the process than they would like.

No windows and barely enough room for a desk. One of my coworkers, on the other hand, has an office about twice its size and with a window. Currently our office situation is the opposite - I have a nice office with windows, and he does not. This makes a good deal of sense in my opinion because I am full-time salaried and he is hourly and only in the office about 25 hrs/wk.

Now I know it doesn't seem like a huge deal, but I was a much needed hire for this company and the office space was a selling point for me. They did not tell me we would be moving when I was interviewing. Because of the role that I play here, I feel like if I asked my boss she would give me the larger office. But I don't want to seem too petty or selfish. WIBTA if I do this?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c2zquy	2019-06-20 18:37:14	meowmeow69420	AITA for asking my neighbors to try and limit their firework usage to July 4th?	"AITA for asking my neighbors to try and limit their firework usage to July 4th?  I've been out of the Army for three years and have lived in my neighborhood since I've gotten out.  I love my neighborhood and all of my neighbors.
In years past, firework usage would start around June 25th with kids lighting off their fireworks and the surprise of a concussion would always get my heart racing and for a split second it makes me hold my breath. 
People in my neighborhood always thank me for my service when they find out about my time in the Army. (I never bring it up but my wife is proud of me and will say something or neighbors will notice my Disabled Veteran license plates)  

ANYWAY....my anxiety seems to get more and more each year.  This year worked up enough courage to finally post on my community's Facebook page and ask if they could limit firework usage to July 4th. The post included my reasoning why I'd ask. 
I was surprised to see the backlash of people telling me off and telling me to get over myself or just flat out tell me that their kids enjoy lighting fireworks and they will let them do that leading up to the 4th. I know that kids and some families really love fireworks so I get it, but I didn't ask people not to celebrate with fireworks.

Our store hires many mentally disabled people to be baggers. I am fine with this. So we had this other manager who has a bit of an ego. Recently to make himself look good he promoted one of the handicapped baggers to cashier (this has never been done before). I am not talking an autistic person I am talking about someone who doesn't even know how to count change. Two weeks after this the manager who promoted the girl left the store and left us to count change for the girl every 5 minutes. I will add that the girl is able enough to understand how emotion works and uses this self awareness to be as much of an attention whore as she can. Am I the asshole?		1	0

I've told him to talk to his manager and he has but nothing gets done about it. I've told him to go to the manager's boss but he isn't one to stir things up or draw attention to himself.

At work he can't ask for help because his manager won't train other people for certain areas so he is the only one who is able to do it. Also, he gets yelled at if he tries to delegate to other people. So he's just constantly overwhelmed and I've tried to help every way I can.

The problem with this is, I feel like if I go the boss my SO will be angry at me. I just want to help but I don't want to get him in trouble either...

c2zmcr	2019-06-20 18:26:09	heavyhearts3999	AITA for telling my brother to not name his son after my own?	"So, I am wondering if I am overreacting. My husband says I am not, but my brother hurt, so here we go.

We lost our youngest son to SIDS. It was an awful and terrible time, it put me in a dark place. I got unexpectedly pregnant a year later and I struggled connecting with my daughter because of that, as well as taking care of our older son. Things are better now, I’ve gone to therapy and am on medication for my depression. It’s not a magic fix, but it’s been 10 years now and I can say for the most part, we’re all doing better.

My brother and his wife are pregnant with their first. They recently told me that they are having a boy and my brother told me he wants to name the baby after my late son. I found it weird for several reasons, one, being that they hadn’t had a chance to connect (we lived in different states at the time, now we’re closer) and he had only met him once and two, it’s not like an older relative or something. (My son was 4 months when he passed.) It’s my son. I also wasn’t sure that I could handle having another person with that name in the family. His name isn’t extremely common, but also not ultra-rare, so I do have to hear it in passing and it can hurt to see a child with it and think about how old he’d be, all his milestones, etc. And while that's a part of life and moving on, I don't think I could handle it on the basis we see my brother and his family.

I told my brother to please not to do that, out of respect for me, explaining why. My husband agreed. Sister-in-law actually understood and told me in private that she didn’t like the idea, but she didn’t want to hurt my brother’s feelings plus she doesn’t hate the name. She assured me they won’t be using it and that they’ll go with the middle name they had planned instead.

My brother is hurt. He says he thought it’d be a nice tribute and says he doesn't get it, saying that it's an honor. AITA here?"	No A-holes here	0	0

Last night was a flurry of emotions. The gist of it was we were talking on snap and and the conversation moved onto a sexual topic. I asked her something like when will she be ready to do some of these things with me. That's when she dropped the bomb that she wouldn't because she is abstinent until marriage. Ultimately I said some choice words which I do regret and will apologize for but I do believe I have a right to be mad here.  

We aren't at an age which marriage is an option for quite a long time.

He refused to talk to me with it on speakerphone(i wanted my grandparents to hear this too as they are my legal guardians, and i have no idea what to do in this situation), he asks me how old i am and i tell him (im 19) and he continually tells me to take it off of speakerphone before hanging up on me.

c2zb8l	2019-06-20 18:00:56		AITA for letting my dog pee on neighbors plants?	"I think this one is borderline but also starting to think I’m the sucky one. 

I have a 3 year old male dog. Being a territorial male, when we take walks he saves his pee to do a billion little squirts all over anything higher than pavement as opposed to just emptying his bladder. We live in a blue collar area with very few front yards. The standard set up in my neighborhood is either no grass or very small patch of grass on street side of block and usually a small patch right between sidewalk and house. [Heres](https://www.google.com/search?q=new+orleans+shotgun+double&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiyvbzizvjiAhUNFKwKHS1aATkQ2-cCegQIABAC&oq=new+orleans+shotgun+double&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-img.3...39108.40496..40629...1.0..1.189.751.6j2......0....1.........0j0i67j33i299j30i10.m6MVawD2g7c&ei=asYLXbJgjaiwBa20hcgD&bih=551&biw=375&prmd=sinv&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS778US778&hl=en-US#imgrc=TsSpTBxqfjeE1M) the best example I could find. 

Sometimes people plant things in this little patch, which of course my dog almost always wants to mark. My general rule of thumb I’ve been utilizing is I hustle him along to avoid pee in potted plants and flowering plants/herbs/other delicate looking things. But if I didn’t let him pee on any of mini front yards I would be walking forever and yanking him half the time. Last week a woman down the street was sitting on her porch and I walked by with dog and he did a little squirt on her green leafy bush-like plant. She immediately asked what the hell I was doing. I just apologized immediately and tried to keep going but she started yelling after me that I was a scumbag and and other curse words. I didn’t engage but I’ve been brooding on it and want to know if I’m TAH and if so how to avoid this in the future. I am realizing my flowing plant distinction is mostly arbitrary since I don’t know enough about plants to know what can be killed by pee, but obviously I’d let him pee on a tree or big study bush. I dont know where to draw the line now. But I do want to emphasize the type of homes in my neighborhood do not offer a lot of public spaces for dogs to use the bathroom and my dog doesn’t let loose a ton of pee, just a tiny bit to mark. If I planted something I wouldn’t want pee on it either, but since its literally right on the sidewalk shouldn’t she plant something hardier expecting that people walk their dogs? Help please how do I walk my dog locally without pissing (lol) people off?"		1	0

c2za8j	2019-06-20 17:58:41		AITA for	"I love making food. When I am visiting back home, I usually have lots of free time and often make dinner. This recently has lead to some heated discussions, where I ended up telling at my mother, because her reasoning is beyond stupid to me, and there seems to be no way to discuss rationally.

The problem is garlic. Now, I do not like the taste of garlic, and neither does my mother.  However, lots of my mother's favourite food contains garlic. Like thai and indian curry, and some italian food. She will eat that stuff up at restaurants with no problems at all. Because you can't taste the garlic itself, it is more a way of adjusting the taste as a whole.

So why is garlic a problem? Because I buy it, I cut it up, and I put it in the food. I could choose not to, and maybe I should. Maybe this makes me an asshole, but I know that she is obsessive about this, and what she thinks makes absoulutely no sense. To be honest, she is like this about lots of food. I have almost never been to a restaurant with her without her demanding to change the dish she is ordering in some way. She will decide she does not like things just on principle. For example everything she eats ideally is whole grain. At a restaurant she will eat white pasta or rice like everyone else, but at home she will make a huge deal out of having her own serving if others eat it white. I understand that is her preference, but she will act as if she dislikes the taste, which is just not true. All of this is getting on my nerves. I am quite picky myself, there is some stuff that I just can't get myself to eat, but this seems more like an obsession and need of control than genuinely not liking it. 

Yesterday, I made lasagna. Of course she had to find the garlic in the fridge. She confronted me about it, as if I had insulted her and do not respect her. And honestly, I can't get myself to respect demands if I find them to be so incredibly stupid. No amount of explanation helps either. I put half a clove of garlic in that huge thing. She admittedly, even after knowing the garlic was there, could not taste it. Still, today she demanded I put no garlic in the pizza sauce I make tomorrow. I do not use garlic in pizza sauce, but that comment made me want to.

Also, it made me angry, and here I am tipping away, hoping to find a solution. Am I the asshole? And how do I solve this stupid conflict? To clarify, this, for me is not so much about the ingredients. Yesterday's lasagna probably would have tasted just as good or better without the garlic. It is about me refusing to give in to her demands because they make no sense, which is annoying."		1	0

He told me that  he gets really bad nightmares and  believes nightmares come from ghost entering your body  when your sleeping so he lays down the salt because the ghost has to pick up each grain before it can enter the room and when it’s done it will be morning time already . At this point I was rolling on the floor laughing and he’s acting scared saying the salt won’t work if you taunt the ghost . I laughed a little longer I would say about 8 mins total and he asked me to go home and it’s like 3 in the morning . I went home but idk where I stand we haven’t spoke but I feel like I’m owed a sorry for him sending me home but I do feel bad am I the asshole here ?

However every once in a while I pick them up if the number appears to be something I may be interested in (it may have an area code from a town I am familiar with, etc). Sometimes these are cold calls. I have a direct number at work, which means they have to have somehow internet stalked me to get my contact info, and then called me unsolicited. Sometimes I will engage them and try to quickly and politely dispatch them. However other times I just hang up without ever saying a word. This usually happens when there is the telltale 2-3 second delay between when I say hello and they start speaking. This tells me I am just one of literally hundreds of cold calls they make that day, and I feel justified in not even engaging in the 45 seconds of small talk it takes to get rid of them.

"This is a serious point of contention in our relationship which seems very strange to me because we literally never fight and have always been able to settle our disagreements like mature adult people. 

The issue: I drive a '94 Toyota Camry. This car means a lot to me. It was my first car and I saved my meager earnings for months to be able to buy it outright. It was a big deal to me to be able to do that all on my own. I bought it off CL for $1000 and have had it for almost 4 years. It is a good, reliable car and I see no reason why I shouldn't drive it until it craps out. 

My fiance doesn't like it which is understandable because he obviously doesn't have the same emotional attachment to it that I do. He sees a crappy, old car. To be fair, it *is* a crappy, old car but it is *my* crappy, old car.

Anyway, a lot has changed for me in 4 years and I could easily upgrade to a better car, but I don't want to and it drives him nuts to the point he has offered up 10k to buy me another car which I politely refused and it's become this whole thing where we are both hardheaded about our positions.

While I’m between jobs and trying to move out, I cook for myself and clean the house in lieu of paying rent and am very happy to do this.

My stepfather usually cooks for the rest of the family, but he’s currently working away Mondays until Fridays, which leaves my mother to cook. The problem is, she’s not a great cook and my half-brother (12M) isn’t fond of her cooking at all. I’d happily cook for my HB, but she doesn’t trust me to make anything for him that doesn’t go in a microwave. The worst is when she makes meatballs. She uses low quality meatballs with a terrible texture and puts in too much garlic and rosemary with no other seasoning.

She called my HB down for dinner tonight having made meatballs, then called me down. I said I didn’t want any without telling her I found it disgusting. She then accused me of eating junk food all day. While my mum was out of the dining room, I quietly told my little brother I didn’t like it and that I was planning to feed it to the dog. I took a few bites, gagged and ended up doing just this when my mum returned to the room. She said I was ungrateful and kept asking me why I wouldn’t eat it. I ended up telling her I didn’t like it and she stormed out of the room *pissed*. I then got a curry I’d made the other day out of the fridge and ate that instead.

My mother thinks I’m completely out of order. AITA?

EDIT: Having gotten several YTA responses, I decided to apologise to my mother, who just rolled her as at me when I told her how bad her cooking was. Also, didn’t know the whole thing about giving dogs garlic, mainly because my mother would have given my brother’s leftovers to the dog anyway.

EDIT 2: My dog normally has leftovers of this dish and is fine, but I’ll keep an eye on her. I think she’ll be ok, she’s a strong dog and she’s survived eating worse, but I won’t be feeding her that in the future.

EDIT 3: Told my mum to keep an eye on what is more her dog than mine, she told me that I have completely got my priorities wrong, she has done nothing wrong, I’m pathetic for seeking advice online and I should stop worrying about the dog I may have just murdered and start worrying about myself.

I was raised in a very religious home and always taught to not have sex before marriage, stay pure, etc. However, as a teenager, I was involved in a relationship with a man several years older than me and ended up losing my virginity at age 16. Since then, I have had multiple other partners and am demonstrably far from ""pure"".

However, I am starting to feel immense guilt over lying to her.

Now she seemed embarrased and we got along real well in those first few minutes so after the initial anger and struggle not to tell her to go fuck herself I felt sort of bad especially considering Communism has less of a shit reputation in western Europe which is weird(Where as on the Polish part of my family it is as looked down upon as Nazism) but alas they never had to deal with it I suppose so am I the asshole?"

c2z0za	2019-06-20 17:38:06	exoticrumble	AITA for using my phone in class to do Homework ?	I am a student in community college Math class. It's my 2nd week and our teacher is known for talking 30 mins plus off topic. So i decide to start on my homework for the class while he does this. After about 35 mins of doing hw while the teacher is still off topic I get to a part in the homework I am unsure how to do. So I take out my phone and Google how to do it since our teacher is too busy off topic rather than teaching us. After a minute of googling my teacher, finally gets back on topic (45 mins later) and starts lecturing for a min. He notices me on my phone and asks me to leave the class. I in shock say OK. As I get my stuff he says he isn't mad at me he just said you don't seem to care about the class the last 40 mins. As I'm walking out I respond pretty quickly to him saying that he didn't seem to care either. He responds saying Well im am the teacher and you are the student. I walk to my car and laugh my ass off.

c2ywtw	2019-06-20 17:28:41	throwm3inthetrashplz	AITA for getting upset at my boyfriend for losing his own coupons?	"Throwaway cause my boyfriend is a redditor. 

Anyway, my boyfriend’s family is very well off and they give him a credit card he doesn’t pay for to buy all his groceries. He spends way more on groceries than me because he can afford to. 

My parents are well off (not as well as his) but they are more stingy with their money and don’t feel like giving money to their 19 year old daughter for groceries is appropriate anymore because I have a job. That’s whatever, but I can only afford to spend $30 a week on groceries and I have to pay for rent and other things too so sometimes my food budget is the first thing to get cut down on. 

Because of this, I can’t buy a lot of food. I buy no snacks, only the bare essentials like ground hamburger and potatoes and sandwich materials. I weigh 102 pounds and I’m 5’4, I want to gain weight very badly but I don’t have the money for food. 

So to the point, my boyfriend got $6 off his next purchase as a coupon and I was so excited for him I explicitly said keep that and make sure to use it! He said okay. It’s been weeks since then and my birthday is coming up and I jokingly asked if I could have his coupon since he wasn’t using it. The dude had no idea what I was talking about. So I got kinda mad and said did you ever thing about me who struggles to stay on budget for food when you basically threw the coupon in the garbage?? And he told me he’d just give me $6 so I’d “stop being mean to him”. And he kept saying I was being mean to him but I feel like my getting upset was justified. 

Am I the asshole? It was his coupon in the first place and he can do whatever he wants with it.

Edit: everyone seems to think I yelled at him or something. I told him I was disappointed he threw it away and didn’t think of me and he said I was being mean. I have NEVER yelled at my boyfriend or been intentionally mean. This issue is more about me being upset that he has the ability to throw away a $6 coupon and I can’t. So I guess I’m an asshole there cause it’s not his fault he can afford more than me, but at the same time I feel like he should be more considerate because we live together and he sees how it is for me."

c2yuk9	2019-06-20 17:23:49		AITA A Friend asked to asked at my apartment for a couple of months, but has been sleeping over at other friend’s places, while they keep their belongings at my place	"Hey Folx,

Thanks for taking the time to read my story. Here it goes!

I have a friend who is in an in-between situation. They are moving into a house with other friends in another nearby state, but not for about 3-4 more months. In the meantime they are without a solid place to stay. So I talked my bf into it letting them stay on the couch. They said they’d chip in for bills and such, which was a selling point for my bf, because he doesn’t really know them personally. 

They are neat, and a lovely friend, so no issues there. 

They brought a lot of their belongings with them from that same nearby state. They packed up their whole car, and now a lot of their stuff is living in my dining area, which isn’t the problem per se, because I knew they’d need a place to put it, and we don’t really have anywhere else it can go. Its not a very big apartment, but it’s my friend, so I wanted to make it work.

Anyways, it’s been about a month so far, and things are going relatively well. But here’s where things begin to shift into an issue for me. They are somewhat new to the area, and have only ever visited briefly in the past. They are very explorative, and friendly, and have made some new friends while here. In addition, they’ve had another friend recently move to the area that they’ve known for a long time, of whom they have been spending lots of time with lately. This is great! I want them to enjoy their stay here and reconnect with their old friend. The issue is they’ve been essentially sleeping most nights at their friend’s(like 4-5 nights)and just come back to gather some things they’ll need for work, or they’ll shower, or come back to eat etc. 

I suppose I was given the impression they were in need of a place to stay for the time being, which I did under those pretenses. I didn’t realize our place would just become somewhere for them to store their stuff while they slept over at other people’s places. They have given me some money, but it’s less than we discussed and is way less than what someone would pay for an Airbnb, if it were the exact same space being offered. In fact it’s a little insulting, but I know they’re trying to save money, and are just getting established with this new job, so I don’t feel it would be right to come down on them about it just yet. I want to have a conversation about it, but i really need to know AITA in this situation?!?

Many thanks and well wishes to you all! 

In short; A friend needed a place to crash for a couple of months. They are pretty much using my place as a storage unit for their belongings, and sleeping most nights at other friend’s places."	Not the A-hole	1	0

They have been together for about two years and just fly back and forth, between countries. She is a lovely girl and it’s nothing against her or him. 

They are having two weddings- one here in Aus and one over there next year. Originally the one in Indonesia was set to be in February but in the last couple of weeks, they have changed the date to June next year so that they only have one date to remember (the Aus one is tomorrow, so the Indonesian one will be exactly a year from now). I was planning on going to the February one but the June one clashes with my 40th and I already have plans for a ski trip in New Zealand so I don’t want to go. 
My partner is unsure if it would be an arsehole thing not to go but I think that if they are having two weddings, then they can’t expect people to go to both, especially when they have changed the date for the overseas one.

c2ysxy	2019-06-20 17:20:09	bffaita	AITA for leaving my best friend’s birthday get together?	"It was my best friend Stella’s 25th birthday last weekend. She invited me to her house for some drinks and to just hang out. Things have been tough for her lately as her boyfriend has been in the hospital for the last month (car accident), so she wanted to keep things low key. Also since she’s been at the hospital, she hasn’t really hung out with me or her family lately.

My boyfriend and I head over to her house and Stella’s sister and brother in law are also there. We all drink at her house every now and then, so this is nothing new to us. Everything’s going well, we’re drinking and laughing and just having a good time. My boyfriend had to be at work at 5am the next day, so I’d check in with him to see when he was ready to leave. Well her sister asked why we were leaving so early (it was around 10 pm, we got there around 6pm) and I told her my boyfriend had work early tomorrow. Her sister said “well okay, that’s understandable but you can always stay.” I kind of didn’t respond and then they asked what I was doing tomorrow. I told them I was just gonna be at home. Right after I said that her sister had a wtf look and said “okay you’re not doing anything, might as well stay?” This went on for like 10 minutes and then I started to get up to leave. Stella was quiet the whole time and I could tell she felt some type of way cause when I went to hug her bye she was kind of... cold? We still did our usual hug and cheek kiss goodbye, but it didn’t seem so happy.

My boyfriend doesn’t think I did anything wrong, but I don’t know. We’ve been best friends for 13 years, I feel like she should’ve said something. AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2yorm	2019-06-20 17:10:59		AITA for changing 4th of July plans with my friend?	"One of my best friends (and ex-girlfriend) has been gone for the past month. She wasn't originally supposed to get back into town until July 6th. So I made plans w/ my group of friends to go to the pool all day and then to watch fireworks that night. Well, my friend that's out of town, lets call her C, changed her plans and is now getting back into town on the 4th. C asked if I'd pick her up from the airport at 2:00 that afternoon and to hang out the rest of the day. I really wasn't thrilled about it bc I'd been planning on drinking at the pool all day & that couldn't happen if I had to go pick her up, but whatever. Plus like, fucking uber. However, I haven't seen her in a month and she will only be in town for a few days so I agree. I told C I'd hang out w/ my friends that morning, pick her up from the airport that afternoon, and hang out w/ her until meeting back up w/ my friends at the fireworks that night.

&#x200B;

So all of this is good until my friends decide they now want to have a 4th of July party that night rather than going to the pool. I feel like this will annoy C, but I don't want to miss the party w/ all my friends & unfortunately, neither group really likes the other. I also would like to note that I do still have feelings for C, she broke up w/ me about a month before she left. She told me I'm her best friend and she didn't want that to change, so I am trying to put my feelings aside and be friends. But because of this I struggle to put up boundaries w/ her. I tend to be overly accommodating to what she wants because ultimately I just want to hang out w/ her.

&#x200B;

Anyway, in hopes of not pissing off either party I ask my friend who is hosting if it's okay if I invite C and her friends to the party. She says that's totally cool. Well, I then text C about this change of plan and invite her to the party & she is royally pissed off. She said she absolutely does not want to go. And in her defense, she does know my friends don't particularly like her & she doesn't see a point in hanging around people who don't like her, which like, fair. However, I still want to go & told her I planned to. I told C I would pick her up from the airport, hang out w/ her and her friends for a few hours after, go to the party, watch the fireworks, and then meet back up w/ her afterwords to go out. This did not go over well. She says I'm ditching her to go to my friend's party. That I made plans with her and then changed them because something came up that I would rather do. 

&#x200B;

I feel like I'm going out of my way to make sure I am spending time w/ both groups, but C is claiming I'm ditching her & choosing my other friends over her. She says I can hang out w/ them anytime while she is only in town for a few days before leaving for another month. I told her I was trying to compromise & she replied w/ ""You're not compromising, you're just trying to get the best of both worlds."" And like, so what if I am? I feel like my emotions are clouding my judgement here so... AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

c2ynkm	2019-06-20 17:08:25	bfe003	AITA for not wanting to play with my friends friend?	" 

I have a friend I'm playing a video game with, in the video game there's a bunch of items and gear. Me and my original friend have been playing for pretty long, and we have gotten a bunch of gear and experience at dodging, and we only have 3 bosses in the game left. But suddenly, he invited somebody new.

The new guy I find to be annoying, and he well to be honest... just kind of sucks at the game. He has barely played and suddenly we have to grind gear we naturally got through playing, and we basically have to carry him because he can't dodge. Not only that, but he doesn't listen to what we tell him and barely even understands the game, but he keeps pushing for his friend to play.

I'm mostly refusing to play with them at this point, because it's boring. Having 3 players play also ruins the balance of the game, and I just don't like his other friend but he won't listen. I barely feel like playing anymore. I also own the original server so I just let them play on it while I afk. I've told my original friend this but he doesn't seem to listen to me and forces this guy to play with us anyways.

c2ymdd	2019-06-20 17:05:39		AITA for asking roommate to remove plant light from living room?	I moved in about 6 months ago with someone I knew from college. He pays significantly less rent then myself, less than half, and we share the living room space which is also a studio. Majority of the stuff in our place is his, because his parents moved all the items they were trying to get rid of to us, which I didn't really want but didn't bother me. I recently got a puppy and he wanted to remove the carpet that his mom gave us. When moving in, they kept talking about how the apartment was going to be no shoes, in which I didn't agree to or follow by. But I did not wear shoes on their carpet. He seemed a bit bothered about having to remove it, I myself didn't want it in the first place. Recently, he got a plant that requires extra lighting and this bright LED shines throughout the day until 5pm. This light makes me completely livid. It shines directly in my face when watching TV, I can see it from my bed, and also inside my bathroom. I have been turning it off whenever I get home because it bothers me and he tells me it needs to stay on until 5. I personally don't want my living room to be a greenroom and am fine with the plants that don't require the light. Am I the asshole for asking him to remove the light?	Not the A-hole	0	0

All of our grades were already finalized for that class so the teacher decided to let us play games during class and she put a movie on too. One of my other friends took out her yearbook and asked me to sign it, which I did. I saw that she had a ton of signatures and I had none so I took out my yearbook and asked one of my other friends who was sitting at the table to sign it, she agreed and picked up the pen to sign it. She held my yearbook in a way so I couldn't see it. When she handed the yearbook back to me the words ""You Are Boring"" were written on the corner of the page. I asked one of my other friends to sign again so when I used white out over the insult her name would still be there. My friend who wrote the insult heard this and started yelling at me. I ignored her. As we were walking out of the classroom when we were dismissed, I tried to talk to her and she said, ""Go away, I'm mad at you."" To which I responded, ""You have no right to be mad at me."" She responded.""Yes I do."" I said, ""Give me one reason."" Someone else said, ""Because you're judging her."" Which I was not. Then I said ""She's the one who wrote an insult in my yearbook."" And that was the end of it because I stopped talking.

"My parents are thinking about having my grandmother move in because they don't think she should be living alone anymore. I support it, she has been having a lot of problems recently. But, my parents are thinking about buying a sofa bed for me to sleep on from now on while my grandmother takes my room permanently.

It wouldn't be a big deal while I'm at university, but I was planning on staying home and commuting while I do my masters because of money and Im not sure if I'm still exempt from council tax in post grad like I am in undergrad. 

I know it sounds selfish but I really don't want to be kicked out of my own room and sleep on a sofa bed until I move out, my parents aren't even considering involving my sister in this conversation (she's 5 years older than me). If I gave up my room I would essentially have no privacy left and I'd probably have to get rid of most of my stuff because my parents wouldn't want it in the living room. 

I've already told them that if it comes to it I'll just properly move out and try to sort bills and money as I get to them. Since it would just be less stressful for everyone involved.

Just as a note, I was always planning on fully moving out eventually, but I was hoping on finishing my masters first and save up some money in that time so moving out wouldn't be as hectic financially.

So, AITA for not wanting to give up my room and sleep on a sofa bed in the living room for the next couple of years so my grandmother can move in? I just feel pretty guilty and selfish

Edit: thought I'd answer a couple of questions. A couple people have asked about my sister. My sister is 25 and still lives at home, my parents aren't including her in the conversation because ""we don't think she's capable of moving out, while you've already proved yourself at university"".

Unfortunately, there is no other option, or none I can think of. We don't have a basement (UK) we do have a loft but it would be too expensive to convert it. My parents don't want to put my grandmother in a home and I agree with them.

For a bit more context I'm 20 and still doing my undergraduate, I'll be starting my final year in September. While at university at the moment I have been able to scrape by with bills and rent mostly because of my student finance. But post graduate I'm not sure if I'm still exempt from council tax, and I will receive a lot less student finance. 

Its definately just a sticky situation, I completely agree with my parents that my grandmother shouldn't be living alone at the moment. But honestly, I'm just not sure if I can afford to properly move out at the moment, I've been looking around for places for a couple of days but I haven't been able to find anything yet. I'll obviously keep looking though."	Asshole	0	0

Next week will be the last week I work because I'm moving to a different city. The schedule is usually posted every Thursday so I checked it. To my surprise, they only scheduled me for one day. A four hour shift at that. So before getting all pissed off, I tried to rationalize. I get that people are usually in their idgaf mode because they're about to leave so they can't get punished. The manager would want to schedule less hours just in case they did take off without finishing their week since they wouldn't have to worry about covering the shift....but I there's another girl that's leaving on the same day as me and she has 30+ hours her last week. I also checked another schedule where a different person had a normal amount of hours during their last week. So at this point I'm annoyed. Mind you, the girl who is leaving the same day as me calls out every other day because her damn kids are always sick. In the year and a half that I've been working here, I've only called out twice, and still found someone to replace me before calling out. Even though I'm in school, I always come on time. I'm always covering other people's shift. Coming early and leaving late. So the fact the they tried my me like this makes me hurt. So would it be wrong for me just to now show up?	Asshole	0	0

They live in the UK but every year they fly me out to Israel and we basically have a huge party all summer. They are really kind and since my mom remarried 4 years ago they have been really awesome to my stepbrother and stepsister.

My stepbrother is my best friend he’s the same age as me and we basically are the same guy in 2 bodies.

She scratches me if she sees me eating out of her ‘bowl’ that’s how crazy it is (it’s not her specific bowl it’s the family China wtf) 

Anyway my grandparents have never invited my stepsibs along but this time they asked if I wanted to invite them. I am SO PUMPED to bring Mike but I told my grandparents I don’t want my stepsister to come along. 

My grandparents were very tactful when they told my mom and stepdad and they said that they wanted to show Israel to my stepbro this year and then next year they’d take my stepsister but my mom knows the real reason and isn’t talking to me cuz she thinks I’m doing it to be spiteful. 

My stepsis is apparently jealous that Mike is going and cuz she’s making my mom and stepdads life hard I think they want me to relent but my grandparents have said it’s up to me.

c2yd9f	2019-06-20 16:45:30	Free-vbucks	AITA for making a joke about his parents divorce?	"So on Instagram I’m part of a groupchat of about 20 people with a guy who we’ll call K. Most of the time in this Groupchat K is a complete knob to everyone doing all sorts of questionable stuff. K has done stuff ranging from telling people has a week to live (which was a complete lie and taking the piss out of a kid who’d died of cancer at the age of 11 a week earlier) to saying stuff like how he’d shag another member of the groupchat, N’s sister (who is like 10) to telling people stuff like how they should kill themselves (this is the main reason why I hate him as he doesn’t know about some serious mental health issues I have). 

So now with the context out of the way we get to the incident. We were all talking about stuff in the groupchat when suddenly K brings up the fact his parents are divorced. Me and my closer friend in the groupchat CJ were both wondering why he’d say something like that in a public groupchat but we didn’t really care. 

Later on I was in an argument (these happened quite regularly in this groupchat) with K and a guy who we’ll call A. Now eventually A ends up saying something along the lines of “shut up or else” and K tells me to kys. So me having had enough of both of their bs tell A “what are you gonna do? Get your parents to have a divorce like K?”. Now yes I know that was a bit insensitive but at this point I was mad and tired and couldn’t be bothered about how either of them felt.

Suddenly like half the groupchat suddenly starts defending K saying that what I said was “too far” and that I’d “crossed the line” which honestly surprised me seeing as they’d never said anything like this before about anyone else including K. 

Long story short I as calmly as I could said “Apologies K but I don’t think I could possibly give less of a shit about them divorcing”. And then closed the groupchat and went to sleep. 

I woke up the next day to being blocked by K and having A say that I was a horrible human being and that I’d upset him.

At this point I’m really not sure what to do about this because honestly I don’t give a shit about K or his family and I believe that if you put something like that in a public groupchat you shouldn’t be surprised if someone uses it later against you. I haven’t spoken to K since this happened and nobody is really talking in the groupchat. 

Fast forward a few days and K has unblocked me and is back to his normal bs but everyone seems to be fine with it. Then I reply to something he said with something like “lol” and he replied “don’t talk to me fag” and everyone seemed to approve. He said that apparently I really upset him and that apparently that was not ok. 

So r/AmItheAsshole, who do you think is the asshole in the situation because I’m genuinely curious."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c2yd8c	2019-06-20 16:45:26		AITA for cooking ground beef?	"This was a long time ago, but I still go back and forth.

I moved into a houseful (6 people) of vegans as their 7th roommate.

I am not vegan, nor vegetarian.  They all knew that when I moved in and said it wasn't a problem.  

Because my diet was different from everyone else's, they pooled their grocery budgets while I purchased my own.  

There was a kitchen full of pots and pans that everyone used that had come with the house.  It was a furnished rental.

After I'd been there a few months, the 'house leader' sat me down and told me that they had all discussed my cooking habits, and they felt it was inconsiderate of me to not have desgnated a ""meat pan"" to cook with.  

I did clean my own cooking dishes so they didn't ever have to touch meat residue, but it's true that I did grab and use whatever cooking dishes were most convenient.

Several of the housemates said they were feeling ill sometimes and they thought that it was from that.  I kind of doubt that was actually true, but maybe I did cause them a psychosomatic illness from the thought of their food being cooked in a meat pan.

Anyway, they asked me to move out, which I did.  WITA for cooking meat in all the vegan pans?"		1	0

c2ycfx	2019-06-20 16:43:46	holymolyraviolyy	WIBTA if I told my friend to get help from social services to learn how to take care of himself?	"My friend had to get out from the family home at the age of 16 for personal reasons and ended up being given a council house and is now living off whatever allowance he is given. He basically sits around and smokes weed all day. He can't do much else because of his own issues but that's another story. 

He can't take care of himself even in the slightest. Can't clean, can't cook, can hardly do laundry, doesn't take proper measures to his personal hygiene. His apartment is filled with random things and furniture he doesn't use, every surface is covered in sticky dust and everything is generally filthy. Everything in the bathroom is mouldy and gross. It's clear that he doesn't know how to clean, keep organised and whatnot, but he refuses to realise it. I've consistently confronted him over the past 5 years about these issues, but they never get better. I've offered to deep clean and sort everything out for him and give him a proper tutorial on how to use different chemicals plenty of times but he always refuses. Followed by an enraged hissy fit. I do understand this, don't get me wrong. I always plan out a strategy to sound as little patronising as I can and show that I just want to help my best friend but its never wanted or accepted.

So, he gets free living and money from the government, and I'm sure they could provide him with further social help in terms of someone who comes in once a week and cleans and teaches him how to clean. At least they provide this where I come from (we live in different countries atm). He also has a cat and the apartment smells like hot sweaty garbage. Would I be the asshole for telling him to get help or even calling social services myself to make this request? I feel like such a condescending bitch for saying all this and getting on his tail all the time but this is a general concern for his health and wellbeing."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2yc83	2019-06-20 16:43:20		WIBTA if I broke things up with the girl I'm dating because of her selection of wine and usage of ketchup?	"Hello,

So I started dating a very attractive, kind and funny girl 1,5 months ago. I like her, and she likes me (I think). Things are going great, we meet up a lot and do activities or eat at a restaurant.

Anyways, I decided I wanted to cook her a great meal my self since cooking is one of my hobbies.
I carefully selected all of the ingredients, buying locally if possible. I slaved, and I really mean it, for hours in the kitchen preparing the kid (goat).
The end result was a half-braised kid brisket seasoned with my favorite herbs. The brisket was served aux legumé topped with a citrus-truffles oil with ukama potatos on the sides. And to finish my masterpiece of I prepared a professionally made red wine sauce.

So that's what I served her. Now for the tests. The first test (wine) is basically if she knows what wine to pair with what. I had selected two bottles l, one cheap white wine made by chapel hill and the second wine was a decent red wine. 
When she came over I asked her if she could grab a bottle of wine. She went straight for the white wine. Big nono. I decided to give her another chance and asked ""isn't red wine better with meat?"" She replied ""but I like white wine hihih"".
Strike one I thought and went to the bathroom to write down the results.

Second test, which is the food test is conducted by placing a bottle of ketchup and the ""chalice"" of my red wine sauce on the table. When I have her the plate she didn't hesitate a second and grabbed the ketchup bottle. She then drenched the kid brisket in this vile and disgusting sauce. Basically shitting on the food and my hard work. This event was also noted down in my phone.


So... would I be the asshole if I broke things up with her because of these 2 tests?"		1	0

c2yb6v	2019-06-20 16:40:58		WIBTA if I filed a complaint against the hospital that just saved me?	"Background: I’m a 28 y/o woman with Asperger's and ADHD, and was having a pretty tough last few weeks. I’m a HUGE introvert, and was desperate for some personal space while living with my parents, siblings, and 3 annoying dogs. I had also been on Adderall for the last week and 1/2, along with many other meds I was already on for depression and anxiety. I was also emotionally abused as a child for several years!

A few days ago, I was going about my business at my data entry job (which can also be pretty stressful at times.) Nothing out of the ordinary. All of a sudden, I felt this big wave of sadness take hold of me, consuming my entire mind. It was like I was emotionally drowning, and all I could think of was, “GET ME OUT OF HERE!” I bawled my eyes out for the next hour.

A short break later, I fell into a state of emotional paralysis. My mind had gone blank, and my arms and legs suddenly weighed a ton. My boss and coworkers tried to cheer me up, but all my energy was slowly draining out of me. Before long, I was just laying there, on the verge of passing out. My boss ended up calling 911, and I was put in an ambulance.

Right from start, I was taken aback by the nurses’ and EMTs' bedside manners. Despite being barely conscious, they kept talking to me like I was just fine. They asked me a lot of questions, asked for my consent on treatment, and had me sign some forms when I could barely move my wrist. A few times, when trying to get my attention, they’d gently smack my face, and say “OP, I need you to wake up for me,” or “C’mon, OP, wake up” in a pretty stern tone, almost as if they thought I was faking it. Deep down, part of me was thinking “Do I LOOK like I’m in the right frame of mind to answer questions or anything?! You might as well be talking to someone high on anesthesia right now!”

The actual treatment went very smoothly from there. The doctor had a more gentle demeanor to him, and he kept me comfortable as my body was recovering. Once I was fully conscious, he had me explain my situation again since I was too groggy to do it earlier. After 45 min or so, my body slowly unlocked, and I could move my limbs again with ease. Once I could walk again, the doctor diagnosed me with acute stress disorder, and gave me a friendly send-off with some new meds.

Don't get me wrong; I'm VERY thankful for the prompt treatment, and that I turned out ok. I just think the EMTs could've been a little more sensitive with a special-needs patient. I've always been pretty sensitive, so I was surprised to see them be so firm with me. Then again, maybe that's just how being an EMT works. I'm very self-sheltered, and haven't had much experience in the real world. I could also just be overreacting due to past trauma. The only reason I'd file a complaint is so that the nurses could be more mindful about similar patients in the future.

What do you guys think? Are my feelings warranted, or should I just be grateful that they saved my life? WIBTA?"		1	0

c2y8hh	2019-06-20 16:34:56	ok32123	WIBTA for telling a friend that they are not lonely and aren't doing nothing over summer	"Throwaway as friend uses reddit.

Quick backstory - we've just finished exams and now have a much longer summer than usual. I'm not in a great place mentally right now and I've talked to him about it a bit. Something that we've talked about is how miserable Summer is going to be as everyone is going out partying whilst I'm just staying at home. This is something that he believed was going to happen to him and was very down about it.

However, it is now summer and in the first half a week he has been to 3 parties with a bunch more planned. I want to make it clear that I don't hold this against him, and I'm actually glad that he's sorting his shit out and going out. However, what has begun to annoy me is him still saying stuff like ""Summer's going to be shit"" ""I'm going to be alone for the whole summer"" when it is pretty obvious now that he won't, which you'll have to take my word for but he gets invited to a lot of things.

He has also started making jokes about my shit social life and how I don't do anything except go to the gym, work and play ps4, although he'll later contradict himself and complain about he doesn't have a social life. I have made it pretty clear to him that I don't find these jokes funny, especially since he knows how unhappy I am about being a loser and not doing anything.

Boss immediately said that he's useless. He didn't even ask about his qualifications (which, admittedly, my friend isn't super qualified for the job anyway). But just the way my boss immediately said that after learning he's gay was really off putting. 

I haven't had a chance to talk to my friend yet. I'm not really sure what to tell him. My boss did say he could come in and fill out an application, but I'm not sure my friend would want to work for a guy who thinks he's useless just because he's gay.

c2y79k	2019-06-20 16:32:10		AITA for cutting off this friendship?	"I met this person this past February. We slept with each other early on, things started off semi-romantic. But, when it was clear that things weren’t working romantically and they started to put distance between us (without explaining why), I told them I just wanted to be friends. During that exchange, they said some very mean, condescending things to me, that they later recognized as mean and condescending and apologized for. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to continue being friends after that, but because they gave me a genuine apology, I decided I just wanted a little space and then we could be friends again.

We started talking again about a month after this and I went to one of their shows. During one of their songs, some of the lyrics were word-for-word things that they’d said to me during our arguments. I left early that night because it just felt fucking weird. I didn’t say anything about it, because I felt like I’d come off as crazy if I said anything to them. I felt conceited thinking it was about me.

So, I let that slide. They left to go on tour with their band after that. About a week into them being on tour, I got the news that I have HPV and might have cervical cancer. I had to have a biopsy. Since they were the last person I slept with, I told them about it, even though I didn’t necessarily have to (according to the medical community, but that just seems shady af to me). I told them then that I understood if this was just too much and they didn’t want to be friends anymore. They didn’t take that out. They *did* make the conversation all about them, however, and complained to me that they felt like they had to cancel their Tinder date now and were just generally shitty about it. That hurt.

That was the last straw for me, and I decided then that I didn’t want to be friends. I explained to them why that hurt my feelings, that I would let them know when the biopsy results came back, but that otherwise I didn’t want to talk anymore. Their response then was only “ok I’m really sorry”.

Today, I got the results back. My cells are abnormal, but it’s mild enough that my doctor wants to hold off on doing a LEEP and is just going to monitor things. I told my now ex-friend this news, and, since I decided I was fully done with this friendship, explained to them that not only had they hurt me during our HPV convo, but that the song they played had also left me feeling hurt, confused, and manipulated. I apologized for not wanting to be friends, but made it clear that I was done.

Their response was to pull a “you can’t fire me, I quit!”, call me dramatic, and block me from all social media, including their band’s social media. Which really I can only laugh at at this point. 

Was I over dramatic about this? Should I have not told them about the HPV? I don’t feel like the asshole, but I do feel like shit lol. Dang."		1	0

c2y1jz	2019-06-20 16:19:23		AITA I want to become pescetarian and my parents don't let me do it, because of food culture and my health	"So, one day I told my parents that I would become pescetarian, they didn't really listen because they thought this was just another idea of mine. My reason for becoming pescetarian is that I feel disguisted and morally wrong while eating meat and just can't stand the thought of me eating meat after realizing what effect it has on the animals and how horrible it is for them. So, one day my mom made some soup and added rice as a side dish, and as stubborn as I am, I decided to only eat the rice and they started to get pretty passive-agressive, but not entirely agressive because we had guests. After that I just ate the vegetarian options in my mom's restaurant for two months and nothing really happened. Also somewhere in that time period I asked my mom if I could make my own portion of something that's not meat and eat it with, for example the rice she's cooking with some tofu or beans rather than steak and she aggressively refused.

&#x200B;

Then I went to my grandparents where thankfully they made fish and overall vegetarian foods in our food culture. Now the #2 reason for my mom not wanting me to become vegetarian (#1 is the fear of me not getting enough nutrients, which I do btw) is that our food culture is extremely omnivore. Literally, almost all meals have meat in them and that's why it causes complications and I'm having a moral dilemma of whether I am right or wrong because the animals suffer, but so does my family mentally because of my stubbornness toward not desiring to eat meat.

Now in my grandparents house on the day I was supposed to leave, there were a LOT of people from my family and they all literally started to force me to eat turkey. Not gonna lie, it was absolutely disguising to me and we had a debate about my pesceterianism and literally everyone was attacking me and it didn't feel nice, though they got me to eat chicken, even though I force myself to eat it. In the debate, my mom said that when I turn 18 (3.5 years from now) I can decide what I eat and now I am too young and ""need meat"" to be able to maintain my health and because the 18 year old me would know that eating meat is good, even though I just am 100% sure, with all my stubbornness that I won't eat any meat (except fish, yes it is meat, and yes, fish do feel pain but they don't feel fear when being presented to death, and in my opinion that's what counts, also my family would be even angrier if I didn't even eat fish)

&#x200B;

And yesterday, at dinner, my little sister didn't eat the food because it didn't have meat and was really stubborn about it and that hurt me mentally and got me an even worse moral dilemma and I feel really bad about my family, but am really disguisted by the meat.

&#x200B;

Am I an asshole, or is my whole family horrible, or is everyone that has anything to do with this mess trash?

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm 14 btw.

Edit 2: I thought fish don't feel pain, so I ate fish too, but  @Asshole Aficionado replied and actually told me that fish do feel pain. So I'm going to be avoiding fish as much as all the other meat."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2xw6x	2019-06-20 16:07:23	Green_Muffin	AITA for getting mad at my two best female friends for telling to leave my wife?	"So context, I've been friends with these two (separately, as they do hate each other) for years. They're my closest friends in the world and we all look out for each other.

We're very open, I've helped them through many bad relationships etc.

Now, it's not exactly a friend zone type relationship. They know I'm married. My wife is gorgeous and popular, and despite these two women being just as attractive, rich, popular. They're both very intimidated by my wife.

My wife doesn't mind I'm close with them for two main reasons. My wife and I have a very special type of sexual relationship, one that we know no one else can really fulfill or satisfy easily. Am I attracted to my female friends? Yes, but I know they'll never sexually satisfy me like my wife.

Ok so here's where the asshole question comes into play.

My wife is very strong minded, and independent. And will behave this way regardless of my feelings. Recently, she's been hanging out with a very attractive guy she works with. So much so that rumours are flying that they're sleeping together. Now I know she isn't but I told her out of respect for me, please try to distance yourself from him. He is crushing on her hard and she is allowing it, enjoying his attention.

That was the root cause of our argument. She doesn't flirt back with him, but I saw her texts to him on her phone. She doesn't ever tell him to stop. Example, he'll send her photos of himself nude, to which she'll tell him he looks great. Then he'll try to push for more, but she'll change the topic or say she isn't in the mood.

I guess that's borderline acceptable.

However, I've told my two female friends and they both insisted she crossed a line, that she is cheating and that I should leave her.

I've explained that, it is inappropriate but I don't think it's cheating and she has since tried to tell him he doesn't have a shot with her. But what I'm still mad at her for is that they're still hanging out after work, at lunch. And people are talking.

So last night both female friends told me I'm being weak, not a real man by accepting her behaviour, saying I need to leave her ASAP.

Their baragement of messages like this was to much and I ended up snapping at them out of anger.

They both tell me I'm being a stupid asshole and one even said, I deserve to be cheated on because I'm too weak.

It's a difficult time, I know they're trying to look after my interest, but this is my marriage and my wife who I still love. I cant just get up and leave over something so minor.

Am I the asshole for telling them to basically STFU and stop pressuring me?

Edit: the reason I've added that I'm not friend zoned by these two women is that they both try hard sometimes to flirt with me (which i never do). One of them has tried to kiss me when drunk twice. And I've heard from a friend of the other that she said if I weren't married I'd be the perfect guy for her. I'm sometimes skeptical of their rash advice."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c2xw2l	2019-06-20 16:07:05		WIBTA for calling CPS on my neighbours?	"So let me preface this by saying that in the past 4 months I have been stuck at home after a ruptured ACL - and have not been able to work in this time. As a result, I have been spending all my time watching the days go by - think Rear Window.

These past few months, I have noticed the behaviour of my neighbours towards their kids, more specifically the lack of attention they show them. For example, their kids, aged between 2-10 (guessing here but some of them look like they have only just learnt how to walk), are allowed to play in our communal gardens (I live in a flat complex), and quite often wander out in to the car park area where there is a fair bit of traffic. On numerous occasions, I have witnessed cars speeding down the road, and last week a cat was ran over by someone doing this. These kids are allowed by their parents to play in this car park, baring in mind the age of them, and I’m seriously concerned about their wellbeing, as they could quite easily end up seriously injured or worse.

Now this next point may be a cultural thing, and maybe a bit racist - but they are an Indian family in particular - who have around 7 kids. The flat complex I live in are at max, 2 bedrooms, which means that these kids must be crammed inside a tiny room, and this leaves me worried about their living conditions. Quite often, I see the kids walking around in old clothing, but their dad comes home in a brand new car, leaving me to wonder where this money is being prioritised.

There are countless other things that occur that are concerning (no shouting or violence), but I don’t know if I WIBTA to report this to CPS for investigation?

TL;DR - Neighbours allow young children to play in flat car park, and are housing 7 kids in at max a 2 bedroom flat"		1	0
c2xvvn	2019-06-20 16:06:40	denihlist	WIBTA if I tell my wife I want to kick her daughter out as soon as legally possible?	"My Step daughter was age 8 when I first got married to her mom.  She has had issues since I have met her and things are getting worse not better. She is diagnosed with ADHD, ODD, recently chronic depression.  She has a few time cut herself.  From the start of our relationship she has made it clear she hates me.  She looks at me as if I am a piece of shit on the wall and refuses to acknowledge my existence most of the time.  I say hello she ignores me.  I say goodbye she ignores me.  etc...  I have stopped trying to discipline her a few years ago and leave it to her mother.  I can not discipline someone who basically does everything possible to piss me off.  She has been in behavioral therapy for years and in the past 2 years has been seeing a psychiatrist as well.  She is on medication for ADHD, Depression . I suspect she may have a borderline personality disorder but so far her Shrink has not gone that far. Her behavior is rude, angry, moody, outburst, chronic lying, disrespectful, hateful, I could go on and on. She burps outloud, farts and generally acts in the most disgusting manner.  Of course we tell her that is not acceptable etc.. But it continues.  I dread eating at the dinner table because of how she acts out.  She has failed 9th grade and refuses to do her school work.  She is like this to everyone btw including her mother.  So I recently been thinking why should I continue to harbor a person like this if they refuse to meet me half way, or any part of the way for that matter.  She really is hard to deal with. Mom does try but it is to no avail and her father is not involved at all.  She is seriously circling the drain.

EDIT:I will respond here:  For all those who think I am kicking a 14 y/o out,  I am not.  She is 16 and repeating 9th grade.  As long as she is in school legally she can stay until 19.  I would keep her indefinitely if she is in school or college even.  But we are talking about someone who is putting Hitler on her phone screen saver and blaming her teachers for being ""bitches""  I do not see her going on to college if something does not change.

2.  I have burn out for sure.  For eight years I have provided my love and understanding to someone who is getting worse.  

3. She is in therapy and psychiatrist but your right something needs to change I feel like many of these Doctors are just going through the motions sometimes.  

4.  Some say they fear for her, Me too! I hate that she is so unhappy and going through this.  I do love her and I do show it to no avail.  I make sure that she is safe and fed and do what ever I can to help her but she refuses to speak to me or acknowledge me.  I can't force her to.  I do my duty as a father the best I can.

5. For those who said I have no business being a Father:  I may not but I have another daughter is is 13 from a previous marriage without all these challenges. She is A-B honor roll in advanced classes since she has been in school (same school). She is helpful and courtious and pleasant to be around.  Mental health issues are indeed disabling.  I offer my love to both of them and I do what I can, I am understanding a I am patient and fair.  I am good with kids but I also know I am failing her and it crushes me.  My step daughter at times can be violent, thats why she in now seeing a new psychiatrist.  

6. For those who say I should leave.  I can not bring myself to do that even though I think sometimes that would be best.  I would be abandoning my wife who is making minimum wage and in college.  They depend on me and I think I'd really be the Ass hole if I divorced her cuz I couldnt hack it anymore.  But I sometime think about it for my own selfish sanity. My wife was being abused by her last husband which is why she left him.  My step daughter was 8,  I took them both in and thought things will get better she just needs love and  security.  8 years later it is getting worse.  Her dad sees her very very infrequently and she adores him.  I encourage that btw.  I sometime think he should step up and try and raise her.  But he is not interested in even seeing her on a regular basis and since my wife divorced him he refuses to speak to her even today.  Which Im sure adds to her feeling of abandonment and insecurity.

9.  I found out that my step daughter suffered a horrible head injury as a infant,  I think this may be the cause of some of this mental illness, that coupled with her natural father being rarely home when she was a baby due to work and mom working she was cast into a day care as a baby.  I think she is a perfect storm for mental illness and it sucks.  Mom did her best but the end result is what we are dealing with and now she is 8 years older under my roof and I have apparently failed her too...BUT am trying to turn the corner!  
10.  I do try and discipline her for those who think I did not.  I tried positive re-enforcement because taking away things is not the answer with someone who would end up permanently without a phone , computer, ipad due to being in capable of being good for even a hour.  I also tried the merit system with her that rewards her good behavior with a treat or outing or something she likes.  It is a work in progress but the saga continues. I do have some years to try and get her the skills I know she needs to survive.
A education, the ability to hopefully function in society.  When I said she is circling the drain it does not mean I have flushed her down.  It means I can see ruin and disaster ahead.  Drugs, pregnancy, homelessness, suicide, take your pick.  Yes a asshole thing to say but It is inevitable if things do not change."	Asshole	0	0

His fiance is great and he deserves it. I am one of the groomsmen for the event and its at a venue about 3 hours away from me. This is where the problem starts - He told me our rental tux would cost about 115$ but he was mistaken and they cost 250ish. Then the hotel room costs like 175 a night. So now I have to pay 250+175+175+gas because I have to be there for 2 nights. That is over 600$ just to go to the wedding and I am not THAT upset about it but that 600$ has seriously set me back. In fact, it has set me back so far that I am struggling to put food on my table this month and have basically been starving myself so my kid can eat. So because he decided to have a wedding that forces all the people in the wedding party to pay 600$ just to go I unhappily decided to not get him anything. I would love to get him something but I just legit can't afford it and have honestly been close to saying I just can't go because I can't afford it.

Am I the asshole? I brought up to him when I found out the rental was 250 dollars that this was a very difficult thing for me to afford. It was already hard to afford when I thought it was just 115 but with the price more than doubling I have been put in this spot where I don't want to upset my best friend but at the same time I am kind of out of money and have a little girl I have to support.

I recently started hosting people on Couchsurfing, and I've been thinking about offering breakfast as a nice gesture. I normally cook my breakfast every morning, and it's usually bacon and eggs.

I don't feel like cooking for additional people however, and I don't feel like sharing my bacon and eggs because I'll then have to go out and buy more(I only do groceries once per week).

&#x200B;

I'm thinking of keeping some boxes of cereal around as well as some milk, to offer this to surfers instead. Will this be considered rude or inconsiderate?

So a year ago a guy on one of my Social media asked if I wanted to make a mini web comic with him, and while I was up for it life got in the way and things fell through. But we recently got back in contact and I suggested ""Finally doing that collab now Im more free"".

Now I was working off the mindset it would work similar to a commission but Im worried because Ive said ""Collab"" that it seemed like Im doing it for free, and he hasnt asked about money yet. Im still new to commissions but I know the basic advice of always getting payed for what you make and not undervaluing yourself, but Im not sure Ive went about it the right way here.

The collaboration is basically me drawing up a web comic for a story of his, and he has provided me with some example scripts I can use or work on something new with him. I dont want to leave bringing up money any longer than I have to. Commission info is on my social media if that makes a difference at all.

&#x200B;

Update: So I mentioned to him about a paypal and being willing to work on negotiating the price a little, and he said hes sorry but he thought it was a collaboration and cant commission me because ""It wouldnt be fair to those who have worked on the series"", which confused me a little but Im not gonna worry or delve too much into that just now.

c2xrv8	2019-06-20 15:58:16	SeveralAnt71	AITA for being upset at not being invited to join in on my BF's hobby?	" 

BF and I are having a fight. Please weigh in. The issue itself is rather petty, although the feelings behind it are not. He’s accusing me of being controlling and trying to take away his freedom. I feel pretty badly about that. 

&#x200B;

Backdrop: We have a hobby X that we like to do together. Boyfriend sometimes does Hobby X alone, but more often than alone or with me, he does Hobby X with his friends. I’ve been suggesting we do Hobby X for about 2 weeks now, because it’s been a while since we’ve had a chance to go together, or for me to go with him when he goes with his friends (I would add that this is because I’m either busy or not invited). Boyfriend has a busy schedule with other hobbies many days of the week. Tuesday, we were both free and the weather was great, so I suggested we do Hobby X. He didn’t want to and we ended up doing a bunch of mundane chores/tasks instead (which is a pattern for how we spend our time together in many ways). 

&#x200B;

Cue yesterday. I had a nebulous plan to go hang out with a couple of friends to get ice-cream. I made the plan because he normally has Hobby Y on Wednesdays. Turns out he doesn’t have a game for Hobby Y this week, but regardless, I hadn’t heard anything about ice cream for a few days. In the morning, I had texted with BF who asked me about whether I was still going to hang out with friends or not. I said I didn’t know but that I didn’t expect anything to materialize and that I would let him know when/if I knew. I told him “don’t worry about planning around me.”  Around 4 p.m., I hear from friends and the plan for ice-cream is confirmed. I text BF immediately after, told him the time, and told him he could come if he wants. 

&#x200B;

He tells me he’s not going to come because he’s going to go do Hobby X. I don’t know when he made this plan but he said it was something that just happened “obviously.” I said that was fine but clarified that I would have wanted to go and that I wished he would’ve told me because I wouldn’t have said yes to ice cream if I had the option of going to do Hobby X … since I’ve been wanting to go for a while.

&#x200B;

Things escalated to an argument because I pressed the issue with him later because my feelings were hurt. I explained that I was upset because I’ve been pressing to do Hobby X lately and it felt crappy that he made a plan to go do Hobby X without asking me if I wanted to go, especially since I had just wanted to go the day before. Am I being crazy in expecting that he would ask me if I wanted to go when he made the plan? Yes, of course, I’m not entitled to be asked to do every activity with him, but I just thought this was really insensitive. He keeps saying  that I’m being controlling and trying to take away his freedom. I never told him he couldn’t do what he wanted, I’m just asking for him to be more considerate. He’s blaming me really hard for feeling hurt and telling me that I’m nagging.

c2xqyx	2019-06-20 15:56:08	sunshine__boi	AITA for being sick and having to leave work early?	"So I work as a barista at a local coffeehouse that's literally the size of a mouse-hole. I only work the night shift ((6pm to midnight)) and the other day I felt so sick during my shift that I had to leave early. I ask my coworker if shes ok with my going or if she'd like me to stay. At this point I've already contacted someone to cover the rest of the shift ((I only ended up working for an hour)) so she tells me to go. 

I have my best friend come pick me up and by then I couldn't move. My head hurt so bad that I physically couldn't move my own body. Him and my mom had to remove me from the car then ""babysit"" for the rest of the night because they were afraid I'd accidentally hurt myself. 

Sometime during the night my mom forces food down my throat and orders me to sit down. I start to feel better and not like I need an ER asap when I get a text. It's from the girl who agreed to cover me. 

""You left early, you should have waited till I was here. I don't care that (coworker) said you could leave! You also left a mess and didn't brew coffee.

Also the right thing to do is to leave your tips for the person covering or (coworker) because she was here alone for an hour"" 

((These are direct, I copy pasted them and removed names, that's all))

Now it was only seven dollars so it wasn't like I was swimming in cash and this wasn't the policy we had. You get the tips for what you worked, point blank period. 

However the next day out 'manager' texts me to come in. ((there's quotes around manager bc shes not technically out manager and shes also a shit one)) So I do. She sits me down and tells me that I'm getting a write up. Because apparently while I was sick out of my mind at work a customer thought i was being rude to her and i left my coworker alone. 

So AITA for leaving my coworker alone? I do feel bad about it, because I normally wouldn't do that. But was I really just supposed to sit in the back room about to faint and wait till the other person showed up?? Because in the end it wasnt worth a write up."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So we're a group of 3 best friends me S and J, S is visiting from college. I worked all day and hadn't eaten, S picks me up around 4 and I say I'm hungry we should get something to eat,S says it's rudeto not wait for J to get off of work at 6 to eat. I agree Even though I'm starving and have to wait till almost 7 for J t arrive. We say we're t a bar but to meet us at the local card shop, to kill Time were playing cards in the car. J misunderstand and drives to the bar, at this point it almost 7 an he's 20 minutes away, I tell S dude I'm starving and Theresa McDonald's right next to us, he says I can wait and it would be rude not too. J meets us at the wrong card place and is now almost 30 minutes away, after working and not eating I say dude I can't wait any longer, S says to keep waiting it would be rude. He finally gets there and we get food and they both tell me ""this is how it should be, you wait so we can all eat together"" and that it's rude of people to not wait. Fast forwards next week, S picks up J to come to my house as he is on the way, I hadn't eaten yet as I was told countless times they see it as a big deal to not eat together when you hangout with people. I get in the car and see that they already ate, being hangry I was very upset, not so much of the not eating but the obvious favoritism that they expect me to wait but when it's the other way around its fuck me. S offers me his old and cold half eaten burger bundled up in a bag, and thinks that that makes up for the rude hypocricy. Then on the way to where we were going, I pointed out every drive thru we passed asking to get something quick as I still haven't gotten to get food. They just giggled and refused to stop anywhere. It's not a big deal but it does offend me that there is obvious favoritism, and there justification is ""we had 20 minutes to spare so that was perfect time to eat"" when I had to wait much longer. And refusing to stop so I can grab something ? S sees how it was rude but still tries to justify it, J doesnt give a shit and refuses to acknowledge or apologize. Aita for being upset ?"

6 months ago, my dad and I were supposed to go to a comedy show together. It's a very popular comedian that I suspect might be the last tour they do. I was excited to go because he had bought us meet and greet tickets and front row seats. Best dad ever, right? 

Well I got this job that had me working on the night we were supposed to go. It was a temp job and I'm not there anymore but I had to work during the time the show was going on. I told him this a week in advance and was bummed I couldn't go. 

He invited his longtime friend and they had a blast. I had one simple request for my dad since I couldn't go.

""Can you take a video of you and him when you meet him and just have him personalize it for me?""

He goes and the next morning he said he got the video. It's a video personalized towards my brother and never mentions me. Saying how proud my dad is and how much he loves him. Normally I wouldn't have care, but it's been apparent that he prefers my brother over me throughout my life.

I felt and still feel hurt that even my small request was done but wasn't for me. I put up a wall towards him for a while after that and still think about it.

c2xpbr	2019-06-20 15:52:18		AITA for holding a grudge against my former best friend?	"We work for the same company, did the same job, just different focus. EX: I quality checked pens & she quality checked pencils.

We started in the company at the same time 10 years ago. We did the same job for 3 years and then I moved to an auditor position.

She wanted to be in my department, but the director never chose her. For years, I encouraged & supported her desire to move up. I also spoke about how once my supervisor left, I would apply for her job because I loved what I did so much. She always listened & supported me.

4 years later, I’m still in my auditing position & my department opens a new area of focus that will need auditors. She got the job & began working alongside me. A few months later, she was promoted to supervisor of that area.

I’d been there 5 years & felt it should have been posted internally first, so I vented my frustration to her; she agreed that it should’ve been open to everyone in the department. She apologized & said she understood how I felt, considering I had been there so long & hadn’t been promoted.

Months pass, the supervisor of MY area of focus decided to step down. I told my friend how I wanted the job, no one else from my department wanted it, & had been told several times by my director that I’d be great at the job. She knew how much I wanted it and couldn’t wait to apply.

Then, she claims that our director asked her if she would take the supervisor position for my area. She had no experience in my area. I told her it was fucked up. She agreed & said she didn’t want to do it. She reassured me several times that she didn’t want to do it, she knew it was wrong, etc. Of course, next thing I know, we’re called into a meeting wherein the director announces that my friend is our new supervisor. She had told me < 24 hours prior that she didn’t know what was happening, but she had told the director she didn’t want it.

I was pissed. I told her it was fucked, & asked why she didn’t stand up for me. What kind of friend doesn’t say, “I care about my friendship too much to ruin it over a lateral move.” But she didn’t. She just agreed, & lied to me about it. I told her I wouldn’t work in the department anymore if she did this, & she just said “well, you have to do what you have to do.” I found another position. But I don’t love it. Not like I loved auditing.

She never apologized or acknowledged that was she did was wrong. She unfriended & blocked me. This was 1.5 years ago. Last week she unblocked me & started commenting on old posts that I had her tagged in saying “miss you” “miss these days” etc. I am still so hurt by what happened that I haven’t responded. Friends are telling me this is her way of apologizing, & I should respond. She ruined a 15 year friendship because she happily accepted a job she knew I wanted for years without any protest or sticking up for me at all. I think the relationship was damaged irreparably.

So friend called me yesterday and asked if i could help her with painting the walls in her living room as a present for her parents. I have helped her before with renovating her little sisters room which was a LOT of work and i was fine with that but back then i had a lot of time on my hands. 

Painting the wall will probably take up less time but this is my current situation. I am team captain of something i do which means i have to prepare trainings, and trust me that takes a lot of time. Then i have a private project with music that i really want to finish. And on top of that from time to time i work as a designer. I basically get an order and do a design and i just got an order which will also take up multiple hours. And since thats not enough already i have a sleeping disorder where i sometime lie awake for multiple hours and fall asleep very late (sometime at like 6am and later).

So i pretty much dont have 4+h to spare at least for the next few days. But i was still willing to take time. I told her on the phone that i dont want to help (and ye those were my honest words) but ill do it anyway. We didnt agree on any time though so i thought ill just squeeze it in some time after eating lunch and call her then.

What happened now though was that my body was like ""nah bro there is no sleep for you"" and i couldnt fall asleep until 10am so i actually used that time to finish some of the work to give me a some extra time for later. At 12am boyfriend shows up at my place and wakes me up. I of course am completely exhausted, especially since its crazy hot in my room and sleeping is rather uncomfortable. So i tell him im sorry but i wont be able to help painting. He leaves and i keep sleeping. I wake up at 3pm and my first thought is ""hey its not that late, i could still help them painting"" so i go to get my phone and see a text from friend that goes somewhat like this:

I have to quickly clarify. Something like this has happened before but from both sides. From mine probably a bit more but at least i am always the one to apologize. I never heared something like ""i'm sorry"" when i was copped out on.

*I wanted to thank you again because its not like it happens a lot that you hurt me* (sarcasm btw)*. But after a few times someone as stupid as me learns as well. I wont ask for help again. Do what you want. At least you now have one less problem. Good luck with everything.*

"I hate this day cause people think that they must do smth for me and it will be rude if they will not call or meet with me. At this day I wish that peoples who know me, forget about my bd and leave me alone. 
  For example : At this day I'm going to go to IMAX, take a VERY-VERY BIG popcorn and watch ""SM:Far From Home"". After that, back home and play some games or read books.That's all. And I want it do ALONE!
  I don't want party or another surprises. I don't want congratulations and presents.
  But for the years my wife and my friends don't understand that.All the time when they start discuss with me ""what I want"", they think that I am sad and they try to make me happy, but it is exactly what I don't want, and all this thing make me sad. All the time I have to put on a smile and celebrate with them.

She has a boyfriend and is sexually active (her mother knows this and got her on birth control). About a week ago she mentioned that she should get a new prescription for her bc pills but hasn't gotten around to it yet. The following conversation went something like this :

Me: You aren't having sex with no bc, are you? 

Friend: Yes, i just have him pull out before cumming...

Me: that's not safe, why would you be reckless like that? 

Friend: it'll be fine, most of my friends do it that way and have never gotten pregnant..

I dropped the subject but felt compelled to tell her mother about her risky sex habits.
My friend knew that i was the one to tell her mom and got quite mad and told me to stop judging her.

I‘m F20 and already moved out from my parents home because of university. My relationship with my parents wasn‘t always the best because I did lie about some stuff when I was younger, but as I got older I learned to be more honest and our relationship is pretty good. But there is one thing that still bothers me when I‘m visiting my parents - my mom snooping around or looking through my stuff when I‘m not there. It could be a jacket, mostly it‘s my bag. She always claims that theres nothing wrong with that, she is just cleaning etc. Which pisses me off. Every time she did it I just let it go because she always said the same thing „I only want to help!“ 

The thing is though, I started smoking when I was younger and still do from time to time. They found a few lighters in my bag and angrily asked me if I smoked. I said „yes, i‘ve tried it, but I have stopped.“ Which I did eventually, but when I moved out I was smoking again. I just felt free and did it because I liked it from time to time. Now, a while back I went home to visit my parents and again...my mom was looking through my stuff. Because I just had enough of this bullshit I told her „Mom, please, can you  STOP looking through my bags? Its mine and its none of your business!“My mom looked hurt and felt really attacked, so then I started feeling bad. But I still don‘t want to apologize, even though she wants it.

c2xg7h	2019-06-20 15:31:37	The_ATH1337	AITA for yelling at my neighbor for having obnoxiously loud sex?	"I've recently moved to a new neighborhood full of townhouses that have their windows facing each other. Summer is nearly here and I don't have AC (almost nobody does in my area). So, people keep their windows open to catch the breeze when possible.

It's 11:30 PM and I'm laying in bed with the fan on and windows open. I'm turning the lights out to go to bed when I hear her. This lady sounds like she's that [girl leaving a voicemail to her boyfriend, crying like a whale](https://youtu.be/966I5NCjnsg?t=11), mixed with an annoying, fake moan of a porn-star. At first I could ignore it, but whatever she had her partner doing to her, or she to herself, lasted beyond 5 minutes. What started as a faint and realistic lovemaking slowly escalated to a sexorcism.

Now, this wasn't the first time it's happened. I've closed my window the previous 6 or so times to minimize the sound, but it still managed to prevent me from sleeping or going back to sleep. But this time, was louder than ever. I felt as if i were in the room, with her / them against my will. Closing the window and cranking the fan wasn't going to help.

So, I got out of bed and went to the window. I'm not sure which of the units to my left she is, so I just shout in their general direction, between moans, ""Your windows are open and everyone can hear you!"" Time moved more slowly after saying that. I reveled in my courage to fight back against Satan's sex-capade. Adrenaline pumped through me, excited as I had finally ridden the neighborhood of it's sex deviant... or had I?

In real time, she didn't miss a beat and responded with an even louder, more carnal moan of pleasure. I was now an accessory to the crime, giving her an audience, which she wanted all along. I was in denial, convinced she clearly hadn't heard me, so I needed to be louder. I shouted again, as loud as I could, ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!""

I didn't think it could get worse, but it did. I had now invited her to let the neighboring streets know of her damnation. If I hadn't known of her habits I'd think a woman was getting killed via penetration. It was beyond artificial now, her screams were a definite response to my disapproval. I didn't know what else to do, so I slammed my window shut, cranked the fan, and stayed up past 2 due to the overwhelming rage educed adrenaline rush.

I'm all for someone having a good time. Sex is one of, if not the best thing on earth. I don't disapprove of her enjoying herself, I just don't want to be involved during it. If closing my windows and turning on the fan completely blocked it out, there wouldn't be an issue. But, it's confirmed she wants us to hear her. She has now since gone about enjoying herself every night, multiple times a night, as loud as the time before. I've unleashed her inner demons and damned the neighborhood.

tl'dr : I yelled at my neighbor for moaning artificially loud during sex and now she is doing it louder and more frequently.

So, I am friends with someone who I met on DeviantArt (yes that site) and our friendship grew on discord. For now I'll call him Caleb. He was a bit of an asshole himself but that kind of asshole that teases you rather than straight up does stuff that hurts you. The likeable asshole. Or so I thought.

One day me and one Caleb's friends were chatting through Discord. Then, Caleb asks if I wanted to see something NSFW. I said no but as you might have already guessed, he sends it anyway which happens to be NSFW images of cartoon characters. I get upset about it. Caleb and his friend then have the audacity to say that ""She needs to see Robot Chicken."" Like, MAYBE THERE IS A REASON WHY I HAVEN'T SEEN IT?

After a day or two (i don't entirely remember how long but it's not important) I tell a moderator of the discord we were in what he has done. The moderator lets him off with a warning which is fair. Caleb then comes to me asking for forgiveness. I forgive him since this is the only time he's done it. But from that moment on, whenever we voicechatted I found myself silently crying for no reason at all (or at least I think).

c2xffn	2019-06-20 15:29:51	InkTaleKaylee1229	AITA for blocking a girl who was manipulated by	"A while ago I was friends with a girl (G), she was nice but petty at times.
I was helping someone because they felt bad for their actions (being a bit clingy causing them and G to break up). I asked G to look at a little paragraph essentially saying 'Sorry for what I did, can we be friends?', but G refused to be their friend (because she was 'uncomfortable around them'), but accepted their apology. This was a month after the break up.

Later on the timeline,G and I wasn't on the best terms with two girls (A and F), they didn't want to explicitly say what was wrong to my face so I just didnt bother with them. G wanted to be friends with A and F again, which I planned on asking what was wrong, to be their friends again, but I wanted to think over that choice, to be sure it was the right thing.
Before I did, G was bffs with them again, so at lunch I am talking to B (A good friend that is amune to all forms of their asshole methods) ans I over hear this discussion between G,A and F

G: Does your mom still like me after that situation?
A: Yeah, dont worry!
F: Yeah my mom still likes you. Did you guys tell you moms? (Clearly talking about me)
They all say 'yeah she gave me some good advice' or very similar responses

That pissed me off a good amount.
Skip a week ahead, we got back from a field trip and I was waitint to tell a teacher my ride was here. Then I hear my name called, A's older sister flipped me off from the window. I was genuinly confused so I laughed it off and went to my dads car, them proceded to breakdown in a sobbing mess. I blocked A, F and G. 
After me helping someone, seeing how to bridge a gap, which was way to wide previously, being a good friend to someone, was it too much to expect G did the same?

c2xb0f	2019-06-20 15:19:42	Go_Puck_Yourself-	AITA for not wanting to look after my niece so much?	"Basically my 3 year old niece is at my house a shit ton, since my sister works a lot and my mum is the only one she can rely on to babysit. I’d say she’s here all day maybe 2 or 3 days of the week. Sometimes my sister kind of takes advantage of the fact my mum wont say no to looking after her and lets her babysit even when it doesn’t suit her and she has other plans.  I love my niece, she’s hilarious, but I’ve never been very good with kids and looking after her is a little out my comfort zone sometimes. I’m also just really lazy if truth be told (I think it has to do with a bit of depression of I’m being honest, some days simple shit like working up to going for a shower can take me hours of laying in my bed trying to psyche myself up).

The days when my niece is here always seem to be days I’m off work or college and wanting to just relax and unwind, but instead I spend a large portion of my day playing with my niece. Now, I don’t mind this at all: a little hour or so of playing with her doesn’t bother me, and I never see it as a chore. But as she’s growing up she wants to play with me more and more, my parents are getting older and don’t have the energy to chase a 3 year old around for half the week, and so a lot of the time if she’s at my house I spend a good 2 or 3 hours keeping her satisfied. I can feel myself getting impatient with my niece sometimes when I’m playing with her cause I really just want to go relax. This scares me; I don’t want her growing up thinking I have no time for her.

It’s like my parents are too tired to look after her, but too scared to say no to my sister, so any time my niece is here she always wants to play with me and I feel incredibly guilty for saying no, so I’m forced to while my parents kind of relax. I’ve started telling my parents she’s not my responsibility, that I enjoy playing with her but it’s their choice to look after her so much, and I’d like to be able to relax a little more while she’s here. Basically any time I venture out my room I’ll be stuck playing with her for half an hour until I find a way out, which makes me feel bad for being so desperate to get out of bonding with my niece. They tell me I shouldn’t see looking after my niece as a chore (which I understand, but they’re doing the same by forcing me to play with her essentially and taking a step back), and kind of guilt trip me about it all, but honestly it really does make me feel like a guilty, shitty person for not spending more time out my week looking after this little girl. Sure, she’s a handful, and hyper as fuck, and I used to hate little kids, but I really do make an exception for this little girl, and try to be as caring and patient and kind with her as I can, but I really value my own space and downtime and it feels like I’m having to spend more time than I should keeping her occupied.

c2xavu	2019-06-20 15:19:24		AITA for joking about a hot doctor?	"A few months back I (40M) had this mole sprout up out of nowhere on the side of my noggin.  I thought I should get it checked out to make sure it’s nothing to worry about.

I’d never been to a dermatologist before, but my wife (36F) has.  She ultimately gave me her doctor as a referral, but was reluctant to do so at first.  The reason is because the doctor is female and, in her words, “incredibly hot”.  She said the doctor would do a full body exam on me since I was a first-time patient.  I guess she didn’t relish the thought of that happening too much.  I assured her everything would be fine and booked an appointment.

Turns out the doctor was indeed 10/10 hot as foretold, but also very professional.  She looked it over, confirmed it was benign, then proceeded to freeze it with nitrogen oxide.  That was it.  The whole visit took about 5 minutes and there was no full body exam.

My wife emailed me later in the day asking how it went.  Recalling her insecurity I replied, “Fine.  She told me she had never seen one that big before and I asked if we could just please focus on the mole.”  I didn’t get a reply back, so I suspected this might not have gone over too well.

When I got home, my wife told me that when she read my email she had people in her office.  They noticed her blushing heavily and asked her what was up.  She tried to deflect, but they were persistent.  She eventually had to fess up with the backstory and our email exchange.  Ribald laughter ensued with much ribbing at my wife’s expense for the duration of the day.

c2xaeu	2019-06-20 15:18:20	ProvinceBee33	AITA for asking that our child have my second name?	"I'm 27F and my boyfriend is 32M. 
He is from a large family and has 5 siblings. However I am an only child, both of my parents died when I was little and I am the only person remaining with my second name. 

I'm 6 months pregnant. 

I've always said I want to keep my second name and pass it onto any children I had and the boyfriend was always chilled about this. 

Then, I found out I was having a boy. Not sure why but bf was convinced we'd have a girl. As soon as we got the gender confirmed, he told me couldn't wait to have a boy and to pass his surname on. I was confused and said we'd agreed to keep mine. He said it's not right for a young boy to have his mother's surname if the dad is in the picture - ""it's tradition"".
I told him that he has neices and nephews with his surname, cousins, brothers and sisters, too. 
I told him why I wanted to keep my dad's surname, as when I'm gone, there's be none left. Bf point blank refused and said he's not gonna introduce ""his boy"" with a different surname as it would be weird. 

We've reached a point where we cannot agree. I have told him point blank that I'm gonna be using my surname and he says I'm acting like a bitch and an asshole and being unreasonable/too sensitive. 

His family all agree with him that a boy should have his father's name. We are not traditional by any means so I'm shocked at how insistent he is to maintain such an old fashioned tradition. I suggested double barrelling the name or using my bf name as a middle name, he said no.

c2x59a	2019-06-20 15:06:29	QueenMaja	AITA for calling the police on my (20F) roommate (32M)?	"Keep in mind while reading that I've had a lot of previous clashes with my roommates regarding noise issues. Our leasing contract also states that parties are not permitted on the property.

&#x200B;

I currently live in a relatively small semi-terraced apartment and lease alone for a room and a shared house. I lease the biggest room in the house and am situated at the front of the property on the first floor. This means that I hear almost everything from the road outside, the people walking past and all that goes on downstairs.

&#x200B;

Recently I've been struggling with a lot of health issues that both my roommates are aware of. I have told them that I don't care what they do on weekends, but to keep it down on weekdays. Cue last Thursday and one of my roommates had invited me out to a party our previous roommate was hosting. I declined.

&#x200B;

I come home from work and start experiencing really bad nausea, stomach pain and heartburn so I decide to lay down in bed and try to get some sleep. I didn't have work on Friday morning but I had an appointment scheduled at 10:30 in the city that I had to attend.

&#x200B;

Cut to around 12am and I hear 15 people get out of a car and hear our front door open. About 10 minutes later music is blaring in our living room accompanied by 15 adults screaming and making an inappropriate amount of noise. Please also keep in mind that our neighbours are regular families and have children around 5-8 years old.

&#x200B;

I text my roommate that what he's doing isn't cool and to please get the people to leave our apartment. A few minutes later my roommate is at my door. We talked back and forth, I was in an extreme amount of discomfort and just wanted to sleep and asked him to get them to leave. He told me that he couldn't do that to which I replied that if he didn't I would call the police and make them leave. He laughed in my face and left to go to his room on the second floor (third floor).

&#x200B;

20 minutes later the party is still going. I go downstairs to try to get people to understand that I need to sleep but I get completely ignored.

&#x200B;

I decided to head back upstairs to my bedroom and called the police on the non-emergency line. I inform them about the party and I express my discomfort and inability to sleep when I have things to do in the morning as well as letting them know that there are families living next door with children. I waited for them to show up.

&#x200B;

The police arrive and essentially didn't really do anything. They informed me that since I was only renting the apartment and the party was hosted by another tenant that they couldn't make anybody leave. They tried to come to a compromise and insisted to the party-goers that they had to reduce the noise level. The police then left and that was that.

&#x200B;

Cut forward after they left and I have 5 people call me every name under the sun for calling the police on them, even though all I did was make good on what I said I would do.

c2x2v8	2019-06-20 15:01:10	thecallofthewee	AITA for bumping into someone and not apologizing?	"This happened yesterday. I was walking with my girlfriend and two women were approaching us on the same sidewalk. There was a bottleneck in the sidewalk caused by some bushes on one side and a large tree on the other side (the walkable width of the sidewalk reduced significantly). 

As both parties are approaching this bottleneck, my girlfriend and I walk single file to allow space for the others; they do the same. Both groups walk through the bottleneck at the same time, and as I'm walking through I notice that the leading woman on the other side is not giving us any space. She's walking straight in the middle of the sidewalk and she's not giving my girlfriend, who's in front of me, enough space to walk. She's also making no attempt to be share the sidewalk as she's walking straight forward and not orientating her body to give more space.

This causes my girlfriend to walk very close to the tree -one foot on the dirt one foot on pavement- and partially crouched(to avoid the tree). When the woman was about to pass me, I positioned myself where I had just enough space to walk on the pavement and I continued walking. I gave her ample space to walk on the other end.

Since our bodies overlapped, we bumped into each other. I come from a big city, so I'm used to trying to teaching myself to allow myself enough room to walk instead of swerving and leaning to avoid other people. As a result, we hit each other pretty hard. I kept walking - my body was pretty much unphased(unfazed?). However, she absorbed my blow and her body recoiled quite a bit.

This resulted in a large argument, in which the other woman (who was the first woman's daughter) threatened to ""fuck me up"" and made some racial remarks at me. I kept trying to explain my rationale to them, but I am quite introverted and they were both very verbally aggressive.

The thing that bothers me is that they kept repeating to me that I should say ""excuse me"" and that I should ""watch where I'm going"". I did not and refused to do so. They were also very rude to my girlfriend, who had nothing to do with it. (I acknowledge that none of this is relevant to the question at hand).

My opinion is that it takes two people to make a collision like that - both not looking where they are going. I willingly hit her and she willingly hit me. I think maybe I should have apologized and handled it better, but it bothers me that they were putting all of the blame on me. I accept half of the blame. But the way I see it, she is just as much to blame as I am. If I went back in time, I would have done the same thing. I'd prefer to have a collision where I hit someone rather than conform to another person's lack of consideration. I really don't like people walking over me.

My dad started yelling about how I was lazy and how I thought I was smarter than him and my mother. I told him that not how I felt and I went to finish my eggs.

My dad kept pushing and telling me that I should have put away dishes that were over the dishwasher. I said that the dishes were my brother's responsibility and I shouldn't have to put them away. He told me that dishes are my job as of now, which made me start yelling back. I put a few forks away and slammed the drawer. He took my phone and I told him to go ahead and make his own eggs. He told me again that I am lazy and that I should help more around the house. I said that he's not the one who wakes up before 6 to go to practice. He said he has to wake up for work and I responded that he was on vacation.

"I am a new DM (<10 sessions) and I run a homebrew game with two friends and my brother. Another friend, who I will call V, has said they don't want to play, but want to be a spectator of my dnd sessions. I told them they could for the second or third session.

I don't know if it's normal, but I always end up mentally exhausted and stressed at the end of a session, no matter how well it went. (I assume that will fade with time, but eh) However, when V shows up to my session, we don't get started for a full hour. During the recap, they interrupt with an instagram post they found(?) and then they continuously are either on their phone or saying something, regardless of what's going on. The story and actual gameplay crawls to a snail's pace.

My players don't seem to mind V coming and doing this, but it thuroughly stresses me out when I can't finish my dialogue or thought. My players don't appear to be bothered at all. The mood is a lot more light-hearted when they are there, but the players are more into the game when V is not present.

She knew for awhile that I was going to move in with her when I turned 18 after high school but I ended up coming for my last year of high school instead. I've been trying to be super understanding and I get that she's old. I've told her over and over again that if she needs help to let me know because I'm more than willing to get that stuff done so I can have a room. But she refuses to let me do anything up there because ""I don't know where stuff is supposed to go"" but its honestly just a bunch of shit that she doesn't even use. I've been getting really frustrated because I've lived here for almost a year and the room looks like its barely been touched. I'm at the point where I just want to bring everything that's up there downstairs and then maybe she'll actually try to get it done. I know that she doesn't owe me anything and I really respect the fact that she does so much for me but I'm getting sick of having to sleep on the couch when there's a bed waiting for me upstairs.

c2wy7q	2019-06-20 14:50:17	chuy1530	AITA for not changing/bathing my wife’s friend’s kid?	"My wife has a friend who I don’t like at all and she’s starting to get sick of as well. They used to have a very codependent relationship which my wife has grown out of now but the friend still tries to cling on to. The friend has a 3 and 1 year old sons, and we have 1 and 3 year old daughters. The friend asks my wife to babysit all the time (for free) and my wife usually says no but every couple weeks her friend’s sob story will be especially sobby (usually another babysitter quit because she rarely pays them on time) and we will end up watching them for a few hours. I do not approve of how the friend parents so she is 100% never allowed to watch our kids, so we can’t like swap babysitting nights.

My wife and I split parenting and house responsibilities really well, and I do a lot of the kids bathing/changing/feeding/etc. But I do not want to do that for the friend’s kids. I don’t really want them here to begin with, and I think my wife is being taken advantage of for saying yes and that any additional stress that causes her should just motivate her to stop agreeing to watch her kids since we aren’t getting any benefit from it anyway. 

I’ll play with the kids, hold them, even feed them, but I draw the line at changing or bathing them. I just do not want to have to do that with somebody else’s kids. I feel like it isn’t my responsibility at all, and I’m not the one agreeing to watch them so my wife should be the one to do it.

She got a little frustrated at me the other night because I wouldn’t give them baths after I gave our kids baths, and I told her pretty much what I said above. I didn’t think it was my responsibility to do that kind of thing for someone else’s kids, and if she’s stressed out about it she shouldn’t keep agreeing to watch them, especially since we get nothing in return. We didn’t get in a fight over it but she gave me the disappointed look which is worse.

So, AITA here?

Edit: adding more details from questions.

We watch them usually about 4 hours, and the times I’m talking about are in the evening. She watches them sometimes while I’m at work but since I’m not there I don’t care. When I say change them I’m talking about diapers (yes the three year old wears pull ups, although he’s basically out of them now finally.) This is the main thing because it comes up pretty much every time they come over, although she’s never really pushed me over my refusal to do it (she does it so they aren’t sitting around in a dirty diaper.)

We don’t bathe then every time they come over but sometimes my wife wants to because they make a mess all over themselves with food or... well I don’t know what else motivates her to do it, other than wanting to make her friend’s night easier, even though the friend never really seems to have the same concern for her. Maybe 1 out of 4 times they are over she wants to bathe them. This last time was because they had smeared Mac and cheese all over themselves.

Also I wouldn’t let them sit in a dirty diaper if the only option was me changing them. If for some reason my wife had to step out and I was the only one there I would change it. The kids aren’t suffering at all in our house."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2wxlf	2019-06-20 14:48:58	frankgrimesaccount	AITA for asking why I'm never invited?	"My SO has 2 sisters, one older by a lot (early 40s) and one closer to my age (late 20s). I invited them both to my girls night bday dinner and drinks with my sister, a couple of girlfriends, and a classmate.

The older sister, we'll call her Ann, stayed for dinner, brought her friends, and then left after dinner. The younger sister, we'll call her Jane, stayed for drinks.

The younger sister went out of state for college and came back about 3 years ago and has been living on her own with her SO. Since they've been back, we've invited them on almost every outing but they 98% of the time decline and I didn't have an issue at first since they said they don't have much money and don't want to depend on us paying for everything.

For the last year or so, they've been going out and exploring the city, travelling, etc. now that they have jobs but they never invite us out unless they want to ask for something in return.

A few weeks before this, it had already been coming to a boiling point for me that Jane always declines my invites due to work, money, or whatever.

The issue is, I wanted to know what I was doing wrong or could fix to be invited along. I started to feel bad for my SO that he wasn't being invited and I felt that maybe if they didn't like me, that's why they're not even inviting him.

Current:

After dinner, we go for drinks and I asked her how girls night was last week and we gabbed and then asked if there was something I could do to improve our relationship? I seemed to catch her off guard (wrong setting, drinking didn't help) and said that I noticed that they decline our invites, never invite, and that when she's with Ann, she doesn't offer to bring me along.

&#x200B;

She broke down ugly crying and called her SO to pick her up. While we were waiting for him, I starting tearing up because I felt so bad and told her I was sorry and she just kept saying it was fine. She said she didn't realize she was leaving us out but that she felt attacked that I would even bring it up. She didn't appreciate how I was accusing her of not liking me and how I attacked her for loving Ann.

I was so confused and just had a ""wow"" face because I had no idea what to say. My sister was there along with my friend and both of them were trying to just avoid eye contact. When she left they all looked me with a confused ""wtf"" face and said what they hell was that? I said i know I'm sorry, idk why i brought it up and they interrupted and said no, we mean her.

They said from their point of view, I casually brought it up and they were shocked at how she reacted and thought maybe she just has issues. I defended her and said no, it was my fault and dropped it.

Well since then, still no invites obviously, still no acceptance of invites, and it's just awkward now.

So, AITA? and if so, how do I fix it?

&#x200B;

TLDR: My almost SIL never invites, never wants to hang out; I thought I did something wrong, brought it up, and she broke down. AITA?

&#x200B;

**EDIT: It seems I'm getting the same consensus here as I was previously getting with about 80% NTA, 15% YTA, and 5% NAH or ESH. I'm not sure if she has anxiety and I shouldn't have brought it up in front of my peeps. I should have approached her later on our own but we're never, I mean literally never on our own, it's always a family function like 2-3 times a year or if my SO happens to ask to go over and I'm with him at their house.** 

Reading some of the YTA comments, it helps to put things into perspective that maybe I was coming off as the weirdo for wanting to be friends with them when really I'm just never going to get that and they just consider me his +1. As some of the comments noted, maybe that'll never happen and I need to accept it and not force them.

I guess I was entitled for wanting us to be invited and do come from a different family environment where if we're going out, I invite my mom and my sister and my cousins since we all live in the same city (about half the time, I'm not that weird and do enjoy our couple time). I figured my SO came from the same background since he's always inviting them and his parents and the sisters invite each other but I supposed a bro/sis relationship is different than a sis/sis relationship where he's not invited.

I also think maybe I was being narcissistic in thinking it had something to do with me when really, it just happens and that's that.

I've taken everything here into consideration and realize that I do have some things to work on and that I can't force a relationship where one doesn't exist. I think for now I'll stop inviting and stop suggesting to my SO that he should invite them out if we're in their area of town.

If it comes up and they ask why didn't we tell them, I'll just remember to invite them the next time but not get pushy and invite them everytime.

c2wwwz	2019-06-20 14:47:28	quietthrowaway_007	AITA for telling my boyfriend I wanna go on a friends trip?	"TL;DR: My boyfriend got upset with me when I mentioned I wanted to go on a trip with my best friend.

Throwaway because my boyfriend frequents reddit.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now and everything's been amazing. We did long distance in the beginning, but I just got a job closer to him so now everything's been extra great.

A bit of background, I just finished school and I just got my first grown up job, and as a result, I have money to travel now. My boyfriend and I love travelling, and have all these places that I want to go to. However, my boyfriend has been to way more places than I have, and he's been to all of them with his friends. My friends and I have just gotten financial freedom and independence from living under our parents, so a friend of mine proposed going on a trip to a country that we both have wanted to visit for a while, which my boyfriend had just visited. 

When I proposed this idea to my boyfriend, he got extremely upset with me because he wanted to travel with me, and saw this as me telling him indirectly that I didn't want to go anywhere with him. I keep reassuring him to the contrary, that because I wanna go places with my female friends, it doesn't mean I also don't want to go with him. I keep telling him that I have a whole life to go places with you, and I just want to enjoy some free time with my friends to visit places that he either has no interest for or has already been to. He's incredibly upset with me because of this, and I'm not sure what to do.

Perhaps I'm being a bit selfish, but if I haven't been somewhere, I like going with someone who also hasn't been there so that our experiences are new and fresh, and it doesn't become a whole ""I already know this is good, I already know this sucks."" My boyfriend's been incredibly sweet by proposing he'll go again, but I still want to go places with my friends. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

  so im in this group of friend that consists of 4 friends from school , we talk alot on school and on discord , we also play games togehter ( mostly cs ). we only knew each other for like 7 months and 2 weeks ago we planned to go out and watch the new man in black movie , all of us were kinda ""alright lets do it"" , 2 weeks later ( well actually 1 day ago ). one of my friend ( lets just call him  A ) decides to not go and when i asked him whats the reason  why he says ""oh , after school right? tbh i'd rather play apex legends with my online friends than going out with ya'll"" i got upset and i said ""well ok then"". I've always knew that he is a little anti social and i wanna fix that , im always thinking like whats his future is gonna be like if he has  socially awkward and have little communication skill whatsoever. 

So after 3 of us had gone home from watching the movie i asked A how was his day was  and he was like ""pretty boring"" and i tell him ""you should've come"" and he replies with some stupid excuse. ok now let me tell you a weird thing about him , hes always bitching about how he have no friend to go out with a but when he have me and the boys he always ALWAYS chickened out so idk whats wrong with him.


 timeskip to today at school.
its break time and he came into my class and i said "" hey come here , i wanna talk to you about something"" and he said ""yeah , what?"" and i said ""regarding your excuse to not wanting to go hangout with us , im just going to tell you that someday when youre an adult , youre gonna feel that you missed on being a teenager"" in a slightly rude tone , tbh i kinda feel bad after saying that and thats what makes me think ""Am i the asshole?"""

c2wusn	2019-06-20 14:42:35	vesa87	AITA for not realising a friend wanted to hang out, without her ever mentioning it	"Last september I went back to university, to study my pre-master (it is a transitional thing between the bachelor diploma from college and the master's degree from university here in the Netherlands) This university is in a different city from where I've been living in the past years, so during the week I am there and sometimes also during the weekend when I am busy or when my SO has to work. 

Before this I saw this one friend every week, we went to gymclasses together. When the schoolyear started at first I tried to meet up most weekends when I was home, but when I got busier at university, but also with sidejobs in my university city (cos of bills) the frequency went down more and more.

At one point in April I suddenly got a long message from her talking about how she thought we were friends and why I never came round, and she lived so close blablabla. And how it hurt when I sent a picture of the kids I babysat a week before, because that meant I was in town. So I looked at my calendar, it had been a bit over a month since I had seen her, plus all the times I had been there, my schedule had been booked. And I had no clue anything was wrong before the outburst. 

So I responded that I had been super busy, no response for days. So I decided to explain myself, which got a very upset message back, after a few annoyed messages back and forth I let it slide and decided to wait and see. 

A month later I thought why waste a friendship and I messaged her that I was taken by surprise by her message and that I had thought/hoped/assumed that if something was going on she would have said something.

Her response was that she had waited for me to realise what was going on, so I politely told her that I wasn't able to know/guess what was going on if she didn't tell me. To which she once again replied that as she said before, she had hoped/waited  that I would realise it by myself.

&#x200B;

A little sidenote; yes, she texted me less frequently in the weeks before her outburst, but I was busy, and I don't have the tendency to constantly worry about why people don't message me or message me less. As in worry like, omg why don't they message me, don't they like me anymore?

"My parents aren't the best with money keeping strategies, they often overspend on their credit card and get hammered with interest. On two occasions, I (21M) have bailed them out, paying  around $6,000AUD each time. However, they never seem to repay the debt with cash. For example, it would always be: ""You live in this house, we have spent more than that on your entire life...etc"" So in short, I never receive the money back.

For a bit of context. I was awarded a scholarship when I was at university, receiving $2000/ semester for 4 years + working since I was 16. Now that I have graduated, and have a full time job I voluntarily decided to start paying board to live with them. Currently, its $600 month.

c2wtd2	2019-06-20 14:39:21	emmasawr	AITA for not wanting to participate in cultural conversations with my friends?	"Wasn't sure how else to title, so let me give more context.

I'm Filipino and just graduated college, but unfortunately I never met another Filipino throughout my college career. I'm not *extremely* in touch with my Filipino culture but I still think that it is an important part of my identity. I have a lot of friends who are Indian, in fact, my few closest friends are. I was lucky enough to form a friend group with all of us throughout college, mostly everyone in the group met through me and we are all very close. 

We would often go to my room just to hang out and chat, my room was kind of the ""chill space"" to have fun and relax. However, often times my Indian friends would have long and in-depth conversations relating to each other concerning their culture. They would talk about movies, traditions, food, speak in Hindi to each other, etc. I am usually very open-minded and love learning about others cultures, and there are a couple things I can relate to as some of our culture share some of the same concepts and have similar ideologies. The first couple times it happened I felt a bit awkward but tried to participate in the conversation, but it was hard since I could only listen. One time, one of my friends made a joke and everyone was laughing, but obviously I didn't understand it and they said ""don't worry, it's an Indian thing"" to which I awkwardly tried to laugh it off. These conversations would always happen in my room, and would last hours, and I would always just be awkwardly on my phone/not paying attention, but I always feel kind of weird about it. Another thing that kind of bothered me was one time when they were having a conversation and then casually mentioned how ""I'm so white"". I asked my friend what she meant by that, and she told me that I ""do white people things"" and ""don't really act Asian"". I was kind of offended by this and blew up a little, and just kind of said ""well it's not like I really have anyone I can relate to about my culture in our friend group"". For me, it was a little hurtful to me because I feel like being Filipino is a part of my identity, but not one that I am constantly flaunting in my friends' faces, because I don't want to make them uncomfortable I guess. I've tried talking about some things in my culture a couple of times, especially when my friends are having conversations about India, but anything I say is kind of just curveballed back to the conversation of Indian culture.

Am I being the asshole here for not participating in conversations/being offended so easily and lashing out at my friend? I feel like I am left out a lot during these conversations and feel super excluded, but don't want to be overly sensitive or offensive about the topic if I bring it up to my friends. I'm not sure how my other non-Indian friends feel about this, I've never asked. I am usually the only non-Indian person in the friend group that is in the room when these conversations occur (to my knowledge)."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2wrhe	2019-06-20 14:34:42		WIBTA if I tell my gf I can’t help her with her anxiety attacks?	"So here’s the backstory, apologies for any confusion as English isn’t my first language. 

About 3 years ago my girlfriend had a real bad anxiety attack that was provoked by a stranger yelling at her for no reason, so she still has some medicine from this. It was a one time event that had a few smaller recurring times for about a month after. She stopped having attacks for 3 years now but kept the medicine just in case. 

So last week my girlfriend had what seemed like an anxiety attack. Her heart rate spiked and she got really cold and sweaty. We both worked from home that day so we called into our offices and explained we were leaving to go to the hospital. 

We get there and they run bloodwork, they do a sonogram of her heart, and take xrays. Everything comes back fine and she is released after about 3 hours. 

The doctor says it seems like anxiety attacks, and that she should follow up with her family doctor if it persists. We go home and she takes an anxiety pill she has, and lies down for the day. 

Yesterday she starts to feel it again and we stop what we are doing and go home so she can take her medicine. She asks what she should do and I repeat what the doctor said “call your family doctor” she doesn’t do this and instead takes her pill and lays down. 

Today she is working again and starts to feel it again. She takes her medicine and says “I just don’t know what to do” 

How do I explain to her that I am not a doctor? I can’t treat her, I can only do comforting things that don’t help if this is recurring. What if this happened and I wasn’t around to help her calm down? 

I told her that she needs to call the family doctor. And she says “I need to have time to call them” she has plenty of breaks from work that she can call and set an appointment. I can’t make it for her, she has to do it. 

So WIBTA for telling her I can’t help her anymore with this. I would still comfort her but not give her any medical advice,  because I am just repeating myself?

TL;DR

Girlfriend asks for my advice. I tell her to call the doctor. Repeat ad nauseum"		1	0
c2wr3g	2019-06-20 14:33:44	Hardrunner98	WIBTA if I told student at NSO not to come to my college?	"A little background:

I'm currently a junior and I don't like my college.  My freshman year wasn't the best, but I figured no one's really is and I bonded with my roommates pretty well so I decided to give it one more year. Sophomore year was more or less the same as freshman year and although I still liked my roommates a lot, our connections were not worth being unhappy with college. I decided I wanted to transfer, but when I turned my plans into actions I was informed by my adviser that my class credits wouldn't transfer anywhere else. This meant I either had to start as a freshman somewhere else, down $100k, or just stick it out and finish my schooling here. Obviously I chose the latter because I couldn't afford throwing $100k down the toilet, but I'm still not happy about it. 

&#x200B;

Things my school does wrong:

Tuition is way overpriced for what we get.

The cafe food is very expensive, never changes, and tastes 3 day old leftovers, oh and can't forget about the miserable cafe workers.

The campus is very small, which I'm honestly fine with, but the one nice part about it is the single quad area that we have and it is constantly blocked off.

The gym is extremely small and we have to share it with two other schools as well.

A lot of the teachers aren't great at teaching and required courses are sketchy to say the least (I'm about to be a senior CS major and I'm currently taking micro biology)

The dorms are pretty small and the RA's  are really unchill (ex: 8 am room inspections morning after we won the superbowl)

There aren't many options for popular extra-curricular activities (ex: football, wrestling, etc), and there's hardly anything fun to do on campus

The guy to girl ratio is at least 80/20, and not to be rude but the I think I've seen a total of 10 decently attractive girls here since I started(school population is \~4000)

&#x200B;

Things my school does right:

Classes are small(\~20 students per class) which allows teachers to connect more with students

Required internships junior and senior year which, sadly takes away our summers, but gives us job experience before graduation and a nice advantage in finding jobs right out of college

Dorms are all within a 5 minute walk from campus and all classes are within a 5 minute walk of each other

They provide students with a laptop freshman year to work with, but they must be returned senior year

Classes are challenging, but we're provided a decent amount of resources to get help if needed.

&#x200B;

Clearly, at least in my opinion, the cons out way the pros. 

&#x200B;

Since I'm a junior and I'm here for the summer, I'm starting to see all the potentially new students coming in for new student orientation. I feel as though I'm obligated to inform them what this schools experience is really like so they're not just being fed fake news and false advertisement from the NSO leaders, but I also feel I could come off as an ass hole trying to slander my school.

c2wqx1	2019-06-20 14:33:21		AITA for ignoring dog shit in my house?	"AITA for not picking up my roommate's dog's shit? 

The past few mornings, as I've been getting ready for work, I've happened upon dog shit somewhere in the house and have straight up ignored it as I head out the door. I've picked it up on the very random occasions it has happened in the past year, but my roommate and I have had a bit of a strange semi-falling out, so I just don't care to deal with it. It's been a majority of the days during the last 2 weeks. 

My roommate leaves for work an hour or two before me, and gets home about an hour before I do. So, in all likelihood, the dog has been relieving itself sometime in the hour after she leaves and before I get up. But, for all she knows, the shit could be from well after I leave. 

Bit of extra backstory/info: 

I knew my roommate was bringing her dog when we moved in together. However she made it clear I wouldn't really have to be responsible. 

She does, on occasion, ask if I could let him out/take him for walks, when she knows she'll be late at work - her boyfriend also helps in this regard. 

I haven't said anything about finding the shit and neither has she."		1	0

c2wpc4	2019-06-20 14:29:41	heebgeebs	AITA for wanting to throw my future MIL in a home?	"A little backstory, my girlfriend and I have been dating for several years and plan on spending our lives together. I love her dearly.

We do differ on our relationships with our families. My family is a little more, I don’t know how you say it, laid back I guess on family dynamics. We all live within 25 miles of each other but it’s not “expected” to go see family. When we see each other we see each other and we are happy and have a good time but no one feels obligated to a point to go see each other although we do carve out time to be with one another.

On the other hand my girlfriend’s family is super close. They have to go see each other constantly or they’ll get upset for being neglected by another family member (when I say family I am talking about immediate family). Personally I find this a little annoying and I know I am being an asshole in getting annoyed but I just can’t help myself.

My girlfriend’s non immediate family has kind of lived with them throughout her life. Her grandma lived with her and her family for a good amount of time and her aunt has been in and out of the house for what I’ve heard, most of my girlfriend’s life.

I’ve talked with my parents on the subject of them moving in with me if anything bad happens. They agreed that if they become old and need help in their everyday lives then would go into an assisted living home. Yes I know, that sounds terrible but they wouldn’t want their parents coming to live with them either unless something truly catastrophic or something short term happened.

Knowing how my girlfriend would respond about this and wanting to spend my life with her, I decided to bring it up how I don’t want anyone to live with us except for extreme cases (homelessness, etc..). She got mad and kind of assumes that one day her mother will come live with us in her old age. I told her I will most likely have a problem with this when this arises. Though we aren’t dwelling on this topic since it seems so far away, we bring it up every now and then and we both hold our ground.

I love her family, it’s just the fact that I don’t want anyone to live with me other than what will one day be my immediate family. I can see how I might be wrong on this but I want your opinion. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c2wog4	2019-06-20 14:27:30	SensitiveBrownGirl	AITA for refusing to cook after my brother refused to pick me up, despite our agreement he would?	"I live in my parents’ rental apartment with my brother, John. I work a pretty sweet gig at a vet office, he goes to university. We have an agreement, he is the only one with a car (parents got it for him when he got accepted in his current uni program) so he drops me off and picks me up from work, and I do all the cooking and cleaning at home. Yeah, we are the kind of family where mom would have a heart attack if she saw *a man doing household chores*. Whatev, that works well for us most of the time.

Yesterday, I was waiting for John (at 4:30pm) after work, as he usually picks me up then. He confirmed by text he was on his way, but time passed and he didn’t show up. At 5:15, I called him to see if he had a problem on the way, but he told me “Oh, I was feeling tired so I went straight home, just take the bus.” If he had told me ahead of time I would have taken the 5pm bus, but now I was forced to wait for the 6pm bus and got home past 7. To be clear, John’s commute is 12 min normally, and 16 if he takes the slight detour to get me (thanks google maps), so it’s not like it would have changed much for him. I do take the bus often to and from work, when our schedules don’t match, but I like to know in advance when that happens.

When I got home though, John was laying on the sofa watching Netflix, AND HE DARED TO BE PISSED AT ME FOR BEING HOME LATE. He said “Fucking finally, what took you so long? I’m starving, hurry up and make dinner.” I just lost it, I screamed at him that I’m not his personal cook and that he didn’t keep his end of the agreement so I’m not keeping mine. I had a sandwich while waiting for the bus, so I locked myself in my room and didn’t cook (John can’t even use a microwave, at best he can throw a salad together). I ignored him pounding on my door and demanding I cook, and I went straight to bed.

This morning, I took the bus to work and was greeted by about a million texts from my parents. They are super pissed off and telling me that they let me live free of charge in their apartment because “it makes university easier for John,” and that they will evict me if I “keep acting out.”

I know they value university a lot and hate the fact I opted out to go straight into the workforce, and I get it studying is hard, but it’s like they only see me as a live-in maid for my dickhead brother. I want to punch something (or someone) rn. I am seriously considering finding roommates and moving out, and letting John figure out microwaves on his own. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2wnyc	2019-06-20 14:26:19		WIBTA if I messaged my FWB's new guy?	"A few years ago, my ex - K - messaged me wanting to hang out. She was in a relationship at the time but swore that it was in name only while he looked for a place. I believed her and we hooked up a few times.

Eventually she told me that she wanted a relationship but I was hesitant. Soon after, she told me that she'd made up with her man and we stopped talking. They got engaged soon after.

Last year, they broke up. Soon after, K messages me again. This time I made it clear that I wasn't looking for a relationship.

She said she felt the same way, that she just wanted to keep things simple and didn't want a relationship with ANYONE.

We agreed that neither of us wanted anyone else so we would remain exclusive as FWBs and let each other know immediately if that changed.

Then she started to get more ""couply."" Wanting to cuddle all the time, hold my hand and kiss me in public. She called me boo and sent memes where she referred to herself as ""your girl"" and mocked guys who want exclusivity without commitment.

I was uncomfortable and raised the point a few times. She convinced me that it was nbd to show affection so I started opening up more.

We talked all day, made future plans, cuddled constantly. She left spare clothes and meds at my house. It turned into a relationship in all but name, but after a few months she started to get distant.

Her messages slowed, she would make excuses not to see me but then hang out with friends.

I decided to confront her about it and she told me that she was just ill.

A guy, B, started popping up on all of her fb posts.

He would comment on every photo calling her gorgeous, reference inside jokes and openly tell her he has a crush on her.

When I asked K about him, she acted oblivious. She told me that there was nothing going on between them and that she just had that kind of rapport with some of her friends.

When she hosted a weekend event at her place that she had invited me to, I thought I'd test if she wanted me there and see if she messaged me. She didn't, so I assumed things were over and didn't speak to her for a week.

Eventually I told her that she didn't have to ghost me and that I would drop her stuff off later. She said she was just sick and that I was acting like a jealous boyfriend.

I immediately folded and started apologizing because I thought maybe I was just letting my anxiety get the better of me.

I asked to meet to talk about things but she told me that it was too late and we should just be friends.

That was two weeks ago and we haven't spoken since. I just saw on fb that she travelled out to meet B and posted a couply-looking photo of them hugging. She must be staying at his house.

WIBTA if I messaged B to tell him about what was going on with me and K? I feel like there was an overlap and I would want to know.

WIBTA if I messaged her ex about us hooking up before they got engaged? They're still friends and afaik he still pays some of her bills.

"So my fiancé and I were working on the list of people that we are inviting to our wedding next year, and he wants to invite one of his ex-girlfriends, who he is still friends with. I am not down with that.

I said I don’t want to us to get married in front of the girl who was his gf before me and with whom he had his longest relationship (they were together for 6 years, we have been together for 1). I have met the girl a couple of times, we are civil and I know she is engaged so this is not about jealousy. The idea just feels really weird and uncomfortable to me.

He said that she is part of his friend group and he cannot invite all of their friends and leave her out. He said that she is a part of his life as his friend before and after she was his girlfriend (He lived with her in college and she paid for everything because he was broke from supporting his siblings). He said she does not need to be seated anywhere near the altar where I can see her but he wants her to be there.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: I just want to clarify that she did not pay his tuition fees. She paid for their apartment, bills and food. And that is a lot and I'm glad she was there for him when he needed help."	Asshole	0	0
c2wnko	2019-06-20 14:25:25	cherrijuice9119	WIBTA if I called property management on my neighbor who lets her dog bark/howl all day, every day?	"  

I'll start by saying I'm a huge animal lover and have a cat of my own at the moment. I work from home full-time and live in a townhouse complex. My neighbor next door who I've become friends with had two dogs and recently, one passed away. Her surviving dog is miserable. He howls/barks from the time she leaves the house until she comes home, which is sometimes 14 hours a day. He honestly doesn’t even lay down for ten minutes. We have no insulation between our walls, and you can hear (not the words) but talking even when someone is speaking at normal volume. Needless to say, I can hear the barking/howling so loudly during the day that it sounds like it's in my apartment. I actually had a client on the phone the other day who asked me if I had my dog locked up in a room or something. It was really embarrassing. I had my sister and a friend over last week and they couldn't believe how loud he actually was. My partner is ready to pull his hair out when he comes home from work because we can't even watch TV over his howling unless we blast our TV, which is annoying even for us. 

I've tried everything. We have keys to each other's houses, so I've gone over to take him out/give him a treat during the day, but it honestly doesn't help at all and I think it even makes it worse. I've tried talking to her. She'll text me during the day and ask ""is he still barking?"" to which I at first was being nice about it, but now I'm flat-out saying ""yes. He has not stopped all day."" every time I see her in passing she keeps saying ""he's grieving…just like me…we miss Other Dog so much!!"" and I do feel awful…I actually had to just put down our family pet and it nearly broke me, so I get it, but this is getting out of hand. I feel like she doesn't actually care, she just wants me to feel bad or something. I've brought up doggie day care to her more than once because I've said that since he's never been without Other Dog -- they were together since they were born -- he sounds extremely lonely and just really beside himself. I said that I thought being around other pups might help. She just kinda said ""yeahhhhh…I guess I'd have to get him his shots to do that"" like, wtf? Shouldn't he have them anyway? I understand she has to leave the house to go to work, but she's been going out for fun nearly every night now on top of it, and I just want to be like ""hey, if you miss your dog so much, maybe you should be there for your other dog who spends half his day freaking out."" 

I'm sitting here again, with noise cancelling headphones on, trying to work, and I can still hear him clear as day. While I'm the closest unit to her, I know others in the complex can hear him. I can hear him every time I walk to the mailboxes or to the trash. Would I be an asshole if I called the property management company with a noise complaint? There's an anonymous line we can use for concerns about the complex."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2wm08	2019-06-20 14:21:27	lettizz	AITA for keeping my friend in the dark about my boyfriend and mutual friend hanging out?	"(Long time lurker, first time poster)

The beginnings of this story take place about a year ago. I had been dating my current boyfriend ('B') for a few months so the relationship was relatively fresh. I had known the two friends featured in this story ('F1' and 'F2') for several years and was keen for B, F1 + F2 to all get along with one another as the closest people in my life, so I arranged for us to all meet.

&#x200B;

B was already aware of F1 prior to meeting her and dating me. He didn't have the best impression as F1 had reported B's friend for abusing F1's friend (to clarify, the abuse allegations were false. F1's friend is a pathological liar). F1 took the allegations seriously and believed it was her responsibility to report B's friend. B had a running joke about F1's 'pencil neck' (he often makes jokes at people's expense).

&#x200B;

In July, I had escorted F1 to a city an hour away for a hospital appointment where she discovered the existence of the pencil neck joke and that B had been making those jokes. I understood this upset F1 the most given that she'd been communicating with him. Later that day I saw B and informed him that F1 had found out about the pencil neck joke. He panicked and asked me if F1 knew that he'd been making the joke; I lied and said no. (I recognise this as a complete fault on my part because I should have equally honest with B).

&#x200B;

F1 later messaged me explaining that she felt uncomfortable about the jokes, which I apologised profusely for, feeling guilty for not stopping the jokes. She added she felt the responsibility to confront B about it which led me to be truthful with B and inform him F1 knew that he'd been making the jokes. Understandably, they were both upset, and I tried (unsuccessfully) to patch things up between the two of them. B and F1 both forgave me, but don't communicate with one another. F1 was understandably upset and B understood. They haven't communicated since, despite my attempts to open up conversation. F2 discovered what happened at the time and blocked B for having hurt a friend of hers. However, since then F2 has unblocked B and now speaks to him regularly, having hung out with B and I on multiple occasions.

&#x200B;

Recently, B and I drove F2 to pick up her kitten as she can't drive. It wasn't until today that F1 messaged me asking about the kitten, intending to report the person selling the kittens for animal abuse, which I have been told by F2 is an exaggeration on F1's part. F1 was inquiring about who had escorted F2 to pick up the kitten, confused by F2's unwillingness to tell her. I wanted to be honest with F1 that B and I had gone with F2 to pick up the kitten, but didn't want to put F2 in hot water. F1 takes matters very seriously and would not take F2 hanging out with B lightly.

"So for starters, I run a bar and a few weeks back I announced we’d be running a promo (this Friday) on a specific drink and that there’d be swag to give out and so on. As part of the promo I was told I would be able to get free shirts for the staff so I collected everyone’s sizes. Most of them wanted smalls and mediums but there was one request for a large and one request for a 2XL. I relayed all of our shirt sizes to the beverage rep and she told me she’d see what she could do.

Fast forward to yesterday and the beverage rep delivered the shirts, yay! Except they are all smalls and mediums with one large. So now I am left with one person without a shirt and that person is one who stays until close while most of the others are cut out early. She also has privately discussed with me that weight is a very sensitive topic for her, so I do not wish to upset her at all. Since I do not have a shirt for her I plan on telling my staff there was a change of plans and that the shirts will be given out to customers.

Today is my birthday. I have a lot of baggage with birthdays because my narcissistic parents went out of their way to ruin every birthday. I cut them out a year ago yesterday. One thing they did is make me get my licence at 16, and then never let me drive. They did all they could to make me fear it. I have recently started doing small drives around town and am in therapy working past my trauma (I have PTSD).

So, last night, before bed, I tell my husband I am relieved I get to take my anxiety medication because it is going to be a stressful 12 hours up to visit his family. We have two small kids, 6.5 and almost 5, and so I have been working on getting everything we need to make the trip smooth. He goes off on me that it isn't fair he is doing all the driving and that I should do some. I told him that if he had said something a month ago (or more) I would have practiced and prepared, but I didn't feel comfortable with driving through some high traffic areas and then twisting country roads I don't know, with the kids in the car. I was very hurt that he would use this against me when I have made a real effort to work on it.

This trip is going to be rough. It is 9 hours without stops, but is going to be a lot more with the kids. It is because my husband insists of his first official marathon in this town. He is complaining that he is going to have to drive, then run 13 miles, and then drive again. BUT HE CHOSE THIS. I am already spending my birthday preparing for this trip! Also, I am deathly allergic to seafood, and will have to be on benadryl around the clock to prevent a bad reaction. Last time, it was a real problem. This is a small town that is about 30-45 minutes to the nearest hospital. There are also family issues about a dying grandparent that is going to add stress. Finally, I told him if he can't be nice to me I wasn't going. I am not going to be on a 12 hour car ride, then in cramped quarters at his relative's house with someone who can't even be nice to me on my birthday. Now he is acting all nice to me and told the kids I wasn't going. He said he was sorry, but it is too little too late. I slept on the couch, so I didn't really sleep. I am not celebrating my birthday and I still and stuck with trip prep because he has to work until 1. We had a fight the other day about him being awful to me when he is stressed and I told him I am not tolerating it, so this coming on its heals just makes it feel like all the talk of him doing better was just that, talk. He is a great guy, but he gets controlling when he is stressed. He is mad at his parents. I told him to go be mad at them and to stop being cruel to me.

Is she the one you work with?' her tone was casual and she doesn't really get insecure but to reassure her anyway I opened up the chat and scrolled up so she could see some of the nudes I exchanged with shannon, so she could see the dates were before I started dating her. She said 'Oh... right' then went quiet. She then told me that she felt like that was really disrespectful. She said that she had asked who shannon was as a joke and hadn't expected me to explain who she was let alone show her nudes. I think she also felt insecure because she's self conscious about her labia, and Shannon's labia in the picture is very small. 

I said sorry! But she didn't accept my apology straight away. She just said she felt really weird, and that she feels like I don't respect her.

I'm a huge how to train your dragon fan and have loved the movies for years, it's one of the few kids movies I actually enjoy and have watched heaps of times. when I heard that the new movie would be coming out I was pretty excited, my mum then suggested that I take my younger brother as he loves the movies as well. I explained that I would rather see the first viewing alone but could take him when I see it for the second time, my mum then tried to bribe me with free tickets and popcorn but I still refused. 

she then got mad at me and called me an asshole for not wanting to take my brother.
she tried telling me how disrespectful and rude I was and that I would hurt my brothers feelings. 

I ended up going alone and had a great time but my mum was super mad at me. 

to add, my bother likes to ask alot of questions after a movie is done and I just wanted to watch it and soak it in. 

was I the asshole in this situation?
and please do not judge me on the movie it's not the main point of the question.

EDIT....
I said I would take him on the second viewing of the move, which tbh was the next day"	Asshole	0	0

c2wcum	2019-06-20 13:59:36	Bubba6942069	WIBTA if I snitch to the teachers?	"No backstory required, I'll get to the point.

Basically, we have a class of 42. During maths class, there are these people, to piss off the teacher, make a loud clack with their tongues. Our teacher has given the whole damn class 5 minute lectures every single time something like this happens, but still no one has told him yet. 

Now recently, he didn't come to school for around 3 weeks, and people say that he had blood pressure issues.

Again, today, the kids did it too many damn times and they broke him. He didn't even bother lecturing us, straight up told me to stand up and said ""u/Bubba6942069, you're gonna tell me who did that"", and then he went right out of class, told our class teacher and the principal, got his bag, and left for the day. They lectured us, and no one said anything.

Now majority of the class trusts that I won't snitch and are more worried about the others, who want me to tell the teacher.

Now I can tell him [the teacher] in private about who did it, and no one would know it's me.

But would this make me the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2wcm3	2019-06-20 13:58:59		WIBTA If I wanted to cut connections with a friend over his decisions that I heavily disagree with.	"My friend is a adult(23) , he's a responsible dude and I looked up to him. We were super close buds till he wanted to start dating and of course I supported him. We talked less and less but it's alright I know my friend he's just going on dates and stuff. Few weeks later he gets a girl and we hyped cause my friend got a gf. 

As his friend I knew he's gonna be super focused on her cause ya know lovey dovey phase of a relationship. So we slowly stopped talking and a few months later they broke up.

The reason why they broke up is cause the girl had cheated on him and also did hard drugs and my friend was in shambles. He really liked this girl. 

At this point my friend and I haven't talked in over half a year. He told me what happened but I knew he was in love with her still and he didn't wanna get over her.

But we tried so help him  (me and our friends) but no luck. Then we stopped talking again cause he was depressed and was going on dates and just swiping on tinder to get some other girl ( he wanted to get her off his mind)


Well few weeks later still nothing but he still talked to his ex and she told him that she didn't understand her feelings (I think it was BS just dragging him along).

Tried to convince him to block her so it be easier to move on. But alas nothing.


And that brings us to today, I hear he's moving to a different state to be with his EX. Like I do not understand how you plan to leave all your friends and family to move to a different state to be with a girl who broke your heart and that you only known for less than a year.


At that point I lost some serious Respect for my friend. But again he's an adult he can do what he wants . Just like me, I don't see why I should continue being friends, he's leaving everything behind and his parents are against it, friends are against it and  I'm against it. We rarely talk now. 

I told him to give it a year or two before making this big jump but he's made up his mind. I want to be supportive but this seems irrational and it leaves me dumbfounded.

Am I the asshole if i stop being his friend. I genuinely want to support him and want the best for him. It's so hard to get on board with this."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c2wbkl	2019-06-20 13:56:17		AITA for not seeing my 7yr old brother?	So here’s the story. I’d say when I was about 15 years old my dad met my stepmother. At the time I was living at home with my mom and my mentally and emotionally abusive stepfather. My stepfather didn’t allow me to have any way to talk to friends about my situation. He would look through my texts, instant messages, and search history. He manipulated my therapist by insisting on a family group session against my will, and would talk bad about me to any friends that came over after he insisted he drive them home without me in the car. Then my dad starting dating this woman. This woman helped me. She let me vent and understand things about my situation and myself. She helped me understand that even though I wasn’t getting hit I was still in an abusive situation. I really loved her. I thought the world of her. Then she showed her true colors. Almost a year in I started staying at their newly bought apartment more. Then she showed her ugly side. It initially began to become apparent to me with her abuse of a foster kid she was taking care of. She would make the girl wake up at 5 am to make her coffee, do all the cleaning, and any other chores while her two kids did nothing. Then she would degrade her when she didn’t do everything to her perfectionist standard. Skip ahead. Her abuse toward ME started when she told me I could no longer confide in my father about anything. She told me she was the head of the household and anything I wanted to say had to be said to her because she “handled these things”. From there everything I did was you can’t do anything right, you’re incompetent. For example, she asked my to do her laundry. And it was a washing machine I was not familiar with. So nervously I asked her how it worked. It led to her cursing at me and telling me how I can’t even do the most simple of tasks. It got to a point where I was walking on eggshells around her. However, I still felt intense loyalty and emotional connection because she had helped me so much and I believed for a long time it was me.Fast forward some more. Her and my dad have a baby boy. My brother. When he was 3-4 is when I really started trying to disconnect from them. I would feel bad because she would never call me his sister. I wasn’t allowed to take him anywhere or do anything with him without being minister despite being 21. Meanwhile her other daughter who was the same age could take him out and was put in charge because I was deemed “incompetent”. I felt like I couldn’t have a real relationship with him. Eventually I did stop talking to them. My dad stole the jewelry my grandmother left for me. My only piece of her. that was my breaking point. I used that as the drive to finally leave despite the guilt of leaving my brother behind. To this day I still feel guilty. I’m 24 and he is 7. I know my stepmom wouldn’t have let me have much of a relationship with him anyway, but when I think about how much he loved me I feel so guilty. AITA?	Not the A-hole	1	0
c2wbds	2019-06-20 13:55:48	youkillmewell11	AITA for being upset with my husband because he didn’t go to work?	"Some background- My husband (33M) and I (26F) both work in a school corporation. He is the technology director and I’m an elementary teacher, so unless there is a problem at the elementary school, he primarily works in the high school.  My husband works year round and I work ten months out of the year, but my pay is spread across 12 months. 

My husband and I just took a vacation last week, so my husband took his vacation time (one week).  After our vacation, we also attended an educational conference (two days) out of state. We got back from the conference yesterday around five at night.  My husband, knowing he needed to go to work the next day, stayed up until two in the morning to play video games. This morning when I got up he was still home. He said he was too tired to go to work and took another day off. 

My problem with this is that our school corporation is small, so these things are noticed.  My husband and I differ greatly in our work ethic, so it drives me crazy when he takes days off that don’t need to be taken off. I know I sound like an asshole here and he should be able to do what he likes, I just get nervous that he’ll lose his job because he does this all the time (staying up late to play games, then is too tired to go to work the next day). His job is much more sought after than mine and he makes decent money for what he does.  He also has been talked to about not being there so often, and I’ve heard rumors that he will be replaced. 

I talked to him about it and expressed my concern, and I talk to him about it whenever it happens. I told him that he needs to be more responsible, but he says it’s not a big deal and he will take off whenever he wants.  I just am really frustrated with his casual feelings towards work. 

Am I the asshole here? Need to know if I should apologize to my husband and try to see it from his view.

Edit: My husband just told me he’s taking the day off tomorrow as well, just because."	Asshole	0	0

c2wa6e	2019-06-20 13:52:29		AITA for selling a custom painting my friend painted for me and my wife as a wedding present?	"I've been married five years. I have been friends with ""Andrew"" since high school. He's an aspiring artist who just hasn't caught a break though he is supremely talented. For our wedding, Andrew painted us a custom landscape which is essentially the view of the mountains in AZ from my dad's gravesite. It's a beautiful painting.

My wife and I own about a dozen condos and houses which we VRBO and Airbnb. Our favorite is one in Scottsdale and because the painting is an AZ theme and matched for decor, that is where we hung it. 

Well we had a guest stay with us recently and he had heard of my friends artwork. He asked where I got the painting and I told him actually he was my good friend. The guest asked if I could put them in touch with each other and I said certainly. Well I guess my friend was in one his brooding artists moods and refused to paint something for the Airbnb guest. The guest asked me if I'd consider selling for painting and jokingly I said ""yeah for $25000."" He asked me if I'd accept an equivalent amount in Bitcoin and I was like holy shit. We don't need the money but my friend's stepson does so I agreed and my wife and I basically used the money to start a 529 for the stepson. 

When I told my friend he was furious at me. I told him I got why he was mad but dude this IS the break he's been looking for and I'm not keeping a penny of the money. And this guy has money and connections and that's the way artists start making a living. Andrew is furious because he didn't grow up with a dad so my dad was sort of a surrogate and the painting was an emotional thing for him. I told him I understood that but his stepson can now afford at least a year of college and the Airbnb guest would fall all over himself if Andrew came to his home to see the painting. As of now Andrew is unwilling to speak to me.

This may have ruined our friendship but I was honestly doing it for him (and his stepson) but did I overstep here?"		1	0
c2w9xr	2019-06-20 13:51:50	Mexican_sandwich	WIBTA if I took my friends girlfriend out somewhere?	"I have this friend, Matthew. Matthew's girlfriend, Chloe, is currently in a position where she is physically limited as to what she can do (nothing major, it just hurts after a while of her moving), and she also cannot drive herself anywhere as it's dangerous for the medication she's taking.

Anyways, to the issue at hand; I would like to take Chloe out somewhere nice, as today she was telling me that Matthew can afford to buy himself new speakers for his car, and a new TV for his room, but can't afford to take her out on a date. However, I don't want to be seen as a dick who is taking out his girlfriend behind his back.

I personally feel like Chloe is being neglected by Matthew at the moment, but that is however neither here nor there. I understand that whatever is happening with Chloe and Matthew is their business, and I really just want to take Chloe out of the house for a change.

Just making it clear - I have no feelings for Chloe apart from friendship, and I would not dream of destroying their relationship.

EDIT: Thanks for the replies everyone. I don't believe Matthew is a dick, I just think he's a bit clueless to how she's feeling, but I could be wrong as I obviously don't know what they say when they talk to each other.

Chloe and I are good friends, and Matthew knows that, and if I took Chloe out for dinner or something he definitely wouldn't think I'm trying to take her away from him."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Today me and my 11 year old step sister were sitting at the dinner table eating our dinners as usual, when my dad, who was talking toy step mum at the time, walked over and turned around and pulled his trousers down. His ass was showing and you could kinda see between his legs and see his penis. It wasn't much to see because his shirt covered most of it but it was still gross. 

My step sister turned away and said *""gross,""* while looking super embarrassed. I saw her reaction and got super angry at my dad. I started to raise my voice and tell him how disgusting he is and how what he did is sexual harrasment and he can easily go to jail for that. I don't want my step sister to think that type of behavior is normal, because it really IS NOT. 

He then started to get angry back saying I was being stupid and it was only a joke, I disagreed and then my step mum who is my step sisters mum started to agree with my dad too saying I was being silly. 

I really think this situation is fucked up but my dad just let it slide like it was nothing (he does this often and when you bring it up again he makes you look like you can't let go of the situation). This has really been pissing me off all night because he thinks it's a joke, he thinks sexual harrasment is a joke.

I’ve had a bad toothache lately and so I keep telling her to leave my beard alone. Sadly that’s her favorite part and last night she ended up grabbing me because she saw in her words ‘a really juicy pimple’ I was really mad because she hurt me but I just sat there til she was done because I didn’t wanna throw her off me and then I told her she was an asshole for continuously disrespecting my wishes.

c2w3e2	2019-06-20 13:34:32	MochiLove13	AITA for telling my friend I don't want to hear about her horrible boyfriend anymore?	"Boyfriend: BF

Friend: GF

So a few months back a friend of mine texted me around 1 am to ask for advice. Her boyfriend had been pressuring her about having an open relationship and she just wasn't comfortable with it so she asked me what to do. Now I also want to explore an open relationship, but my SO does not, so I'm not. I told her this, she thanked me and I assumed that would be the end of it.

Well, he kept pressuring her and eventually she told him she wasn't comfortable with him dating other women, but other men were fine (though she told me she's still uncomfortable with it regardless) so he immediately plans to go to the gay bathhouse in the city the next morning. He told her that he went in the morning and chickened out, but went back after work when it was more empty, and ended up talking with an employee for a while. When the BF left, the employee smacked his ass and gave him his number. (I don't think I believe this, the employee could get super fired for it)

A few days later, she's snooping through his texts and finds he's sexting a few people, and sent a sex tape of GF and BF to a girl. I told GF she needed to break up with him, as he didn't ask if he could send the video and that's a huge violation of privacy, plus it's been like three days and BF has already broken his promise. BF tells GF he was drunk and horny, and it won't happen again.

Shockingly, about week later, GF snoops through his phone again, he's still texting girls, and is expressly saying ""my girlfriend doesn't know about this so it's hard to get away"" along with a ton of gross shit about how GF doesn't satisfy him enough.

I've been telling her since the video that she needs to leave him, but she won't and constantly makes excuses for him. She texted me a few days after this incident and said ""so you wanna know what's going on now with BF?"" and I replied ""no, don't tell me about all of the shit he's putting you through if you don't want my opinions. I think you should leave him, nothing is going to change that."" Am I an asshole for saying that?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2w2co	2019-06-20 13:31:51	genjaminfranklin	AITA for asking my girlfriend to send me two pictures of us she removed from her instagram	"We dated for almost 4 years, when we split we were living together so we moved apart because the fire died and because she essentially was dumping me. I had dumped her a year prior, but with pressure from her and from my friends who really liked her I gave her another chance and fell back in love with her. A short while later she confessed that she planned on leaving me and was already looking for apartments, then a short while after that insisted I go on a vacation with her as a last ""hoorah"" which was very good and very bad in a few ways. She stayed with me through my birthday after that and we hooked up and that was the last time we were intimate, a week later I moved out because her body language indicated she wanted nothing to do with me anymore and I felt crushed and felt like the best thing I could do was move on.

&#x200B;

One of the last conversations we had was her telling me that she just wanted to be friends and that I should start hooking up with other girls. I asked her if that was what she really wanted and she said yes. Because of the way the dating scene goes, I had to archive all of my instagram photos of both of us. I figured that when a girl I started seeing hopped on my instagram page and saw these lovey photos of me and my ex, it would have made her think I was cheating on my girl to be with them and I didn't want that to be the case. She had kept hers for a while (I looked at her profile after unfollowing her from me and unfollowing her quite often, still attached and probably just being a needy loser). A noticed a few days ago that she removed the photos, two of them were really precious to me. When she said she just wanted to be friends I told her that I was very attracted to her and being friends would benefit her exclusively and I would be burdened by being around her and not actually being with her, that I felt like I was a seat warmer for the next guy to come in and sweep her off her feet, so I told her that we just shouldn't contact each other unless she changes her mind.

&#x200B;

I texted her last night and asked that she send them to me. This means that I broke the no-contact which is why I'm thinking this makes me an asshole. I told her in the text that they were my favorite pictures of us and I'd like to have them if that was alright. She hasn't responded and I know I should give her time, it's only been a day, but she was texting every day early in the morning even after we broke up so I figured she would have sent them over to me by now. I don't plan on texting again even if more months go by without contact as I know at this point it's over and I just have to get over her. I'm just wondering if this was offensive to her as I had suggested no contact and reached out to her first for the photos."	Asshole	0	0
c2w1cw	2019-06-20 13:29:12	heresyforfunnprofit	AITA for tipping the other tables waiter?	"I took my family out to a sit-down restaurant last evening, and our waiter was terrible. He took forever getting to us and taking our drink orders, then took even longer bringing them out. The drinks he brought out were wrong, so we had to wait again. Then we waited forever to place our entree orders. 

A waitress at the table next across from us noticed us sitting at a table without even water in front of us and stopped by and repeatedly to check on us and covered for our waiter - she was the one who eventually took our entree orders. She also brought out refills for my kids twice while our server was playing on his phone next to the bar. 

The food was fine - but our server never checked in on us after bringing it out. I had to request help from passing busboys and other waiters.

The restaurant was NOT busy that night - it was only half full, and there was plenty of waitstaff - our server was not overworked, and the bar was not backed up. I know this because I repeatedly saw him sitting casually at the empty bar talking with the bartender for several minutes. 

After waiting over 10 minutes for the check, I went up to the hostess to request it again. Our waiter, who had been chatting with someone in front of the kitchen saw me and finally seemed to remember that I had asked him for the check and came over to print it out. 

I left him a $0.01 tip. 

Then I went to the table with the helpful waitress, and said “Our service was terrible, but your waitress helped us out a lot. Could you give this to her?”, they happily agreed, and I left cash for a 40% tip for her. 

My wife was horrified that I did that - she just wanted me to stiff the lazy waiter. 

So... AITA?

Edit: So, thank you for all for the responses - particularly those who pointed out how petty the $0.01 tip was. I'll adjust accordingly

She came home escorted by a local cop who said she was caught shoplifting expensive chocolates from a fancy grocery store a few blocks over. He said the owner had seen her lift a few small things over the past two years, like makeup or candy and things, and this time he finally caught her in the act. 

Thankfully owners not pressing charges but banned her and us from his store, which is whatever since I never shop there anyways. So my husband and I give her a reprimand. She cries and apologizes and I’m like good. You’ve learned your lesson. This is over. 

Well my husband REFUSES to let this go. He’s convinced there’s something wrong with her and she needs therapy. I think he’s overreacting. I shoplifted when I was a dumb teenager too although no one ever caught me. In fact everyone I grew up with stole something at one point or another. It’s part of being a teenager. It doesn’t mean you’re going to live a life of crime. It’s. Just. Being. A. Teenager. 

However my husband grew up incredibly sheltered and privileged and I’m sure in his circles no one ever nabbed a 50c lip balm from a corner store. I tell him it’s enough that we’ve grounded her, but he freaks out and thinks we need to find professional help for her “stealing habit.” I finally put my foot down and said no, she’s being a normal kid and as long as she doesn’t do it again and get herself in even more trouble she’ll be fine. 

AITA? I feel a bit bad shutting my husband down like that but I felt like enough was enough at that point."	Asshole	0	0

c2vzj5	2019-06-20 13:24:28	PartyClass	AITA For Honking At People Who Decelerate Prior to the Exit on Highways	"I live in a US state with lots of two way single lane highways. Most of our exits don't have sharp turns. The ones that do still have plenty of runway to get down to a reasonable speed. For whatever reason there are people who will shave off a lot of their speed before taking the exit. I'm not talking about coasting as they take the exit, I'm talking about shaving about 10 - 20\~ MPH off of their speed before getting on the exit ramp.

&#x200B;

I see this action as not only annoying, but unsafe. They are causing what is usually a line of cars behind them to hit their brakes as well. Whenever I see this and are directly behind them, I honk at them. I do not lay on the horn, I do not play a drum solo on my steering wheel, it's a short double chirp. It isn't out of anger, I simply want them to recognize that they shouldn't be doing this.

&#x200B;

Earlier a friend disapproved of this and I wanted to see what Reddit had to say.

Edit: For clarification. I'm not referring to driving slowly on the exit ramp or deceleration lane. I'm referring to braking on the actual highway before taking the fork off of the highway.

[https://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/dmv/forms/documents/nhdm.pdf](https://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/dmv/forms/documents/nhdm.pdf)

Page 72 has a diagram. They are braking on the part of the diagram that says 'Don't brake on the expressway'.

c2vyoj	2019-06-20 13:22:11	decemberandjuly	AITA for not warning my cousin that my other cousin was about to call her on some adult family drama?	"Family tree- my sister and I, my two cousins who are also sisters (A&B), and my cousin who is an only child (C). 

Basically to fit the word limit, my cousin B has always had problems with my cousin C, but has been very passive aggressive about it and has never directly told her what her problem is. Honestly I don’t even know. 

A&B hosted a family Father’s Day but didn’t invite C or her parents. My sister and I went, but I made it clear from the beginning I would not be caught in the middle of C found out. I only went to see my dad because that’s where he told me he wanted to go that day to celebrate. 

C found out and called me today. I didn’t lie to her, I simply said I think you need to call A&B and ask them what’s going on. 

C reached out to A. My sister thinks I’m an A-hole for not warning A that she was going to contact her. I don’t think its my responsibility to make excuses for other people’s decisions. I already told them I refused to be in the middle of their drama. I also won’t be going to any more of these events if everyone isn’t invited next time.

I was like no big deal is a short 3 hour flight i can manage the people in front of me sit down they were in there late 40's and were super obnoxious and loud i overheard they had already been drinking and they were going to spend the week drunk and let loose..

plane takes off everything is cool then suddenly the person in front of my does a hard recline right into my knees the plastic part of the chair bashes my knee  and now i am pissed.... my wife offers to switch spots with me and as soon as she said that the person next to her went back hard as well giving me basically no room in both spots.. so now i am really pissed my knee is fucking aching  so i do what any sane person would i sat with my legs perfectly straight digging both knees into the persons back in front of my..

she called the flight attendant over to complain that she couldn't recline all the way, the flight attendant looked at me and when she saw how little space i had she gave her a pillow to put behind her back(i think she had a little sympathy for me).

For the next 3 hours i gave her the worst lower back massage anyone has ever gotten..

forgot to mention i couldn't man spread comfortably because of the window on one side and the plastic part of the chair would be digging into my knee rather than the soft part..

c2vx0k	2019-06-20 13:17:40	ellieefry	AITA for eating an omelette in an Uber?	On the rare occasions my parents could not drive me to school, my sister and I would take an Uber to school. On one of those mornings, I was really craving an omelette, so I made sure I got ready fast enough so I could make one. When I was cooking my omelette, my sister decided she wanted to order the Uber . Note, she was in the kitchen and my eggs were about halfway done. I was  barely able to get it on the plate when the Uber driver was just starting to pull up on our driveway. I am one of those people who has to eat something before going to school because it really throws me off and my ADHD medications make it difficult to eat once they kick in; I also did not want my omelette to go to waste. So, I took it in the Uber and ate it on the way to school. My sister kept on complaining about the smell of the eggs and even called my mom to berate me about it.  Even to this day, my sister still gives me crap about this incident. The Uber driver did not say anything but just gave me a weird look. So, was I the asshole for bringing the omelet to the Uber?

We'd been out a while, but not near done playing, when a school trip showed up. But there was no kind of organisation, the one teacher just let them take over the course. Six kids on hole one, six on hole five, and so on. There's only nine holes, so from that point it was a case of: ''Oh, is that hole there free? Nope. Oh, that one! Nope. Okay, we'll just sit here for ten minutes till we can get on a hole, and repeat.''

I got pissed off, as I thought it was rude of whomever was in charge. My brother, always eager to please everyone got pissed at my being pissed, and long story short, we left, not another word said until he'd dropped me off, as we both knew a loud shouting match was in the offing.

Its also worth noting i had to have an emergency C section so standing/walking for long periods of time causes me a lot of pain, usually to the point where im actually doubled over in agony. 

I got on and i put the pram in the designated place for it, anyone from the UK will know what i mean when i say it was one of the older Arriva buses where theres only 2 seats to lift up and nowhere for the parent to sit except for the 2 seats that face the front of the bus right next to where the pram goes. As soon as i got on i noticed the bus was packed, some people were stood because they didnt want to sit near strangers. I got the pram sorted and looked at an old lady (60ish) sat on the only seat near the pram, i asked if she would mind moving a few seats behind her so i could keep an eye on my newborn as i didnt want to sit at the back of the bus where i couldnt see her or, god forbid, get to her quick enough incase someone tried to take her because of how packed it was. 

The woman told me i have no right to take her seat, i agreed that i dont have any right to do that but im not taking it im politely asking if she would move a few seats behind where she was right now so i could be close to my daughter. She told me if i wanted to be close to her then i should stand, i told her how i had a 35 minute journey ahead of me and explained about my c section and how standing causes me agony and she still said no. So i stood. I stood there for 35 minutes in agony, tears in my eyes trying not to flip out on this old woman because my emotions were all over the place. During the journey i heard some people whispering how rude i was to ask the old lady to move just so i could sit, saying i have no respect and my generation is filled with disrespectful people. The woman got off on the same stop as me and she walked of with no problems. 

Im starting to wonder if i really was rude and disrespectful towards this woman, so ive come here for the opinions of you.

c2vulv	2019-06-20 13:11:20	HuneyBeeTea	WIBTA if I told on my roommate for not having renters insurance?	"As part of our lease, it is required that we have renters insurance.  2/3 people in the house got renters insurance per the lease.  The third roommate thinks renters insurance is stupid and unnecessary, which is their opinion, but it is called out as required in the lease, which they signed.  

This stresses me out because technically that is breaking the lease and I’m not sure what could happen to us as tenants if the landlord finds out.  EDIT: looked at the lease and it says we can be evicted for breaching any term of the lease. 

I have already talked to the roommate and told her it was part of the lease and she needs to get it, but her response was that she is not going to get it.   I mentioned to her all the benefits of having renters insurance like in the event of a fire, flood, break-in, or injury on the property.  She still thought it was dumb. 

WIBTA if I reached out to the landlord and told him that she doesn’t have renters insurance?

Edit: the only reason I cared about her having renters insurance is because it is part of the lease and I do not want to get evicted.  I learned I would be the asshole so I will not tell the landlord."	No A-holes here	0	0

c2vu0n	2019-06-20 13:09:51		WIBTA for congratulating our fired intern?	"Throwaway account. This one's a doozy, but I'm trying to be discreet for work reasons.

There's an intern (23m) on my (30f) team who graduates college soon and his last day is coming up. I'm not particularly good friends with him, but he's not a bad guy. He keeps to himself and is a little bit awkward socially, but he's a sweetheart. But what happened the other day in our team meeting makes me feel SO BAD for him.

Essentially, he's not being offered a full time position with our company--hey, it sucks, but it happens. Especially in smaller companies where projects may not always have the funding to keep people on after they've completed their main task. Usually you write them a good reference letter and point them to a new opportunity elsewhere if they're a decent employee. However, the way I found out he's not being hired full time was when our manager announced to the entire team he wasn't getting a full time position after he graduated...with him STANDING THERE.

Now, I don't know if they spoke prior to the meeting (I'm assuming they did), but I feel like going into a longwinded speech about how he's not getting a full time position with us and how we're letting him go in front of everyone was tactless. He could've at least let the guy announce it on his terms.

We're having a ""going away"" party for him this week and the card they got for him just says ""Good Luck"" which doesn't sit well with me after that went down. Some of my coworkers and I want to kind of go over our manager's head and get him a congratulations card for getting his degree as a hopeful note since his send-off is pretty shitty. We also took him to lunch. It's a small gesture, but I feel like it would be nice.

So, in short, WIBTA for implying their idea of sending someone off sucks and refocusing on his school accomplishment rather than him getting fired?

Edit: I realized right after posting that I left an important piece of info out of this. A few months ago another intern graduated who WAS hired full-time. So that adds to the burn imo"	No A-holes here	0	0

Her dad works very hard to provide for her family (as well as her mom, but their income is mostly from the dad) and as long as I have known her, her dad has been an active participant in her life and has supported her as well as financially helped her through life.
In the past year or so, she has consistently posted on social media that she “does not have a dad”, her dad does not love her, he is abusive, an absent father, etc. I understand that she and her dad may argue or not be as close as they once were, but from what I can tell (I frequent her house frequently) she is very rude, passive aggressive, and snarky to her father when he is very loving and caring towards her. For example, he will come home from work and ask what she did that day, and she will snap back with “it’s none of your business”. By no means do I think her dad is abusive. He also has a very loving relationship with her siblings. Her claims on social media have bothered me because I actually grew up with an absent, abusive, drug-addict father and it hurts to see someone make such claims when their dad is trying to maintain a healthy relationship. I confronted Megan and told her she should maybe be nicer to her dad and stop making false claims for attention and to label herself as having “daddy issues” (because I guess that’s cool now...?).

When I first thought of the idea, I told my 2 best friends and at the time, A and B and they committed to going. I later invited 2 other girls from our sorority that told me this week that they wouldn’t be able to come.

I’ve made a list of back up girls I could invite in the event of someone canceling. So I have already talked to two girls that would be interested in coming. However I told A and B about our friends canceling and me asking two new girls. B told me she could invite her friends instead who I don’t know. I told her I would rather keep it to girls in the sorority and girls I knew. She said “it would be just in case”. And she has started pestering me about it again seeing if the other two girls have committed. 

Some other things to note: 

I’m paying for the hotel and tickets out of pocket. The rest of the girls haven’t paid for anything yet. 

I went through a tough break up recently, and I’ve been leaning on my friends ever since. B has been the least supportive and has just told me there is nothing she can do and to go get therapy. 

Our friendship wasn’t the same in March because of a fight we had before the end of school where I felt like she was using because I had a car and she didn’t. 

If she keeps pushing the idea to bring her friends on a trip I paid for, I am thinking about uninviting her. WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c2vj9r	2019-06-20 12:43:25	Lin_Angstwyn	AITA for ignoring text messages from a high school friend(?)	"Just a bit of background.

&#x200B;

I didn't graduate high school because I chose to leave for University early, so... I'm not really close with any of my high school friends. Also, I'm currently in another country for University (international student) and not where I had high school. 

&#x200B;

Moving on.

&#x200B;

There's this guy (let's call him James) from my high school who just seems to text me constantly asking things like ""oh, when will you come back home?"", ""when are your holidays"", etc etc. In the past I've replied to them thinking, oh maybe he just wants to catch up? 

&#x200B;

But the thing is: 

1) I was never really that close to James, we talked back in school but just for the sake of making convo and school stuff... heck I was never really close to anyone in high school cause I was such a loner 

&#x200B;

2) I'm not the biggest fan of texting anyway, to anyone... I don't even know why I have a phone 

&#x200B;

3) A part of me just want to leave high school behind because it is one of the most shittiest time of my life emotionally, mentally and physically. One reason why I chose to move abroad for uni, to leave everything behind

&#x200B;

4) Every time I do reply to James (in which he replied almost immediately every time), the chat just becomes either a random series of deep convos that I don't want to be a part of or just me forcing to say something just to have a convo and then make up an excuse to leave the convo. It's... a bit odd. 

&#x200B;

One day, I asked a couple of people I know from high school about James and apparently he does this to EVERYONE, just randomly asking ""when will you be back home?"" and such, attempting to catch up, I guess? or something? So much times... that they too just started ignoring him. The thing is, James is now not even back at where we were in high school. He's somewhere abroad having Uni too.

&#x200B;

I don't know, I think I just find it weird that he keeps on contacting everyone, including myself even though I have no past connection with him or interest at all with the convos. Instead of forcing a convo or talking to him due to pity and pretending, I just choose to ignore him hoping he'd forget and just move on, you know?

c2vhyx	2019-06-20 12:38:51	witchdaisy	AITA for telling my dad to stop showing affection	"So basically my (19 F) dad (54 M) has this problem of only really showing affection when we’re asleep or in a rush to go somewhere. 

In particular, he feels the need to go in my mom’s room and my room to kiss my mom and I good night when HE goes to bed. Not when we go to bed, when he does. 
AKA at like 1 am or later.

I also have issues sleeping and staying asleep, so when I go to bed early, it’s in attempt to try and get enough sleep since I have such bad issues sleeping. 

But he doesn’t just do it when he’s going to bed,
when he is off to work in the morning he will come in and do it then as well, in which he woke me up and scared me so badly all right before 7 am this morning.

This also affects my mom as he’ll constantly wake her up to talk to her and try to show affection even though we’re just trying to sleep, and she has to be up early in the morning.

Whenever I try to ask my dad to quit doing stuff like this (I wouldn’t mind if he did it before us individually went to bed and if I was already awake in the mornings, in which I tell him as such but.) he throws a hissy fit and claims he’s just gonna stop trying to be nice, etc. 

So, WIBTA if I asked him to stop?

c2vh3x	2019-06-20 12:35:49	Hairy_Sasquatch	AITA for not wanting to pay rent?	"I moved into an apartment (with 2 other residents) with my gf recently. They had a roomie moving out and we told them we could do month to month and they agreed. One of the people currently living at the house is my gf’s best-friend (BF) from childhood. BF told us about the place.

When we moved in, BF told both my gf and I individually the rent was “x” number of dollars a month. Rent rolls around for the 1st month and to our surprise the rent is higher than what we were told. BF said the rent for the whole place was being split 4 ways, when originally we were told x which was split per room. Additionally, there are only 3 parking spots at the house and one of our cars would have to go down the road on a side st every night. Since we were splitting the cost of a room and had relatively cheap rent gf and I agreed to put a car there. When confronted about the price change BF said she was telling us her rent when 3 people lived there even though we asked numerous times what OUR rent would be. Learning BF intended to split 4 ways we were annoyed and said fine but we think we shouldn’t always have to park down the st if we are all paying evenly. This apparently was something BF could not do and she countered by lowering the rent but still not to the price that what was originally told to us.

Also when we moved in we started finding mouse poop everywhere. In the kitchen, counter tops, bathrooms, living room, bedrooms, you name it. My gf and I were grossed out and cleaned it up across the whole house (with no help from either room mate). My gf confronted her BF about it and her response was that we didn’t ask the right questions. I felt pretty amazed that a supposed best friend wouldn’t be upfront about that. I definitely should have had more due diligence but I still feel like we got screwed/deceived there. 

Importantly we never signed a lease or anything. So my gf and I told her BF we are looking to move out either July 1 or August 1 depending on whether or not we find a place. When we moved in we told her BF we would help try and find a replacement when we leave so they don’t get screwed on rent. So for the past few days I’ve posted adds on craigslist and gotten many responses from people wanting to check out the room and possibly put a 1st months rent deposit down. After letting BF know about this I was asked to take the post down because BF does not want to live with strangers.

Finally, I texted BF two days ago to plan on having us out by July 1 if it makes finding a replacement room mate easier. BF texted yesterday asking to confirm that we will pay rent next month even if we are not living there because it is too short notice that we are moving out. Considering I tried to find a replacement and everything else I feel no need to pay rent if I move out with my gf for a new July 1 rental. Obviously I will pay if I am living there in July.

BF is pissed off and I want some outside opinions, am AITA?

I told her I liked it but then she pulled out blue hair dye and was going to color part of her hair. She saw my face and asked what's wrong. I told her I didn't think it was a good idea given that she has a very professional job and that shes about to turn 30 and in my opinion it's kinda weird. I honestly told her know my thoughts on it. I also said it's her body and she can do what she wants with it. She seemed happy with that but I also let her know it's my choice whether to go out in public with you and if your due your hair blue, I'm not going out with you. She seemed upset but I run into people I know all the time and the town I'm in is a very uppity town.

"Tl;dr: roomate moving out, didn't formally announce to us both and told me in passing, told other room mate a while ago, now they're pissed that they weren't involved with calling dibs on left behind furniture.

So one of my roomates (Jay) is moving out in about 2 weeks. There has been build up to this for a while which I was fully aware of. 
My other housemate (Jen) never leaves their room (smallest in the house) so I only really catch them if we cross paths in the kitchen or in the hallway. Told Jen a few weeks ago in the kitchen that Jay was moving out so she could move into his room (which is the biggest in the house). We're both a bit bummed about having to pay more in house costs but whatever we'll deal.

Today the topic of the furniture came up and Jen asked if Jay was leaving his much larger and sturdier desk behind and I said he was and its hers to have since I don't want it. She asked about his TV stand and I said I had already called dibs on it since Jay was selling me his TV. 

She then reacts quite angrily and aggressively, saying she has been living in the smallest room and been paying equal rent with myself and Jay who are in larger rooms. Saying she should have first dibs on left behind furniture as a result, also saying she doesn't like these conversations happening behind her back.

Am I the asshole in thinking she'd be more involved with these conversations if she left her room and interacted more once in a while, or even just went to Jay herself instead of taking things out on me? 

Feels like I'm being treated quite unfairly in her reaction."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2ve0g	2019-06-20 12:26:24	culturewarcrimes	WIBTA for choosing peace at home over moral neighbor interaction?	"Some background:
-My (27m) wife (27f) and I are married 3 years
-She's pretty territorial, private, and ""brutal"", and that's part of why I love her. No one gets a warm fuzzy feeling from her
-We bought a house a year ago and have barely interacted with any neighbors, but the neighbors in question seem to be very nice people
-We're middle class, living in a middle class neighborhood in the suburbs of a major American city

The family next door has a teenage son and a DUI dad (our theory) who doesn't drive. Someone (mom, son, or dad) backed into our 2004 Accord (the car my wife drives) and scuffed up the door panel pretty good, leaving a few dents. It doesn't look like a white trash level car now, but it's pretty noticable. Car is totally functional still. The wife left a note and got in touch, doing all the proper things. She asked if we could handle outside of insurance, which is legal and preferable to her, because her rates are 'already very high'.

If it were up to me, I would have absolutely told her not to worry about paying anything, we'd live with the damage. But that would have quite literally been world war 3 in my house, especially since she drives the damaged car and we can't switch cars. She got an estimate to repair the damage, and it's about 1000 bucks. 

My wife wants me to call and collect the money from them, and she doesn't plan on actually repairing the damage, claiming that it's up to us what we do with the money. If I don't collect, she won't collect either, because of how much she hates interacting with people. It's almost a mental block, how much she is unable to interact with neighbors. But if we don't get that money, I'll certainly be in the dog house for months.

I don't actually resent my wife for her mindset, because her ""us against the world"" mentality is something I love about her and it makes her a great wife in many circumstances. 

WITBA if I actually collected the money, going against my better judgement?

Edit: Not sure if it's against the rules, but I'd also appreciate any creative solutions :)

Edit2: because this has gotten a decent amount of attention, and it seems to be a genuine split down the middle, I figure I could add some clarification. I'm not afraid of confrontation with the neighbor, I just like to practice forgiveness and generosity. Their family, if they are like a normal family, can't exactly swing a $1,000 surprise expense. My wife and I both work and have no kids so we are not hurting for money. I'm not really in the mood to entertain insults towards my wife either, she's a great person who is extremely generous when it comes to gift-giving and donations. She just has principles that are strong and, in this one circumstance, in opposition to mine. also, everyone is saying that I'm the asshole whether they agree with me or not lol, which is kind of funny I guess."

c2vbr9	2019-06-20 12:19:12		"AITA for being pissed at my friends for editing my ""persona""?"	"I'm on mobile, but I'll try to keep this as clean as possible.

Long story short, I'm a furry (which is important).

In the furry Fandom, we create these things called ""fursonas."" If you've ever seen any furries who dress up in suits, those goofy characters are their fursonas. What they are is essentially an anthropomorphic animal persona which represents a furry in some way, shape or form. I have one for myself, and I'm an artist so I've created art for him (along with a personality, a world he lives in, and what have you). It's a creative endeavor and I'm very proud of him, so to speak. 

I also hosted a small discord server for me and my friends from high school who I'm typically close with. They are not furries by the way, but they're just indifferent about it, which is generally how people feel about the Fandom.

Anyway, one of my friends recently took my artwork, traced over the faces I've created for my character, and warped/edited them in such a way so as to turn them into goofy emotes for a discord server. We're talking about emotes that look like those ""pepe"" frog pictures you see that circulate in the internet so they're meant to be comical and funny. He did this as a little homage, as a gift to me and everyone else in the discord server because he thought that it would make everyone laugh. Well it did, for everyone except me. I don't like the way they represent my character and I think they're a little ugly. 

I told my friend that I didn't like it. I don't want my character being represented in that kind of way and without permission, even if it was a gift. Some of my other friends told me to suck it up because it was a gift and a kind gesture, that I should be facetious and feign being grateful because of that, but I don't think so. 

I tried to make an argument that it was disrespectful and they were essentially bastardizing the content I've created, but they didn't see it that way because they think my argument is unreasonable as anything on the internet is fair game to be edited. Not to mention, they also brought up the fact that I draw Nintendo characters on my whim so I'm a hypocrite because I'm gatekeeping my content on the internet while I use content from other people freely. I didn't really have an answer for that. People can draw mario and Luigi, why can't they draw my character? Also, many others are making a case that its just a joke and meant to be funny. Other furries said they have no problems if they had friends that did that to their characters but I don't think that matters because I don't like seeing my persona look like that. 

Anyway, after I expressed my discontent, more emotes were made. They came back to the server, and what happened was that I became distant, and admittedly passive aggressive with them. I took a break and handed off the server to another buddy, and they think I'm blowing it all out of proportion for something so insignificant.

c2vah8	2019-06-20 12:15:28	Toooh	WIBTA if I told parents about my suspicions of their daughter having autism?	"Okay I'm pretty sure I would be the asshole as I'm way overstepping my job as a gymnastics coach, but please hear me out. 

Some background information: I graduated with my masters degree in psychology last year. I have been working (and currently still am) at a specialized centre for childrens' psychiatry for the past two years. I work a lot with children with autism. 

Next to working there, i'm also a part time gymnastics coach at a competitive level. I see my gymnasts 3 times a week, 6 hours a week. I teach gymnastics to 7-11 year old girls. 

When one of my newer gymnasts (let's call her Lola) came to my group, her previous coach told me he thought that Lola was a bit different. I immediately saw what he meant, but I  figured she was just shy and needed to adjust to her new teammates. 

I gave her some time to get used to our group and kept an eye on her, just to be sure. 3 months later I kind of feel like I should talk to her parents. To clarify some of the behaviors I noticed:

- She is not getting used to group routines
- She needs a lot of personal, individual instructions, even when I'm giving the entire group an instruction (she just doesn't get it's also meant for her)
- Lola is having a hard time connecting to other girls in our group (she is mostly on her own)
- She is really strict and rigid on her own thoughts and ways to do something
- Lola is getting upset really fast and not able to recover (she went home a couple of times during training because of it)

I asked her parents to have a chat with me in a couple of hours, because I'm genuinely curious if she is having fun and likes being in our group. I also kinda want to tell the parents I noticed Lola has a hard time socializing and getting used to our routines. I'm really hestitant to tell them about that, and even more about my suspicions of her possibly having autism. I feel like I'm really overstepping, possibly even offending them, and putting myself in a psychologists' role without them asking for it.

On the other side, I really would want her to get help if I'm right and feel a little bit responsible to tell her parents my observations, because I get to see the effects of late diagnosis on a daily basis and I wouldn't wish that for Lola. 

So reddit, WIBTA if I told her parents about my suspicions and HOW could I tell them while minimizing the possibilities of them being offended by it?


UPDATE: I spoke to Lola and her father. I asked Lola if she enjoyed being in our class. She told me she enjoyed it very much and thought all of the other girls are so nice. She then went to put on her gymnastics leotard so I could talk to her father alone. 
I told him that I've noticed her struggling with socializing and aksing for help and I was concerned about it. Also told him the other things I listed above. He was very open to it and told me she also has difficulty making new friends at school and that they were struggling with routines at home too. He told me that they were wondering why everything was so different with Lola compared to their other kids and that he recognized everything I told him. 
I suggested that it might be good for Lola to get some help and that I was willing to help during gymnastics of needed. He asked me what my advice was and how they could take the next step. I suggested talking to their teacher or to their doctor. 

He thanked me for being alert and open and said he would discuss with his wife/Lola's mother. She later texted me to thank me! 

TLDR: I told the father about my concerns and suggested extra help. Father recognized everything I said and was happy I told him. Later talked to his wife who also was very thankful I told them. I'm happy I made the decision to talk to them!"	No A-holes here	0	0

Background is that while I have a good relationship with my brother, there aren't too many people in this world I dislike more than his wife.  Entitled and spoiled but bitches about everything, just straight dumb, two faced, doesn't work or ever has since she got with my brother, manipulative, uses her 'Christianity' only as it suits her or to look 'good' if that makes sense, walking definition of actions speak louder than words in a negative sense... I could go on forever.  Somehow has my brother completely brainwashed and whipped.  Can't even bring up anything negative about her to him because it's like he can't see it even though every other family member of ours (ok there's only 4 of us) also dislikes her.  Can't stand to be around her for more than a couple hours every 6 months

Ok maybe I went on a little long there.  Anyways I just visited them to see my niece for the first time (I offered to come at birth but she declined, through him..whatever on this).  Now he wants me to come up for the child's baptism already 3 weekends later and due to schedule, itd be a 4.5 hr drive up in the morning for a 45 min baptism and a 4.5 hr drive back down a few hrs later

If it were for something genuinely important to my brother, I'd do it ten times over no problem.  Actually already did a couple times before to bring and take care of the dog she neglected while she was off vacationing and my brother on a work trip.   But this?   He's not even religious in the slightest.  Just follows her whims.  Actually confused why it would be important for me to be there.  While I obv want to be involved as an uncle in the child's life as she grows, I just don't give a shit about a non genuine religious ceremony for a 2 month old.  Even for a family member.  And tbh, and I know I'll be trashed for this, but babies are babies.  As in, one baby is pretty much just like any another baby to me.  

So, I kind of want to decline and also use this as a breaking point for now in that I want to make clear that he continually ignores that I've expressed that I truly don't want to be around his wife and two birds one stone, that I'll just be more involved when the kid is actually a kid at like 3+ yrs old

my brother does everything for my mum 

my mum dislikes me

my brother couldnt make this years family holiday

I'm stuck with my her abroad and wish I wasn't

I'm 16

&#x200B;

 The resort is really not appealing to anyone who's not an adult, at the hotel we have prepaid for breakfast,and are allowed to bring in food and cook, so I'm really leaning towards not wanting to go out with her and do what she does ( drinking, walking around looking at buildings, window shopping, smoking, eating out(as i hate the local food) )

I can see that I'm just wasting her money by staying inside but honestly, theres no better alternative for me.

I've tried going out with her twice and both times its been boring, uncomfortable and pointless, shes probably lonely going out on her own despite telling me how popular she is, but she makes it impossible for me to want to go anywhere with her.

She's just hard to be around, the type who opens the balcony door thing,  mid argument so she can try and embarrass me by letting everyone know ""YOU HAVE FUCKING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES!"" (I don't), among other insults and I hate how she acts as if shes silenced me just because i dont want her to get other people complaining about us because they cant sleep or something.

&#x200B;

When I tell her that I don't want to go anywhere  I'm suddenly an ""ungrateful, jobless parasite"" and now shes adding ""depressed"" to that list, saying she'll make sure I miss the month- long group event I've been looking forward to going on by telling the organisers I'm not in a fit state of mind to be around other people and I'll have to see a therapist instead, all this just because I dont want to go anywhere with her, It's just such an overreaction imo.

Maybe as a son I should Sstill put her first and keep her company?

We've never got along before this so I don't see why I should have to take my brothers role now that he's not here to be her servant/best friend just because we're away from home.

&#x200B;

Her trying to force me to do as she says is just making me want to do it less, In my opinion, she should've just booked the holiday with a friend instead, as I would rather not be here - she said before we went that as it is just going to be me and her,she'd understand if I wanted to do my own thing, I think it's unfair that now that shes actually here , shes suddenly denied saying any of that and I'm being treated as the villain because I'm not suddenly begging to be spending time with her.

&#x200B;

Shes convinced anyone will see me as a spoiled ""brat"" and I'd like to put that to the test.

Also note that I'm only like this on this holiday, back home I get outside as much as possible, I go to the gym, I play out with friends, I go running...

I’m not one of those naturally smart kids so I study every night from when I get home to around 11:30pm to make sure I get good grades. As a result I don’t have much time nor do I prioritise chores around the house. 

The other night after setting the table, feeding the dog and helping mum cook dinner my dad asked me to take out the rubbish. I tried explaining to my dad that I have to study and don’t have time to do a million jobs in order to get the grades you expect me to. He freaked out at me and told me I’m rude, ungrateful and spoilt. He said I had to walk to school the next day and I’m grounded. In Australia it’s the middle of winter so it was 5°C that morning and it’s a 40 minute walk (this isn’t the first time he’s made me walk) with a backpack my mum couldn’t even pick up as it’s that heavy. I woke up and realised if I walk I won’t make it on time before school starts, so I called my friend and she came and picked me up. This only fuelled the anger and my mum said I’m grounded for another 2 weeks. 

Since then they haven’t been giving me dinner and won’t take me to school. Dad is doing everything he can to piss me off and my parents are clearly favouriting my brother. They gave him money and told him he is their favourite. My dad also locked me out of the house this arvo and told me he thinks I’m a disappointment.

I asked him about an abortion and he broke down and told me he’d worn a condom and he was hoping she’d abort but to no avail. 

I have met the future mother of my grandchild in a very awkward meeting one day and it’s clear to me she’s a lovely young lady. However I found out from her (not even my coward son) that he has broken all ties with her and plans only to give child support and not see this baby at all. 

I have been texting her and trying to assuage her worries but she is also understandably worried that she won’t have any support and that her baby- my first grandchild- won’t have its father. Obviously I am very much wanting to be in this child’s life also.

Of course I have been trying to speak to my son over and over about this issue and I keep telling him that the deed is done and he needs to just deal with it now. He told me in tears that he never wanted to be a father and he wore protection, as well as the fact they were casual lovers and nothing more. I told him I would withdraw all financial assistance if he wasn’t in this babies life and he told me if that was the case then so be it, so I took his car and phone and bank cards that were attached to my account. 

In response to this, he’s moved in with his father but I have no idea where he lives and he’s not even attempted once to contact me. He told me he was leaving and that I wasn’t supporting him. My own parents are vehemently against him leaving and have said they’ll disown him if he doesn’t come back.

He hasn’t shown any sign of wanting to learn or get better, he’s just happy to do the bare minimum and spend the rest of the day playing mobile games and posting stories on Instagram.

It’s my birthday next week and in our team it is a tradition for the celebrant to treat everyone out to lunch. But I don’t want to invite my Jerry to go with us. I want this to be a happy occasion and his being there will just remind everyone how annoyed we are at him.

If he did he would feel shame for making us carry his dead weight ass.

I told my co-worker Donna about this, she said that it was mean and might even be construed as bullying. Donna also dislikes Jerry but she thinks we should just suck it up and be civil to him for the duration of the two hour lunch, for the sake of a ‘peaceful’ work environment. She says if we openly exclude Jerry, it might result to tensions in our workplace.

There’s twists, hills and dangerous short slip roads. 

There’s even petrol stations literally just off it which don’t even have a slip road, so people have to stop to enter onto the dual carriageway. 

Also, I’ve only been driving on my own since March. I’m not afraid of dual carriageways in general, it’s this stretch of road which I don’t feel safe on. 

Anyway, I was coming up to a petrol station and a car is stopped waiting to enter the dual carriageway. If it was a short slip road I would normally go into the right lane, but I kept on going, expecting for the car to enter the road when there was a larger gap. 

I can’t remember if there was any traffic to my right, but this guy just pulls out in front of me and I literally have to pump the breaks. There’s also a lorry behind me. Traffic was relatively heavy at the time as this morning rush hour and I was going 60mph.

When he pulls out in front I sound the horn. This is the first time I’ve ever done this, but I was fuming. 

However, I’m now second guessing myself. 

Was I the asshole for not going into the right lane or should he have waited when there was a larger gap in traffic?

All opinions are appreciated as I always aim to improve as a driver and be safe.

TLDR - car entered a dual carriageway too slow, and I beeped the horn at him because I had to pump the breaks. AITA for not going in the right lane or should they have waited?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

c2ux3n	2019-06-20 11:34:51	throwawaybabey69	WIBTA if I cut contact with my Dad?	"Throwaway for reasons. I (22f) live in Ireland if that helps.

My Dad left my Mom a little under 9 years ago. Just got up one morning, packed his bags, and left. My Mom was a stay-at-home parent, so he would send her some money every week for bills/groceries, but obviously this was still a huge upheaval of our lives. I was 14 at the time, but thankfully my two older brothers were old enough to get part-time jobs and help out.

Cutting a lot here to fit inside the character limit, but basically I used to see my Dad semi-regularly but haven't seen him since Christmas 2017 because I keep saying no whenever he asks me out to dinner/lunch. I don't like seeing my Dad. We were never particularly close when he still lived with us, so I've never had much of a relationship with him. The only reason I meet up with him is for my Mom. She wants us to have some sort of relationship, so I just do it to make her happy. I've also never met him on my own, it's always with either my Mom or at least one of my brothers. A few weeks ago he asked me out to lunch (just the two of us) and I said yes just to get him to stop bothering me about meeting up, but the night before my grown 22-year-old ass starts getting all pissy and depressed, trying not to cry when talking to my Mom. She tells me if it's gonna upset me this much I should just not go. So I cancel on him, saying I feel too sick.

Fast forward to now, where he asks me what my plans are next week, etc. I haven't responded yet. Every time I plan to see him I get upset, or depressed, or straight-up angry. It ruins my day or even week. It's been nearly 9 years since he left us and I'm just tired of trying to keep up this relationship I don't want. My Dad isn't a particularly bad person, I just straight-up don't like him. Don't like how he left us (the way he went about it, not the leaving itself. No point staying in an unhappy marriage). Don't like how he's treated my Mom at points (he once accused her of turning me and my eldest brother against him, which is absolute BS since she's the only reason I meet up with him). Don't like how he treats other people (he's the kinda guy who complains at minimum-wage workers just doing their jobs).  Don't like how he got 35% of our house in the divorce so now me, my Mom, and eldest brother (other brother lives in another city) have to sell and find a new home in the next year. I know that's technically not his fault but our family is literally suffering from his decision to leave so I don't really care. As I said, we never really had a relationship when he lived with us, so why do I have to have one now?

I know it probably sounds petty and childish but I just don't want to do this anymore. So WIBTA if I responded to his latest message saying how I appreciate the effort he's made in trying to meet up with me and stuff, but I just don't want to see him anymore?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

In March 2018 my mom found out my dad was in a relationship with another woman. Long story short, he moved out and in with his new partner (NP) few months later. My mom has been devastated and my dad is happy with his new life. I'm happy for him but sad for my mom.

I moved back home and stayed with my mom Jul-Dec 2018. I also (at first reluctantly) visited my dad in his new home many times and have gotten to know NP. We get along but I'm not attached to her at all (yet, maybe).

I moved abroad again in Jan 2019. My mom visited in April and we had a great time. I've been asking my dad when will he come for a visit because I miss him, too. He suggested a visit this autumn which I was glad to hear.

The problem is, he asked if NP can come with him. Honestly, NP is loud and assertive and I feel my dad and me can't connect around her. She's not bad, she's actually funny and alright, but I miss my dad. I'm also not too keen on having NP in my home for 10 days because I'm worried how that would make my mom feel (who is still hurt and recovering--she loves my dad), but I also don't want to hurt my dad's and NP's feelings.

c2uwpl	2019-06-20 11:33:32	kakarikiloki	AITA for not wanting to talk to my brother?	"My brother (17m) and I(19f) used to be very close a few years ago. We hung out every day, listened to the same music, talked about everything. He has autism, but not severely. He has had a lot of fights with my dad about anything and everything. After those fights, I would always sit with him until he calmed down and he would speak his mind and let out his frustrations.
This went on for at least two years before it suddenly stopped. I finished high school (Dutch one) and decided to take a gap year, which resulted in me leaving for a month. My brother was going a bit into the wrong direction: smoking, hanging out with friends until late nights. Noteworthy: he was 14/15 at the time. I got back and he didn't talk to me the way he did before. I got into a relationship and we drifted apart.

Skip ahead two years: my brother is now going through a very hard time. He has said he was depresses multiple times. He smokes cigarettes and weed. He drinks. Normal for his age and I don't care that it is like this. But he is also a brat. He HAS to get what he want. If one of my parents doesn't agree with him, he'll throw a tantrum about it. I have heard him scream that he'll jump off a building if he doesn't get his phone back, after my parents took it as a fair punishment.

I have moved out now, I live within travel distance but not walking distance from my parents. I do see them at least once a week. He's been horrible to me since I left home. Some examples:
-A few weeks ago, my bf(23m) and I left for a week on holiday. Everyone was saying goodbye, hugging. He just shrugged, said he wouldn't see me either way for the week and left to his room.
-We were barbequeing at my parents house and he kept laughing about how he once threw a book at my other brother (14m). No one thought it was funny, but he kept going. I felt uneasy and told him it wasn't funny and that he should stop. He started screaming at me about how I'm not perfect either, and that I shouldn't talk about his imperfections. Then he ran off and would only return when we left.

He doesn't want to have a normal conversation. He quit school. He can ignore my parents for days if they didn't give him what he wants.
And I hate being around him because of this. I don't want to talk while walking on eggshells. One wrong word and hell hate me for a few days. And then it's all fixed and he'll tell me jokes I don't understand. And it'll happen all over again.

Tl;dr: my brother became a brat over recent years and now I can't stand having a conversation with him.

c2uw7g	2019-06-20 11:31:56	bassinlimbo	WIBTA if I got involved in my partner's family drama?	" 

For background I have been seeing my BF for six months, which isn't a long amount of time especially for family situations but I am feeling conflicted. Boyfriend (BF) lives with father (J), and BF's grandma (GM) lives with his cousin (A). About a month ago BF's grandpa (GP) passed. As a father J has little boundaries and treats him more as a friend but is constantly condescending to bf and there is a physically and emotionally abusive history. Bf's sister is NC with their father. Sorry in advance if things are a little confusing.

Now onto the situation. Three weeks ago BF and J went to GM's house to sort out GP's passing. They cleaned out his room and helped everyone get affairs in order. The entire weekend BF was calling me upset at how J was stomping around the house making things miserable for everyone. He yelled about how they were living, insulted them, and kept trying to ""take over"" so to speak. He's the type of guy that will constantly stop you with whatever you are doing and show you the ""right way"" while acting as if you are stupid for doing it any other way. BF called me to tell me after one instance J was in a screaming match with his BIL (A's father) about GP and how they were taking care of GM - it got to the point where A was between the two of them crying. The fight was essentially that J lives hundreds of miles away and unless he is physically going to be there then he doesn't get as much of a say, then J tried to get physical when A stepped in between. J continuously got angrier at anyone disagreeing with his opinion, until they were yelling at him to get out, and he grabbed A by the wrists. BF stepped in to physically stop his father from harming BIL or A.

This is just one incident from the long weekend. I understand that everyone handles grief differently. From what I know from BF, BF's sister, personal experience, and A, I don't like J. He's entitled and selfish. A and I have talked on the phone a few times but I wouldn't necessarily call us close - though I do like her a lot. If it weren't for her then I would definitely stay out of this dumpster fire. Over this past weekend I was with BF and J when J mentioned that he wanted to rent a car and show up unannounced and force them to do things his way. He laughed and almost bragged about his plan and it really rubbed me the wrong way. Part of me really wants to warn A because of what happened last time, and the idea of him showing up just to wreck havoc makes me angry for her. She has expressed her own struggles with him over the years to me from his misogyny to financial control he takes whenever he can over her and her family. I don't want her to be blindsided. However I am afraid that telling her would make me the asshole since it's not really my business and my boyfriend might get blamed by J if he finds out. My BF seemed unsure of what to do but obviously I would take his opinion over anyone else's as it is his family. So from an unbiased standpoint - WIBTA if I warned A?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2uvbl	2019-06-20 11:29:16	Bawsack15	"AITA for leaving our friends' wedding ""early""?"	" 

In  October, my partner (M) and I attended the wedding of our friends; the  groom was my best buddy at university, and the bride was the equivalent  to M. We've drifted a bit, but are still close enough to be part of the  wedding party - groomsman and bridesmaid, respectively.

Important  to mention that we are Scottish, and the cultural norm is that weddings  are an all-day and all-night event. We've been to a dozen weddings in  the last five years, and generally they last from early afternoon until  the wee hours.

My  partner was part of a sleepover at the bride's house the night before  the wedding. I arrived at the venue at 1100. The event began at 1230 and  lasted until about 1400. Photos and drinks until 1600, then  dinner/speeches until 1800. The reception began at 1900; a band played  until 2200, after which a DJ came on. We left at 2300.

Immediately  after the wedding, both bride and groom began behaving strangely. Bride would rarely reply to M's texts, while groom would outright ignore any  contact from me.

It  came to a head yesterday: M and I received a Facebook invite to their  housewarming party on Saturday, but after checking out the event page  discovered that it had been organised for months, and that we had only  been invited at the last minute. Something about this rubbed us the  wrong way, because all of our extended friend group had been posting on  the page about the party since early May.

So M decided to text bride, saying the following:

""Hi  bride, just got the FB invite to your housewarming. I think it would be  a bit weird to attend when you and groom haven't replied to either of  us in months. If we've done something to offend you, please tell us.""

Today (24 hours later) she got a reply which said yeah, you have done  something to offend us: you left our wedding early, didn't talk to us  enough at the wedding, and didn't seem to be having a good time.

M  has not replied yet because we're looking for advice on how to proceed.  I mean yeah, we technically did leave ""early"" - but I'd still consider  12 hours to be a pretty good shift.

If  I'm being honest, neither partner or I find weddings very thrilling; we're at the age where we attend a lot of them, and they're mostly all  the same. That said, we both did have a good time - it was a nice event.  Neither of us are big drinkers though, so weren't really in the 4am  party rager mood.

Also - and this bit is quite bad but I'm including it in the interest of  full disclosure - about 15 minutes before we left, the mother of the  groom caught M and I in a big ""contagious"" simultaneous yawn and err...  gave us into trouble? for it, I guess. What can I say here? Yes, we were  fucking tired! It doesn't mean that I wasn't having a good time, it  just meant that my mind was reaching exhaustion point. So we left (of  course after saying our goodbyes, we're not savages).

c2uq6v	2019-06-20 11:12:50	throwaway2019373638	AITA for absolutely hating my manager?	"I'm going to try to summarize the issues I have with my manager (F31) & my (F20) faults as best as I can. 

1). I believe my manager handles employees' mistakes poorly. She screams at employees & has a tendency to publicly humiliate them (she yells in front of staff & customers). When she yells at you, she doesn't give you a chance to explain yourself. She calls it ""talking back"", ""not taking criticism well"", & that it makes you ""uncoachable"". She has taken numerous things out of context with my coworkers & I, as such has yelled at us for things that weren't our fault/things she didn't witness. I also don't believe this is criticism, or tough love, as it's not constructive - it's borderline abusive.

2). She has mood swings; employees have to mentally prepare themselves for what version of her they are going to get. Some days we are literally afraid to ask her questions. I have been scared to go into work. 

3). She has favorites & gives them privileges. i.e. there's an employee (Sue) who talks very condescendingly & rude to other employees because Sue knows she won't get in trouble for it. Sue also hangs out with my manager, even though we were explicitly told when we were hired that ""hanging out"" with managers was inappropriate. She always gives her favorites every day they request off, the hours they want, & the shifts they want while other employees will have their days off rejected & such.

4). My manager is inappropriate with the males (most of which are underage). She flirts with them, calls them ""handsome"" & that they are ""hers"". She told me no one is allowed to date a certain employee because no girl could ever be ""good enough for him"". It's obvious that she makes them uncomfortable. She got drunk & sent a topless photo of her to an 18-year-old employee. 

5). She gossips about everyone. Not a favorite/a male she finds attractive? Gets gossiped about. She has gossiped to me about my coworkers & I have overheard her talking about other coworkers.

Here's where I am the potential asshole - I talk shit about her. I criticize her for all of the things listed above, & in much more aggressive/vulgar fashion than I wrote here. She heard some of the stuff I have said about her & said I was spreading rumors to my coworkers, among other things. I'm not upset that she is talking shit about me (since I do about her) but what I am concerned with is if I am actually being an asshole in how much shit I talk about her & if she is justified in talking shit about me, or if I am right to be angry with her & talk about her in such an asshole-y way whenever work gets brought up in conversation. I absolutely despise her behavior & I think she is extremely inappropriate but I could also be a shitstarter & not realize my behavior is just as bad.

(I also realize it's stupid to gossip about your boss - I find her so incredibly disgusting & mean that it's difficult to keep my mouth shut when her character is so repulsive to me)."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c2upj9	2019-06-20 11:10:39	mtsaria	AITA for canceling a family road trip?	"My husband and I made plans a few weeks ago to take our toddler on a six-hour road trip to visit some good friends in a scenic part of the country. We planned to leave on Friday morning. This is why I canceled the trip:

My husband's car is 15 years old and has 265k miles on it. (He's said repeatedly that he wants to hit 300k.) The check engine and brake lights have been on for several months. A few weeks ago, the car overheated and died while I was driving it, and he discovered a crack in the radiator that he sealed with some kind of epoxy. (He previously said that it probably just needed fluid.) Then the brakes started grinding, and after a few days he agreed to take it into the shop. In the interim, the brakes failed to catch correctly while I was driving our daughter home from daycare, and I narrowly avoided an accident. He had the brakes replaced (although previously he'd said, as with the radiator, that they only needed fluid).

Now the check engine light is flashing, and the car is shaking at speeds above 50mph. Every Google search result says this indicates a misfire that could result in catastrophic engine damage (something about the catalytic converter). My husband says he's narrowed it down to a fuel injector problem, and he wants to repair it himself today and go on the road trip tomorrow as planned. I told him that I didn't trust the car and didn't want our daughter in it, and I texted our friends last night and said we couldn't go.

Now my husband is angry--he thinks I'm being anxious for no reason because he knows cars better than I do and has done ""hundreds of hours of research"" into car repair. (He is not a mechanic, but he is very handy, and he's made successful car repairs in the past.)

Last night, I was talking about some summer courses I’m taking and he said something that kind of rang a bell in my head.

“Well at least now you have some courses so it can be easier when you do go to college.”

I told him I’ve been in college for two years now, and asked him how old he thought I was. He said 19, I’m 20. And I do look young for my age, so I didn’t think much about it. So I asked him how old he was and he said, “17, turning 18 soon.”

Now I know that’s only two years, but I still feel a little icky, as this kid is LITERALLY STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL.

To clarify, he does not look 17, maybe in the face at best but I also look young so I figured that was why. He’s pretty built and from afar I guessed he was 20-21 and just looked young. He’s a nice guy otherwise, hasn’t said anything else alarming and seems decent enough (but it’s only been two days).

So, WIBTA if I stopped talking to him because of his age alone?

UPDATE: I don’t really know if anyone will care, but we hung out for 5 hours, just talking and getting to know each other. It was honestly so much fun. I’d lose my train of thought as soon as I’d look at him, I’d just get lost in his eyes.

I also asked him about my intentions, asked him what he thought I wanted out of this, and expressed my concerns to him. He was an absolute sweetheart about it and no, he did not expect sex because I made the first move, he was just happy I did.

My dad wants me to get a job in the area of some sort of computer programming or Java, and in my area, this is a required course for the such.

Last year in the summer vacation I just barely got into the course and quit because my regular physical school was so close to starting up again, and I didn't want another class to go along with my physical classes.

This year in the summer vacation I actually had more time to look more in-depth in the course and try to do some assignments...and honestly, I just don't find it the least bit interesting. And when I don't find things interesting, I don't perform well.

My (22f) boyfriend (23m) is from Russia. He moved to my country when he was about 3, I think, so he basically grew up here and holds my country's citizenship. 
When we started dating (around 3 years ago) and I met his family, I developed an interest in his culture, particularly the food and traditions. I started learning Russian as well, because I like having that connection with him and his family. I occasionally shop for snacks at Russian supermarkets, and I don't think that's super weird considering that is where my boyfriend is from and that I kind of fell in love with his culture.

However, one of my friends has been telling me that I use my boyfriend's culture for ""wokeness points"" and to make myself feel included in something that isn't for me. I don't think that's what I'm doing, because I rarely bring his immigration history up (his name is Russian so it's obvious that he's an immigrant anyway). I do however talk about Russian culture quite a lot because that's what I'm now interested in and I like to share new things I've learned. I'm now worried I'm kind of ""fetishizing"" his origins.

Communication kind of feels one way, if I get upset at something she  takes it super personal and makes it hard for me to get my point across with out offending her. On the other hand when I do something that upsets her she kind of treats it like a get out jail free card.

  So on to the asshole bit. I recently broke my leg, so for the most part I’m home bound. At first I liked being home from work but it got old quick, GF doesn’t get home till 5 and usually kicks it for an hour or so at home and then leaves to go to the gym if she doesn’t have errands to run, in which case she runs the errands and goes straight to the gym. Her routine isn’t that efficient so she takes a long time working out.(side note, Before I dropped out of college I was taking athletic training courses, because of this she asked me to make a routine for her, I did but she doesn’t follow it because her friend wants to do other excercises) One day as she was about to leave I mention that I’m feeling kind of lonely because she’s been so busy. I think she understood it like it was my way of saying I didn’t want her to go out because she got super offended. Started ranting about me holding her back from doing the things she wants to do, being controlling, not supporting her gym aspirations and so forth, so instead of me trying to counter her points or give examples of how the thing she says is not true I just got a few clothes together and hobbled my way back to my parents house. Where I have been for about a week, before I left I told her that I was tired of not being able to have a constructive conversation with out it devolving into finger pointing.
She had nothing to say. So for the past week she’s been sending me generic I miss you, come home texts and calls but doesn’t leave a voicmail. It irks me cus I was clear why I needed space from her and she still refuses to address the problem, she kind of treating it like it’s only my problem and after I stew over it I’ll come back to her. Will I be the asshole if I officially end things with her on her birthday? I gave her a lot of time to get her thoughts out but the lack of effort and sincerity in her messages makes me feel like I shouldn’t care. 

TL;DR. Tired of GFs inability to communicate and solve problems WIBTA if I officially end things with her on her birthday or should I wait for a more tactful time?"	Asshole	0	0

c2u626	2019-06-20 10:03:42	Ovulatingliger	AITA for being interested in my married best friends high school crush?	"Tl,dr at the bottom. 
My (20) best friend (20) has been married for one year now and has been in her relationship for four years total. I have known her for eight years. She expresses all the time that she is very happy and wants to stay with him (20). I am single, and have been for a couple months. As a normal 20 yr old, I’m on tinder. I matched with a guy one day and thought he looked familiar so I screenshot the picture, and sent it to her, asking where we knew him from. It turns out, during our sophomore year of high school, he went to the same school as us. She developed strong feelings for him during that time. I asked her why she never told him about her feelings back then and she said since she was moving to the other side of town at that time, which means different schools, there was no point. When I told her that we matched on tinder, she seemed angry. I asked if she was bothered by it but she said no. 
Usually, I would believe someone when they say they don’t have a problem. However, she usually doesn’t admit that she feels angry about a situation until after more than a week, when she’s already overthought the situation. 
I have been talking to him every other day, getting to know him, seeing where it goes.
I, personally, don’t see any issue since she is permanently taken and happy. 
Am I the asshole for not following girl code, and talking to a guy she use to have interest in? 

Tl,dr: My best friend, who has been happily married for a year, seems put off by the fact that I am talking to and connecting with a guy she use to have strong feelings for."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2u5e0	2019-06-20 10:01:37	__Haplo__	AITA for asking bride's sister not to wear a striking dress?	"First-time poster and long time lurker here. I have read plenty of incredible AITA, and I consider mine pretty tame in comparison, so I'll keep it short and simple.

My fiancee (A) and I are getting married, and her sister (S) is looking for a dress. She has shown A various dresses, and she liked most of them. However, yesterday she thought about choosing one that A didn't like, as she thought it was too striking \[[photo of the dress](https://imgur.com/a/CJY5pcL)\]. She then asked me, and I told her sister that I found the dress inappropriate for two main reasons:

1. She is the bride's only sister, and she would stand out in all the pictures, as the bride would be wearing white, and the rest of attendants probably nothing that striking.
2. She would be gathering the wrong kind of attention, think ""WOW, is that the bride's sister?"" instead of ""Oh, that's the bride's sister"".

S got really annoyed and started saying that everyone she had asked liked the dress. However, after talking about it, she admitted she initially thought that it was too striking, to which the shop attendant told her: ""you are the bride's sister, you can afford to draw attention to you"". She actually mentioned the shop attendant's comment as another reason to wear it, as she thinks she also deserves some attention.

We don't have any issue with her wearing that dress, as we think is nice, is just that we don't find the style appropriate for the wedding. Particularly when it's the only dress (out of many) that we don't like. AWTA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I should have expected this outcome, but I am still shocked at some of the comments. It's your opinion, but I still wanted to clarify some points:

1. For the people who inferred that the bride doesn't want her sister to look better, that's not the issue. You'll have to trust me when I say no one wants her to look bad. She will look stunning whatever she wears, she has suggested really nice dresses that looked really good. However, we just thought this particular one looked out of place (think Jessica rabbit, as they are both also ginger) and she could wear a dress more in line with the occasion. I don't mean ""striking"" as in ""too good"".
2. For the people thinking the bride got annoyed, she didn't. I was the one creating this post because her sister asked for my opinion too, that's why I'm involved, we have a very close relationship. I gave it, and then the bride's sister got annoyed because we didn't like one of the dozens of dresses she had suggested. Again, some more provocative than the one we posted, but in a different colour.
3. For the people who expected a shockingly slutty dress. No, is not as you would have expected. This is just a tame AITA about the couple getting married not liking a single dress, and the bride's sister getting really annoyed about it."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2u52d	2019-06-20 10:00:28	ailehole	AITA for being upset that my family doesn’t want to go on a 3 day vacation with me for my 21st?	"I’m turning 21 in a few weeks.

The water park is a 2 hour drive from where we live so I was planning to rent out a house and hang at the water park and also explore the malls and food in the city. 

This was in the works at least 5 months beforehand.
I love water parks/theme parks and I wanted to spend time with my family there. We used to go during my childhood all the time but we haven’t been together in 3 years. 
I’m the middle child and my older sister is married and always busy and my little sister is 17 and spends most her time at school, practice, or hanging with friends. 

I feel like I may be acting a little entitled and over dramatic but 5 months ago, when I was talking about this trip, they all promised me we could go. 

Then they all went off on their own trips, said they can’t take anymore time off work/doesn’t want to spend anymore money, and would only spend 1 day with me. 

That upsets me because we all haven’t hung out together in ages, I just feel like 1 day isn’t enough, considering it’s a 4 hour drive the whole road trip, so basically we’d only have a few hours together at the park. 
Plus I’ve always felt like the most memorable parts about trips is when you’re all hanging together in the hotel, not the trip itself. 

I haven’t celebrated my birthday since I turned 14 and I just want to use my birthday wish to spend a couple days with family before we all start our own families. A part of me feels like I shouldn’t be expecting everyone to drop what they’re doing to accommodate me, but another part of me has not asked for anything for my birthday for 7 years, is it really too much to spend 3 days together as a family again?"

Christmas with my parents is always uncomfortable for me, my mother has severe schizophrenia and my relationship with my father is tumultuous and we can have heated arguments over the smallest of things, mostly initiated by him but I am to blame as well. Because of this every Christmas dinner I have ever spent with my parents is a mixture of my father and I angrily sitting in silence after the yearly Christmas argument, while my mother messily eats her Christmas dinner. Because of this I've grown to loathe and dread Christmas, and so I want to spend it away from my parents for the first time in my life so I can actually have a nice day. My girlfriends mother has invited me to spend Christmas with them, and I want to more than anything. My worry is that I am being unfair on both my parents, especially my mother. My father would likely be seriously offended and angry at me for not coming home to spend the day with them, but mainly because it will mean I won't see my mother. My mother will probably really miss me, as I don't go home very often for the aforementioned reasons. I don't want to have an awful Christmas, but I don't want to upset them.

I think there’s no shame in plastic surgery or natural beauty alike. My bf says that while I can do what I want with my body, he thinks I’m giving into societal norms and doesn’t care for it. He thinks I look great, but no offense to him, i’m doing this for myself. FYI my nose is a little crooked from a childhood accident, plus genetics gave me a lady gaga nose so I just want it smooth and straight.

The “societal norms” comment kinda bothered me tho - that I’m doing this for approval from others or something. I reminded him that I recently got laser hair removal, which he is all good with, and I told him *that’s* more of a societal norm. I told him it was a little misogynistic (?) that he likes my **permanent** hairless skin but calls me out for wanting plastic surgery. This happened a while ago but I’m probably going to follow through with the nose job soon, so I wanted some input: Did I go too far in calling him misogynistic? Did he go too far? AITA?"		1	0

c2u00t	2019-06-20 09:41:52		AITA for being mad at my mother for joking with extended family about her	"So, this all happened a couple of weeks ago and I’ve been thinking about it for a while. I’m too nervous to ask anyone I know in person about this, so I’m asking here.

For context, I’m a teenager, 15, the oldest of four kids. I’ve always felt responsible for my younger siblings, as most older siblings do I imagine. My brother, J, who this all argument started about, is nine and I’m pretty sure suffers from some form of mental illness. He is very obsessive and meticulous, which is how the whole argument started.

My brother J and my other brother, L, were arguing because L messed with J’s baseball card collection. Arguments in my family often begin and end with screaming, so they were yelling really loud, you could hear it through the closed door of my room. My mom stormed downstairs and started yelling at J. This is normal because L is my mom’s favorite, her words. J yelled back at her and then it escalated. My mom started telling my brother that she just can’t take it anymore and she was going to send him to foster care.  It got to the point where she was pretending to dial the phone and was grabbing my brother, shoving him into his room, telling him to start packing his bags. At this point I worried for my siblings’ safety and herded all three of them into my brother’s room and locked them in. I comforted them while I called my dad and asked him to please hurry home. He got home, than we had a family meeting. It basically ended with my family all agreeing to respect each other.

A couple days later we were visiting extended family and I heard my mom telling my aunts about how my siblings and I were crying because she thought she was actually going to call foster care on my brother and how funny it was. My aunts thought it sounded funny too. I got angry and made a joke how “Emotionally scarring your children is just hilarious.” After the party my mom told me that I was being rude, I told her she shouldn’t have told our family about this. She thinks I’m overreacting.

TL;DR: My mother yells at my brother, threatening to send him to foster care. A week later my mom is joking to extended family how we thought she actually was going to send him to foster care. I get mad about it and my mother tells me I’m overreacting.

c2tvov	2019-06-20 09:26:17	dharmisius	AITA if I don’t want to share a room with my adult sister?	"Some background.  I’m a 19 year old girl.  I’m out of high school and i work part time at a sandwich chain.  5 years ago my family drastically downsized from our apartment to this rented house.   The house is small but with all of our huge furniture it makes it feel smaller.  

When we moved it was just me.  My mom.  My stepdad.  And my younger brother all in this 3 bedroom 1 bath.  No big deal.  Whatever.  

I drew the short end of the stick and got the smallest room in the house.  I’m not a brat so again whatever.  

A year into living here I got into a very heated argument with my stepdad.  He tried to punch my door to intimidate me??? And to show I didn’t give a fuck about his angry outburst and I also punched my door.  

I got my door taken away.  

Now I have a curtain.  A thick black curtain.  

My sister (27) didn’t move in with us.   But she moved in with her boyfriend and that (obvi) didn’t and wasn’t gonna work out so she packed her things and moved in with us after 5 years of us being here.   She decided to share room with me.  

I don’t even have a door.  So I definitely didn’t have a say in this situation.  And I was told to stop being selfish when I protested.  

So she’s in here.  And it’s like sharing a room with a toddler. She smokes in here so my room and bed and shit smell like weed.  I smoke too but she can’t even function if she doesn’t smoke.   And I have the decency towards myself to not smoke in my small bedroom.  She leaves trash in my already small space and she keeps her shit in trash bags and a broken clothes hamper.  

I asked her if she wanted space in my small closet and I also offered to get her a new hamper.  But she just wants to act like a fucking hobo.   

She’s a horrible roommate and she’s also put multiple holes in my air mattress that we share for now because she overfills it and plops down on the bed.   I’ve bought patches.  I’ve even bought new beds but she still does the same fucking shit.  Then she snores and I mean like.  She sounds like a grown man with several breathing problems.  She shakes the whole fucking bed.  

She’s been here a year.  I haven’t slept right in a year and I haven’t been comfortable in my room for a year.  I’m about to spaz.  

Am I the asshole if I do so???

"My father in law has made it a habit for the last 5 years to come and spend weeks at my house to celebrate Christmas together with us. MIL passed away 6 years ago so it's understandable that he doesn't want to celebrate alone. Christmas is a big thing for everyone in my family and my wife's.

My wife and I are devoted vegan and animal rights activists. FIL is not. It bothers my wife so much that her father thinks it's ok to eat meat at our house, but I told her that we can't hate him for not being vegan.

Last year though, on Christmas Eve, we went home to find him chopping large portions of a pig in our kitchen, blood, viscera, and bone fragments everywhere, which horrified us. My wife flew off the handle and told him to get out of the house. He did not understand why we were making such a big fuss about him cooking an animal. He was simply 'making his own Christmas dinner'. But my wife had had enough.

Later he apologized to us and things were okay again between FIL and us. But yesterday he called and said that he would come to celebrate Christmas again with us this year. I told him we're sorry but after last year, we've decided that he is no longer allowed to celebrate Christmas with us at our house. He got upset and even started to apologize again, but we would not change our minds.

My mother thinks we're overeacting a bit about the pig incident. She even said ""Do you guys know how it feels being alone on christmas eve?  Poor man!""
Am I The Asshole?

Edit : We still allow him to come over and visit us from time to time. But we have decided it is too much for us if he stays longer than a week since he refuses to not eat meat in our house. I can tolerate him doing that for a couple of days. But my wife can not!"	Asshole	0	0

For the 3 years C has dated B (31M), she has always complained about him. She’d often call me up to get our nails done and rant to me about how he didn’t show her affection, treat her as his equal, etc. Most recently he had decided to move into a house with his brother instead of her.

Just two hours back while driving in the rain with my mom, a bike came and crashed into the rear end of my car. I slowed my car down behind a bus...and that's wen the bike came and rammed into my car.it wasn't at high speed or anything...but It was the bike rider's mistake and he accepted it 

After the crash my mom immediately got out of the car and went to inspect the rear end...and then went on to scream at the biker(he was back up on his feet by then). I put the parking brake on and got out and then checked the car myself...the damages weren't anything serious...just something that a paint job could fix...once I saw the car was alright I asked the biker if he was alright...and just made sure he was alright to ride again...

Apparantly this was a very big mistake I made...my mom kept shouting at me and telling  me on the drive back home how I shouldn't be so soft. And how the world isn't made for nice people..and how because it was the bikers mistake..I should've been more aggressive..I didn't accept this and defended myself and told her this isn't what parents are supposed to tell their children...back home mom told dad what happened and he too began telling me that I shudnt be soft and stuff like that...I don't at all understand why asking someone if they're fine(after making sure we didn't have heavy damages)is a problem..so we had a kind of a fight

My girlfriend and I are expecting. we're about 6 weeks along. 

We went to urgent care because she was having excruciating body aches and she's been feeling very weak from what we think is the pregnancy. 

During the urgent care visit, they had to do an ultrasound and my girlfriend SPECIFICALLY requested that I be present during the ultrasound, but I was not allowed to enter the room with her, even though she wanted me, the father of the child, there.

I was getting increasingly frustrated because this is something that I want to be a part of. Like I said, I'm the father and I want to be a part of every step of this journey. And to not be allowed to see my child was pissing me off, even though the patient, my GF, wanted me there. I asked the doctors why I wasn't able to see her and they just kept giving me the same excuse that they ""need to do their [our] job"" and me being there would prevent them from doing so. I kept telling them that I don't see how I'd be in the way, considering all I'd be doing is sitting next to my girlfriend while she's getting her belly checked.

c2tnv6	2019-06-20 08:57:54		WIBTA if I started charging my bandmates gas money before we use my car?	"Hey there Reddit,

My bandmates have always suggested using my car for driving as it gets really good gas mileage, making it cheaper all around for everyone. Although, the car is manual and I’m the only one who knows how to drive it. I’m fine with driving, so long as they respect my car and actually pay me gas money. We needed to pick up our drummer for recording this week and my drummer lives about an hour and a half away. My guitarist and I start our journey and along the way I mention gas money. It’s about 90 miles, my tank gets 28 to the gallon and gas is about 3.60 where i’m from. The total cost of the trip would be around $25. I asked if he and the drummer would pay $10 in gas each. The guitarist agreed and we happily made our way to the destination. 

When it came time to fill up, the guitarist argued that it was unfair he was paying double what I would be and said it would be fair if we split it evenly. I declined and said since we are using my car a lot for moving gear around I need to factor in maintenance and not just gas itself. They said they shouldn’t have to contribute to maintenance and we should just split it fairly since this trip benefits me as well. I ended up paying for the whole trip out of anger and rejected any money they offered. I told them if we can’t agree on a price beforehand then we can’t take my car anymore and they said that’s fine but we’d have to pay more money in gas since the other bandmates car gets nearly half the gas mileage as mine does. 

I don’t want to cause strain on our relationship but I feel taken advantage of. We’ve made this round trip at least once every week for the last month or so. I am providing them a cheaper solution (my other bandmates car couldn’t even reach our destination on $10) and they still want to give the bare minimum. Not only that, but I’m trying to take better care of my car and be more conscious about its lifespan.

c2tne7	2019-06-20 08:56:09		AITA for straight up telling my GF she has been unreasonably moody and lacking in hygiene lately	"My GF of two years changed birth control method one month ago, and evidently has been having some issues with hormones as a response. Over the past few weeks I've noticed a change in how she behaves:

* In general moodier and more prone to conflict
* Goes well over 24 hours without a shower regularly despite living in a tropical climate
* Has developed some body odor issues that flat out make me not want to be near her
* Requires constant entertainment and food sources unless you want the silent treatment
* Sleeps for about 10 hours a day and does little to no exercise outside of going to her desk job

Now, I identified depression signs here pretty early, and have tried to be supportive through all this. What drove me to have a frank discussion with her was how I noticed her lack in hygiene and moods were becoming constant, and I could only assume she was taking them to work as well. We had a night out together to celebrate a promotion I got, and she went out dressed in a dress, sneakers and a jacket with her hair in a greasy bun, no deodorant and hairy legs. Our night ended after one drink when she decided to stop talking so I took us home. The whole experience was reminiscent of babysitting a 12 year old.

So after being supportive and dropping a couple of hints about the issues I decided to just tell her that she can't keep acting like this or she's going to alienate herself at work and with family/friends and ultimately me. She did not take this very well, and says that I shouldn't try to change her and that she was trying her best. I stood my ground a bit longer and mentioned that it isn't difficult to shower daily when you only work 20 hours a week, and again she took it badly. This was a few days ago and while I've seen a small improvement in these issues she won't stop making remarks about how I don't find her attractive or that maybe she's just not good enough.

c2tn4r	2019-06-20 08:55:12	canitellyouasecret	AITA for moving my son and I across the world away from his uninterested father	"Rare poster, on mobile, this is a long story so bare with me. 

I (23 F) ended up unexpectedly pregnant whenever I was 19 with someone i had only been seeing about 4 months. I realized soon after he was not the type of person i wanted to raise a child with. Very immature, expected me to do everything for him etc. So I left him soon after and that's when the verbal abuse started. 

Constant fights with him. Him accusing me of cheating. Etc. It never ended. I didnt cut contact with him only for the baby. I grew up without a father and didnt want that for my child. 

When the baby came he refused to sign the birth certificate until we got a paternity test. The verbal abuse continued. Even after the paternity test he didnt want to sign the bc. Where we were living if an unmarried couple has a child, full custody goes to the mother until the father brings her to court to petition for custody. He never went through with that. We agreed to write out and get notarized a parenting plan. He never followed through with that. 

He saw the baby MAYBE 8 times in 2 and 1/2 years. Never provided anything for the baby. To get free childcare while I was in school I had to take him to court for child support, but in my state child support doesnt equal custody so he still did not have guardianship of the baby. 

With CS I got roughly $300 a month. Which he constantly throws in my face saying ""that should more than cover half of the baby's expenses"" parents you can all laugh with me at that one. 

Anyways enough back story; I got offered by some family who are over seas to let me and my son live with them rent free while I finished up school online and I agreed. This has by far been the best decision I've ever made in my opinion. My son is thriving. He is starting to speak two languages and we have built a fabulous community of family and friends here that all love him, a support system I did not have where we were. I also have several good paying jobs and I'm able to even pay rent and save which is something I could have never done where I was previously. 

Last night the father was texting me telling me how shitty of a mother I was to do this to my child. How he would have helped if I wouldve just swallowed my pride and asked him, even though history has proven other wise. He claims I have taken something irreplaceable from my son, even though I have made and initiated all the contact between them. They only video chat whenever I ask for my son's sake and last night he informed me he thought video chatting with the baby wasn't worth it because the baby doesnt understand. 

My heart hurts for my son. I wanted so so much better for him than this situation I have put him in... so after this really really brief description, I ask you people of reddit, AITA??.. 

**I referred to my son as the baby alot even though he is a toddler now because let's be honest, hes my baby Haha."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2tn3d	2019-06-20 08:55:01		AITA passing down baby clothes	"Last night my BIL told us they're having their 4th baby. 
Without asking it's clear that this wasn't planned. He was in a car accident a few months back where he broke his neck, and it's still unclear if it's disabled him in any way and if so how bad it is. 
Since she hasn't been able to find a job since her last maternity leave ended that puts them in a tough spot financially. 
None of this is any of my business, but I can't help but feel that they're being very irresponsible. Even before the accident they seemed overwhelmed with 3 kids and they rely a lot on others to make ends meet.

I know I probably sound a bit resentful and jealous, and to be completely honest I am. But I feel like that with anyone who more or less just has to look at each other to get pregnant. We had to go through several miscarriages and completely change our life to deal with fertility issues to have ours.
All of this was probably irrelevant but now you have some backstory.

During this my SIL mentioned that they would love to get our daughters clothes when she grows out of it if they're having a girl. As well as some other stuff, too, like her carseat.
I don't know why, but the way she said it annoys me a lot. Like she just thought our daughters stuff was up for grabs or something. 

A lot of our daughters clothes is something my late grandma has sewn, which there's no way they'll get. She had a little boutique with children's clothes she made herself. Most was donated but my aunt and mom both saved a few boxes of clothes for when my brother, my cousins and I started having children. 
I was the first to have a baby and everything we've used will be passed on to my family members when they have kids.

What's left of her clothes is either something I want to save for any future children we hope we'll be able to have, or something I would sell to be able to buy new clothes for my dd as she grows.

I know a lot of people would let them borrow it with the expectation of getting it back once their baby has grown out of if. 
But then I wouldn't want to use it since both of them smokes and they have both cats and a dog which I'm allergic to. In general they don't really take good care of their stuff either. 


It might be worth mentioning that she's offered us a bunch of stuff from their youngest as he's grown out of it. She'd always ask us if we wanted something (more like throw it at us aka just show up with random stuff) before donating or selling.
We've always turned it down because of the above issues.

Am I being unreasonable in not wanting to pass anything on? I'm starting to feel like I''m being petty since I wouldn't mind passing a lot of these stuff down to my own brother if he was the one having a baby."	Everyone Sucks	1	0
c2tn1v	2019-06-20 08:54:47	PsychoYam	WIBTA If I got out of my car at a light to tell someone off for texting and driving with 3 small kids in the vehicle?	"To start, let me be clear that I ***know*** this woman was an asshole.

&#x200B;

So I was driving down the road and noticed that the lady in the car in front of me kept looking down at her lap while driving down the road because I saw her eyes in her rear-view mirror. I sped up and went around her not only to give her a death stare as I drove past, but also to confirm she was texting and driving. My suspicion was confirmed, the stare received and I also noticed 3 small children in the back.

&#x200B;

I then moved over, in front of her now, and when we came to the light I looked at her in my rear view mirror; she kept mouthing ""What?!"" to me so I held up my cell phone and motioned with my hands down and she then mouthed ""No,"" shook her head at me and made sure I saw that she was still texting- albeit at a red light. She honestly had the audacity to spite me for calling her out on texting and driving with multiple children in the car. At this point I was so beyond heated at the ignorance and recklessness of this women that I unbuckled my seat belt and was about to get out of the car to go and say something along the lines of ""You have 3 kids in your car! Put you phone down while your vehicle is moving before you get yourself, these kids, and anyone of the hundreds of other people on the road seriously injured or killed!"" but my girlfriend who was in the car with me grabbed my arm and said ""Don't make yourself look like an asshole.""

&#x200B;

I listened to my gf and didn't get out. When the light turned green she laid on her horn which made me instantly regret not taking further action.

&#x200B;

So, would I be the asshole if I got out to tell this women off? Likewise, am I an asshole for calling her out?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c2tmjq	2019-06-20 08:52:44		AITA for feeling upset over my girlfriend and best friend's interactions with myself?	"So I introduced my best friend to my girlfriend a few months ago and we don't really hang out together but both of them ended up wanting to play a game and I don't so I asked if they'd want to play with each other and they decided to. Tonight was the first night I sat in call with them and we were joking around then she started to divulge personal things we do together, the color of my pubic hair, just things that make me very uncomfortable. I'd try to chime in with a story or something of the sort whenever asked just to continue to joke around but they would call me a liar whenever I told it. I ended up finding an excuse early and leaving because I felt so uncomfortable being in that call, I'm a very impersonation person unless someone asks and I just felt very violated in this situation to have stuff about me divulged after I have had this talk with my girlfriend before. I don't know how to talk with my best friend after this because I just feel awkward and uncomfortable now. It was in a joking context and I get that the mood was light but it just makes me very difficult for me to be around both of them without resentment or discomfort now. 

I feel like a part of my trust has been violated and then spat on a bit with accusations."		1	0
c2tl66	2019-06-20 08:47:01	Alcatraz4710x	AITA for giving my friend's internship to someone else?	So I'm in law school and I am a pretty good student so I got into a reputed law firm on the first year itself as an intern. Now a friend of mine wanted to intern in the law firm as well and asked me if I could help him. I agreed and I put on a recommendation for him. Fast forward to today this friend of mine publicly humiliated me in front of my batch mates, my seniors and MY CRUSH by playing a rather nasty prank which he thought was hilarious. When I confronted him he laughed at my face and told me that it doesn't matter and I should stop being such a wimp. As my luck would have it 2 hours later the partner I was interning under called me and said that there was a vacancy and if my friend was still interested he could come in for an interview. I was still upset about the prank so I gave the dates and the details to another guy from my batch whom I barely knew. So am I the asshole for taking away this opportunity from him?

c2tjkz	2019-06-20 08:40:31		AITA for inviting my friends ex to an event?	"Throwaway in case IATA.

My friend of several years (lets call her Mary) and I were talking about going out to an event, depending on some medical advice. When she found out the advice, she said ""maybe not that particular kind of event"", and I thought I would just go on my own, which is ok with me.

A few days later, I met up with her ex (let's call him John) who I have known for longer than she has, but not as long as her. Maybe I've known him 2 years? They were dating for about a year and broke up some weeks ago. He asked what was new and I mentioned I was going to this event, he indicated interest and asked for details, so I shared it with him, and he said that he was definitely going.

The next day, Mary said she was going to go to the event, and I gave her the heads up that John was going to be there, as well as some other mutual friends. She then got mad, so I said sorry and she said it was ok. Things seemed normal, so I thought we resolved it.

Then today I had to cancel on her for work reasons for something else we had agreed to do, and her response was ""that's fine, I'm mad at you anyway"". I said to let me know when she wanted to talk things through, and she replied with something along the lines of ""ok, let's talk now, you're being a shitty insensitive friend and you can talk to me when you want to be supportive"".

I said that I wanted to be supportive and explained that I thought she wasn't going, and that I didn't specifically invite him. I reinforced the idea that I am there for Mary, but that I wasn't going to change how I conducted other friendships. I said I was sorry if that caused her pain and that it wasn't my intention, but also that I was not trying to dish out punishment to anyone for anything.

She came back with ""yeah, it really hurt to see that he responded interested on Facebook, and now I can't go. And you maybe didn't invite him specifically but (insert incorrect assumptions about things I must have said in my conversation with John)"". I didn't have the time to reply, so said I would later, to which she said ""don't bother"".

I sent her a message later anyway, which was basically ""I see you're hurting, and I'm sorry for the misunderstanding that meant that I was a part of that. I am still here for you, but I will respect your space and will be happy to hear from you when you're ready. I hope you heal well.""

c2tj9w	2019-06-20 08:39:15	qwerty_ghjk	WIBTA for leaving a friend group and girlfriend over mental issues?	"(sorry for any weirdness, first time posting on throwaway and on mobile)

To start, I myself have extreme mental illness, my parents gave me a nice cocktail of depression, and anxiety. However I got therapy and am planning on getting on meds soon, I like to think of myself as a positive person but it does get hard sometimes especially with the state of the world. I've always had a hard time making friends, sooner or later people end up hurt and a group fractures, no big deal, but recently I've been having an issue with a friend group I've been in and have loved since about junior year of highschool. (I've been graduated for a year) It's a big group of girls all pretty much in the LGBT category and they all have alot of issues. One of them has an immense amount of diagnosed issues, one has a troubled home life, another has anxiety and depression and then finally there's the GF.

Me and her got together soon after graduating and I really thought I liked her, recently though I've been having second thoughts, she has extreme body issues to where she wants plastic surgery, she has a really tough home situation, I'm not even allowed at her house due to her parents hating me for seemingly no reason and overall it's very tough to be together. But whenever we do hang out I always have such a nice time and it's good to be around someone who genuinely likes me and wants to be around me, or that's how it feels anyway. 

It's really tough to constantly feel like you're the most neurotypical one out of a group because you have walked their path and know how to guide them but only they can guide themselves. My words fall on deaf ears and it's just really hard to deal with, im really empathetic so their problems hit me just as hard if not harder as I feel completely helpless and can only watch as they just spiral into sadness. I've been contemplating getting new friends and possibly even breaking up because of how hard it's become.
I know though that they probably need me and I also need friends, so I've of course considered sticking around til they get better but by this point it feels neverending.

c2thko	2019-06-20 08:32:12	kiripeiju	AITA for not wanting anything to do with my fathers side of the family?	"I'm 16 and have had a relatively good childhood. I'm in a good school, have a job and generally live a good life. My father on the other hand is, from my point of view, a loser. He smokes and drinks his money away whilst leeching off of our country's welfare syste. He has little ambition for anything, is in shit shape physically, utilises multiple unhealty defence mechanisms when defending his situation, has not done anything significant for me, and has not asked me once in my last trip there on how I'm doing, despite me doing that multiple times for him. 

I first met my dad when I was seven. My mom flew off the moment she knew she was pregnant since my dad had multiple drug problems at the time. 

We used to do stuff there when I was younger, but now all of us just do our own thing. I don't think I spoke even a hundred sentences to him during the seven day trip. He also never signals any appreciation for me or my brothers unless he is really drunk. If this is the case, it's always the same fucking monologue about how much he loves us. I have been listening this for a few years now. 

Now here's the morally gray part. He suffers from mild brain damage, which he blames his situation on. Says he has no energy to do anything. He was lazy before this, and at least I don't see any differences in his behaviour compared to his past self. I don't know enough about the situation, but to be honest, even if it was because of this I wouldn't care. I don't want anything to do with him. I don't even feel comfortable thinking he's my dad. I have suggested multiple times some ideas on how to start improving his situation, but he does not have the will to try. If I talk too much about his problems, he gets defensive, irritated and usually insults me. 

He is also really passive-aggressive. I have been shouted out of the room multiple times when I say anything to the contrary of what he, or his grandpa believe in. Last Christmas we played board games and every single one of them ended in me storming out of the room because of varying reasons. He also insults my mentally handicapped younger brother a lot, and though he can handle it, I don't know how he feels about it on the inside. He cries multiple times per day, every day, but his tantrums usually last for a few minutes and he's back to normal. My bro is really emotional though, and his home environment has never supported his growth in a good way. He is also really irritating at the best of times, and my dad has admitted to me that he wouldn't mind if he came less often, since he just can't handle him, since he's tired often.


I can elaborate on the details if necessary. This is the groundwork for the situation and I want to know if his brain damage justifies his behaviour, and would I do smartly if I cut ties with him when I'm a bit older. I have no doubts he does love us in some way, but the fact that I never gain anything from those trips gets me to question my motives when going there in the first place."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Husband and I just got married not too long ago and we’re still in our honeymoon stage. Everything was going great until last night when we were eating ice cream.

Now, I’m the type of person that ALWAYS give him the last bite. Whenever we eat, I give him the best parts of my food. And of course I was more than happy doing this thinking he did the same for me.

Mentioned to my roommate (27M) that we'd be doing it later today/tonight. He's catholic so I thought it'd be polite to let him know in case he doesn't want to be in the house while it's happening. He went cold and told me that this was not going to happen in his house. I offered to compromise and do it in my bedroom instead of the living room even though it'd be a bit cramped but he was not having it. Demanded that I give it to him to throw it away. I refused saying it's my property and I live here too so I can do what I want with my personal belongings. He implied that if I did it he would take ""extreme measures"". Thankfully my door has a lock so he won't be able to enter while we do it.

Last year we had to be separate for our birthdays so this year we thought we'd do something special. We are renting a limo to take us to a nice-ish bar and back again. This puts a hard limit on the guest list, 10 people max, or if we dont fill that out, we downgrade to the 8 passenger. We both agreed on 10 people we both enjoyed the company of, and I was tasked with getting all the details locked down for those 10. We also talked about what would happen if one of those 10 (really 8 because I am including my boyfriend and myself in the 10) would drop out, and we said that we would look into alternates and then never really discussed it.

&#x200B;

Tonight he tells me that he invited his best friend's recent boyfriend. This is a person I had never met, and admittedly, he didn't know very well either. My boyfriend is just kind of that person, extremely extroverted and willing to branch out to people he barely knows. I am extremely introverted on the other hand, and wanted the experience to be with people I was comfortable with (its important to note that I am not super close with a few of the 8 guests, just comfortable enough to say yes when my boyfriend wanted to invite them. Many of my close friends are far away and will not be attending)

&#x200B;

I tell my boyfriend he should have checked with me and that I was not okay with it. My reason being is that we will be is that we have limited capacity and we will be in close quarters with each other, its not something where if I don't get along with the best friend's boyfriend I can just stay away, we will be all together in a limo for a number of hours. My boyfriend was very upset. I told him that the person could meet us all at the venue, but I didn't want to sacrifice a limo spot to someone I didn't know and would be meeting that day.

Let’s call them John (M27) and Jane (F24). My girlfriend thinks it’s weird that I want to get her a present. John and Jane have been dating for two years now, things are quite serious, they got an apartment together, a cat and are both very committed to each other. Over these years I got to really know Jane and we became really good friends as we are both very positive and open people.

Now my (m27) girlfriend (f25) doesn’t like the fact that she is also my friend because for her, she is my bestfriend’s girlfriend and if they break up I will never see her again and she says it’s just weird that we are that close and that my bestfriend would never do the same for her (which is true). 

This is the second time she brings up this bothering her, the first time being, a couple of weeks ago, when both my best friend and girlfriend were out of town, Jane and I met up for coffee to catch up on life and mainly talk about my bestfriend who is in a depression and stuck in long term unemployment.

I told her that for me, from the beginning, I wanted to be welcoming and supportive ofJohn and tried to accept Jane in our group and ended up becoming good friends with her. She answered that I should just keep it casual, courteous and normal because she originally isn’t MY friend but she’s my bestfriend’s gf, essentially saying I should treat her as such and not as a friend (which is very different in her mind).

For more context, we are all going to a friend’s wedding this weekend and Jane doesn’t plan on celebrating her birthday any other day which to my girlfriends, makes it even weirder that I would even think of bringing her a gift (the gift would be from both my girlfriend and me).

c2tahi	2019-06-20 08:05:03		WIBTA if I do not tell my ex-girlfriend that she (most likely) has a brain disorder ?	"8 months ago my ex-girlfriend broke up with me. It was really, really weird. She suddenly behaved like a completely other person, she treated me like shit, she began partying, she probably cheated on me (not sure), and after being ehavily depressed for 2 years she suddenly had no mental health issues at all anymore. At first I was really angry at her for what she did to me, but 1 month after the break up I began thinking about what happened and that this just wasn't her usual behaviour.

So I remembered that she once had to take a test to see if she has a bipolar disorder. She lied on the test and told me it fits perfectly and she didn't want to have the diagnosis. We both thought being bipolar just meant ""A person that has mood swings"".

Now after that came to my mind I informed myself about the illness. I found an account of her on a website where she describes that she felt really good for 10 months and she lost all her mental illnesses and now they are back and she doesn't know why.

So I texted her once to check if the manic episode is over, 2 months after the break up. Then I checked on her a second time 5 months after the break up. And her it gets complicated. She hates me. I know you guys don't know me, but you have to trust me on that one, she does not have a single reason to hate me. This can be part of the disorder (irrational anger and paranoia). She told me she has a new partner, I should never message her again and that she feels happier than she did in our relationship with the new guy. That hurt. But I also know that she doesn't have a new boyfriend. So she lied to me, because she wanted to hurt me. I don't blame her, since she has brain disorder. But I knew that she is so angry at me, that telling her about the disorder might really hurt her. I mean bipolar people don't accept that they ill during mania anyways, but telling her that she only behaves like that because she has a brain disorder.. it could have gone seriously wrong. 

So now it's been 8 months. She told me to never message her again. She has a brain disorder that might end deadly. She has about 2 months left in her manic episode.

So I don't know what to do here. I'm scared at how she will react if I message her to tell her that she has a brain disorder. I'm scared that the anger of the mania became more intense and that she will try to hurt me even more. I'm scared that she is still manic and that I do more damage than good. I'm also a little bit scared that I'm wrong and that I make a fool out of myself.

I just don't want to have contact with her. But at the same time I feel like it's my ethical responsibility to tell her about it. But I don't know how and I don't know how all of this would end.

c2t96b	2019-06-20 08:00:08		AITA for choosing to not engage with a stupid person?	"To provide a little bit of context, I was what you would call a typical rebel when I was in the sixth and seventh grades. I'd sometimes refuse to go to classes, sometimes I'd say some inappropriate things to teachers, and sometimes I'd simply undermine their authority. 

I wasn't exactly an easy person to put up with because some of my developmental/learning disabilities put me in a conflict of interest with the school because I wanted them to handle some of my issues better, whereas they felt they weren't doing anything wrong. They asserted that they weren't trained to deal with my issues, but I felt they were capable of learning how to deal with such people. 

This teacher I bumped into the other day never had a high opinion of me when I was in the sixth and seventh grades. He'd chew me off for the smallest of mistakes, he refused to listen to anything that my mother kept on telling him, asserting that he was right and that we were in the wrong. Granted, I know I didn't exactly make his life easy due to my disabilities, but hey, I guess I'm always at fault for shit like that. Even though I didn't see much of him after the eight grade, he even tried to convince my parents to get me to drop out of school.

So I bumped into him the other day, and he asked me what I was up to. I told him that I graduated from university with a degree in a STEM field, I've got a good paying job, I've gone and traveled to several places. And of course, in disbelief, he said ""I always thought you would never ever graduate high school given your circumstances"". And then of course I decided to leave, feeling that it wasn't worth my time spending it all on a stupid individual. Then as I was about to leave, he said ""Don't you turn your back on me, it's rude"", and I said ""I'm sorry, I don't choose to engage in conversations with stupid people"". 

I later looked him up, and to my surprise, he's still holding the same position as he has been for the past decade, he hasn't progressed at all in his career, and I was like to myself: ""Wow, your life is so stagnant. You've not done anything major, you've not done anything significant, and in the many decades you've been a teacher, you've accomplished absolutely nothing despite having three degrees from top universities worldwide. What have you been doing with your life?""

c2t8ul	2019-06-20 07:58:47	anastasia_dedonostia	AITA for ordering food for myself to a party?	"So I was at this pretty decent sized apartment party with easily 40-50 people. It was my good friend’s apartment. He has roommates who clearly have friends but as these parties generally go, I’m assuming that there were quite a few people that didn’t even know the hosts.

Anyway party is raging, everyone is loud and dancing and drinking. I’m at the point of being pretty drunk myself, and it’s approaching midnight and I’m thinking it’s time to head home soon but as I am going to be walking home alone I figured it would be a good idea to get a sandwich in me, and as all of the local restaurants are closed at this hour, I figured ordering a sandwich to be delivered is probably my best option.

So I get a couple Sammie’s delivered and started eating them. Then this girl comes up to me and is ABSOLUTELY RAGING at me, like seriously mad telling me how incredibly rude it was to order food. She’s really laying into me... like treating me as if I had just shat on the floor.  She won’t relent for like five minutes, and I’m just eating my sandwich listening and thinking to myself... what is her problem? Meanwhile literally NO ONE is paying me any mind. They aren’t even looking at me- just drinking and partying and having fun. No one else seems to care but her.

She won’t stop so finally I’m just like... “are you hungry? Do you want half of this sandwich?”

She gets really angry and finally storms off.

c2t8db	2019-06-20 07:56:54		AITA for going to a volunteer event and then walking out during a meeting?	Throwaway cause friends know my account. So hear me out cause it sounds bad. I signed my friend and myself up for a health educational event for some organization one of my dad’s friends told me about and went to the 1st 2 meetings for the event and they went great. It was explained to us at the initial meetings our responsibilities would include making educational posters about various medical diseases and presenting them to people at a educational event, which I was completely fine with and excited for tbh. The issues started at the 3rd meeting. When we got to the venue to scout the area and start making the posters the head of the program “handed” us off to some other dude that made us carry tables and chairs from one place to another and set up the area for a part of the convention that had nothing to do with what we were volunteering for. At that point I was already annoyed because I have back issues and they were asking me to do things that hurt my back but I said whatever and did them cause I didn’t want to cause a scene. 10 minutes after this the head of the program calls us back and says we have to each pay $150 to be allowed into the venue when the event starts. At this point I get angry and say “I will not be paying $150 to volunteer, I have never heard of anyone paying to volunteer” and he tried to make up some excuse but eventually agreed to see what he can do. At the end of this exchange the guy who was making us do the set up comes and asks us if we can stay and help do more labor for 30 min. I said no and walked out. I thought I was in the right and so did the friend I brought as he walked out with me but some people there said we were rash and rude for walking out of a volunteer event regardless of the reasons. I felt bad for walking out and thought maybe I could have handled the situation better but I wanted y’all opinions too. AITA Reddit?	Not the A-hole	0	0

So the other day my friend told me this horrible story, his mother was walking their dog, a little one, and the neighbour's german sheperd just jumped on it and killed it by biting its head to death.

The neighbours prensented their excuses, saying their dog is usually never agressive like that and offered to pay for another dog, well they can't do much more I guess, nothing will get back the dog to life.

I'm very frustrated from this since i knew this dog and my friend is **omega frustrated** over 9000 he was not here to protect his dog.

So WIBTA if I tell my friend to contact the local police and make the neighbour dog euthanized ?

I'm pretty sure it's not really good and just will put both neighbours families in a very cold relationship if not a ""war"" but what if the sheperd do it again and kill the new dog or even attack humans ?

c2t3rg	2019-06-20 07:39:48	Jullika	AITA for getting irritated when asked if I’m okay?	"My brother is staying for some weeks. Since his stay here, every single time I come out of my room from when I go to the bathroom, when I go to the kitchen to get myself something to eat, or when I go outside, he asks me if I’m okay. 
At first I was fine with it, but then I started to get annoyed. 
So, my mom won’t be home until tomorrow which means my brother and I are the only ones in this house. Because I don’t cook much when I’m not alone in my home, I decided to make myself some French toast for breakfast but there wasn’t any butter. I went to the store and come back home 5 minutes later. I see my brother sitting at the dining table when I walk in and I knew he was going to ask the usual “are you ok” in like the next minute or so when I started to gather all the things to make my food. He gets up, comes to the kitchen, and this is it. This is the part where he asks that question I was hoping he wouldn’t ask. I said yes irritatingly, and this is when all hell breaks lose. He starts yelling questions and I don’t remember what he said, but I remember telling him that I was annoyed with him asking if I’m ok all the time. He gets angry and kept yelling at me, so I quickly went to my room. While I was in my room, he was still yelling. Not gonna lie, I was kinda scared at that moment because of how loud he was. A few hours pass by, I come out of my room and I see him coming out of my mom’s room. He asked if I’m okay, once again, and I ignored him. 

TL;DR brother keeps asking if I’m okay every chance he gets, I get annoyed and he rages, I stay in my room for a couple of hours and he asks the same old question. I ignore him.

"I have a decent number of tattoos and some of them are pretty visible (half sleeve, wrist, feet). For the record, the tattoos aren’t embarrassing or crude and are in good taste (in most people I’ve met’s opinion). I’ve had them all since before I met my husband and he has always liked how they look and never complained. Except of course when I’m around his family. 

The first time I met them, he asked me to cover up because his family is “old fashioned.” I felt a little weird about it then, but did it because I wanted them to like me. We live in a different state so I haven’t seen them much anyway. Now his dad is visiting us for a week and I don’t know how I’ll cover up the whole time. It’s summer!!!

I’ve told my husband it bothers me that he doesn’t think his family will like who I am with my tattoos. They are a part of me and I feel weird hiding them. He goes on and on about how I don’t understand how things were in their generation and I don’t understand psychology (???). I got to the point where I just don’t want to talk to him about it anymore because it’s going to end up in a fight. He’s mad at me for “shutting down” as well as not understanding his side.

He's thirteen and I'm just a bit younger than him. 

I think he vomited because he was overfeeding himself he basically steals out of the kitchen so he just freaking eats.

For a little bit of background, I (24m) was born in France, but  have Belgian origins. My grandad is 100% belgian, and had my dad and a daughter. She died young, so my father was the only kid left in the family. I came along, and last year my father and his girlfriend gave birth to a beautiful 1yo girl. (my mom and dad has been separated since I was 2yo)


Now, as life goes on, I am realizing I might not want kids. I love kids, I always have. I love my sister to bits. I know I am young still, but babysitting her, being around her and watching my dad and her mom parenting her made me realize this is not how I picture my life in the future. Now that might seem selfish to a lot of you, but this is not the lifestyle I think I will choose. 


We were recently jokingly making fun of fun my sister or something, and he said something along the lines of “you’ll see what it is like one day to have a kid”. That’s when I expressed to him my feelings about not wanting kids. I told him I loved my sister and didn’t mind kids in general, but I cannot see myself raising a child, and I would rather spoil myself, my partner, my sister, as well as him when he’ll be older, than spend time and money on a child of my own.


(There is also the issue of me thinking about raising a child in our current environmental situation, with climate change and overpopulation, but that's another story).


He calmly said he was disappointed in me, saying I was being selfish. He was disappointed in the fact that I didn’t want kids, as it was my duty to do so. To him, our family name HAS to survive time. We come from a very, very old european family, with a lineage (is that the right word?) going all the way back to the 1000s or something, and our ancestors were knights (there are statues of them all around Belgium). He expected me to have kids, so we could keep our family name from disappearing. 

(My family doesn’t have money, we are not rich. No “perks” come with our last name, except knowing it hasn't changed in a thousand years)


I am torn, as I really do not want to disappoint my father. Even though I mostly stayed with my mom when I was young, we still saw each other twice a month. He was always there for me growing up, and always supported me in whatever decision I made. He is a great father, and I never would change him for the world. I have always looked up to him and definitely do not want to disappoint him. We have a great relationship, and I would never jeopardize it.

This year, I invited them all to spend a week at my place in my home country during the summer (flights are booked already). It was all going well with the rest of the planning until yesterday.

It's important to mention that my friends and boyfriend come from a country where there's no seashore, whereas my home country has a bunch of beaches. However, my house is located slightly more towards the rural centre and not exactly near a beach. The thing is, my boyfriend and my friends started planning for us to spend a day at the beach while there. I told him that it wouldn't be worth it to drive over an hour to the beach when we had both a pool in my backyard, and a lake just 15 minutes away. Everyone just mocked me, saying stuff like ""why should we go play pool, when we have a swimming pool in the backyard"" and other puns like that. I was annoyed by this and probably sounded like it, so everyone just let it go after a while.

Later that evening, my boyfriend confronted me and asked why I was so against going to the beach. So I told him that the ocean in the north of my country is not like the one he and my friends are used to from their holidays: the water is extremely cold and violent, and the beach is usually very windy. I said I thought it would be a complete waste of a day, when we could have fun by the pool instead, and that I certainly was not going to the beach. In the end he said I was being selfish towards my guests for making them feel bad for making plans, and that they had every right to see the ocean because they rarely got that opportunity. I was annoyed that my arguments were being thrown out the window and I told him that I felt it was rude of him to demand I do something I don't want to do, especially since I invited everyone over for a virtually free stay abroad. Then he said he wasn't forcing me to do anything, because nothing beside the flights had been decided yet.

We later apologised to each other, but neither of us said we were wrong. It's an idiotic thing to argue over, but I honestly think that, being native to my country, I would know which activities are worth it and which aren't. I'm not concerned about the future of our relationship, but I'm afraid I created tension between me and everyone in regards to our holiday. AITA for shutting down my boyfriend's plans?

c2spha	2019-06-20 06:51:55		AITA for not blaming myself when my daughter shit her pants?	"My 8 year old daughter was at the park playing with friends while my wife, M, and I were in our home theater in the basement watching Chernobyl. It’s always a challenge to get M to go to there / the basement, but in this situation I told her it was my preference, and compromise is a good thing. I love it, our kids love it, but she feels isolated there and doesn't like the lack of natural light she has said. We rarely get a chance to hang out by ourselves in the early evenings, so we made an attempt to get through some of the 5ish hours of that show that we have been trying to for the last couple weeks.

In any event, my daughter came home with her friends, unbeknownst to us, and needed to use the restroom. We always keep one of the garage doors and the door in to the house from the garage open while the kids are outside. My kids know this. A tried the front door, and the back door, but not the garage to get in to go to the bathroom but ended up panicking and shitting her pants.

M went upstairs when she heard loud footsteps and found A, hiding from her friends, having a panic attack because she had soiled herself trying to get in the house to use the bathroom. I came upstairs and M immediately laid in to me saying she knew being in our basement, versus being in our family room, or another room in the house with a TV, caused my daughter to have an accident and that she now feels like a bad mother.

In this situation I feel like she is using this situation as a reason to further dislike the basement, and entirely blaming us for our daughter having the accident. I told her that her blame was mis-placed and that my daughter is responsible in this situation. She told me to ""shut up,"" and was super rude about my perceived lack of empathy for our daughter. In this scenario I had gone out to tell A's friends that we asked her to take a shower, and that she would be out in a few minutes, covering for her. When my A was done with her shower, she was shy / embarrassed about going back out to them, but her friends didn't know what happened, so I broke the ice on her behalf and got them all playing again.

My wife came out on the porch to apologize, but I wanted to talk a bit more about her placing blame on being in the basement, and us as ""bad parents."" I let her know I thought she was a good mother, which she really is, and she got rude about me not having empathy for the situation again. I didn't immediately agree with that, and she went back inside and gave me the silent treatment. I went to her a couple hours later, and she was still blaming me for not having empathy for our daughter and blaming us for the situation with A, then refusing to speak any more about it. I told her she should re-evaluate the situation, as we were in no way to blame from my perspective, and that I shouldn't be made out to be an asshole in this situation as I do not believe that is justified.

She has full time employment which means she gets paid during holidays. She was going to change jobs and go to casual employment where she wasn't going to be paid for holidays but earn more a day. Because I love her and want to help out, I gave her some money from working a weekend so she can put it aside for the holidays. She decided to stay at the school and spent the money I gave her on random stuff.  

I earn around 20k less than her. 

AITA for taking issue with this? Should I be grateful that she is with me and sometimes my money will be a casualty of our relationship?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2slwl	2019-06-20 06:39:17	lalaland200	AITA for asking for the $3 ATM fee even though it gets refunded to me?	"Hi everyone, I think this seems petty but every dollar counts to me... I let my partner of 5 years use my debit account because I make more money, trust them completely and we haven't had any issues. We both have a debit card from my account. He uses it for some daily expenses like food and coffee. The agreement we have is if he wants to withdraw cash, he has to pay it back, but regular purchases he doesn't have to. Every once in a a while he will withdraw $40 - $60 dollars and e-transfer me the amount a day or two later. The problem is, ATMs here have a very high fee since our bank is not close. I can be $3 - 5$ per transaction. So the total amount charged on my card will be $43.00 for example, but he only transfers $40. A couple times I asked for the fee and he sort of laughed since I don't mind if he bought a $3 coffee for example, but the fee bothers me.

&#x200B;

Here is the thing which would make me the asshole: I have a premium checking account where I get refunded for a certain amount of ATM fees per month. I don't track the number of withdrawals so I'm not certain. I think it is 3 right now but could be 5. Sometimes he doesn't withdrawal 3 times but sometimes he withdrawals more. I am not certain. For example, if I withdrawal 3 and he withdrawals 3, should I get the 3 free ones?

&#x200B;

AITA for saying he needs to transfer the full amount with fee, even if I might get it back? My partner thinks I'm being super petty and its only a few dollars which I wouldn't mind otherwise which is true. It really bothers me to see a $43 withdrawal though and only get 40 back at the time."	Asshole	0	0
c2sli1	2019-06-20 06:37:51	Nosetradumbass	AITA for saying I don't like nose piercings?	"A couple days ago my Girlfriend (17F) expressed to me (17M) that she was thinking about getting a nose ring or stud. This felt like a ""what do you think of that idea?"" conversation, and I said ""I'm not really into nose piercings"". After I said this she seemed kind of bummed, but when I asked her about it she said it didn't matter to her. Obviously she was hoping I would be excited about the idea, probably because every other fashion choice she makes I either am totally impartial on or think is hot as fuck, but I just don't find nose rings attractive. Don't get me wrong with or without a nose ring my girlfriend is the most beautiful person I've ever seen, and I told her this and it seemed to make her feel better.

However last night she brought it up again. This time with a little more detail. Apparently this isn't some idea she's just recently thought about. She's wanted to get one for about 3 years now ever since her sister got one, and it has a semi-cultural connection (she's half Pakistani) and that's why she asked my opinion. At that point I really didn't know what to do. Obviously if she gets a nose ring it's not going to change how much I love her, and she knows I love her more than anything. I told her that a nose ring isn't going to make me love her less, but she said she's not getting one because she doesn't want to be ""less attractive"" to me (she didn't say this in a sarcastic way) She said it's not a big deal and that she asked my opinion for a reason, but I just worry that if her sister or her friends ask why she decided not to get one ""My boyfriend doesn't want me to get one"" will sound controlling and make her friends hate me.

I am working summer hall staff with both of these people, and we have a good friendship. We regularly hang out, drink, or both. Over the past  few weeks, we have gotten really close, and I feel like I have genuine feelings for J, and would really like to act on them. I also feel like J and K are into eachother, and because I’m insecure and curious and whatever else, I drunk texted both of them saying I thought they’d be a cute couple. J didn’t respond to my claim and said that K and I would be adorable, which I denied since I don’t go for straight girls. K agreed with me, saying she feels so comfortable around him, and that she’s thought about it and even how kissing him earlier tonight would go over, but it was clear she wouldn’t have said this if not for my prodding. 
I feel bad. I know a selfish part of me wanted to clear up that they weren’t into eachother, but I feel I may have pushed them closer together, especially on uneven ground of attraction and with my feelings in the mix. 

As a frequent commenter, I figured I’d ask y’all how I come off and how I can be less of an asshole going forward.

c2sism	2019-06-20 06:28:32		AITA For taking an underage kids money	"So I work in the legal  recreational cannabis. I work at a fairly large dispensary and we very often get fake IDs and underage kids trying to get other people to buy for them.  Seeing how it's one of the main ways for us to loose our license and have some serious legal repercussions on us personally, I'm talking in the tens of thousands of dollars loss of ability to work in the industry (that is a life career choice for most of us) and the possibility of jail time. it is one of my biggest pet peeves.

Well on my day off I was enjoying a night on the town with some friends and as we were heading off to another pub I decided to stop at the dispensary I work at to pick up a quick joint.  As I start walking into our parking lot I'm stopped by some obviously underage kids (I'm guessing college age 18-19) who ask me to buy them some weed.

Now I'm fairly drunk (absolutely pissed but not blackout) and am just absolutely sick of dealing with this shit, so I tell them that I could but they have to make it worthwhile to do it. They hey super excited and agree after they tell me what they were hoping to get, I tell them that it probably cost well above what I knew it would and ask for an additional fee so I can get myself a treat for the trouble. Once they fork over the cash, I walk into the store buy my joint, throw what they gave me into the tip jar laughing my ass off telling my coworker what's going on and leave through the backdoor that exits into an ally not visible from the parking lot where the kids are. 

Now my coworker informed me that they waited around for about 30 minutes before he went out and told them to take off or he would be calling the police on them for loitering and harassing customers to buy them weed and they high tailed it out of there.

Anyway after sobering up and thinking on it I can't decide if it's fucking hilarious or if I was a huge dick for taking there money instead of telling them to fuck off. 

I myself am in my late 20s so I can kinda relate but at the same time this is the type of thing that can seriously jeopardized our jobs/ industry. Seeing how I work in an affluent resort town, and these kids were obviously well off (designer clothes brand new phones apple watches ect.) It's not like the monetary loss would seriously adversely affect them. 

In all honesty I think the whole thing is absolutely amazing and so do most of my coworkers. But almost all of my friends outside of the industry think it was a major dick move. Any way am I the asshole here?"		1	0
c2sihs	2019-06-20 06:27:32		WIBTA if I filed a complaint against the hospital that just saved me?	"(Sorry for format; on mobile.)

&#x200B;

Background: I’m a 28 y/o woman with Asperger's and ADHD, and was having a pretty tough last few weeks. I’m a HUGE introvert, and was desperate for some alone time while living with my parents, siblings, and 3 annoying dogs. I had also been on Adderall for the last week and 1/2, along with many other meds I was already on for depression and anxiety. I'm even struggling with the aftermath of being emotionally abused as a child!

A few days ago, I was going about my business at my data entry job (which can also be pretty stressful at times.) Nothing out of the ordinary. All of a sudden, I felt this big wave of sadness take hold of me, consuming my entire mind. It was like I was emotionally drowning, and all I could think of was, “GET ME OUT OF HERE!” I bawled my eyes out for the next hour.

A short break later, I fell into a state of emotional paralysis. My mind had gone blank, and my arms and legs suddenly weighed a ton. My boss and coworkers tried to cheer me up, but all my energy was slowly draining out of me. Before long, I was just laying there, on the verge of passing out. My boss ended up calling 911, and I was put in an ambulance.

Right from start, I was taken aback by the nurses’ and EMTs' bedside manners. Despite being barely conscious, they kept talking to me like nothing was wrong. They asked me some loaded questions, asked for my consent on treatment, and had me sign some forms when I could barely move my wrist. A few times, when trying to get my attention, they’d gently smack my face, and say “OP, I need you to wake up for me,” or “C’mon, OP, wake up” in a pretty stern tone. Part of me wondered if they thought I was faking it! Despite being barely conscious, part of me was thinking “Do I LOOK like I’m in the right frame of mind to answer all these questions or give my consent to anything?! You might as well be talking to someone high on anesthesia right now!”

The actual treatment went very smoothly from there. The doctor had a more gentle demeanor to him, and he  kept me comfortable as my body was recovering. Once I was fully conscious, he had me explain my situation again since I was too groggy to do it earlier. After 45 min or so, my body slowly unlocked, and I could move my limbs again with ease. Once I could walk again, the doctor diagnosed me with acute stress disorder, and gave me a friendly send-off with some new meds.

Don't get me wrong; I'm VERY thankful for the prompt treatment, and that I turned out ok. I just think the EMTs could've been a little nicer about it. I've always been pretty sensitive, so I was surprised to see them be so firm with me. Then again, being an EMT is a such a stressful job; maybe they were just frustrated. The only reason I'm considering filing a complaint is so that the nurses could be more mindful about similar patients in the future.

c2sih6	2019-06-20 06:27:29	kzhg5z2ka	AITA For not asking my gf permission for a girl to stay over at my place?	"So recently I (22M) had an argument with my gf (23F) about my female friend who needed a place to crash at my place. I currently live in an apartment with my suitemate (male) and have an empty room open in the apartment. I agree to let my female friend to stay over at my place in the empty room and bed. I later informed my girlfriend that a female friend will be staying over in the empty room. 

&#x200B;

This is when we got into a full blown argument that I should have asked her first before agreeing to let my female friend stay over at my place. She states that we are in a relationship and that it is a basic courtesy that I should be asking her first rather than simply telling her that my female friend is staying over. 

&#x200B;

I have to note, my girlfriend does have her own place that she lives in right now. We are NOT living together.  I feel like since I am the one paying rent with my suitemate, she should have zero say into who can stay in my place. I own the place with my suitemate, if we are cool with it, why do I need to first ask her if my female friend can stay? Also how come she has no issue if my male friends stay over, I never ask permission first for male friends, so what makes it different besides the point that she is now a female?

All of my friends began dodging my calls and texts and nobody said anything to me. Then one day two of them met up with me ( they weren’t even like my best buds in the group, in fact they were kind of new to the group ) to tell me that all the others don’t want to hang anymore. Which I feel is shitty as fuck that they could not say it to me directly or just work it out with me. This happened 2 years ago and I haven’t gotten over it, they were what I thought were my best friends and now I have insecurities about new friends because of that. 

1 year later I was talking to my best friend who is a part of my old group and he told me one of the reasons that they stopped hanging out with me was because I got mad and punched one in the arm over a game. Yes I understand I clearly over reacted but did you really need to stop being my friend because of that?

1 more year later to a few days ago. I am hanging out with two guys from the old group that stayed friends with me (one is my best friend and the other is just a buddy) and the buddy told me he got a text saying that the whole old group wanted to hang out with me and make amends but I held a grudge and refused to go.

Everything you’re going to say, I know and fully expect it, so really all you need to comment is “YTA” and I know everything you’re implying with it. But at least hear me out. 

I am in the military. I am currently deployed in a not so friendly environment. In fact it’s very unfriendly. Let’s just say it’s a desert area and we’re carrying weapons and there is very real danger. Like hiding in bunkers danger. Not somewhere nice like Kuwait, or Qatar. 

Now my significant other and I want to take a trip when I get back. Just somewhere cool in Europe. We’re planning just a week. But tickets and shit are expensive. We’re trying to do it as cheap as possible but that’s seeming pretty hard. 

Would I be an asshole to make a go fund me asking for help? I know I know. I signed up for the military. I volunteered, fully knowing what I could get into. I don’t feel entitled to a free all expenses paid vacation, and that’s not what I’m asking for. Maybe just some help with plane tickets, that’s all. Maybe some people out there would think “wow they just had to deal with some rough shit and want a getaway to decompress, I don’t mind throwing a couple bucks their way”. 

I dont want to be the person saying “I’m in the military, thank me for my service, I’m a hero, I make sacrifices blah blah blah”. That’s not me at all. I don’t feel I earned it just by enlisting. 

But I really want to take my SO somewhere they’ve never been, and any help I could get would be amazing. 

So I’ll fill in the comment for you:

 “You’re not entitled to free money and vacations just because you’re in the military. You know what you signed up for.” Trust me I know this, please don’t look at it that way.

c2sbai	2019-06-20 06:03:11		AITA for reclining my seat?	I was on a flight yesterday in an economy seat. It was a short-ish flight (3 1/2 hours) but I still slept, as I usually do on flights; makes them go by quickly. As soon as we were in the air, I reclined my seat as far as it went and started napping. The older woman sitting behind me started to push and knee my seat so I turned around to give her a warning look. She kept on doing that so I turned around and asked her to stop kicking my seat, to which she replied that my seat was “in her face.” I simply told her I was allowed to recline my seat. She stopped doing that after I said something. In my opinion, her space problem was not my issue and if she wanted more space she should have gotten a better seat. Somewhat relevant: she had on a flight attendant uniform (I mention this because... she should know the seats and the spacing issues with certain seats.) Now, I was watching Murder Mystery and in the movie, the wife says to the husband, both of whom are sitting in economy seats, that reclining his seat was inconsiderate to people around them. That just seems a little excessive in my opinion but made me question how I felt about the situation. I’m typically very polite and well mannered but get annoyed with entitled people.

c2s9i7	2019-06-20 05:57:34	Iexisttonotbefound	AITA for handling this financial situation the way I did?	" So recently I've found out that my girlfriend, mid twenties with who I live with, has some pretty immediate debt. The kind where she has to pay it off monthly otherwise people will come take her stuff. She and I, both mid-twenties, live together but legally she's still registered to her mum's place.

I have a pretty good financial situation, whereas she does not. So when I found out, I offered to maybe pay for a few bills for her. I mainly did this because, usually when she can't pay an upcoming  bill she goes and asks her dad, who she told me has been a horribly abusive person to both her and her sister. This was also the first step towards us sharing a financial situation. She accepted this proposal with hugs and tears in her eyes.

Come this morning, before work, she asked me if I could transfer her 80 so she could pay off an upcoming bill. She wanted to pay for it after work, but the tools for that were still at her mum's place. I felt like that was how she would handle it before, ask someone for the money and pay it asap. I told her I felt uncomfortable with that, and asked if she could maybe pay it together with me. That's how I like to do shared bills - together. She told me that she'd rather handle it there and then and forget about it. After I told her that it made me feel uncomfortable that I'd only be providing the money, she called me an asshole and turned to get into her bus that wouldn't leave for another 10 minutes.

AITA for how I handled this? I'm trying to be very careful with financial situations, because I don't want to seem to be controlling her with it. But at the same time, I don't want my role in our relationship to just be the one paying her bills.

TL;DR I offered to pay a bill of my gf who is in financial dire straits. She told me to just give her the money, which I refused. She told me off, and I'm unsure if I handled it correctly."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2s6yo	2019-06-20 05:49:06		AITA for asking my dog walker to pay a $400 vet bill?	"I genuinely do not know what to do in this situation. A little background: I have had a foster dog that is dog-aggressive since April. I am aware of this. I have tried to introduce him myself to another female dog and it did not work out, so I have accepted this and he lives a happy life as the only dog in my home. 

I hired a new dog walker a few weeks ago and really loved the relationship he had with my dog. My dog is 130 pounds and he knows how to control him and has actually helped improve his leash pulling and other manners. I told my dog walker upfront: he is dog aggressive. Please avoid all dogs when on walks. Cool. Fine. A couple of walks go by and he tells me that he would like to bring my dog to a dog park down the street. I’m not sure why I thought this was OK, but I just went with it (in hindsight, fully aware I should have said no). He took him off leash there and he bit another dog. Side note: he is very tricky and does not have the normal aggression signs. He will walk up to a dog with his tail wagging and then sniff, meet, and after a few minutes out of nowhere bit the back of the dogs neck. Thankfully, dog was OK and didn’t need to go to vet. 

He apologized and we agreed no more dog parks. I continued to use him as a walker. Fast forward to a couple of walks later and I get a text that he bit again. I ask what happened: they were walking and a woman with her PARALYZED from the waist down, 10-pound dog complimented and asked to meet my dog. The walkers story is he explained my dogs aggression but she insisted it was fine. He allowed my dog to walk up to this dog, sniff, meet, then Bam! Did the exact same thing as last time and bit him on the neck. Except this time the dog needed staples. I offer to pay the vet bill. She declines. This was a couple of weeks ago. This morning I get a call that because he was already paralyzed, the bite caused an infection and he had to have a drain tube put in.

A couple of weeks ago, she talks to me (around 7:00 AM) ""Do you want me to come by your house and go to university together?"" (because after all, it was not something every day). I answered, after ten minutes, with a ""yes"", 'cause I had finished dressing and eating breakfast. I waited another ten minutes, and I still had not received an answer, so I decided to go alone to the bus stop. A few minutes after leaving, she sends me a message saying that I was already walking towards my house. I told she that I was already walking towards the bus stop. She got mad at me because ""I made her wait for me"", and she began to reproach me with the situation (supposedly, she was already ready, but why didn't you answer my message?).

In my defense, I didn't have an answer in the time limit and I assumed that she had not read the ""yes"". If she answered me the messages, I would have waited for her to pass by me.

Adding a little more context, every time we organized to go together, it was always me who had to wait for her to prepare (she takes her time, and I respect it).

c2s55t	2019-06-20 05:43:25	friendshipworthkeep	WIBTA If I Cut Off a Close Friend?	"I’m a male and friend is a female. Over the past year and a half or so we’ve had our share of differences and have blocked each other several times. Most times it was her and to be honest, I still don’t even know what I did to get blocked because she wouldn’t tell me. It’s been over a year since one of us have blocked the other and we’ve grown pretty close over the last year. Despite this, we have only ever talked irl a handful of times if even that. Mostly (I think) because our social circles don’t really cross and we don’t have classes together.

As you may have already guessed, over that time I developed feelings for her. This hasn’t been too good for me because I’ve been getting mixed signals from her and I have anxiety disorder so you can already guess the shit that goes through my mind sometimes. A few weeks back I had a little too much to drink and ended up telling her. Never got rejected but nothing came of it but things haven’t really been the same since. That’s partially my fault because I’ve been trying to somewhat distance myself from her for reasons such as anxiety and just to simply move on.

Prior to this however, I felt like it was me who was putting in the most effort for our friendship and anytime I’d try to talk to her over facetime or try to make plans with her irl, either nothing ever came of it or she would agree and then when time came she would fall silent despite clearly being active. (i.e viewing my snapchat story) Or she would just outright make an excuse. This happened basically every time and the only time she’s ever asked me to hang out was when majority of her friends were away at a tennis tournament and I caught onto that and just continued to play basketball instead. I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve given up on the friendship as it’s practically just some online friendship crap at this point. I’ve tried to cut her off a couple times before because of things that have happened but never have because she ends up fighting to keep the friendship.

Ever since I’ve started distancing myself, I’ve noticed she’s started putting in slightly more effort as she’s the one who initiates conversations because i can be arsed to do so anymore. All of my friends don’t like her and say she’s too faced with one of those friends being an ex-friend of hers. Another one of my friends is friends with a girl in her little friend group who also says she’s two faced. So basically reddit, WIBTA if I just fuck off from this friendship? I don’t meant just all of a sudden block her ass and whatever, more just stop talking to her. At this point I feel like it’s done me more negatives than it has positives and I’m not exactly the type of person who likes talking to people online, i’d much rather call or hang out. Both of which she apparently refuses to do from what her actions have indicated. I’ve -also confronted her before about the excuses and whatnot and she just said “I thought it’d be mean to say no.”"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I was living in another country for 7 years, went back to my homeland 2 years ago and I got a great job, I'm making 3x nation average. 

Of course I supported all of my family, friends and especially Joe.

I don't live in US so I won't give you exact figures so I'll use % of my salary and keep in mind my salary is 3x average as I said

When I came back he was in really struggle I helped him a lot. 

One day he wanted to start new career - I borrowed him 30% of my salary to get license for digger machines. He was thankful and we were joking it's an investment and he will pay me back

He got the license, got first job, then he quit after less a month.

For two years I was borrowing him more money, he was working on and off (but not on digging machines), all together it was 100% of my salary. No biggie for me but he never paid me back.

In meantime I was renting an expensive flat for 6 months and I got idea maybe I can move to his place because he had flat with two empty rooms (his parents died long time ago) so this is a way he can pay me back. So I moved to him and his debt was going down because of the rent. 

But after 4 months he asked me to give him cash instead taking rent money from debt. 5th month, 6th month, 7th month he wanted cash instead taking it from the debt. I moved out (for other reasons)

Now year later I borrowed him more money recently because he had no job. I borrowed him 10% of my salary and bought him smartphone so he can have internet to find a job.

His debt now to me is 200% my salary. I told him it's enough.

Yesterday we called and he said his tooth hurts and he needs treatment. He could go get treatment free if he had a job, but he wants me to borrow him more money.

It's not biggie for me I could easily do it but at this point I think I'm hurting him because if reality won't him he won't stand up. But on another hand it's his tooth

I had very similar situation with my brother, when I cut that money tap he found job and he is doing great."		1	0

c2s0x3	2019-06-20 05:29:57		AITA for being mad at my mom for complaining about her old phone when she can get a new one for free?	"So my mom has this pretty old phone. A Samsung from 2013 I belive. It's super slow, probably not helping that my mom has 300 different taps open at all times. Anyway she has been complaining about this phone for so long, ""this phone is so slow I hate it"", or ""my stupid phone did this or that"".
So for her birthday (on Saturday) I decided to splurge a bit and bought her a new phone. I'm a student so this is a very big gesture and took me months of savings but I love her and she deserves it so. 
I've asked my mom many times why she doesn't just get a new phone (financially shed be able to), but she tells me it's a work phone so she's not allowed to replace it. Weird but whatever. 
I tell my dad about the gift and he's all confused and sais ""but she can just replace it at work"" (they work the same place btw). There's litterally houndres of brand new phones, newest models, stored at their work for employees and all she would have to do was turn in the old one and she'd get a brand new. 
I'm pretty pissed that I've spend months of savings on a new phone for my mom when apperantly all she had to do to get a new was to walk down the hall. I feel like my mom is just keeping her old shitty phone to get sympathy from me and to feel like her life is hard. 
Now I'm thinking of just returning it and not give her anything since what she said she needs is very easily accessible to her."		1	0

Streamer’s friend was flirting with an overweight girl, streamer told their other friend a joke which was directed at the over weight person and about weight.

Lady overheard, and cried, the streamer defended it saying not to be so sensitive and it wasn’t even that much of an insensitive joke (it was the meme I like them big I like them chunky). 

The joke itself wasn’t that bad in my eyes its what they said AFTER, apparently the streamer felt bad about making the lady cry but continued on saying how “if they dont want people making fun of their weight, don’t be heavier”.

I wanted to call them out then and there but decided against it and quit out of the stream.

I was worried I was taking it to heart (I’m a heavier girl myself but i have my own set of complications as to why I can’t just “not be heavier”). 


So AITA, would I be the asshole if I called them out or at least sent them a PM telling them how it wasn’t appropriate?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Her girlfriend (who I've never met) will be joining the day after Kelly arrives, on a redeye landing early in the morning. I live about 15 minutes from the airport in traffic.  While she is by herself Kelly will stay at my place. 


While discussing plans Kelly mentions that she was planning on using my car to picking up her girlfriend. I immediately replied  absolutely not. Stating the girlfriend can use a rideshare to get to my place, it's not expensive and the wait times are generally short. Kelly she needs to meet her gf at the airport because it might be confusing to find where ride shares and  taxis are located. I assured her there are signs from the terminal exists as well at baggage claim clearly directing passengers to the correct place.  This wasnt good enough for Kelly. I told her, she could take a ride share to the airport to meet her gf  then they could ride share back together.  This response was not met well by Kelly who went off on me saying I was being unreasonable and difficult. To this I mentioned she could also stay at a hotel near the airport the first night to make things easier on all of us. 


Reason I dont want let my sister use my car stems from her never letting anyone drive her car.  Additionally Kelly does not have the best driving record, no accidents, but several speeding tickets. 


I work until 2am so waking up at 6:30am to drive the airport is an unreasonable ask of me if I am expected to also be functioning in the day. All travel arrangements were made without my input as what times are more convenient."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Recently I was without a job the past couple of months. It's not the worst thing cause I still live at home while I go to college. However, I felt bad cause I felt like I was taking advantage of my parents even though I was looking for a job the whole time. This combined with not wanting to know what I want to do with my life and the fact I want to provide a good life for my girlfriend started making me miserable. I would worry cause it seemed everyone around me had figured out their lives and here I was just stuck in the same place. This led to me having days where I felt depressed.

I hid how I felt from my parents and her cause I didn't want to worry them. My girlfriend already has a lot to deal with in regards to school, a crazy mom at home, and depression plus anxiety. I didn't want to pile on to all the stress she already has.

We ended up talking last night cause I recently got a job and figured out what I want to do with my life. She sounded more critical than excited and it led to a long talk. Now she says she isn't upset but I'm pretty sure she is and isn't telling me. I tell her everything else that goes on in my life: friends, past experiences, school, family stuff, no matter how big or small I usually tell her about it. So AITA for not telling her my biggest worry?

Guy: Never seen that, a lot of people are saying it's pretty good.

Girl: Uh, she's kind of young.

Me: I'm pretty sure she's an adult...\*pulls out phone and looks it up\*, yep she's 19 now. She would've still been 18 when the first season was filmed.

I was on a fairly busy street in my city and a minivan was T-Boned at an intersection and slid into one of those large store signs (Walgreens). I immediately pulled into the parking lot and ran over to help if I could. 

At this point a few others were coming up as well. There was an unconscious passenger and I volunteered to begin CPR. This was my first time and I was horribly anxious for obvious reasons. With that being said, I was also very much “in the zone”. 

Which brings me to my moral dilemma, while I was performing CPR on this individual a child who was in the car was screaming, crying. and hovering over me.  It was making it difficult to keep track of my compression counts and rhythm, but understandable considering the circumstances. Then, said child bumped into me and I lost my balance and fell into the individual. I lost my patience and yelled “KNOCK IT OFF AND GO STAND OVER THERE” I don’t think anyone saw her run into me so I really just looked like an asshole yelling at the poor kid. 

I kept preforming CPR until the paramedics arrived and then I told them I had to go to the bathroom and I just left because I felt bad about yelling at the kid but at the same time we were on a busy road, it’s 90° out and I’m doing CPR, why wouldn’t anyone be consoling the toddler ya know away from the girl preforming CPR??

Anyway, AITA? Not sure how I could have done it differently because it was so spur of the moment"	Not enough info	0	0

So my best friend and i have been friends since elementary school, we are now 19. When i came home from my first year at college we talked about how she wanted to clean her apartment and basically her life in general. Shes quit smoking and we recently cleaned out her car. Her car was a whole thing on its own, it was piled with litter and dirty and overall just gross to be inside of. Everything was sticky and it smelled and there was old food everywhere. I was happy to help, my boyfriend even gave it a bit of a detail and we all had fun. Before that i even helped clean her apartment. She lives boyfriend and a roommate, neither of which care for being clean, they ash cigarettes wherever and dont help out with cleaning. The entire apartment is rather gross to be inside of, and reeks of cigarettes, and when i go home i have to wash my clothes and i need to shower just to get the smell of her apartment out of my hair. Now ive never been all that “prissy” i dont think im better than her or anything, hell my own room is a mess but her situation is rather different. While my room may be a mess it isnt in fact dirty, its not unsanitary unlike her apartment which is concerning as i feel it may be becoming a health hazard. Last week we planned on cleaning out closet today. Its a small walk in which couldn’t be walked into. It wasnt as bad as the rest of her apartment as there wasnt much trash, but it was way over filled with things she didnt need. She has an insane amount of clothes. It dosnt all fit on the hangers and her dresser is filled. After going through and organizing and sorting, she refused to get rid of anything. I get it may be a lot to ask of someone to get rid of so much but i know for a fact she dosnt wear 75% of that clothes. I see her all the time in the same couple of outfits but she  insists she needs all of it. We both became frustrated and she got a little snappy with me and i decided to go home early. I went home and did my usual routine after visiting her and showered and threw my clothes in the wash. I think i want to tell her i dont want to go inside her apartment anymore as its disgusting to me and im tired of having to shower the second im home after as well as washing my clothes just because of the smell.

"I'm a full time college student, currently taking summer biology (an accelerated, very difficult course). I live at home, and instead of rent I earn my keep. One way I do that is make dinner every night. About a month ago my sister, her infant, her boyfriend and his teenager moved into the upstairs renovated 'apartment' for rent, but my parents haven't installed a cooktop yet so they eat with us most nights, but not every night. They eat out at least once a week and have cooked their own food in our kitchen.

Tonight I was making spaghetti, and to be clear I am used to cooking for four people and that has jumped to seven. I had what I needed to make my regular portions, which isn't really enough for her family. My mother bought extra french bread, but one of the loaves had ended up in an unsanitary position and I found a bug on it. I messaged her, late because I was doing homework/chores all afternoon and didn't find the soiled bread until after four, and she said she wasn't going to buy another but we needed two if my sister's family were going to eat with us. I replied, exactly, ""They can go eat their own dinner. I don't have enough tomatoes for a double batch anyway. No need for two bread, just us eating"". This was a group message, so my sister texted what I took as a snotty message basically saying I was making her starve since she doesn't have a kitchen, so thanks. I said she could come cook in our kitchen, but I don't care, whatever, do what she wants. She replied I had a bug up my ass and to leave her alone, attitude not appreciated. My mother agreed my message was rude and made her out like a burden.

They were always on and off, and last year, they broke up again. During this time, we became closer which progressively turned romantic. Now, we're almost a year and I never restricted her in doing whatever she wanted, including chatting with her ex. 

Last night, Anne and her ex were chatting online and she even sent me a screenshot of a part of their convo wherein the guy said ""Since we've broken up, it looks like you've become so different,"" implying that her lifestyle became worse as she used to be conservative before. This made here furious and so she ranted to mw about it. Me, just being an honest person, told her, ""Why should his opinion of you still matter? "" She replied with a cold ""okay. I'm going to sleep now.""

Later that morning, I received a long message from her which basically said that she was crying at the moment and that she wants space even just for a few days. ""I don't know why I'm being like this. I love you.""

a while back I decided to finally bite the bullet and get Netflix. 
I decided to give my netflix account to my friend on one condition, I get 5$ a month (its 20$ a month where I live) to help me pay for it, she agreed. 

she has always been late with paying me, this has never been a huge issue as it's only 5$. and I'm normally paid a week later so it's never been a huge issue. 
that was until she decided to stop paying the 5$. 4 months went by without any money in my account. 

whenever I would message her she would tell me that she was broke and can't afford it. 

I then learnt that she would be using my Netflix account to host a Netflix watching party for a TV show premiere. 

I then decided (purely out of being petty) that I would sign her out of the account a few hours before the party so her party would be ruined. 

turns out I did ruin my friends party and I woke up to 20+ messages from people telling me how shit I was and that I ruined her party.

c2rhby	2019-06-20 04:28:50	HydraPops222	AITA For causing a scene in the middle of a 10 mile race?	"I’m an avid runner and run a lot of 5ks, 10ks, 10 miles, etc. I am also slightly hard of hearing. I’m not deaf; I can hear people talking to me at a normal level just fine and I don’t need a hearing aid (yet). The major issue that I have is that I can’t hear direction very well. So if someone is standing behind me and talking to me, I don’t know what side of me they are on. 

I was running a race last weekend, and  was jogging at a fairly steady gait, when I heard a girl behind me say “behind you”. Traditionally, in a race I thought it was common knowledge that you say “on your left” or “on your right” So people know what side you’re coming from if you want to pass. She didn’t distinguish it and since I was jogging I didn’t want to turn around so I stepped over to the right and I stepped right in front of her and we collided. 

We both fell pretty hard because this was a trail race. I apologized right away, but then she snapped at me and said I wasn’t paying attention. I tried to explain that I couldn’t hear which direction She was coming from. I had headphones on, on a very low level, and I think she took that to mean I was listening to music too loud and not paying attention. I also tried to explain that you are supposed to state your direction so this doesn’t happen, but she was already over the conversation by that point and kept running. It was a 10 mile race and we were about 4.5 miles in. I also think because I’m 29 and look healthy, people don’t assume/believe that I have a mild disability. But it wasn’t the best time for a teaching moment. 

Anyway, I was embarrassed I caused a scene and other runners were annoyed that I slowed them down. Am I the asshole because I got irritated that she didn’t tell me which direction she was coming from?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2rgmp	2019-06-20 04:26:42		WIBTA for simply calling my dad out?	"Before I start, I just kind of want to say that my dad and I have a very complicated relationship. The both of us can't see eye on eye on anything, and almost all of our talks end up in tears or an argument/fight. 

One such example was about my weight. Before then, I used to be pretty fat, engaging in little exercise. Before then, my dad would habitually verbally abuse me for it. He'd tell me things like ""You're so fat"", ""I'd never hire a fat person at my company"", ""You look so unattractive"". Little did I realise that he'd also give other people shit for it at work. Now here's the catch. As soon as I've lost more than 18kgs of weight, he then goes around announcing it to everyone. As soon as I start being conscious about what I eat, he keeps on pushing me to eat more and more, which I honestly find hypocritical because he used to give me a ton of shit for overeating and being fat, and now he's pushing me to eat more and more. He even talks about this in front of his friends, which is ridiculous because he makes it sound so casual when he's actually airing things that I've told him face to face. I've even confronted him for it, but he always acts so defensive. 

Our more recent rift has got to do with me wishing to invest in stocks. As soon as I make some profits, he tells me ""sell them, sell them"". I tell him, ""no thanks"" and I proceed to share some of my knowledge about long-term investing. He claims ""those are all motherhood statements"" and that ""he knows better"". I later find out from my mother that he's never invested in anything, and I can immediately tell that my dad is just airing BS.

Now my mother takes me to do some bank work with her. My dad later calls up, finds out about this, and starts complaining like an absolute child, saying that my mom knows how to do it better and that I didn't need to come along. 

My mom is tired of his shenanigans, and so am I. I've had enough of him, and I honestly don't know if I'm going to be an asshole for confronting him or simply distancing myself away from him."		1	0

"Long story short; my boyfriend of 8 months doesn’t have a drivers license due to multiple DUIs and just stopped drinking 3 days ago. We have been on rough terms due to his drinking and I accidentally slept through this 9pm shift to pick him up. When I work 7am-3pm. I’ve been picking him up for months and only did this one other time in November accidentally sleeping through his shift. I’m 30 he’s 31.

It’s now 11pm and I wake up realizing what I did so I call. He said he’s hurt and embarrassed he had to walk home and take the bus in dress shoes when we were planning on eating together. I asked why didn’t he call me (wake me, ask where I am, am I ok)? And he said I pre-mediated this and it was because of our issues. He said if I cared enough to call him tomorrow as he didn’t want to discuss it tonight when I usually stay at his place but obviously not tonight.

I’ve been trying to work through things but now I’m ready to break up and already made a post earlier today about it.

c2rfwc	2019-06-20 04:24:28	satans--bitch666	Aita for not wanting my sisters bf to move back in with us	"My sister has been dating this guy (Dick) for 10 years. A week after they started dating he moved in with us. Dick is a lazy, self absorbed, pretentious prick who thinks of no one but himself. He always has to be right about everything and if we tell him hes wrong, we're idiots.

He loved to do things to piss me off to the point where I'm yelling and screaming at him and my sister and hed always somehow convince my mom it was my fault. He constantly put garbage on my bed. He even threw the contents of a butter tub on my bed once because SOMEONE ELSE left it on the stove. When the parking lot by my place was rented for a popup carnival, I turned in some cans so I could go with my friends. I should note that my sister and dick decided that all of the soda cans and bottles that EVERYONE helped accumulate were only for them. Mom told me a week before that they weren't. I guess he saw me leaving the house with them because when I was at the carnival waiting in line for a ride, he came up and started yelling at me in front of everyone. He had to be escorted out since he was cussing a bunch and the carnival was being run by a nearby church. 

He took a conversation I had with my friends, that he overhead, way out of context. They were talking about how they liked it better at my place because things were more layed back and they could do a lot more. What they ment was they didn't have any little siblings to look after or include since I'm the youngest and the rest of them had siblings younger than 7. He however took this as a chance to try to convice me that my friends really weren't my friends. They were only using me. I obviously didn't believe him. 

My senior year I was in a long-distance relationship and we had gotten to the point where we wanted to be more intimate. So, nudes. Dick decided to hack my Facebook and look at my messages to my boyfriend. He sent screenshots to my mom. To this day, I feel violated by that.

A year later my mom bought a house. Dick was the only one who had grown up living in a house, but he refused to help upkeep it or teach us how to do the things we never had to before living in an apartment and all. He never even lift a finger while he lived with us, but he was all too happy to tell me that he didn't want me to clean my turtles tank in the upstairs bathroom. He wanted me to take every bucket of water downstairs to dump it in the laundry room sink, then haul the tank to the backyard and hose it off there. Mom said there was no way I was doing that. She didn't want me spilling the water and getting the stink in her new carpets. Mom put him in his place that time. 

He moved out a year ago and I feel so relaxed without him here. But recently, he got fired from his job and if he doesn't find another one he'll have to move back in. My sister thinks I'm being a bitch because I don't want him to come back. Am I really being the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2rfig	2019-06-20 04:23:16		"AITA for telling my Dad that I have no interest in changing up my weekend to ""catch up"" with two of HIS cousins that I have only met once?"	"My (31M) parents (66M, 66F) are super pushy about me catching up with my Dad’s cousins (two F, 60's) while they are in town for a wedding this weekend.  It feels like part of a ""close family"" initiative he has been pushing, and I just frankly don't care to see them.

They keep saying “I need to know when you plan to get together with them this weekend,” expecting that I will make time.  But here’s the thing – I don’t have any desire whatsoever to “get together” with them.  I met them once at my grandmother’s funeral, two years ago.  I don’t know them.  And frankly, I don’t particularly care about them – they have never expressed any interest in being around me, and now I’m supposed to take time out of my schedule to meet with them and have one of those awkward “well what have you been up to for your entire life” conversations?

All the while, my fiancé (28F) is very ill, her birthday is this weekend, I’m very far behind in work and personal chores, I have to fly out on Tuesday for a big quarterly review, my fiancé has to travel for work next week, and I’, just plain tired.

My sister (28F) has been a “yes man” for them for years, because they still pay for a lot of her life, so of course she’s going to the wedding and meeting with them later.  Which makes me look bad by comparison if I say no – but I just have zero desire to have a weird conversation with people who don’t really care who I am likely won’t see me again. 

My parents have been very pushy on the whole “family first” thing lately and the importance of a “close family.”  I agree to an extent, but not to the point where I want to uproot my weekend and my sick fiancé to go see two extended cousins who I don’t know.  Does that make me the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c2rfci	2019-06-20 04:22:44	thegratefulsin	AITA for not telling my friend the guy she’s crushing on isn’t interested?	"(i’m on mobile, and i go on tangents sometimes, so i’m sorry in advance.)

Okay, so currently, one of my friends (F, i’ll call her W) is crushing very very hard on another one of my friends (M, i’ll call him S)

Now, both W and S are very good friends of mine, but they’re both parts of separate friend groups. (W is with my bigger friend group that I started hanging out with 2 years ago, and S is part of a small group where we’ve been friends for years.) 

I know for a fact that W has been tearing herself apart for this crush, and is debating asking S out. However, S told me a few days ago that he’s dating someone (I’ll call her D) that is a good friend of mine (as well as family friend) and that they haven’t told S or D’s parents, and are only telling a select few friends. W was not included in this group, as while her and S are friends, they’re not super super close as they’ve only known each other a few months. (I’m the main mutual friend between them, so that’s how they started interacting in the first place.)

I feel god awful watching W crush so hard on S, but i also respect S’s wishes not to tell people he’s dating. Both are two of my best friends, and at this point, I’m beating myself up constantly trying to think of a solution. I can’t tell S that W is crushing on him either (so that he could let her down easy), as I would immediately lose her trust and that would honestly break me.

AITA for not telling W that S won’t reciprocate her feelings? Or for not telling S that W was crushing on him? 

tl;dr - friend one is crushing hard on friend two, but friend two is secretly dating someone and doesn’t know about friend one’s feelings.

edit/update: dunno if anyone will see this, but S told W and W knows that i knew for a few days before. She’s upset, and rightfully so. I just wish it had ended differently."	No A-holes here	0	0
c2rewu	2019-06-20 04:21:16	BeneficialTeacher	WIBTA For Going Over Someone's Head To Expose Someone Else	"Burner for obvious reasons

&#x200B;

A professor slept with at a minimum one student, and at least tried to with two more. At the time, #1 was his intern, and in a position where she felt she had to please him. Quote from her. He gives private lessons in his home as well, and a guy who took lessons said he filmed them all for evidence of nothing happening, but would have students enter and leave through the back of the house, where girl 1 said things happened.

&#x200B;

\#2 never spoke up, but #1 said she saw very clear similarities. #3 Had him make a proposition, and she brought her boyfriend to the next one, which isn't uncommon for people to hang out there. He dropped her right after.

&#x200B;

Prof. directs in theatre dept and community shows, and will give his students audition material early, at least by 3/4 months. Multiple school students have had issues with him, but they're always swept under the rug. Girl 1 was in the room when he gave another student music for a show he was doing later in the year

&#x200B;

He recently sent a bunch of his students to harass a friend on his anniversary, and he accused the same kid of illegal/immoral/gross things I can't mention on this subreddit. Used a temp email so I won't pm people it if asked, but a go to jail free card.  Kid had a full blown panic attack, he was getting personal insults and threats, even deactivated his facebook for a while until it blew over. The same kid was called a f\*\*\*\*\* during one of this guy's rehearsals and nothing happened.

&#x200B;

Prof yelled at one student out of nowhere several times, and blames students for every issue he has, including the one where he will cast people he knows outside of the school to take over every lead for shows he directs. Someone brought it up once, and he tried getting at least 2 kids he didn't like expelled. Almost put himself in a show.

&#x200B;

Notable that he specifically approaches young girls (17-18) to give lessons, and tries to keep them from going to college. Lied to 2 about giving them free college credit for doing his show. Ran the student he sent harassers to ragged doing an internship that broke school policy, but he needed to graduate, and was told by admins that it was only being counted still because he needed it, but it wasn't a real internship

&#x200B;

A couple people wrote in student reviews that he slept with students, he blames every person in the class he didn't like, was literally three kids, and he has no idea who. Tried failing some of us for no reason until someone above him said to give us a real chance at the final. Two kids kept pointing out he was teaching the opposite of the textbook.

&#x200B;

I live nearby, and want to write an anonymous note to the school saying all this WIBTA for going over his head and that of people in the department who know and do nothing? It would ruin his career and reputation, and I'd go over the head of one of the people I respect there who doesn't see the problem, I've been weighing the costs"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Currently in the process of painting the case but saving up and plan on buying the rest in one go when financially ready to leave enough to live on comfortably. Recently he has started pushing for my total account balance in reference to the pc. I refuse to tell because I have always been the type to never discuss finance unless that balance is going to change significantly within the next week (Which it isnt). Due to this he is accusing of not being trusting but for me it is simply a matter of finance just not being something to be thrown around or discussed. It has always been just a number but that number is a measure of effort and only meant to be known by the person(s) managing that account.

My mom owed me 45 dollars but didn't give me the money the initial day she promised to give it to me(Saturday 6/15/19). So she said she'd give me 50 on Wednesday (6/19/19). I have 40 dollars with me now and she had said that she owes me 5 though, she said that she will give me 50. 

When I tried to say that she owes me 10 instead of 5, she called me selfish also possibly thinking that i want the money now. I was more than willing to wait longer for the ten but I wasn't going to stand for my mom saying that she only owes me 5. 

She started complaining about how she is in debt to everyone, how she is stressed(I understand how she is stressed. She works at a casino) and how I'm selfish for wanting my money and backtalking when I had said she put herself in that debt(Borrowing money from my uncle, my brothers, everyone to get drunk and hangout with her new boyfriend everyday) 

She also said that I'm not getting anymore allowance(I had worked for the money)

She also called me a selfish ungrateful child for asking for money while she is living paycheck to paycheck.

c2rds0	2019-06-20 04:17:51		AITA for worrying about my dads diet?	"My dad has been struggling with weight loss for years. He works really hard to lose weight and will relapse into a bad diet, which happens to the best of us. At his age it’s hard enough to lose weight as it is.

I think he tells my mom wrong info bc she thinks my dad has been disciplined all these years, and the only way to make him lose weight is to feed him under 1,000 calories. They blame his age. She is super critical of what he eats, even a bite of something good at a restaurant. I can imagine it’s exhausting for him. I’ve never told my mom that he’s lying, but I’ve tried to correct her for being misinformed. However she only listens to my dad.

Now, my mom often goes on trips to see her family in Europe and when she does my dad is left to cook for himself. Usually my mom cooks everything for him. Last year when my mom left, I guess my dad ate junk and put on a bunch of weight. My mom came back and was super furious, interrogated me on what he was doing.

Last week my mom left again to go to Europe and my dads diet already seems to be failing. Every time I get in his car it smells like fries and he hasn’t been eating the healthiest. When I see like a bag of chips, I won’t say anything and he’ll make a defensive passing comment to explain the chips. 

I worry that he will gain weight and resent himself, as that happens, and he may lie to my mom which will make her extremely furious (she will be regardless). My mom works very hard to make him healthy meals so she feels disrespected too. It’s also sad that my dad feels the need to be defensive around me. AITA for worrying about my dads diet and wanting to bring it up with him? I’ve always been told it’s none of my business. He is also a great father to me."		1	0
c2rcz6	2019-06-20 04:15:36	FlDawn	AITA For snapping at my mom	"So earlier today I got into a huge yelling match with my mother about the way she treats my dad. Before we get into this let me give some backstory.

My parents were an arranged marriage and were clearly not a good match. My dad had to leave school at a young age to work to support his family, and my mom got through high school but she is a smart woman. My dad isn't necessarily dumb, but he can be airheaded at times and very laid back. This disconnect between them has led to my mom having ALOT of resentment towards my father. He recently had a kidney transplant and can't work so they're both home 24/7.

All my mom does is treat him like shit. She barks orders at him all day and talks to him like he's worthless. Instead of saying ""hey can you do this thing for me"" she'll say ""GO DO THIS THING NOW!"" When I was younger she would shit talk him behind his back and try to drive a wedge between us. My dad is by no means perfect, he has his flaws but he's never hurt anyone, he's just a simple guy. 

So earlier today he was talking to me and she butts in and starts talking shit with her negativity and I just snapped. I told her I've had enough of her bullshit constant negativity. Not a day goes by that I am not bombarded with negativity from her and she lets that anger rule her every waking moment. She plays the victim and says I jump at the chance to defend my dad and attack her when in reality I just want a peaceful moment where there isn't constant negativity. I honestly don't feel bad at all for yelling at her because I'm just sick of dealing with this bullshit."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I’m a zit popping fantatic. I know it’s gross but I can’t help it. I have clear skin after discovering an amazing line of products and my husband has gorgeous skin so the chance to pop a zit is rare. 

Last night before he went to bed I noticed he had a huge white head right in the middle of his back. He’d had a horrible day at work and I knew he wasn’t in the mood so I didn’t say anything. 

But as I was waking up this morning I had a perfect angle and spot to get that zit. He was still asleep. I went in and squeezed and it was amazing and actually shot across the bed. The stem that shot out was thick and a few mm long. But he let out a howl like you wouldn’t believe. It must have really hurt him both with the pressure of the zit and the squeeze. 

He got up and said “holy shit Halee, Keep your fucking hands to yourself” and took such a long shower I had to leave and shower at work or I would have been late. He has another 15 hour day so I haven’t seen him.

I have seen her twice then at other friend things. About a week ago I sent out invites to my wedding and didn’t send her one. I don’t consider her a close friend anymore and anyone I was feeling iffy about, I didn’t invite. She was on that iffy list.

c2r814	2019-06-20 04:01:40	SPL712	AITA Best Friend Breakup	Today I just told my best friend, Sara, from 9th grade that I didn’t want to be friends anymore.  Here is some backstory to help everyone understand the situation. I was working a full time job right out of high school which left me very little time to see my friends after working long and exhausting hours. I also didn’t have a dependable car at the time so driving it across town gave me horrible anxiety for fear of it overheating (a common problem that happened daily with this car) and that the engine would explode. (I have diagnosed General Anxiety Disorder so that’s why I feared it so much even though it wasn’t likely to happen.)  Of course Sara lived across town so it was a major stressor that almost threw me into panic attacks so going to see her took a lot out of me. Anytime we agreed to hang out she would always have other friends of hers over and I would always end up getting drowned out and sat on my phone alone. I would think why am I bothering to put myself through the stress and give up what little free time I have to just sit here. So we grew distant and I stopped accepting invitations to hangout.  Then one day Gina and Ally, two of mine and Sara’s mutual friends, got into a fight with Sara.  Sara told me that they didn’t want to be friends with her anymore because of her mental health problems.  I took this very seriously because I suffer with similar issues and was upset with them, but having no way to contact them just dealt with my feelings.  A week later I run into Ally at work and she tells me her side of the story with all of the texts between her and Sara. I was so mad that she used my mental health as a way to turn me against my friends.  I sat on this for months because I honestly wasn’t in the headspace to deal with this situation properly.  I know it wasn’t the best move but I could barely get myself out of bed let alone try to end a friendship with someone I used to be so close with.  So today I finally did and my family is kinda like yeah it’s your decision but I don’t think you should’ve done that. So I want to know Am I the Asshole?	Not the A-hole	0	0

I know how it sounds, “rotten kid, spends too much time on his computer, disrespects his parents, etc” and I’ll admit I do spend too much time on my computer but it’s explainable.  

I don’t really have friends near where I live because of my schooling and my biggest hobby is computer gaming and simply relaxing on some YouTube. I do have a dirt bike, but I have to drive far to be able to ride it, and it needs some parts replaced.  

This results with me sitting on my computer a lot. When my computer is taken away, I don’t really have anything to do. I don’t watch tv and Reddit gets boring after awhile and needs a break.  

Effectively he’s making me sit around doing nothing till I go to bed. I basically always have to be on edge with him or I lose being able to do anything I like. My sister agrees that it’s ridiculous.  

For some more background, I struggle with sleep. I’ll often sit in bed for hours, restless. I’m starting to think I’m depressed. I think that this can have part in causing that depression. He’s a pretty explosive person and I really don’t like living with my family.  

Everyday seems like a struggle to separate myself from them. It really doesn’t feel like a family. Go ahead and say it’s just a teen faze, but I don’t think it is.  

I know I’ve kinda hopped around on this post a bit and I’m not good at posting cause I tend to just lurk, so I’m sorry. And just one last thing as a side note- talking it about it with him does nothing, I’ve tried. No matter my judgement, I think my views will stay the same.  

So Reddit, AITA?  

Tl;Dr: my dad got mad at me for calling him out, took away one of my only things I like to do and I think I’m depressed from living with my family.  

Edit: I called out my dad for being mad at me for not waiting 45 minutes till their show is over to talk to my mom quickly. I called him out because he brought it up again. This is not a first time."	Not enough info	0	0
