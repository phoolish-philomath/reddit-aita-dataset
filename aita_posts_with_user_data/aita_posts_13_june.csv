c0fhhn	2019-06-14 03:53:31	Vamosity-Cosmic	AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to fake her voice?	"My girlfriend has a deeper voice than what's normal. It's not anything crazy, I personally find it sexy, but she hates it. I constantly tell her I really like it and she shouldn't focus on what other people say (for example, sometimes people think she's a man when she's on the phone). It really bothers her. In my opinion, since I'm a sentimental type idiot, your voice is very important and you shouldn't try to change it because it's something true to you. I see her as being a 'pretender' whenever she tries to fake her voice to be more feminine. We've just argued over it, and she said 'is a very ugly person just supposed to accept they'll probably never find love?'. I think that's a ridiculous analogy, but for the time being I'm kind of giving her the cold shoulder until she just, in my opinon, just lets go of what people think and just accept herself for what she is. But I'm obviously having doubts, so here I am.

Small edit 1: When I mean cold shoulder, I was just not being enthusiastic or actively trying to speak to her. I'm never going to intentionally ignore her.

Edit 2: Already moved on from it. I realized it was assholeish for me to give her any form of the cold shoulder, and I'm letting her do what she wants. But she's now growing deterred from it because she can barely speak because of how hard it is to speak (after trying to train her voice). Then we both laughed about how stupid it was to argue over it and we both turned into voice actors. Happy ending."	Asshole	0	0	2547.0	381.0	0.0	0.0

She has also been open with me about helping me over come this fear.


So fast forward to wed, were at the lake, when our lounge floaties begin to float away from us, I'm the closest and she tell me to go get it, I reluctantly go and I freeze up after taking three steps toward the direction the floaties are going. When an 8 year old child comes and heroiclu grabs the floaties for me and brings it to us. Because of the commotion the entire lake is watching and were here with her whole family. Needless to say I was mortified and embarrassed. When I get on her about what happens, she tells me that I was wrong for being upset about it and that she would prefer to be truthful vs polite so she let me know she found what happened funny. 

I get mad because she knows the trauma I have with deep water, and the fact i felt she should have come and consoled me in that time, as it is what I would have done if roles were reversed. Am i the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	73.0	52.0	0.0	0.0
c0fgqy	2019-06-14 03:51:31	Etho3000	AITA for hoping he would take the hint or is this considered ghosting even though we didn’t go on a date? Be honest please,	I (23f) work in a call center. After work, many of my coworkers go across the street to the bar to hang out and drink as a group. Eventually, one of my coworkers who I had a crush on joined the group. Me and him hit it off at the bar and bonded. It was strange. We had a couple of drinks and I opened up about some things going on in my personal life. I began to cry. The guy was supportive and we ended up cuddling. After work, he joined our group more often. We’d talk and after the night was over he would give me really long hugs. I told a couple of people that I liked him. We are a close group within our coworkers and so word got to him that I liked him. Over the course of the week, I realized that while I do like him as a person, my initial attraction to him kind of dropped.  I was under the impression that he was gonna ask me out soon and so I tried dropping hints to him that I wasn’t interested. I’d give one word responses in our conversation and I could sense that he recognized a difference in my interaction with him. I hosted a birthday party at my house. All of my coworkers came and we had a good time. My sister really liked him and told me that she approved of him. I still felt that the spark wasn’t enough for me. The day after my party, he texted saying that he had a great time and that he appreciated the invite to the party.In the same text he asked if I’m free on Monday?  I didn’t respond to the message. He then called my phone and I didn’t answer his call. A mutual friend approached me and asked why I didn’t respond to his texts and didn’t return his call. I figured that since we weren’t exclusive nor have we gone on a date that it wouldn’t be a big deal. The guy speaks to me when we cross paths at work, but he hasn’t hung out with the group since. Am I the asshole? Be honest.	Asshole	0	0	9.0	11.0	0.0	0.0

My spouse is concerned about the whole thing way more than I am, particularly about performance issues and size/shape of my unit as swelling sometimes occurs. Would I be the asshole if I played a joke on her either now or at the time of/after the follow up?   I'm not sure exactly what kind of prank to play, but I was thinking of something as simple as pretending not being able to get it up to as complicated as a enlarged prosthetic to startle her.  My sense of humor has gotten me into trouble in the past, so I thought I would ask complete strangers first before I did anything either funny. Or stupid that might anger my amazing wife.

Some background: I’m 14 and the “friend” in question is 13. Let’s call her D. I’m pretty much like a therapist to D, she always texts me and tells me about her problems. I always console her in the best way possible and she usually cheers up and starts talking to me.

So what happened was, I was going to hang out with a girl I liked, but I ended up getting stood up. My self esteem took a pretty big blow and I was pretty sad. So I texted D and told her what happened, hoping she would treat me like I treated her, but she responded with, and I quote, “AHAHAHAHAHAHA” . I then said bye and she said bye. She obviously didn’t care. That hurt even more. So I left it and didn’t come back to it, then, maybe 7 hours later at 11pm she texts me and says that she can’t stop crying (she says this often) . So I decided to reply with “AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA” like she did. she then proceeded to call me an asshole and blocked me. AITA for this?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"To give some background, the only one of my parents who works is my father, and he gets Friday - Sunday off every weekend. I have a brother that lives in the Dallas area, and we don't see him too often. I completely understand that they miss him and would like to see him. However, they planned to visit him this weekend come back on Monday, which would miss my birthday on Saturday. 

When they told me this, I was kind of irked because it would miss my birthday (and they would also be using my more fuel-efficient car, leaving me without transportation as the only other car is a standard I can't drive). 

The car thing isn't so bad, but I'm a little bit hurt that they could've chosen any other weekend to visit him and chose the weekend of my birthday. Birthdays are really important to me, but I understand that they're not as important to other people. Again, I also understand that they would like to see all their children and choosing between children sucks for a parent.

Ultimately, though, I feel that there are better ways to plan this trip, and I am honestly hurt enough that I'd like to take some time to distance myself from them. Am I justified in feeling this way?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"My boss and I have always been very close and when she goes on her once yearly vacation I usually watch her dog and the few cats she has. The dog is big goof whom I love but he has had problems with going to the bathroom in his cage. No big deal. I usually clean it up without issue. 

The problem is one of the cats had kittens this past week and before my boss left the mother cat moved them. My boss and her kids could not find the kittens before they left but had to go and so they shut all the doors (to keep the other cats out) and left. 

THREE DAYS later I hear the kittens crying from a shut bedroom and go in to find them having been without food for now up to three days. I bring the mother up to feed them and they weren't latching. This snowballed into a debating on whether or not to have to bottle fed (which I do not have time for but obviously don't want the kittens to die). 

In the process of moving the mother cat, I noticed fleas on her. After confronting my boss through text, she revealed that she knew the cat had fleas but couldn't do anything because of the babies. I, of course, get very upset as I do not want the fleas coming back to my own pets and she didn't even warn me before I started coming. She decides that because of the whole situation, she's coming back from the only vacation she takes a year, early.

c0fclq	2019-06-14 03:39:13		AITA for not wanting to hang out with my dad and instead of saying so, I keep making up excuses not to?	"So my father has been pretty inconsistent in my life. My grandma (his mom) basically took his place when I was a child. The only reason I would see him was because I would be with my grandma. He lived with her for some time, so that's a given I would see him, but when he didn't, I wouldn't even see him then. My aunts and uncles also were stand-ins for him. My grandma has since passed away, so I might see him once or twice in one year if I'm lucky. 

He would, and still has up until a few months ago when he just stopped offering, lie to me about where he was so he would have an excuse to not hang out with me when he said he would. He has money but never helps me or my mom pay for anything. I'm in college and he doesn't pay for a book, a loan, or anything while my mom does everything. When I would ask him for money for small things, he'd either guilt trip me by saying I only talk to him for money or say he won't have it until \[insert date\] and when that date comes around, would come up with an excuse for why he can't give it to me. He would have moments of ""I need to do better"" except he never does. It's honestly tiring. I was set on cutting him out of my life at 16, but everyone (including my mom) convinced me not to. Now I don't want to cut him out of my life just because I feel like he shouldn't have to escape the financial responsibility of having a kid. He may only give me money sometimes, but it's still money I didn't have before.

I'm a very successful college student. I get straight A's for the most part, I have a high GPA, and I've made the Dean's List every semester. Recently, I won an award for outstanding academic achievement for the second year in a row. My mom sent it to him for some well-earned bragging rights, but he sent me a really long text about how he was upset I didn't feel the need to send it to him. He took full responsibility for our strained relationship and said he'll do better. He's texted me a few times trying to figure out a few days that I'm free, but I just don't want to hang out with him. I like staying at home. I like my room, my bed. I also just don't like hanging out with him, to be honest. He knows nothing about me, and I know nothing about him. I'm in my early 20's and trying to build a relationship now just seems pointless. I've honestly developed an attitude where I don't need a father figure even if it's my real dad. I've been telling him I can't hang out until school is over, but the semester ends in a few days. I feel like an asshole for not being honest, but he's still my dad, and I don't want to hurt his feelings especially with Father's Day coming up.

So today I came back to my dorm to move the last of my stuff. We had a total of 6 girls so it can be hard to tell what stuff is yours to take. However we have one girl Maya who purposely left a shit load of things she didn’t want to deal with. A couple white boards, a blender, giant cardboard boxes, kitchenware, a BIKE (because of one flat tire), not to mention tons of food in the fridge and cupboards. Her mom even encouraged her to leave it behind when moving out (according to witness roommate).

She had already moved out yesterday so there was no point in texting her. I started dumping out things people left behind, including hers. I felt bad that some cleaner coming to vacuum has to deal with her shit.
 
I got hit with some petty irritation (you can imagine what it must’ve been like *living* with Maya the past year) and I decided to take all of her items and put it on her desk, in her assigned space. After, I’m supposed to fill out a sheet stating I’ve moved out and to leave comments regarding damages because we can get billed. I stated that one roommate (didn’t leave a name) left a ton of items. I listed the specific items that I had placed in her space so they can piece it together. She will definitely get billed for that. 

My roommate who was there helping me clean wanted nothing to do with it. I told her I didn’t want to get fined, then again I think I could have prevented all of it if I had just tossed her things out. I had plenty of time. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

He'll gift me a game every now and again. Now, I have a habit of kind of playing the same few games while my Steam library kind piles up. Because of this, I usually wait until the summer steam sale before buying any more games. Anyhow, after he buys me a game, he'll be kind of persistent on me playing it in a not-really subtle way. 

The other week he asked if I was interested in a nostalgic game he likes, but I wasn't really that interested and knew I probably wouldn't get around to it any time soon. But he kind of persisted, it was like a dollar or two, so I said sure. Cue him today being like ""You know what I'd appreciate? You playing that game""

After that him and 3 other moderators started using racial and homophobic slurs and just overall harassing me in the server and my DMs to which I blocked them. I messaged the owner of the server and realm about this but I’ve been told he has not been on in over a month.

Anyway, we go on our way.  So now, it's happened about 5 times if I'm alone or with my daughter.  He rides up, starts asking too many weird questions while I'm trying to put groceries in the car.  I tried ignoring him and he kind of got pissed and said, ""you're a nice person, aren't you??!!""  Now we run to the car and try to avoid him because he gives me the creeps!  My biggest fear is that I will tell the store or call the cops and be made to feel like an asshole.  Maybe he's been in this town forever.  Maybe he's harmless.  I don't know.

TLDR; went to dinner with mom and her cousin, my mom poked fun at my depression. now, i don’t want to go to her birthday dinner tomorrow.

so i (F, 18) am almost a month deep into summer vacation. i don’t drive and a lot of my friends are either far/preoccupied with college so i’ve really been spending a lot of time home alone. this has exacerbated my preexisting mental health issues— while i was still in school, i had schoolwork and constantly seeing my friends as distractors from my depression, body image problems, anxiety, etc. now that i have 0 stimulants, i’ve regressed back into my old unhealthy mental state.

my mother has noticed that i haven’t been doing much and has had her share of fun at my expense, when she comes home from work, she asks me why my fifteen-year-old brother goes out more than i do, why i do absolutely nothing, blah blah.

she doesn’t really have the best track record when it comes to handling my mental health, (it took a grand-scale unhinged mental breakdown for her to even recognize i had problems last year, even though i’d told her repeatedly i needed help). so when it came to trying to explain how i was feeling, i oversimplified it to ‘i’m bored and there’s nothing to do around here.’

why i’m really writing this post though is because of something that happened a little less than an hour ago. my mother’s cousin is in town and wanted to have dinner with her. my mom’s birthday is tomorrow but her cousin won’t be here, so they decided to celebrate together today.

i initially didn’t want to go, said that i would skip out and instead go to her real birthday dinner. when she asked why, i told her i ‘wasn’t feeling up to it’ and that i was ‘sad,’ which has historically been my way of telling her that my depression was acting up. she took it as a valid answer at first but then kept bugging me, saying that her cousin would be so happy to see me, etc. so then i said fine, i’ll go.

we’re there and the conversation changes to the topic of summer. my mom goes on to say that while my brother is never home, i’m always there and didn’t even want to come out tonight because i was ‘sad’ (said in a ridiculing way.) her and her cousin laughed, i said it wasn’t funny, and they both laughed again. they went on for a few minutes about it.

at this point i’m annoyed. after, i excused myself to the bathroom because i couldn’t take it. i know that tomorrow is her actual birthday and she’d be having ANOTHER dinner, the real one i told her i’d attend instead of tonight’s. my brother got out of it because he had a party to go to, but as i am the ‘adult’ child who definitely has nothing ‘better’ to do, my mom’s counting on me going. i don’t want to go anymore because 1. i’m mad at her, and 2. i don’t want to be ridiculed again, this time with a whole bunch of adults there as the audience.

c0fa74	2019-06-14 03:31:01	Chickadee_Cortana_	AITA for refusing to talk to my friend because she cheated?	"TL;DR at the bottom

Backstory, I've been friends with this girl, we'll call her Ashlynn, since 9th grade. We have been super close since and I even worked with her husband for a while. We were all like three peas in a pod, they would come over every other weekend and her husband, we will call him Kaleb, gave me sound advice whenever my ex would just decide to pop back into my life whenever he felt like it. 

Keleb was really good to Ashlynn, even took care of her for the first year of their marriage because she was diagnosed with chronic pain. Everything about their relationship was good. But then Kalebs friend passed away and according to Ashlynn he was being distant towards her because he was mourning. 

I guess Ashlynn didn't take to this well because she messaged me and told me she had slept Kalebs brother and that he caught them! I was very disappointed in her but i wasn't super angry like i am now. I had a serious talk with her about it and told her to do what was right. So I guess they started to work things out because they came and stayed a week with my husband and I for my birthday. They seemed fine, he was buying her all sorts of gifts and she seemed happy. 

But after they got home, she texted me again and said that Kaleb had once again caught her sleeping with his brother. I was furious this time, after seeing how hard he was working to save the marriage after she wronged him she turned around and did it again! I told her I didn't know what to say, and honestly haven't spoken to her in a long time. Last time I did they said they were getting a divorce.

Today she posted that she is now in a relationship with Kalebs brother and i am still so upset and angry with her because Kaleb is a really awesome guy. But I feel it is not my place to be angry. 

So, AITA for not talking to my long term friend for her choices she made?

c0f9rx	2019-06-14 03:29:37	lexplm4	WIBTA/AITA for telling secretaries to back off my dog	"So for context. Me (19F) and my Boyfriend (20M, J) have a 1.5 yr old American Pitbull Terrier (N). We have had her since she was 7 weeks old and she was the only puppy in the litter (which is slightly important).

When N was old enough we started taking her to Puppy classes because we wanted her to be socialized, and wanted training tips.

N is also extremely smart, she knows sit, lay, roll, play dead, bed, dance, up, down, wait, and stay. You can also put food on her nose and she wont eat it until someone says ""break"". I trained her the most as a puppy and J isnt strict enough with her which has made her begin to misbehave more.

So because N is a Pitbull and some people are scared of dogs, J and I agreed that when shes around people she needs to be held back and wait until shes calm before she can go say hi, she jumps up too much and I dont want to risk her getting in trouble. J is again not as strict with this as I wish he would be which has caused her again to back track on training.

I have several friends and family who get angry when I refuse to let her go because they say shes just a puppy and shes so sweet and I'm being too harsh. This just makes me angry because she is OUR dog, and she is still in training and it's none of their business. This has led to me putting N in her kennel while people like that are around which isnt fair to her but I don't know how else to deal with this. These people usually come right up to her despite the fact we ask them to wait. N is VERY strong so this has led to a few injuries to fingers from her collar. 

Tomorrow afternoon N has a vet appointment for some vaccines. Shes gets excited everytime we pull into the parking lot. The veterinarians respect our wishes with her but the secretaries dont. Every time we go they immediately come over a let her jump all over them. I've tried pulling her back and asking them not to but it only works for a few minutes before they start up again. This gets her worked up so that when we sit to wait for the vet she whines and howls for more attention. She goes from an easy to handle dog to an overly excited misbehaving puppy. This has began to make me resent her which I know isnt her fault and I shouldn't, I'm trying to get better but still.

So my plan tomorrow is to hold her back and ask the secretaries to please leave her alone as she is too excitable and becomes too much to handle if they pay too much attention to her. 

So AITA for asking people to leave her alone and respect J and I's wishes involving N, and WIBTA if I told the secretaries to back off during N's appointment tomorrow?

TLDR; Have a 1.5 yr old Pitbull who gets too excited and hard to handle around friends, family, roommates and secretaries at vet. AITA for keeping dog away from those people and WIBTA if I told secretaries to back off at Vet office tomorrow."	Not the A-hole	0	0	162.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

c0f7x3	2019-06-14 03:23:46	zoltakk	AITA for being upset that my SO wants to spend a lot of time with her guy friend specifically without me there?	"The title makes it sound obvious, but it’s more complicated than that.

I (M) have this friend, let’s call him B. He’s been one of my best friends for many years now, and he’s great. My SO, lets call her A, has been with me for about a year, and she has also befriended B to the point where they are very close. 

I think that it’s very cool that these two are bonding, in fact I feel very lucky that it happened so easily. But lately, I feel like they’ve been spending a lot of time together, without me. It’s not like they are trying to hide it at all, they’re quite open about it. Keep in mind, I’m not concerned about them actually cheating, I trust both of them with my life. 

However, them hanging out one on one with each other all the time still makes me feel like I’m losing time with her, and that I don’t get to be as intimate with her. I have brought this up to her, and her response was that she needs times to hang out without me, with B only. And that it’s with B only because she doesn’t really have many other friends (which is true). 

It was hard for me to understand this when she told me because I have never felt that I need time to hang out away from her; if I can include her in any social situation I will. But A says that when we’re together in a group, it inhibits something in her, and she’s forced to constantly think about our relationship and keep me in mind. For that reason, she doesn’t want me there sometimes.

I eventually accepted that, but it did not sit well with me. Now, they hang out basically every day, doing various things, almost always without me there. I brought it up again recently, but she said that I was being unfair and that she should be able to do things without me. 

Just today even, A was with me, then she decided to cut our visit short to go visit B. 

It might seem worse than it is, but I can’t stress enough how much I trust each of them, and how cheating is really not any concern to me. My concern is just that I feel like B is replacing me in other ways.

c0f7u6	2019-06-14 03:23:28	metallicScat	AITA for dating a friend's ex?	"I met two freshman who were dating the summer before my senior year. I met them each individually and did not know they were dating until the semester started and the three of us became friends. When I first met the girl, Marly, I thought she was incredibly cute. George was a friendly guy and seemed pretty cool, but was not as memorable to me for obvious reasons. 

Over the semester the three of us became fairly close, and I quickly developed a crush for Marly. I denied my feelings for a while since she was dating George, but I also felt a bit odd about the age difference. Being a senior feels pretty far removed from a freshman. 

Marly and George eventually break up. My impression was that there were some underlying reasons. Marly reached out to me to talk about these things. I did my best to listen, but the advice I gave did not neccesarily support dating in college in general. In hindsight I'd like to think I gave honest advice, but perhaps subconsciously I wanted them to break up. 

After the breakup it became clear to me that Marly had a crush on me as well. I later find out that was the final straw (and main reason) that Marly and George broke up. A few weeks go by and still I'm trying to deny my feelings for her, because I know it would hurt George if we began to see each other. Just before winter break we both acknowledge our feelings for each other, but also that it wouldnt be fair to George. After texting all of break we decide to start seeing each other. 

George confronts me and tells me that I did a shitty thing to him. That he would never have done that to a friend, and that I effectively stole his girlfriend. 

I am conflicted between feeling guilty for hurting Geroge, and also feeling that if two people want to be together they shouldn't have to feel guilty about it. 

Months later Marly and I are still dating, and George and I no longer talk. Am I the asshole?

TL;DR: two freshman are dating, I'm a senior. I befriend them both, but allow my feelings for the girl to come between the three of us. She reciprocates the feelings, breaks up with her boyfriend and now we date. AITA?"	Not enough info	0	0	14.0	6.0	0.0	0.0

Been out, downtown college town is packed. Local dive, semi regular, mosey in to finish the night at 11ish. Karaoke is going strong, but not the usual crowd. Make small talk with my bartender, grab a drink and post up out of the way and get to people watching.

After a bit of wallflowering, realize it's frat mom night. Look over to a table near me and see a lady dancing. Older. Not sure how much. Next to a frat boy and his girlfriend, assume it's the dancy lady's mom. Sing along and keep peeping trying to work through dancing lady age. No ring. Probably her kid. Good for her.

Frat guys girlfriend leans over and points out to frat that I'm obviously peeping. No shits given, give a jaunty wave. 

At this point frat looks at me and yells something about staring being rude. Still no fucks given, meander over and start making conversation. ""I'm sorry, are you not having fun being looked at in a bar you obviously are treating like a tourist attraction? It's the bar. We stare"" 

Can tell gf and mom are uncomfortable. Realize I'm being rude, but fuck that guy. Mosey back to my singing spot and continue to peep. Get a glare from frat, flip him the bird and continue to sing. 

Chat with other regulars. Frat and frat gf get up and butcher a song. I sing along. My turn comes and I sing my song and head home.

Wake up next morning and try to work through were if any where IATA. Forget about it till next time I'm out for karaoke.

"So I'm the only one out of 6 kids to have had my own and to be honest my parents have been pretty uninterested grandparents. I don't feel entitled to anything, but we have two young kids who love their grandparents and despite living 5 minutes away, they never see them and we have zero support from them.

 If they ever come over it's only for like 30 minutes before they leave again for some other pointless fucking commitment and if we are ever over there, we don't just let the kids destroy the house, we're on-top of them and vigilant, but kids are kids, which they should fucking know having had 6 of them.

I noticed a while ago that there hasn't been many family dinners anymore, as this used to be semi regular with all the birthdays and didn't think much else about it. However recently, my brother asked why we weren't there on Mother's Day, and I'm like 'what?'

Apparently they've still been doing these family get togethers, but have stopped inviting us. My brother apparently asked mum where we were and she shrugged it off and said it was too hard with the kids! Too hard for who? They're your only fucking grandchildren!

My wife is really hurt about it and especially sad for the kids who just adore their grandparents, but sadly they're seen as annoying and difficult.

So I (20m) and my friend Heidi* (20f), who I’ve been close with for 4+ years, are hanging out at my house to play video games together, but instead of actually playing or even talking for that matter, she just uses my computer to incessantly message her “boyfriend” online.

I say “boyfriend” in quotes because they have never actually met in person and they aren’t “official” but they consider themselves mutually exclusive. Every time I talk to Heidi, she tells me how they’ve been fighting, he’s being immature or whatever, but then they make up the next day. It’s a never ending cycle. 

I always try to be a good friend and give her the best advice I can when she asks for it, even though I feel like I’m essentially digging myself an even deeper hole into the friendzone with her...

Normally I wouldn’t have a problem with her messaging him because obviously I don’t control her life and she isn’t my girlfriend so I have no say in who she decides to talk to. 

The problem is that she literally goes afk while we’re playing games together and starts furiously messaging him about whatever it is they’ve decided to argue about today. I asked her if she could stop and just get back to him later, and she told me to “shut up.”

Maybe I’m just being jealous and selfish, but it makes me feel used and neglected. Like, why even come over if you’re just going to talk to someone else the whole time and ignore me. I even paid for her dinner. And I’m not okay with her telling me to “shut up” in my own house.

The car went in for a service today and it need new tires if the car was to be drivin interstate as they probably wont make it.

Me and my friends smoke Marihuana.
2 Days ago one of my friends made a deal with some guy (lets just call him ""A"") to be the courier for a relatively large delivery of weed in exchange for some money/weed (I was not involved in this deal). My friend was supposed to deliver a bag to the buyer and then bring the money he got from the buyer to guy A.

But after delivering the bag and befor he brought the money to Guy A he came to me to chill. After some hours his Mom called him demanding that he gets home. Still a little high he forgets the money at my place and that he was still supposed to delivery it.
While cleaning up i found the money and decided to call him in his cellphone. He didnt picked up so i texted him instead.

5 or so minutes pass and i get a call from guy A complaining that my friends didnt already brought him the money and so I had to deliver it (I thing after reading my texts he told guy A that the money was by me and that I would delivery it without asking me first). Not wanting to get my friend into trouble I agreed.

Guy A told me to put the money into his mailbox. He lives in an Apartment building where the mailboxes of the residens are tightly stacked on top of another. Me being extremely paranoid someone could see me infront of the mailboxes put it in without really looking. 

Some time passes and guy A calls me sounding rather pissed and asking why his money is still not in his mailbox. That was the moment i realised that i had accidentally put the money not in his mailbox but in the one directly above his.

Luckily one of the closer friends of Guy A actually saw me infront of the mailboxes so he knew that i didnt just took the money for myself.

Guy A than called me explaining that all is fine if we would give him the money back he lost because of us.  Acknowledging the fact that it was an accident he said that we didnt need to pay him back everything. Instead of the whole 200€ we just needed to give him back 150€.

Later that day my friend calls me suggesting that each of us would pay 75€ to get to the 150€ in total.

Now my questin is WIBTA if i would refused to pay (or at least not the full 75€) for a fuckup of a task I was never supposed to do and that was forced opon me?
I was never involved with the deal my friend made with guy A. I had nothing to gain it was just a favor i did so that my friend wouldnt get in trouble.

It looked great, but once I got it home, it rode terribly, and the breaks were shot. I rode it once and there it sat, in the storage unit of our apartment. Flash forward a year, and we’ve bought a condo, with a garage. The bike comes with us because my husband says, “It’s a really cool bike, let’s keep it.” Against my better wishes, we keep it. And there it sits, in the condo garage. Never ridden. 2 more years later, we’ve bought a house, with a bigger garage. Same story, bike tags along. This unridable $50 flea market bike has now officially moved with us twice, and there it sits, in our bigger garage for two years. My husband has since filled the garage with more crap, making the 2.5 car garage impossible to park in. I start cleaning the garage a couple weeks ago, and see The Bike. I say to myself, “I’m throwing this bike away. Now.” And I roll it out to the curb. I come home from work the next day, and there it is, back in the garage. I ask my husband, “Hey; what’s the deal with the bike?” He claims his dad wants it, so he’s keeping it aside for him. I wait two weeks, dad is nowhere to be found, bike is still there. I roll it out again to the curb, and FINALLY this useless piece of garbage is out of my life. My husband flips his lid, and accuses me of treating this house like “my” house and not “our house.” That he wanted to keep the bike, because he wanted to ride it eventually (he hasn’t ridden any bike in 8 years), despite the fact that 24 hours previous to this, he was saving it for his dad. I’m furious, obviously, but AITA here? Should I have let him keep the bike it the cluttered garage until the end of time just because he felt like it? TIA.	Not the A-hole	0	0	185.0	28.0	0.0	0.0

 We're both great at expressing our feelings and opinions and working through our frustrations with each other. But even after coming to terms,  I can't stop being FURIOUS about it.

c0ez3u	2019-06-14 02:56:41	1972Pinto	AITA for the minor joke I made at a family event?	"A joke I made at my cousin at a family event has seemingly spiraled out of control. I'll try and give as much concise and neutral background as possible.

My family held a holiday event and included a scavenger hunt game into the event. My mom purchased cheap trinkets that we collected and got to keep at the end. All parties involved were drinking. 

Me and my cousin are both mid to late 20s, I've grown up seeing them regularly through the years and I always thought we had a good relationship. I am a silly person and non-confrontational, my cousin can have a laugh but is a bit more sensitive and much more aggressive, especially when drinking. Once again, we were both drinking.

Someone at the event (that I had brought) had taken one of Cousin's cheap trinkets and there has been a squabble about it. I don't think they took the item maliciously but in a teasing way where they planned to give it back. But the person I brought and my Cousin don't know each other and the teasing came off poorly to my cousin. I'm adding in this detail to give context to how my cousin might've been feeling.

I have a joke I regularly make, where I put an ""L"" on my forehead at people. Most people laugh because they dont expect it from someone in there mid-20s, I've always thought of it as a silly children's joke, people usually do it back.

I either made an ""L"" on my forehead at my friend and by proxy my cousin standing behind them or directly at my cousin, I honestly can't remember. Nothing was said to me in that moment and I mostly forgot about it.

My Aunt (Cousin's mom) sent a text to my mom telling her we're bad family, I called my cousin a loser, I bring terrible people around the family, she wants nothing to do with us anymore because we're toxic people, etc. A big part of this text focused on me calling my cousin a loser. They have not spoken to or seen any of us since.

The whole situation makes me sad and angry. I feel like this explosion is not solely because of me but obviously I have caused some conflict. I am angry that no one said anything to me but just blew up at my mom, no one said ""hey, I don't like that, please don't"" and as silly as I think my joke is, I would've reeled it in for that person but I never got the opportunity. 

I've never had a conflict like this with any family member before. Our family still does not speak and they have mostly cut ties with all of us. I know jokes are supposed to be funny for everyone and I honestly thought this joke was too childish to be seen as a serious ""wow, they called me a loser"". Especially with people I've always been jokey with and known my whole life. I have never called anyone a loser verbally.

I don't feel wrong but that doesn't make me feel better about this situation. Is my joke really that shitty? Is there context to it that I'm missing? Am I being a real prick over a joke I shouldn't have made? Should I have sought my cousin out when I when I heard I had hurt them? AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So at my college, we happened to have a private Facebook group for just men, ""gentlemen of ____"" (there was one for women too).

It was fun and chill when I first joined, enjoying the privacy of it and since it was independent and not official/monitored, it was fun to talk about things occasionally that normally wouldn't be all that appropriate. As well as randomly gossip about professors and stuff and others.

There would also be the occasional ""smash or pass"" posts (just random models from the internet), which were alright I guess, but then I noticed they started to talk about some of our female classmates like that, sharing their sexual fantasies and what they would like to do with them, in detail. Kinda made me a bit uncomfortable since I was good friends with some of them.

I mentioned it to a friend who was being talked about and what was being said, she freaked out and next thing I know, a few days later the group is shut down and several men from it are expelled, and I get a notice that I'm about to be. I had to fight them and explain that I wasn't a part of it and how it is because of me that they know about it so they don't see me as ""guilty by association"", which wasn't easy but I did eventually get my expulsion overturned and my degree.

Initially I wanted to be anonymous before I realized I'd be taking the fall for it, but eventually I realized it's nothing to be ashamed of considering what they did. Or is it? I have been struggling to find a job and now people who know what I did are saying I deserve to be jobless.

"My brother (27) lives with me (29m) hasn’t worked since January and has racked up 2500 hours on splatoon 2 in less than a year. He spends all day playing switch games with his online gf he has never met but could see TODAY if he spent £50 on a flight to Germany. He is on benefits and to be fair he pays his rent and food but owes me money for internet and other things. 

3 weeks ago I gave him an ultimatum, apply for some jobs and at least get ONE interview (within 3 weeks, which he can do because he’s done it before) or I will cut off the internet.

Edit:- he hasn’t got an interview and didn’t talk to
Me about jobs at all during the past 3 weeks.

I’m not painting a very good picture of him but not too long ago he was quite sociable, he has friends and is decent looking and has worked quite a few jobs over the years. He is capable of so much more, he’s great at drums, guitar and art but he has absolutely zero drive or direction in his life. He doesn’t act depressed but no amount of pestering from the family has spurred him into action. And yes he does smoke weed go figure, with the typical stoner excuses that it doesn’t make him lazy etc etc...

So today I cut it off and he’s gone off the wall, complaining about his clan needing him for his league matches like a fucking kid, I can’t believe he’s 27 it’s like he’s reverting mentally.

He said he’s been looking for jobs, there’s nothing out there and I’m treating him like a kid and I said he’s acting like a fucking kid. I could go on, he always asks me what’s for dinner etc etc 

He’s using his hotspot at the moment but it’s gonna run out and I’ll have another shit show in my hands.

He’s my brother I love him and want him to do well but I don’t know what to do or if this is too heavy handed an approach."	Not the A-hole	0	0	42.0	6.0	0.0	0.0

But I have another question about a friendship that I find more ambiguous. This story happened almost 2 years ago, but I always wanted a clear answer. Enter Martin (not his real name but for the sake of this post I'll use it.) Martin moved to my school in 8th grade. He was really funny and I thought he seemed like the kind of person I'd want to hang out with. Naive me thought I was fucking hilarious, and so I told jokes to everyone, Martin included. I wanted him to like me, but I guess I was too cringey. Mix that in with some other people who didn't really like me giving Martin bad info about me. I never suspected that he hated me. I kept asking and bothering him to add me on social media, which he eventually caved to doing. I never tried to be mean, but I joking kept reminding him on the daily. During summer vacation of that year, I posted something a rather innocent picture of myself. I must have looked retarded, since Martin and some other jerks screenshotted the picture and turned it into a local meme. At the beginning of this year, I tried a less annoying approach and tried being friendly to him, but he still told me to shut up every time I talked, even if what I said wasnt directed towards him. I gave up trying to befriend this guy eventually, but it still hurts my feelings. He still posts offensive things about people I know for no reason. But, I want closure even if Martin isn't the greatest person. AITA for wanting to be friends with someone repeatedly even though they clearly didn't want to be my friend?

c0eveq	2019-06-14 02:45:24	KungFuEli	AITA for telling people there is no end credit scene?	"IF YOU CARE ABOUT END CREDIT SCENES LIKE THESE PEOPLE DONT READ I GUESS

So, I have been working at a movie theater for a summer job, and my movie theater has ushers, but ushers at our theater don’t rip people’s tickets, they just clean the theaters. So that’s what I’ve been doing recently on my shifts and it’s pretty laid back and easy.

So ushers get a door sheet, and it has what theaters to go to in an order so you can clean each theater after everyone gets out efficiently. And I had Dark Phoenix and another movie to clean at the same time. It’s super slow on weekdays so it’s not a big deal. But I knew the other movie besides Dark Phoenix was pretty crowded so I wanted to be as efficient as possible. So when I walked into Dark Phoenix, and the credits were rolling, there was 4 sets of people still in the theater presumably waiting for the end credit scene like most super hero movies have these days. So, to help them out (in my mind I guess) and myself out to clean the theater faster, I told them “hey guys, you don’t have to wait around there’s no end credit scene.” I’ve done this many times with no issues but this couple in this showing had an issue. They got up from their seat and yelled at me for “ruining their movie going experience” and wanted to speak to a manager.

So I call a manger to the theater and they tell the manger that I was rude for spoiling that there was no end credit scene and they complained also that I was shining a flash light as well. I told my manager that last part was false but I didn’t see an issue with telling them as it saved them time. My manager told the couple we were sorry and he gave them a free movie pass. Once they left, my manager told me to just stop telling people about how there’s no end credit scene.

c0evdl	2019-06-14 02:45:19		WIBTA if I didn't go to my friend's wedding?	"My ""best friend"" is getting married this summer. We've been on and off best friends for about ten years, but the relationship has had tumultuous moments, and at this point he refers to me as his 'best friend' (though I honestly don't think that I would call him my best friend).

He's getting married in August, in a city that while not that far away from where I live in the grand scheme of things, would require a two hour flight for me to get to. This is not the city that he lives in, or that he or the bride are from, but the city he went to grad school in, and he picked it because he likes the venue and it's massively cheaper than getting married in the city he lives in. While the city itself is kind of lame, I've been internally considering this a destination wedding, because for me (and 95% of the guests) to go would require significant expense in the form of flights and hotel rooms for two or more nights, which could run me somewhere around $1000 or more. I have a good job (a fact of which he is well aware), and while I *could* spend the money right now, I don't want to. I have a lot of other expenses and stuff going on, and spunking a grand on going to his wedding to be a guest seems really wasteful to me at this time. 

Also, while they have sent out 'Save the Date' cards, the wedding is in less than 8 weeks and they haven't sent out invitations yet. I get that a Save the Date is kind of similar, but I personally wouldn't book a hotel or airfare until the actual invite arrives, and have had to sit and watch flight prices rise.  I know that they're being mailed out sometime this week, but it seems really slapdash to me (which kind of seems to be a theme as far as the planning has gone), most weddings I've been to, especially destination weddings, I've had invites way earlier.

To add some color to this— I'm not part of the wedding party or involved in any way, and while I intellectually understand why, I'm a little resentful of the fact that he won't be an adult and talk about it, instead choosing to ignore it. He also has no problem telling me about who he is picking and asking them, etc. It's his wedding, and he is perfectly willing to involve who he wants, but I really don't feel the same sense of obligation to go that I might otherwise feel. I'm also kind of anticipating some awkwardness from other friends that I might encounter there because of it, and really don't want to deal with that.

I know that he's going to throw a fit and call me an asshole if I don't go. Would I actually be the asshole?"	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0evdj	2019-06-14 02:45:18	MrShortShortShorts	WIBTA if I went out with my GF in short shorts?	"Throwaway here because my girlfriend knows my real Reddit account (my first mistake). Now, I need to first say that I fully support a woman’s right to wear whatever she likes. But I do believe that there is a time and a place for certain clothing, for a man or a women.

She has always dressed well, but more recently she has taken to dressing over the top sexy for simple trips out, like a day trip to the city. Specifically, shorts or skirts that go all the way up to her cheeks, and shirts they could be best described as more like crop tops. The attention that this generates makes me uncomfortable, and quite frankly embarrassed.

No, I know that most relationships fail in the communications front, so I’ve tried to talk to her about it in an understanding way, and explain how I feel. Whenever I’ve tried to do that though the response has been to tease me and ask me if I’m jealous. And that if you’ve got it, you should flaunt it.

 So since talking about it hasn’t worked, I’m thinking about a different approach. I am reasonably attractive and go to the gym a lot, so I’m thinking about taking a page from her book and flaunting it as well. I’m thinking sexy shirts and short shorts. Perhaps this will help illustrate the situation from my perspective.

c0euye	2019-06-14 02:44:07	Jaski0	AITA for using dark/edgy humor?	"Sorry if the formatting is bad, I’m not gonna make any excuse other than I just suck at it.

The backstory: My type of humor has always been pretty dark. I’ve dialed it down after realizing that I could offend a lot of people. My friends have the same type of humor so it’s never been a problem. 

Second story: I recently started summer camp. I’m not quite sure the age range because my dad basically signed me up for it, but I was the youngest in the camp by maybe a year or two. There was one other boy, a couple of girls, and this group of high schoolers. I’ve always been a little bit intimidated by older teens (i know, sounds dumb) so I didn’t really try to talk with them at all. I kept to myself and befriended the only other boy. Things were going pretty well and we became pretty good friends. 

Cut to earlier today. My friend was playing Goku’s Ultra Instinct theme from Dragon Ball Super and I jokingly said, “This song gives me PTSD”

I never really thought about how joking about how something gives me “PTSD” (basically just saying that something gives me bad memories, or just wild memories I guess) could be offensive. 

Anyway, one of the high schoolers started going off on me and I started feeling really bad. Being young I felt like the older high schooler’s word was absolute and I was the lowest scum on earth. Something I would like to point out that might not change the outcome is that my friend’s dad has PTSD and my friend didn’t seem to care (although his dad might have, idk)

This is less about finding out if I’m at fault and more about getting this off my chest, but I would still like to hear if I am the asshole. Anyway, that’s the story."	Not the A-hole	0	0	47.0	91.0	0.0	0.0

Told a close female friend to just pretend I didn't exist and we never met. Figured it would be better if she didn't see me like this. Not denying that I'm the problem. Just figured if I could keep someone I care about away from a problem person like me, that's one good deed. I'm off to college anyways so I think it's best if she doesn't have to deal with my bullshit if I end up overstressed or something. She's quite pissed with me telling me things like I don't care even though it's the opposite. Please give me some insight.
Edit: Thanks everyone. I think it's stress. I just work hard and feel like a black hole to be around.
Update: thanks everyone. I apologized and promised that I wouldn't let my issues and our friendship involve each other. I realized that instead of just saying, I could work through them. Cheers."	Asshole	0	0	647.0	50.0	0.0	0.0

I have a co-worker that is older than I by at least 20 years, and relatively new at the factory.

I have always tried to be a bit of a friend to him, and as a result he has become comfortable in joking with me.

He also is overly interested in my sex life, asking what races I prefer, how many women I've been with, etc. 

Today, out of the blue, he said ""I'll give you $20 if you let me touch your butt."" Now, this caught me off guard, and I just said ""not worth it."" He pulled out his wallet and showed me how much cash he had and said ""I've got more, $40, 50, 60?"" I laughed it off, as he said it in a joking tone, but I again, declined and got back to my work.

c0erw7	2019-06-14 02:34:21		AITA for calling out my neighbors at a block party.	"TLDR at the end

Their dogs bark at all hours of the day because they are outside all day long and sleep outside. They are not socialized so anything sets them off. Even the sound of doing the dishes sets them off. They have let them outside on pretty cold near freezing nights and outside on really hot days. I’ve sneaked onto their property many times and filled up their dogs water and shoved old blankets into their dog houses to help with warmth and padding. I’ve even brushed them on multiple occasions. Since they are teachers they are typically gone during regular business hours and are gone on the weekends and at night because they are social butterflies. It’s caused sleep issues for me because I worked night shift for a while and they would dig close into my yard and set my dogs off on barking. Their dogs are sweet with people. Just poorly trained and socialized. I end up lining that part of the fence with bricks to prevent them from digging over to my side and getting killed by my dogs. (My dogs have a high prey drive so any thing small sets them off)


The neighbors recently had a newborn baby within the last two weeks and are moving to a bigger home they purchased. At the annual summer party one of the other neighbors throws. The wife casually mentioned “I don’t know how we’re going to do it with all three dogs and the baby”. For me this pissed me off because after all that bullcrap over the years it sounds like whatever little care the dogs were getting was going to go further and possibly getting rid of the dogs now that the baby had come. 

So I interjected “I assumed you guys would dump the dogs off at the pound”

Neighbor husband: oh? (In a way that seemed too casual)

Me: you guys have been such shit owners over the years you have always seemed like the type to dump them off somewhere if you were to have a kid. I bet you’re even planning on doing this already. 

Neighbors wife interrupted my soapbox : but we won’t have time for them!

She confirmed my suspicions at this point. 

Me(pissed off) : just know you can always drop a baby off at any fire station if you can’t care for it either. 

Wife starts crying and runs into the house. Husband cussed me out. Owner of the house pulls me aside and asks my fiancé and I to leave. My fiancé is pissed for embarrassing her and the neighbors at a social event and called me an asshole. Since then a couple other neighbors don’t look my way when I walk my own dogs anymore and do not say hello. 

My fiancé wants me to apologize before my neighbors  leave this Sunday. Neighbors that also hear the dogs agreed with me and tried to defend me. Party thrower sided with shitty dog owners. 

TL;DR. Neighbors are shit dog owners and just had a baby.  I assumed hey would dump them at the pound. I was right.  I called them out on it and said they could dump their baby at a fire station during a neighborhood party. Fiancé is pissed. Neighbors pissed."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

They spent last summer staying home alone and no one said a damn word. This year multiple people have gotten their panties in a knot about my leaving them home alone. 

By “alone” I mean I am 10 minutes (at the most with traffic) away, they each have a device they can contact me directly on, the oldest has a non-password protected device that can call 911 if needed by any of them. But I can probably get their faster than 911 in our town. I can also leave my job at any time for any reason and be home with them as needed, or bring them to work with me. 

I work 6 hours a day, that schedule is extremely well flexible. If I go in at 6 am I am home by noon. I usually work 7 am to 1 pm during the summer. I also come home for a lunch break about half way through my day. We have a neighbor who lives 1 block away who does daycare out of her home, but doesn’t have room for my kids, if anything was going bad at home they can go there to calm down and get a new perspective. We also live 2 blocks from the elementary school where kids play in mass daily and my children are often invited. 

AITA for putting my kids back into the unsupervised 80-90’s? I have never felt the backlash I am feeling this year from various friends and family members, especially my mother in law who just retired and “offered” to watch my kids for $3 and hour per kid this summer. This is only the second year I have had a job since having children, and I want to do what’s right by them but also want to work for all of our sanity and some fun money.

Edit: 

I pay the kids: 12 gets $5 per day, 11 gets $3 per day and 7 gets $1 per day. 
The kids like staying home. They don’t have any issues with it and love that they get to sleep in every morning. 
There are no summer camp programs in my town that are regularly available. There are a couple 1 week half day programs they will go to when they can. But there isn’t much. The boys and girls club offers child care from 12pm - 5pm but 7 isn’t old enough to go to that program. We live in a small town about 20,000 people."	Not the A-hole	0	0	10.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

After about 3 months of living with him he saw my payslip, and when he saw how much i earned he started taking rent for me living there, its was around 300$ a month, i know its not much but i think its just shitty taking rent from your own kid. But i just went along because it was cheaper than having my own place.

So fast forward 8 months i got a raise. I was happy with this and told him, he didn't even flinch before he said that the rent had to go up.  So he puts the ''rent'' up to 600$ and i was pissed, had an argument with him the next day and everything, this was about the 20th of may. 

 And the day i get my salary is 24th, he knows this and and he said rent is due, at that point a was pissed, i found an apartment to rent for about 900$, and moved in on the 25th, he was away this day, i packed everything i had and got a few friends helping me move, on the 26th he called me, not asking where i was or anything, just asking for the rent, and i said that i had moved out and im not going to pay his fucking rent.

He gets furious started calling me an asshole etc, trying to guilt me into paying by saying i earn more than him. At that point im pissed and just hang up, haven't talked to him since, he has tried calling me a few times i don't pick up. 

&#x200B;

So, am i the asshole?

Just wanna add that the last 6 months i lived with i basically had to take care of him, because hes a drunk, i cleaned the apartment every night when i came home from evening shift (spilling everyhwhere), put him to bed etc. and i told him this also.

Hello, this is my first post here. I am (M 20) and my boyfriend is (M 25), this has been going on for awhile, and I would like to genuinely know what the ""general public"" thinks of a situation like this.

Example: My boyfriend and I have an extension cord near our love seat in front of our TV. we generally use it to charge our phones. Now, my boyfriend and I have arguements like these all the time, in which he deems everything as ""his"". I was charging my phone, sitting on the couch, eating some fruit. He comes up and unplugs my phone to charge his, when I ask, mildly angry, why he did that instead of putting his charger on the other side of the extension cord where there is another socket, he says that it's his (the extension cord) and he can do with it what he wants. We argue a bit, and then he asks why I think I'm ""entitled to use his things"". 

Another example: I'm playing botw on the switch. We are arguing again, and because he is in a foul mood over the arguement, he pulls the switch from its charging system that's linked to the TV, and walks away to put it away. I'm furious, to me, understandably. And I ask, (yell), at him why he thinks it's okay to do that, and he says that it's his switch. He says this a lot, but I am the one who initially paid for it. He says that he ""paid me back"" when we moved into our apartment, by using our money for the pet fee.

"I live close to my mother's apartment and am really attached  to her two dogs. My mom texted me a 2 minute long video of one dog audibly crying/whimpering and in a cone while she did nothing, stayed silent, and only recorded. I watched the whole thing horrified waiting for an explanation. There wasn't any in the video and no follow up text of what happened. I had no idea what was happening and feared something awful had happened. I fired off a text asking why she was recording without doing anything to help him and asked what happened? 

She sent a one line text saying he had a ruptured gland. 

I immediately went over to her apartment and started going off about how awful it was to receive that video without context. Demanded to know why would she just record a video and send it off without telling me what was happening instead. I said I would never do that because I actually have sympathy for others. She said that's what she wanted me to feel from the video. I demanded again to know what the point of such a long and disturbing video was and she said that she wanted me to come visit and give the dog a hug. I told her she could have sent that request as a text in place of the video. All the while she was making jokes and invalidating my reaction.

She got angry with me and started declaring that if I wasn't going to lower my voice and be supportive of the dog that I should go home because I was stressing out both dogs. 

I left her and went to find the dog in his spot. I continued to ask questions and finally got what happened from her short responses. I didn't get any apology and left her apartment as soon as I had made sure the dog was okay.

"My roommate (F)  asked me today (Also F) if her boyfriend could stay at our apartment in her bedroom for three and a half months because his roommate had kicked him out of his house without giving him time to find another place. She even offered to pay me and our other roommate a little bit of money if we said yes saying that he wouldn’t be helping pay for anything at all, but he could help keep the place clean. I told her I’d think about it. 

I then later realized that I’d never met this guy even though they’d supposedly been together for awhile and I went back and asked if she’s ever met him before. She said no and that he currently lives in Kentucky. I again said I’d think about it, but that the idea made me really uncomfortable. 

She later sent me a text message asking if he could at least stay with us a week. I said I’d think about it, but reiterated that I was kind of uncomfortable with that idea. I personally just feel a bit unsettled with pretty much letting a stranger stay with us. He could be anybody. I just kind of feel like you can only know someone so well from behind a screen and he could have some hidden qualities about himself that could be dangerous or problematic. If she would have spent irl time with him and knew him very well before asking, I wouldn’t have really had a problem with it at all especially since he’s currently in a bad position, but because she hasn’t/doesn’t I’m not very receptive to the idea at all. 

Even though I’m mostly opposed to this arrangement, I kind of feel bad because I’m friends with my roommate and she’s assured me that she’ll try and make sure that he’d never be left alone in the apartment. Even then,  I’m still extremely wary of letting someone she probably doesn’t even really know stay in the apartment even if only for a week....

So I've been using Spotify (who doesn't, I know) under my own account for the past few years. My parents bought me a Google Home for Christmas last year, so I naturally link my account to it. Somehow, this also connected it to my parents' Home. I honestly didn't notice or care, until I subscribed to Premium. 

This is when things got dicey; my parents decided that DepressoEspresso can shout for music = they can. The problem here is that when they use it, mine cuts out. I brought this up, and they said they didn't know what they were doing, and that they would stop. Spoiler alert, they're doing it more now that they know what it is. It's a joke to them. Not to mention, if I cut *theirs* out (ie, I open Spotify on my Home, or on my phone), they get pissed.

I want to cut off access to my Spotify from their Home, but I'm conflicted; I don't particularly enjoy my music being cut off when I'm using my Spotify.

So I'll try to make the backstory as quick as possible. 

My mom died when I was a teenager and years later he remarried to a woman with a baby and they have since had a daughter together. 

From his previous marriage he has two adult offspring: myself and my younger brother (who has 3 kids of his own now) and she has 2 adult boys. So that's 6 kids in total. I have 1 blood brother, 3 step brothers and a half sister.

I love my blended family and my littlest siblings especially.

A few weekends ago my boyfriend and I are over at my dad's place and my dad announces that he's redone his will and life insurance so that it all will go to the two youngest because my brother and I are grown up and settled.

I didn't say anything because I was pretty surprised. My dad has a government job so his life insurance policy is worth an awful lot of money. Like definitely enough to split between 4 kids.

My boyfriend and I are by no means rich but we just bought a house recently and we are settled pretty comfortably. 

My brother has 3 kids and they are not well off in any capacity and regularly have to borrow money. So grown up yes, settled not so much. 

Am I an asshole if I'm offended that we (my blood brother and me) aren't included in his will or his life insurance policy? 

I wouldn't care if it was swayed more heavily in the kids' favor but it feels like a bit of a slap in the face not to be included in it at all."	Not the A-hole	0	0	99.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

c0eksd	2019-06-14 02:13:09	saddad_throwaway1	WIBTA if I confronted my SIL about her husband going AWOL with a new baby at home?	"My SIL had her second baby recently. Her husband was never really present for the first baby due to not wanting to lose sleep.
This time around, due to reasons I don't want to get into, he is in a different city for an unknown period of time and has left the responsibility of his young child and new baby to my SIL with his mother and her mother as temporary help.

&nbsp;

My wife tried engaging my SIL in conversation during the first baby about this issue but she avoided the subject and historically, has always defended her husband. Her reasoning is that her husband makes the money and so she should step up to be the caregiver. This distresses us as she is very well educated and has huge potential but seems held back by what we see as the selfish actions of her husband. She is also very non-confrontational and we see her as meek with regards to her husband. They do truly love each other, though, as far as we can tell.

&nbsp;

Would I be the asshole if I asked her how she feels in this situation? I plan to be direct in broaching the subject but not cruel. Both my wife and I are super concerned for her, that she feels like she has to solo parent, and deal with this all alone. She also lives in a different city than us so we can't easily be there for her. We have two very young children of our own and know how difficult it is. We also harbor concern on the long-term impact of the current father figure in our SIL's kids' lives.

&nbsp;

Maybe I should confront my BIL instead... We aren't close for obvious reasons and I do not value our relationship whereas I adore my SIL. She is one of the sweetest, most caring people I've ever met.

&nbsp;

The problems I see are:

1. I'm the BIL. My wife would probably be the ideal person to do it but she can be abrasive. I'm known to be more level-headed and gentle.
2. She is actually okay with the situation and not secretly calling for help. Then, it's really none of my business.
3. She is not okay with the situation but feels trapped. A divorce would be awful for their family but may be warranted."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

(Sorry for bad English)

So I have panick attacks quite a lot. I don't wanna get into it but I'm very scared of a lot of things. Like someone comes down the same hallway and I don't see them? Its sometimes really small and sometimes it's really bad. Idk how to explain it but I get panick attacks when people scare me.

I was at a family reunion today for the first time since we've been in France. (I've lived in France for 12 years, we're in the states now.)  My uncle got remarried and his wife had 2 kids (?) One was about 17 and I think 23. My uncle told them about my panic attacks, and he told me to try to stay away from them the best I could because they liked cause trouble.

About an hour in, I was meeting all my American family ive never met before and having a good time. I've never really seen those boys around me so I was relaxed.

After long bleh stuff no one cares about I went to go get a drink. I've forgotten all around them at this point I'm having fun! I get to where the pop is and from UNDERNEATH the table they come out and scare me. I start freaking out and I did something really embrassing. I pissed myself.

They're laughing and I'm crying just sitting on the floor when uncle comes over there and snacks them. Everybody was watching at this point.

They got mad and yelled at me for ""being a big baby"" saying ""you're 14 and you still need diapers?"" And it was a mess. I guess they saw something through my dress I don't really know.

After we got somethings sorted out me and my parents left. A few days later we gat a call from my uncle's number. It was his wife calling to say that I embrassed her son's and 'made everybody hate them' Grandma told her that she's not aloud to go to family reunions anymore I was told after a little while. I heard she got really drink so it may have been something to do with it.

She told me that she's only been in the family for a year, but she feels unwelcomed.

Tldr: Two boys scared me, had a panic attack. Pissed myself. Then got told by their mom that she no longer feels welcomed.

c0ejcy	2019-06-14 02:08:49		AITA For hiding my husband’s baby blanket?	"I love my husband dearly, but he has an emotional attachment to his old baby blanket. In the beginning of our relationship I thought it was endearing. I only ever saw him sleep with it whenever I sleep over at his house when we became boyfriend and girlfriend. By the time he became even more comfortable with me, he became more comfortable with holding his blanket outside of the bedroom. He would hold it and stroke it as we watched movies together, roll it up into a ball and lay his head on it on the couch, and fold it into cushion for his butt on our dining room chairs. Weirder, I thought, but it didn’t effect me at all, so I left him alone. 

Fast forward 10 years. He’s not anymore obsessed with the blanket now than he was then. However, it’s gotten to the point where no matter how much I wash this blanket, I can’t get rid of the foul odor that it has developed after 35 years. Like I mentioned earlier, he sleeps with this blanket. I brought up that the smell is disrupting and he said that he “never noticed.” The smell does not bother him, but I cannot sleep. It smells like shit. He refused to find a common ground. I asked if he could just not sleep with the blanket from now on when we’re in bed together, and he said no, that he will sleep in the guest room if it bothers me so much. Of course I agreed, but I feel like my husband chose his blanket over me. We literally no longer sleep together because of it. 

One day, when I was doing laundry in a public laundromat, I “lost” his blanket. In actuality, I hid it, because I don’t have the heart to actually dispose of it. However, he’s been in great distress since it’s been “lost.” He will not speak to me, or anyone. I understand that the blanket is basically apart of him, but it’s drove us apart.

Anyway, when I receive a gift that I don’t need or I  already have, I put them away in a cabinet so when I need a gift I just pull one out.

Last Christmas for some reason I received 3 identical fancy cheese board sets. So I use one and put the other 2 in my gift cabinet. 

Fast forward to last week, it’s my cousin’s birthday so I decide to give her 1 of the fancy cheese boards. The next day I get a message on FB basically saying “If you didn’t want to get me a gift you didn’t have to, no one is forcing you”. I tried talking to her but she won’t reply to my messages.  

I asked her mom and apparently she’s upset because the person who gave me the cheese board left a personalized Christmas card inside the box (my fault for not checking) so she’s mad because I gave her “something I didn’t even want”.

I tried to get an abortion but was told I was too far along. My boyfriend and I then decided that we would put the baby up for adoption, but he backed out toward the end of my pregnancy, due to his own mother wanting to raise the baby herself. I was living with them at the time of the baby being born because my own mom had already kicked me out. My boyfriend's family kicked me out after he was born. My family made me get a custody order for every other weekend because they still wanted the right to see him. I didn't see the baby again until they were year old.

I have never had any kind of connection to the baby due to the intense emotional distress I went through during my pregnancy. I had severe depression before and after the baby was born because it wrecked me mentally, physically, and emotionally. When the baby was 2 years old, I moved pretty far away and immediately received a letter stating that I was obligated to pay child support and backpay for the first 2 years of their life. I never got a chance to respond or defend myself in any way - I just received a letter that my paychecks would be garnished for $350/month.

It has been over 10 years, and the $350/month has crippled me financially. I make $750-1000 a month after the support is taken out. I have had some really slow months where I only make $400-600 for the entire month. I have no relationship whatsoever with the baby and never have. I wouldn't even know what he looks like or where he currently lives. I have considered trying to file for a change in support amount, but I also feel incredibly guilty because everyone has told me that I should be my entire life.

I am a completely different person after all of this time. I am a very happy, healthy person married to a wonderful man with a stepchild. I am pregnant with our first ""us"" baby. 

AITA for resenting that I have to pay an extremely high amount of child support for a child that I know absolutely nothing about and was essentially forced to have while I have two children here that I love and support?

first time posting here, so i feel like this is going to be brutal but here goes:

&#x200B;

I am a software engineer at a big tech company (think big 5).  Our team only has headcount for one more person this year (we already hired 2).  I interviewed this college new grad who I really liked and advocated for.  For those who don't know the tech industry, generally the candidate goes through 3-5 interviews with different people, then we all sit together in a room and vote.   She was voted down cause my manager wanted someone with more experience; no big deal, happens all the time.

&#x200B;

A few weeks later, I interview another new grad for the same role.  She was objectively worse than the first candidate (lower grades, failed the coding interview, no relevant experience), yet everyone voted to extend an offer because of reasons you'd know if you lived in a US city.  I couldnt object because it'd be career suicide, but I was bitter because the candidate I liked a week ago was rejected on the grounds that we wanted someone with ""more experience"", yet we hired one with less.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months since the offer, and now she's onboarding with our team.  The system we work on is quite complex, so new hires tend to need their hand held for the first few months, but she asks a *ton* of questions.  In her case, it's even worse because she doesn't have C++ experience (the language our system is written in).  But I just can't get myself to help her.  I'm not rude nor do I go out of my way to impede her success, but I only answer like 20% of the copious amount of questions she asks and don't point out bugs in her code because deep down, I want her to get fired because she took the job away from someone who deserved it more.  The worst part is, she's a friendly person, just noticeably incompetent.  In a different setting, I'd like to be her friend, just not her coworker.

&#x200B;

\[edit: a lot of people are making it a political thing, which i'd like to avoid.  i'd just like to know my obligation in this situation.  removed irrelevant bits to focus on what i should be doing\].

&#x200B;

AITA?

&#x200B;

For the past 3-4 years, I have gone to her parents house every single 4th, thanksgiving and christmas often staying for 3+ days, as well as, meeting her family for a week long vacations usually every year. I have expressed that I really don't want to do this every single time, or if we do go I would like to have a few days during my work break to have to myself and not deal with her family. I hate going to see her family. Her siblings are always there and all have kids, and it is just not fun for me. There's no good internet, no games, and we just sit around all day doing nothing. This isn't just a one day family reunion or something.

&#x200B;

Example: July 4th is a Thursday, I told that we can go Friday, and come back Sunday. Or go Thursday and come back Saturday. I feel that's reasonable. Says, ""Wow so you just get to decide for both of us"". Nope, she wants to go the entire Thursday through Sunday, and she says that's her compromise because she wants to leave Wednesday night. I told her, I just don't even want to go but I'm meeting you half way.

&#x200B;

Example 2: Christmas is on a Wednesday and I would have Monday & Tuesday off. I wouldn't want to go Friday through Wednesday or Thursday. I would like to have some days to myself away from her family and go like Sunday through Wednesday.

&#x200B;

Example 3: I offered to fly to my parents to meet my parents for the entire christmas break, and she said we will have to talk about it and find a compromise. I feel that's pretty shitty seeing as I have been to her parents numerous times.

&#x200B;

This is slowly becoming a deal breaker for me because every time this turns into an argument and a fight. I get literally no extended holidays to myself. Tried to talk to her about this but she always turns it back around on me. Everything is fine other than this, but it is slowly becoming a sign of what is to come.

Recently, after my dad left, my mom has gotten pretty depressed. Not very recent actually, maybe like 6-7 months ago he left.

Anyways, as i said, my mom has gotten really depressed. Everyday she would just be in a plain bad mood and be pretty abusive. (Verbally and physically). 

But sort of more recently, like 1-2 months ago, she found a new love. Cooking. She never used to cook when my dad was home we always just did takeout or something. But now she loves cooking. And I gotta say, her food isn’t that good but us kids just support it because we know it’s the only thing that lets her like not be depressed.

A few weeks ago I got a gf. She’s Latina and I’m white. And my moms pretty racist and has hated my gf since I got her.

2 nights ago on the table, she made some lasagna. She got the recipe from online and I’ll be honest it didn’t taste good. I took like 2 bites of it when she starts going on a rant on how Mexicans and like how other people should stay out our country. She was specifically targeting my gf but like just not saying her name. She a huge conservative.

She starts going on and on for like around 10 minutes and I just snapped. I was saying like I know this is targeted against my gf and we just start calling eachother every name in the book. There were also mangos on the table and that was kinda all I ate cuz the lasagna was terrible so I then turned to her cooking and said how her cooking is shit and the only good thing on the table is fruits and shit. I wasn’t thinking of what I was saying at all and just said whatever came in my head

I later just went to my room where I had been staying for the past day and getting out just for food and school. 

She’s been pretty depressed for the past day now and just brought Taco Bell (I didn’t even get anything!) and now I’m wondering should I apologize and am I the asshole.

Parking at the event was going to cost money so I called up a friend who had a place close by and asked if we could park there. My wife didn't want to park there because she didn't want to walk to the event from my friends place. I told her that it made no sense to pay for parking when we could park at my friends place for free. She was short with me for the rest of that night and ever since then she's been complaining about the blisters she got on her feet from walking. I still think its stupid to pay for parking when we don't have to. Am I the asshole?	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0ecbx	2019-06-14 01:47:44	Laurallooni	AITA for telling a friend who I had plans to go backpacking with that I wanted to go with someone else instead.	"So this is my first post ever on Reddit so I'm apologizing ahead of time if this is wrong but I think I've read the rules right.

&#x200B;

So anyway, I have a friend who I've known since we were young but we've only become close in the last two years. Basically, she was not a stranger and I thought I knew exactly what she was like. I had started planning a backpacking trip around Southeast Asia at the end of last summer for 2020 and I was looking for someone to go with. When I asked her, I already had a 75% of the trip planned so she immediately agreed and things were fine.

&#x200B;

Since then, I've seen her probably 4 days a week and I've noticed some things. She just seemed to be extremely sensitive and have a load of double standards. We went to school together and we were both very competitive so it caused a lot of tension. We work together at the same job in an office and we sit across from each other. She'll be fine one moment, laughing at a stupid joke I made or having a conversation with me, then all of a sudden, she'll shut down and roll her eyes/stare at me blankly, etc. I could talk about the subtle/unsubtle rude gestures and things shes said to me for another couple paragraphs but this would be way too long.

&#x200B;

One day I had enough and decided that if I don't tell her how she's making me feel that I'm going to explode, and I was sure as hell not going to spend a fortune on a trip where I'm a doormat the whole time. We had a big argument in her car otw home from work one day. She brought up some good points about things I do that upsetting her, and I apologized (I would never ask her if she had plans after work, etc.)

&#x200B;

She said that me saying I thought she was rude to me was the same things as calling her annoying and that's the worst thing you could call her (insert backstory). I explained that I didn't think she was annoying at all and it has nothing to do with what we were talking about. I brought up a time she was rude to me as an example and to this, she responded: ""yeah but you were being super annoying that day"".

&#x200B;

She had many double standards like that I had to listen to her music that I didn't like but I couldn't play mine because she didn't like it. Seeing how she seemed to be putting these rules in place for me to follow but not her, I decided this is not someone I wanted to go on a month long trip with. I told her on the spot that she wasn't coming anymore and that I was going to find someone else to go with.

&#x200B;

I think it's justified because I planned the trip and asked her if she wanted to come with me. She definitely believes I'm in the wrong because it was now ""her trip too"" and she'd rather me not go at all then go with someone else, but the timing is still perfect and I don't want to wait only to find that I never have to opportunity to go again. I feel bad for still planning on going but should I? Is this justified?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c0ebgo	2019-06-14 01:45:15	JaceThePowerBottom	AITA For skipping fathers day dinner	"So some context. I live about 2 hrs from my parents house. Just close enough I get asked to come to all holidays and random stuff, but far enough away it's a taxing drive. Additionally, I wake up at 5am for work, and when I'm over my parents insist on me staying for desert. I normally dont get to leave until 930, which makes me sleep deprived at work the next day.

Ok so this weekend I'm going to be near my parents house for an event all weekend (staying overnight at a friends). Due to my social anxiety I'm expecting it to be an exhausting weekend. After texting with me mom and making somewhat veiled statements about how I wasnt ""originally planning"" on being at fathers day dinner, she said they were excited to see me. After thinking about it, I called her and told her I wouldnt be coming, because I'll be exhausted and the drive would be late at night.

She was noticeably upset over the phone (though I suspect she was trying to hide it). She asked that I call my dad on fathers day, which of course I will do and normally do.

So AITA for skipping? I feel like I am, but I know that if I go I'll be completely miserable that night and more so the next day."	Asshole	0	0	71.0	17.0	0.0	0.0

We're both 17 f, in the months leading up to my birthday my best friend tells me she has a big surprise planned for me.

I'm appreciative for the present but I feel like she's just straight up lying to me and found a random charm at a gift shop last minute, I then jokingly point out the $12 price tag that's still sticking out and she says it was actually around $90 but she had it replaced because she didn't want me to know how much she spent on it.

c0e8z8	2019-06-14 01:37:47	CarrotsAndCrunch	AITA for making a mess in the hotel room?	"Now, just to be clear. I know I was kinda the asshole in the first part of the story. It's more the second part I'm asking about. But here's the full story for clarity. 

Was staying in a hotel with a friend, we were sharing a room. The last night we go out for dinner, have food, and a few too many beers. When I have too many beers I get diarrhoea, so when I felt the storm coming on I headed back to the hotel room. I don't remember what happened, but I remember waking up at 4am and I'd shit *everywhere*. My friend hadn't come back yet, and I panicked. So I ran away. I left my car as I was still drunk and got a cab home (cost like $140!) and I left him to deal with the mess.

It turns out the reason he still wasn't back was because he hooked up with a girl. So he got back a little late to the hotel to checkout thinking I'd have done it and found the staff quite angry. They charged him an extra $750 dollars because they needed to get the carpet and towels specially cleaned, and to replace the wallpaper. And of course it meant he faced the shame of them thinking he did it.

Now that's the part I know I might have been the asshole. 

But when he called me, he was really mad. I said I was sorry, and that when I got paid I'd pay him back the full amount and I'd buy him some beers or something to make it up to him. But it's been two weeks and he's still not talking to me. We've been friends for 12 years and never really argued before. I feel I did enough to rectify my mistake. 

Was I really enough of an asshole to never talk to again?

Edit: Yes this is a real situation. Didn't want to post on my actual reddit though because it's obviously quite an embarrassing one."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

She's well established in her career and really successful , her job is recruiting for companies. And I am a student who's starting her undergrad at a CSU, a bit late I know but life stuff happened so I started a bit late. The college I will be attending is about 2 hours from where i live and I'm moving in about 2 months. Issues started a few months ago when she told me about a job -in the city I will be moving too- and how she could help me with my resume and she knew the person in charge of the department I would be interviewing. We worked on my resume, i interviewed and i didn't get the job because i lived far and didn't have any experience. Which I expected going into it . Fast forward a couple months later I get a voicemail about a job I never applied to and I ask her about it and she said she's being sending my resume around without telling me. Which made me a bit un comfortable because she didn't mention it after either . I told her I'd call back on Monday since It was Friday when I noticed the call. Comes Monday and i had a stressful day and forgot to call back she asks me on Tuesday if I called and I told her I forgot but will do it today since it's my free day( I called but had to leave a message). She then proceeds to blow up on me and said I quote: ""No one is willing to give you a chance and when you do it's bc I'm putting in a good word for you referral by mouth and it upsetting when you don't follow back bc it makes me look bad and reputation and then people won't wanna trust me with referrals again"" 
And other messages about how I'm not taking my career seriously. And honestly I'm just trying to start school and figure stuff out. Also I could be wrong but it sounds like I'm getting these interviews with no intention by them of actually hiring me but as a favor to her. 
I could be wrong but all of this came off super condescending and she made it all about herself and how she's wanting to help me. The way she talked to me felt like she was lecturing me not an adult conversation.) apologized for not calling Monday like I said I would but after she kept saying things like she didn't see me doing anything for myself and she's doing all the work. When I'm working really hard to move my life and set my self up for school in a different city.) just don't share everything I'm doing with her. I don't know if this makes sense but I'm confused on how to feel.  update the next day she wanted me to share my credit score with her.

c0e698	2019-06-14 01:29:26	implodemode	AITA for Refusing to Continue Helping My Broke Sister?	"My (60 f) sister (69) has made bad financial decisions her entire life. Our mother has helped her a lot over the years. Mom died several years ago leaving each of us $75,000. 

Sis took years to be a counselor. She worked part time a few years before getting full time. She worked a few more years then decided to retire at 67 with virtually no savings, a tiny pension plus the govt pension. She still owes on a car bought before mom died taking up 2/3 of the govt pension. A friend offered her cheap rent so she thought she would be fine.

A year later, her friend is going sour. She hints she wants to move in with me. I hint no. I have a husband who likes to lounge in his underwear. We have had the house to ourselves only one year as our kids have each returned to save for their own houses. We are really enjoying it. And we need to do renos. I have just fixed up the rec room, got a new tv and finally have space for my hobbies.

She has a car accident and  borrows $2000 from me in September. I dont expect to see it again and tell her no more. She gets mad and insists she will pay it back but she has never paid me back before.

Mid November her friend tells her to leave. She begs to come to my house. I tell her ok but only until summer and she has to pay expenses. I am not mom and will not subsidize her life. She moves in mid December and within 2 weeks I blow up because she is avoiding helping out or paying anything and has made me unwelcome in my rec room.. She cries that she has no money but offers no reason why but she will do better.

We go away for 2 months. She does no cleaning while we are gone. My DIL cleans before we come home but sis stops her doing the fridge. Says she will do it but doesn't. It is gross.

She continues on as always. I cook and clean and work in our home office. She sleeps til noon and watches my tv. I get pissed. She makes 2 meals in 5 months and makes a big deal of paying $50 - like I am robbing her. She keeps snacks in her room. When I dont buy the cereal she likes, she does but keeps it in her room too. One evening, I am frantically lining up work for our crews as the weather has been brutal and we can't do as planned. She pouts in the dining room sighing because I haven't started dinner. She finally asks if she can make herself a sandwich as if I would refuse. But it would have been nice to offer to make one for each of us or start dinner. I tell her I will get to it when I can. As I serve dinner an hour later, I ask if she would like to contribute to groceries and she whines that she has no money or she would. I am fed up. I have told her she cant afford her car but she will not give it up and thinks mooching off me is ok. Mr. tells her he wants her out. She asks for the end of summer.  He says end of June.

She stops talking to me but throws $50 at me, again like I have robbed her. It has been a month. She sneaks out at noon and sneaks back at 11. She is not civil if I attempt to be.

c0e4of	2019-06-14 01:24:46	cow-bird	AITA for sending a woman photos of my snake eating?	"For pretext, everything that occurred happened on Instagram.
I happen to love opposums, so I follow the opposum tag on Instagram where I'll routinely get posts on my feed that have been tagged in such a way.  I was going through my feed when I happened to find a video of someone showing in plain view a dead opposum that had been killed by her cat and brought in the house by her dogs. She spent a lot of time focused on the dead opposum, and it upset me to see this out of the blue on my feed when all I want is opposum positivity. 
So I then commented something along the lines of ""I don't appreciate seeing a dead opposum on a tag for people that love the animal to congregate. Have some decency."" OP then responded, ""I don't appreciate you on my page with your silly comment. It happens all the time in nature.""
Seeing this frustrated me, so I went through the comment thread and noticed that someone mentioned a snake and she had a repulsive reaction to this. So since I had a video of my ball python eating a mouse, I decided to take key screenshots and dm them to her with the caption. ""in regards to your recent post. / it happens every week, so look forward to weekly updates.""
I kind of want to block her, but I also genuinely want to fuck with her and continue to send graphic content pertaining to my snake. She should understand that just because she's alright with seeing a dead animal she hates, doesn't give her the right to joke about it in a bid for online sensation. So, AITA?

Edit: I'd first like to thank you guys for being honest. I can be kind of hot-headed and I don't see clear in these situations. I still stand by what I said, but I've decided to unsend everything that I've sent to her as it has yet to be seen. I agree that it's uncalled for and generally uncorrelated to the argument at hand. I've decided instead, to dm her and have a conversation as to why posting gore isn't ok even if she isn't phased by it. The best way to prevent a situation is to come at it with reason. I'll try to keep you guys updated as to a further outcome.

Edit²: here's my revised message to her:
In regards to your post wherein you joked/showcased a dead opposum.
I'd like to take a moment to say that it's not my intent to make you feel lesser. I just want to convey my thoughts on why I disagree with the post so that you may better understand where I'm coming from.

I'd like to start by saying that just because you find it normal/okay to see a dead animal, doesn't mean other people share this opinion on life. I understand that animals die daily in the cycle of life, but that doesn't make it okay for me to post about it on social media to garner likes/sympathy. I have a snake, and even though I'm excited to see her eat, I don't just flaunt her eating for anyone with a fear of snakes to see. If I do want to talk about her eating I make sure to give a photo warning before for people who can't handle stuff like that. Continueing with this hypothetical, i wouldn't post her eating a live mouse with the hash tag for mouse/mice. I know people who love and care for mice look through that and have that content appear on their feed, and it wouldn't be fair for them to see gore of their beloved animal. I see you have huskies, how would it feel for you to be scrolling through your feed to see a dead huskie front and center?
I want you to understand that just because you can handle certain subject matter doesn't mean that others can. Please don't belittle those that can't with comments like ""it happens daily."""	Asshole	0	0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

SO what happened was, a week or so after my husband and I moved in, our doorknob fell off. No big, the company we went through are ADAMANT; we cannot fix anything ourselves, go through their website for maintenance requests. They told me when making the request, they will call when they send someone out to make sure we're home.

That was two months ago. Then today, we only have one set of keys, so when husband leaves the apartment, if he forgot something I have to let him in. This morning I had gotten no sleep last night, so I was falling asleep while he got ready for work. He left, came back because he forgot something important, I let him in. Fall asleep, wake up to knocking, oh shit husband had a bit of time before having to go back to work. We hang, I'm so tired still, he leaves, I fall asleep. Then more knocking on my door, holy shit, it's not time for husband to be home, he must've forgotten something important! I open door in a large nightshirt and nothing else expecting my husband, NOPE. MAINTENANCE MAN FOR THAT WORK ORDER I PUT IN TWO MONTHS AGO. I apologize, close door, put on pants, then speak with him. He leaves, another dude comes later, didn't know someone was already sent, then first dude comes back, looks SO GUILTY and says someone else will be repairing the door. So now I feel horrible for making the maintenance man uncomfortable, and I STILL HAVE A BROKEN DOORKNOB.

I want to send an ""update"" to my maintenance ticket calling them out on being horribly unprofessional on not giving me any progress on my ticket for months, not calling us before they arrive or send someone out like they told me they would, and neither of their maintenance men announcing who they were when I yelled through the door I'd be with them in a moment. Why would I expect anyone but my husband without a prior heads up?

I feel more bad about making the maintenance man uncomfortable, but no one has ever come to our door since we moved in so I thought it was my husband needing something urgently. WIBTA if I chew out my landlords?

Edit: Thank y'all for the fast responses! I for sure see how I am one of the assholes in the situation. After I cool down more I'll send them an email about their horrible communication, that is really what's been pissing me off since we started our lease, and this stupid incident just summoned all of my rage at once."

We asked if we could have it because as she stated it wasn't being used.

I went to college and got good use out of it, playing on average once every two weeks. Fast forward to today I get a message from Amy. She said that since we never paid for the table she asked if she could have it back. I replied saying that just because we didn't pay for it doesn't mean it isn't ours, she gave it to us. She tried to tell me that we were never paid her, which is true but we offered and she declined. She said since we used it for a year for free that we should give it back. When I say no Amy threatens to get her dad involved, in which I was sarcastic in asking what he would do about it. Amy said that when he found out we never paid for it he wanted it back, which was a year after me and my friends got the table. Nothing came of that. She calls me rude but I told her it's rude to ask for something back a year later. She says I'm an asshole and I have the whole summer to buy a new poker table. I reply with ""I already have one"" and she never replied.


She thinks I'm an asshole for not giving the table back, but my parents and friends back me up on not giving it back and think my last comment was funny even though that's the one part I think was asshole-ish. So reddit AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I hate my life, honestly. 3 months ago my mother had two seizures due to low potassium/sodium and was hospitalized, forcing me to take a week off school. I came home and when I returned, she was discharged from the hospital and was “good to go” according to her cousin. That’s when I joined the National Guard to help pay for school, a hasty decision imo. 

Flash forward to May, school ends and I’m returning home. I believed my mother was doing well, she didn’t really talk to me or let me know about anything, and I decided to help take care of her considering I’m the only child. Only thing is I came home and my mother is blind in her right eye—well she can see light—and is not returning back to work, has memory loss, chronic weight loss, depression, anxiety, and a few other stuff. All of this wasn’t brought to my attention until the day I got home, well a couple of days later. She didn’t let me know of any of her health problems until I went to the doctor with her—and I had to get the information from the doctor! However, her cousin knew about ALL of this. 

So, keeping my word, I decided to look into getting out of my National Guard contract to take care of my mom and transfer closer to home to help support her. Her cousin, who is a military homer, did not like that and boasted that she is “the only person who can take care of her” and that I was “taking the easy way out”. She even replied “you quit on the military, they expect her adult son to take care of her” whenever I asked for help.  This led to some friction between us that resulted with me swearing at her because she honestly enraged me. Being a man, and because my mother begged me to, I decided to apologize and ask her for the help she was going to provide. She accepted my apology and said she was going to come down and help. Now I agree that she is not obligated to help, but she promised my mother that she would help as they’re like “sisters” and have a deeper bond. 

In the meantime my mother is becoming more and more like a stranger. Our bond is slowly decreasing and she is so hellbent on getting it back to normal when I just don’t see it getting to that point. She is emotionally abusive and is becoming a helicopter parent. I told her I was going to help take care of her, but it feels like she is taking advantage of me. Her cousin tells her that her behavior is “okay” and because I am the son I must deal with it. I put my life on hold and it feels like my mother just doesn’t appreciate it. I literally do everything for her. I’ve taken her to all of her doctors appointments, cleaned the house, halted my life, and more. I’ve never asked for acknowledgement, but I don’t want to be treated like a doormat.

c0e01i	2019-06-14 01:11:02	WorldExplorer23	AITA for not hanging out with my friend?	"  

A little context about my friend

&#x200B;

Him: lives roughly 20-30 minutes of me depending on traffic. He’s not to my knowledge huge on going out, and would rather chill at his place than do other things. We don’t hang out at my place because my internet is slow. I can’t remember a time he has ever came to my town to hang out. So that means to hang out I would most likely have to make the drive to his place.

&#x200B;

Me: I’ve finished school and got a job that doesn’t have set schedules every week, it changes. I haven’t hung out with him since he first got back. Personality wise I’m like the extroverted introvert; I like going out to the gym, bar, or am happy chilling with some games. 

&#x200B;

My friend, let’s call him Saul, is back from school for a few weeks and then he is leaving for an internship out of state. Since Saul has been back we’ve hung out once. We went to a bar, and long story short it wasn’t his scene, so we ended up heading back to his place and played some video games. After that night, to the present: I got my job (customer service), my car has been breaking down, and I’m dealing with family issues. I have not been on discord (When we normally talk), and I have not hung out with Saul since. It’s not that I am always busy 24/7. I have time, it’s just I need some of those days for “me time” after work.

&#x200B;

I have invited him out to do some things. For example, my old roommate from college invited me to go golfing and I extended the invitation to Saul to either go golfing, or to a range. He made a joke about who plays golf yata yata, the answer was no and I was fine with that.  Saul is leaving soon and I wanted to try and hang out before he left. We set a time on Tuesday when I’m off, and its set. Midway through my shift my boss tells me I have to close the same day Saul and I were going to chill. Shit. I text him when I have a moment at work to say “Hey, boss rescheduled me for tomorrow can you hangout before my shift starts.” I don’t hear anything back. I log into Discord today, and see I was demoted to a lower rank (the ranks are just titles we give each other, not something to take super seriously). Regardless, with everything else it kinda pissed me off. 

&#x200B;

To be fair, I don’t know if he changed it or someone else in the discord did, so I’m fully aware I could be overreacting. I haven’t spoken to him since I found out.  But still, am I the asshole for not hanging out with him?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	18.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

c0dyyy	2019-06-14 01:08:05	Ayekari	WIBTA if I ruin my parents' chance to buy a house?	"So this is going to be long. I'll be brief if any additional details are needed, I'll provide them.

My parents are trying to buy a house for investment purpose. Basically, they would rent the house out and use the rent as future income after they retired. They asked to use my name for the purchase/mortgage. 

I (25F) just started working in my field and am on track to finish a special certification end of this year. I didn't really want to be shouldering a mortgage so soon (even if they are paying everything, I am still technically responsible so if they can't make payments, I would have to do it.) 

The first time, the deal didn't go through because seller ended up backing out. Mom was very upset and let it be known. That was about a month (or two) ago. Two days ago, she bumped into seller and ended up coming home with the exciting news that the seller is willing now (higher price). I relented to her asking me to help since I wanted to help and trusted them. Offer was signed last night.

I found out today that my recently obtained credit card's first payment(deadline was on the 8th) is late because my parents ""forgot"" to give me the statement and left it under a pile of their stuff in a place I never checked(they know this). This isn't the first time they misplaced my letters and forgot about it, I have requested numerous times that they either give me my mail directly or leave it in a visible place. 

When I confronted them, they: 1. said it was my fault that I didn't check the mailbox, 2. that it was not a big deal and 3.didn't apologize. I have been checking the mailbox religiously everyday, but I have overtime sometimes and come home late, and seeing the empty mailbox and parents home, assumed that my parents took the mail if they was any. I have asked them before if they got any of my mail, last time I asked was literally two days ago.

So WIBTA if I back out of helping them and essentially ruining their chance to buy that house?

(Just to clarify that all the charges on the card are for purchases they needed but could not make at the time and that I don't get anything in exchange for helping them buy the house.)"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Slight nsfw 

I was at my friends house, and i went to go change my pad before i went home. i disposed of everything properly, i wrapped the pad with a couple layers of toilet paper and then i went home. about 30 minutes later, i get a string of angry texts telling me that her dog, Charlie** got into it and started chewing and ripping apart the used pad. yuck.

anyways, she started blaming me for leaving the door open, and i told her it's not my fault, and i didn't know i had to close a bathroom door. she insists it's my fault because the dog got into it and sHeS jUsT a PuPpY and she's too lazy to clean it. ( her dog is over a year old) and i'm at fault here. i explained that im not going to her house until her dog is trained, and told her she should probably train her dog before it causes her to lose more friendships. she bitched out at me and blocked me.

c0dy53	2019-06-14 01:05:32		AITA (22f) for feeling like this guy lead me on after 2 dates or is he (23m) the asshole in this situation. Please be honest.	I had a crush on this guy I worked with.. He quit his job recently and I was able to get his his number from our supervisor. Me and her are good friends. I texted him and he was receptive. I asked him to hang out a couple of times, but each time he wasn’t available. We continued texting. He eventually asked if I was free Sunday. We went out and he was such a gentleman and polite. We went out again the next week and it was a great experience. I noticed that he wouldn’t initiate texts with me as much as I would like. I would go five days without him initiating a text conversation with me. Nonetheless, when I texted him he was receptive. I had asked if he would be available Wednesday. He replied back that he wouldn’t be, but also didn’t indicate when he would be available. Two days later he calls me and says “ I think your an awesome person, but I’m not not ready for a relationship at this time. It has nothing to do with you, your an awesome person and I just don’t want to lead you on”. I told him okay and the conversation ended.  I was really upset about the situation. Why take me out on dates, if your not looking for a relationship? Two days later, my supervisor texted him telling him that I was upset and not handling it well. He replied that it was only two dates and that he doesn’t understand how I could be this attached so soon. She then further questioned him and asked why did he take me out if he wasn’t looking for a relationship. He replied that he only saw me as a platonic friend. She then asked him why didn’t he just say that. He replied that he wasn’t trying to hurt my feelings. My boss relays this to me, without him knowing. I text him telling him that he was a cop out for being so cliche and that he should’ve just told me the truth. I also told him we could’ve avoided all of this if he just said he wasn’t interested at the beginning. I also thanked him for the dates and told him he was a gentleman. Am I wrong in this situation?

Our back yard connects to two adjacent neighbors, and Their yard exits into the parking lot of a Hannaford. some of my guests and I have noticed that my surrounding neighbors, like to cross through our front and back yard, to get their groceries and come back through. 

My husband doesn't seem to think it's a big deal. And I find him unconfrontational about the whole situation. He grew up in a city with no land to himself, where everyone roams wherever they please and dig through your garbage for cans to return, and buy Natty Daddy's. I grew up in rural Maine where your land is yours and people should respect that, there's no reason to be there unless invited. Keep in mind, These neighbors have not once introduced themselves to us, and continually cross our property to get groceries.

We have been trying for weeks to grow our lawn as well. There is a perfectly good sidewalk around the neighborhood to get to Hannafords, but instead they cross our lawn. In my mind, if they wanted exercise they can go the long way around..... (It isn't even a half mile around, literally a block) They let their kids run around, and play in our yard. Just last week I caught a group of teenagers in my backyard flipping our patio table. I want a fence, and have recently bought ""no trespassing"" signs, And plan to put them up when they come in. My husband disagrees, and thinks we would be assholes for doing that.... I frankly think my neighbors are the assholes.... 

Am I the asshole for wanting people to be considerate of my own land, and wanting a privacy fence?? Please help me and my husband settle this dispute... He's a huge Reddit fan, and this was his idea to ask you guys. Thanks for your feedback 👍"	Not the A-hole	0	0	2.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

So, I’ve been looking at apartments for the past several months and finally found one that was perfect for my partner (33/M) and I (31/F).  I went and viewed it on Monday, my boyfriend came with me again on Tuesday to view it, and yesterday the Rental Applications were emailed out to both of us.   I filled my application out within the hour (took less than 10 minutes) and my partner didn’t fill it out until this afternoon until I reminded him again.  Unfortunately, last night we were at dinner with his family and missed an email sent to both of us about my partner needing to get his application in ASAP.  I woke up this morning to a text saying that the place was already rented to another couple.

Now I am fuming at this point.  Not only have I been the only one looking for places, but due to his stringent list of requirements it is incredibly difficult to find anything that is within MY budget too.  We both make the same amount of money but I pay $800/mo in student loans.  Although I didn’t blow up at him, I did make it known that it was his fault that we didn’t get the rent application in on time.  Am I wrong?  AITA?

I was at the bench and had just finished a few sets of my dumbell curls, so I was taking a five minute break. The bench is directly behind the deadlift/squats barbell.

This very attractive lady suddenly walks up, and to be honest, she had a great ass. I'm not kidding when I say I tried my honest best not to look at all, but I glanced at her ass like twice before I went back to my workout. She hadn't begun squatting yet.

When she began squatting, I stood up to leave. I glanced at her again, and to be honest, I was dumbstruck for like five seconds. I'm.honestly not a creep, it's just I really appreciated the amount of work she put into her ass. I could tell she worked hard to get to where she was, not to mention she was probably blessed with good genes.

I honestly didnt look for up to five seconds before this short, mildly overweight lady starts yelling at me. Basically making it seem like I was molesting the other lady with my eyes. Everyone pauses for a second and looks at what the noise is about. This lady won't stop telling about how I'm a creep and a disgusting asshole.

I do feel bad for being annoyed by this and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.

c0duy0	2019-06-14 00:56:15	ProPandaman	AITA For not being able to drive my GF to the airport after my car broke down.	"The title pretty much says it all but will explain a few extra details.

My (20M) girlfriend (19F) has been prepared and set to travel to America from Australia to meet her host family for months. She is away for 2.5 weeks and as it is a long time we both wanted for myself to drive her to the airport approximately 2 hours away.

Anyways, unfortunately this week my car broke down 2.5 hours away from home while I was heading to an event that I was working at. I managed to get to the location but when roadside assist got there they basically said the engine is dead (rip first car) and towed it to a mechanics nearby.

They couldn't fix it so I had to take a day off to hire a car trailer and drive down with my dad to collect the car.

When we got it back to my town our trusted mechanic took one look at the spark plugs and knew it was a case of bad fuel.

So we turned to insurance who requested that the mechanic files a report to them. We asked the mechanic yesterday and he said he would come over to my house today to fill out the report and take a photo of the odometer. He didn't specify a time however so I had to take another day off work as everyone else is busy in the house taking my sister to her surgery/travelling to our bank branch which is located around 3 hours away.

I just started a new job at a computer and smartphone repair place and am enjoying it thoroughly. Taking two days off this week to get things in order car wise I'm worried does not give a good first impression to my employer, because of this I would rather not take off work next Tuesday to drive my GF to the airport.

Even though my GF knows the situation she is mad with me, AITA?

c0dtgv	2019-06-14 00:51:47		AITA for nagging bf to go get a haircut	"This whole argument feels so petty and highschool-ish, but here we go. So my (21F) boyfriend (21M) has long hair, long enough that he can tie it back into a bun. For the past few weeks now I've been reminding (or nagging, however you see it) him to go get a haircut. We've discussed it, and he knows he needs to get one so that he looks more professional for work, and he also acknowledges that he needs one and would look much better. 

What's holding him back from getting one is that he's scared that it would look bad, because he hasn't had short hair in a while, and he's also just lazy. When he went for a job interview a few days ago he was a bit unhappy with his appearance because of his hair as well. I've been trying to push him into getting one for about a few weeks now, and I feel like an asshole for doing so. I've been trying to reassure him that it won't look bad, and that if he's so scared of change, then he should get his previous haircut. 

He promised me a few days ago that he would try to get one today, but he also messaged me saying that if it looks bad he's going to get angry and blame me. We then got into an argument, and I told him that he shouldn't get a haircut if he doesn't want to, and that I'm not going to force him to do anything. He's now saying that only I want him to get a haircut, not him, and it's all my idea. So I've completely given up on it, and I won't bring it up again after today.

I feel like an asshole for this whole situation, but I really felt like I was helping him get over the unnecessary anxiety. I  should also mention that I don't find long hair on men attractive, but it's far from being a deal breaker, and I'm not going to love him any less for not getting one. So AITA for nagging?"

We met each other 2 weeks ago on tinder and decided to meet irl. We were walking through this sketchy looking neighborhood (looked old and broken down) when all of us sudden I hear gunshots. My date screamed and I immediately go ""fuck this"" and run as fast and far away as I can. My date texted me an hour later, telling me it was just firecrackers (in my defense I've never heard a gunshot in real life before) and called me an asshole and a pussy for leaving her there alone for dead (she thought they were gunshots too until she saw for herself that they weren't). My view is that I just met her two weeks ago, I sure as hell ain't gonna risk her slowing me down by waiting for her at the cost of my life. I value my life way more than hers (sounds harsh but it's true). Also why the hell did she need to be with me to run away, couldn't she have just ran herself? Also I'd rather be an alive pussy then a dead one. I think its just survival instincts, but I might as well ask if I'm the asshole

EDIT/Update/Info/Idkwtftocallthis:  Alright guys I've had a wank and calmed down a bit. The responses were a bit mixed but most leaned towards YTA because I didn't check up on her and yes I completely owe up to that. I should have checked to see if she was ok instead of just assuming she was dead, I tend to do these things sometimes and the thought hadn't even crossed my mind so definitely need to work on that. She's blocked me, probably for the better since I was gonna dump her anyways (she was a lot snobbier irl than on tinder and was rude to the waiter) though I definitely didn't expect THAT to be the way it ended. Also to those calling me a coward: yes I am and I'm proud dammit. I survived a shooting because of it (I know it was just firecrackers but I'm gonna make them gunshots in my head to feel better about myself). Anyways I'm gonna go back on tinder."

c0dsnr	2019-06-14 00:49:20	Practical_Mind	AITA for telling my poor friend that if she stopped spending money on useless shit, she wouldn’t have to keep borrowing from others?	"I’ve been friends with Melanie for 3 years (we’re both 21). She’s always had irresponsible spending habits. She’s at least monthly asks to borrow varying amounts of money (to her credit, she always does pay me back when she says she will, which is typically by the end of the week).

The thing is that she ALWAYS spends her money on dumb things. Anytime we go out to eat, she’s the one who orders a drink (besides water) and a appetizer. Anytime she comes at one of our places, she brings over bags from high-cost places like chipotle and Starbucks. I try to tell her she needs to budget to learn how to budget and stop unnecessary expenses, meal prep her meals, and actually start trying to save but she just brushes me off. 

Well we recently came from a group vacation (which she HAD to have spent at least $400 because that’s how much each individual share was, not including things like food). She called me freaking out this morning because her dog accidentally ate a chicken bone, and it got stuck in its throat. The vet said he’s going to need surgery, which will cost her over $500. She wants to borrow $350 from me and says she’ll pay me back in 2 weeks. 

I told her I’ll give her the money IF she promises to stop wasting her money on things she doesn’t need and actually start SAVING it. That it was kind of sad that a grown adult doesn’t have anything in her checking account, but insists on coming along to expensive vacations and spending hundreds of dollars eating out. I was tired of her having to rely on me like I’m some kind of a bank, and tired of her taking advantage of my kindness

She got really offended that I actually stood up for myself for once and calling her out on her atrocious spending habits. She said fuck off, she doesn’t need me, and hanged up on me. Now she’s telling all of our friends that I’m a piece of shit making fun of her because she’s poor. 

I told my side of the story, but most of my friends said it wasn’t cool of me to “blame her for her circumstances” (her parents are working class immigrants who don’t have much money). I told them that spending mentality is exactly what’s going to perpetuate that cycle of poverty and she needs to be more conscience of her spending habits. 

I’m kinda fuming that everyone took her side and I needed to write this all out. I’m sitting here knowing I’m trying to help her. I don’t *think* that I’m an asshole here, but I’m willing to accept the fact that I am if I REALLY am.."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

But the day that we scheduled for was on a day that another one of my friends (18F) is staying with me (We’ll call her F). 

F is staying with me for a week before going off to Cleveland for college. She decided to stay in our home state instead of staying in Texas with her family for a month to be able to stay with me and her other friends.

While I was planning the Lunch with C I made sure that F was good with this arrangement. She said that she was so the date was set. A couple minutes later F asked where it was. I told her the general area but now I’m worried that she’s under the impression that she’s coming. The problem with this, is the fact that they don’t know each other all that well.

The only date they had was at the end of November. I told him that I would only get married on that date if he agreed to shave his beard off.

My fiance has been an avid ""no shave November"" participant and I have always been and always will be supportive of that choice. However, he does not have the ability to grow a full beard. It comes out very patchy and scraggly. It's bad and he knows it. He even makes jokes about it when it's growing and calls it his ""face pubes"". He keeps his face completely clean-shaven for the rest of the year. 

He agreed to shave it early, but when he told his friends about this, they called me controlling and said that if I really loved him, I wouldn't mind marrying him with the beard and embracing the cause. My perspective is that if we're going to shell out this much money for a nice wedding and nice wedding photos, I would like both of us to look our best. I am going to get my hair and makeup professionally done, and I would like for him to put in similar effort to his appearance for our wedding day.

I will admit, I'd get upset too if someone came to me to talk something out and didn't listen to my advice. But at the same it's what felt right to me. After all, I'm the one who has to live with it. She said she's not mad at me, but I do feel a little bit of a disconnect and maybe it's all in my head, but still. I mean, a year ago I would has never even had the guts to talk about my feelings let alone say how I felt to my ex. I feel like I'm improving, but I still feel bad when I go to my friend to complain and I don't take her advice. 

She's been there for me through a lot so far and I consider her one of my closest friends even if we haven't been friends for very long. (Almost a year). The last thing I would want to to drive her away, but can't help who I am. She's not the sensitive type so it can be hard I guess for her to see my side of things. 

AITA for not taking her advice and apologizing?

"My in-laws are probably what you would call functioning alcoholics. They hold jobs and have a nice house, but get drunk every single night and still go to work the next morning like it’s nothing. 

Once I counted MIL’s drinks starting from when she got home at 5; she had six Hennessys, and by 8 she was slurring her words and stumbling. My FIL is much the same, only instead of slurring he speaks at 10x the volume of a normal speaking voice. 

Whenever we stay with them, our 2-year-old gets terrible sleep because they keep him up late being loud, and I have to remove myself from the situation because FIL’s volume gives me a headache and MIL is bothering me so much. 

Currently I am upstairs because MIL kept coming up behind me and hugging me,and kept showing me things on her phone by holding the phone up half an inch from my face, and FIL is shouting at a golf tournament on the TV while my toddler tosses and turns in the next room (I can see him on the video monitor). 

I’m posting because my husband texted and asked where I am, and when I told him where I was and why, he said I’m being judgmental and that his parents ‘mean well’. I am absolutely judging them; not to their faces, but I don’t think it’s so wrong of me not to want to be around loud drunk people who can’t stay out of my personal space. AITA?"

I got a call today from her asking if I could cover her closing shift on Father’s day because she forgot to request it off. She mentioned that this is her father’s first Father’s day after the passing of her mother, so it would probably be difficult for him. Here’s the thing, I had already made plans weeks in advance to attend a family gathering for Father’s day. This gathering I’m going to is hosted by my grandparents. The last time they had family over for dinner, I couldn’t go because I had to work the closing shift.

I explained that I had already made plans in advance and requested the day off weeks ago, so I couldn’t cover the shift for her. I did apologize, but she finished up the phone call with a rather passive aggressive sounding “Well, I guess I’m going to have to just work the shift then” before hanging up. This, and the fact that it’s her father’s first Father’s day after her mom passed has me wondering if I’m the asshole for not taking the shift. Thoughts?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0do1q	2019-06-14 00:35:59	olympic_gem	AITA for hiding the fact that I eat chicken from my family who are vegetarian?	"Backstory: I am a high schooler and have come from a vegetarian family. My dad is a vegetarian, and my mom is a vegetarian. In the past, they have shown lots of hatred towards chicken and other meats, and I thought it was something about our religion. 

&#x200B;

Fast Forward to 8th grade.

During this time, I was very conscious of my health because I had gotten very chubby over the years. So, I started dieting by eating salads at school. The salads were pretty bad, the only vegetarian one barely had anything in it. But there were chicken salads, and one day I decided to get the salad, ignoring my pre-conceived notions that chicken was bad. However, instead of telling my parents about it, I decided not to because I feared that they would have too big of a reaction.

&#x200B;

Fast Forward to the March of 9th grade.

&#x200B;

My friend asks me if I want to go to Buffalo Wild Wings to eat wings there, forgetting the fact that I am vegetarian. I quickly remind him but say that it's ok because I am used to it. I tell him no one really knows except school friends and him. He is surprised, but we make the plans. Soon, we go, and I tell my parents that I'm going to get a salad. During the car ride, he tells me that he told his mom, but she will keep it secret. He went through the same thing as me and knows how it feels. He urges me to let his mom call my mom to reveal the news in a joking manner so that my mom doesn't think much of it. I decline quickly.

&#x200B;

Fast Forward to the end of 9th grade.

&#x200B;

We decide to go to BWW again and this time he urges me to let his mom call my mom and reveal the news. I agree but tell him that he should send me a quick text before his mom reveals the news. We finish up and head home.

&#x200B;

Nothing happens the next day, but on Thursday, that friend texts me and asks me if my mom was mad at all. I ask him, ""for what? why would she be mad?"" Quickly, I realize his mom told my mom and he didn't text me. She had called my mom the day before, but my parents hadn't said anything. At this point, I am in school doing a test-out class, and my Mom is at work. I panic, and I text my mom, ""hey, did friend's mom say anything yesterday that was special?"" She doesn't respond immediately but after a couple of hours, she texts back and says, yes, she does know that I've eaten chicken for a while now. I tell her that she should not get mad because although I made a mistake by not telling you, it is my choice, and you should respect it.

&#x200B;

I get home, and she is furious. She gets mad and starts crying because someone's mom had to tell her that I eat chicken instead of me myself. She said she feels as if she doesn't know her son anymore and that she feels betrayed. While hearing this, I feel terrible, but couldn't do anything. I was too afraid of her reaction that I didn't tell her over these 1.5 years. I feel like an ass after hearing what she said, but I want some other people's input. Am I the Asshole?"

c0dmab	2019-06-14 00:30:48	neintoes	WIBTA for cutting my Aspergic sister out of my life if it seems like doing so wouldn't make a difference to her?	"I (24M) immigrated from SA with my mum, dad and sister (27M) to the UK when we were much younger. It was rough on both of us but we were really close when we were younger. As she grew older she grew more angry and sometimes really quite venomous.. I was definitely an annoying asshat from time to time but mostly I kept hoping she'd grow out of it and act like my sister again.

When she was in her early 20's she was finally diagnosed with Aspergers which made complete sense and we al kicked ourselves for not picking up on it earlier.

The moment she got diagnosed she almost took it as an excuse to act rudely to everyone, she started losing friends, started several feuds within the family and stopped holding up almost any appearance of kindness towards me. When I moved away to University about five or six years ago things got worse and I now get treated as a complete stranger in my parents house (where she still lives half the time). She acts very antagonistic and standoffish any time I'm home it's her territory and she wants me to know that. Any attempts at kindness towards her are met with grunts and obnoxiousness behaviour. Any messages on facebook checking in on her are ignored.

Last week my grandma passed away back in SA which was pretty rough given that I couldn't afford to fly back there with my folks for the funeral and general group/family grieving. I reached out to my sister who was also still in the UK to check how she was. Ignored. I messaged a few days later again. Ignored again. 

I decide to catch the train back to my parents house the night before they get back to the UK to sort out the house and see how they're doing. Out of the blue I get a message from her 'I hear you're coming today. I've just gone to a&e I'l be home after. All the food in the house is mine and my partner's, bring your own.' 

I was pissed that after a week since my gran passed the only time she wished to reach out was to tell me not to eat her food. Then of course I panicked and tried to find out what was going on, how I could help. Her condition later got worse and she was in a scary amount of pain. The moment my parents arrived back in the country I took them to the hospital and we all anxiously awaited her results. We got good news and I broke down a bit (I was operating on 2 hours sleep and was a bit over emotional at this point). I got a rare glimpse of a kinder side of her.

Later when she was feeling better she came home and returned to an antagonising angry version of herself.

It's been difficult for the past 15 years attempting to have some sort of bond with someone who for so long has treated me as a really uncomfortable presence. I know she's struggling with issues  I cant possibly understand and when she's been in the hospital might be an assholish time to make such a judgement but having gotten so emotional about her health for things to so quickly return to how they were, it's felt like the last straw..

c0diqb	2019-06-14 00:21:07		WIBTA if I put my neighbors trash on their doorstep for using my bins	"I live in a small apartment building. One of the downstairs tenants, let's refer to them as Problem Unit (PU), are constantly blasting music at all hours of the night and day, leaving  cigarette butts all over the stairs leading to my apartment, and constantly honk at the building to get someone in the PU's attention. I both work from home and I am a homebody so I spend about 99% of my day at home on average, so having to constantly deal with all of this has really gotten to me over time.

To top it all off, I recently discovered that they've been using my trash bins instead of their own. My city requires its residents to pay for their trash bins, roughly $36USD monthly.

Since I moved in at least 2 weeks out of the month when I take my trash out for the first time each week my bins have been at least half way full to 80% full of the same huge black trash bags with yellow drawstrings, leaving room for only 1 or 2 bags of my trash. This isn't always an issue, but some weeks I have a ton and it is very much a problem. All the bins are clearly marked with their apartment unit number on them, and I even went over mine with the same white paint when it faded after a few months.

Until recently I haven't known who was doing it and asked my landlord to ask the other tenants to use their own since it became a problem for me. However, last week I saw the older man (OM) from the PU taking out the trash. It was very late and I'm normally asleep by then. He was carrying 5 or 6 of those same bags and put most of them in my currently empty bin instead of his own. A few nights ago I was up late again and saw him do the same with more trash! I finally had my culprit.

I normally talk to my landlords when there are issues and have them deal with it. But since the last (and only time at this building) I did that the OM banged on my door at 1am to chew me out for going to the landlord cause they were blasting music so late on a week night. To avoid this, I made a point to take my dog out to pee the next time I saw him outside and asked him very politely if he would quit using my bins cause it makes it hard for me to put anything in them. He just glared, grunted, and went inside. I hoped that would be that. How foolish of me. That was yesterday. This morning guess what I found. My bin full of their trash bags.

I was mad, so I talked to my landlord and they said: ""We will ask."" What. Did you forget that you own the building? Just made me angrier.

I've pretty much decided that if it happens again I'm going to start putting their trash on their door step every time I find them in there. I move out in 2 months so I'm ready to burn the metaphorical bridge. WIBTA if I did this cause it could cause a real mess if any of the bags ripped or came open?

c0dhtf	2019-06-14 00:18:31	UrbanMG	AITA for confronting a large guy intimidating an old man when it wasn’t my business?	"I have been given the same response by many people I know and they think I was in the wrong, the story goes as follows.

I was walking home from my local shopping center, as I was passing a taxi rank on the bend the where there is a stop sign (not part of taxi rank) there was an old guy (easily 70 odd y/o) parked up on the side of the road. Obviously he is in the wrong parking in front of a stop sign beside the taxi rank, but, the road itself is a very unused road, just a side road for people who may work in the shopping centre. 
Anyways. As I approached this small road, I hear a lot of yelling from what sounded like a foreign guy (in Ireland) losing his head at somebody. I then see this big bald headed dude, decently sized, out of his Jeep and in this old taxi driver face absolutely screaming abuse at him, calling him all sorts of names, threatening to call the police, all for him being parked up beside the taxi rank but in front of a stop sign. Meanwhile the old guy is sat in his car, looking very very frightened and highly confused, not saying a word. This really bothered me because here was this big guy, yelling in this poor old guys face for a simple mistake. 
So, I approached him (just as he got back in his car) and asked him what the f**k is he doing, I began shouting to him asking what age he was (I assume mid 30’s) he seemed quite confused because I approached him from nowhere sticking up for the taxi dude. He kept shouting bullshit at to which I kept shouting what age are you, he eventually shut up and I asked him “Do you realize that he is an old guy and made a simple mistake” to which he said that “I am here every single day and he is always there, which I called bullshit because I pass that road every day and have never witnessed this going on, he became very quiet when I kept at him about the mans age and how disrespectful it was to be intimidating him. He stormed off in his big boy jeep and the taxi dude left also
I might add, his daughter was also in the Jeep with him and she witnessed all of this. (Great example to set, aye?)

What goes through my mind, if that was my grandad he was shouting at, how would I feel.

Everybody I have talked to says they “understand where I’m coming from but it wasn’t my right to get involved” which is absolute bullshit because this big dude intimidated an old man and scared the shit out of him. If it had of been a bodybuilder parked at the stop sign I know this dude would have don’t nothing like what he did to the old guy.

TLDR; I confronted a big guy intimidating and scaring  an old dude for a simple road mistake."	Not the A-hole	0	0	2.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

Now that we’re done with backstory here’s the real story.

Me and G were driving around he took two of his shortcuts that got us into a little traffic. So I jokingly said “we can’t make the right turn” this made him mad and told me about how this is his way and he don’t need my opinion.

I know this sound minor but he’s gotten much madder at what I believe are much smaller things.
One short example is he yelled bloody murder when I formatted a text to someone my way and I thought his one was convoluted. 

I talked to my Dad tonight and as he always says he 70 just deal with it. Usually I would quiet down and say ok.

c0dgey	2019-06-14 00:14:34	Thry4321675274	AITA for cutting my son off financially b/c I distrust/disapprove of his new gf?	"Preparing to be called the asshole but here goes...
My son is 24 and disabled so his job prospects are very limited. I give him some money (~60% of his total income) every month to pay his rent and buy essentials with. His mother (we’re divorced) also gives him a little bit of money. His disability payments are minuscule and would not even cover 1/3 of his rent. He’s been taking online classes hoping to get some kind of remote IT role, which could really work out for him one day.

But three months he had news that made my heart drop. He found a girlfriend for the first time but this woman is not only 8 years older than him, she’s also pregnant with someone else’s child. He says she’s an abuse victim escaping her violent ex and they met online but she’s already moved in with him AND she’s already changed her online profile name to his last name despite not being married (he said she did it for safety reasons. Now he’s excited to be the father of her baby and start their lives together. 

This meant taking a pause on his education, his goals, everything just to take care of her and her child. I told him I had to put my foot down and if he chooses this then I can’t support him financially. He was distraught and begged me but I said no. I can’t give him money to raise someone else’s child and waste his own life. 

My ex wife is furious because she says I’m sabotaging his happiness and trying to control him with money. I just don’t trust his girlfriend and her intentions and I don’t feel right funding this kind of lifestyle. At least before I knew that my money was helping him to become self-sustainable one day (I was also paying for his classes) but now I know any money I give him will be an indefinite thing since neither of them
can work. But on the other hand he really does seem happy despite all the alarm bells going off for me. AITA?

Edit: To everyone asking what he would do about rent, if I cut him off it wouldn’t be all at once. His 2 year lease is ending in October, so I would naturally end rent payments there and he’d have to find a place he can afford himself without me as co-signer. 

As for the other expenses, most of that went towards his schooling. I would also naturally end that since he’s no longer taking the courses. 

But the biggest thing is still rent. His mother and I had initially decided that it would be best if he could move out and get a nice apartment downtown so he could see his friends and have a better social life than being stuck in the burbs. But obviously rent there is far far more than what his disability would ever cover. I paid it thinking it would help him get a good job and be self-sufficient one day.

So he is mostly upset over the thought of moving. On his disability + my ex’s support he would only be able to afford either a tiny studio or a very rundown one bedroom apartment in much less desirable area."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

She still refuses and the next day I suggest we should go do something sometime during the week as a kind gesture. She suggests we hang out the next day and I agree. We are also friends and my crush on her has always been on the down low. A lowkey crush if you will. I had no idea what was in store for that night. We were watching a movie and from the get go she becomes very close and so do I. We were leaning on eachother the whole time. I’m a movie talker (I know I can’t help it) and every time I say something she leans towards me so that my lips are touching her face. I started thinking that maybe she’s interested in me. We are getting towards the end of the movie and I told her I was going to sit up and when I did she just leaned against my shoulder and I just said, “Alright just come here” and I put my arm around her and we held hands. the movie is ending and we start getting closer and closer.

This is two days after we had our night at the cinema and one week after she turns down the mutual friend.

This morning he texts me, “we need to talk”. I respond with “yes please” (she told me she told the mutual friend about what happened).

c0dc37	2019-06-14 00:02:23		AITA for telling everyone an Ex-Friend was toxic- resulting in her losing friends?	I was friends with this girl O for 5 months. And when I mean friends she was one of my best friends- we talked every day and did everything together along with one other girl C. After around two months of our friendship O and C started to gang up on me, attacking my political beliefs, clothes, fashion, family, etc. every day when I went to school there would be something they would attack me on and over time it grew on me. O was also a really toxic friend- not letting me really have other friends, attacking her family or random people all the time, and just being plain nasty for no reason. They attacked me on my insecurities- and then blamed me for things that I talked about or said that I was bullying when I was excited about something- ex getting into a fully sponsored STEM camp that one of them tried our for or grades. I think it was pack mentality or something but they were brutal when talking to me and I really just closed my self off to other friends and family. After I defended myself a few times O and C said that we shouldn’t be friends and basically ditched me. I made multiple new groups of friends quickly and I thought this was all over- me and C were still talking but I basically never talked to O. Fast forward two months- O and C got in a huge fight- and O ended up with out friends. She was desperate so she joined my friend group and acted like nothing happened- while still going back to her toxic ways- bashing my friends and random people- her entire personality basically became being a bitch. No one really in my grade liked her but she started getting friends again. One day I was walking with a few of my friends to my lunch table and I hear her talking about me to some random girl- basically becoming her old self again. I was lowkey done and decided to tell all of my friends- 25ish ppl- what happened with em O and C because they were basically all clueless. That resulted in 20ish ppl hating her- among the 60ish who already did. Shes basically friendless now- 2 people who really aren’t friends with her- and I’m feeling really guilty for it- as she hadn’t done anything in a while. She’s texted me a few times just out of the blue with instagram videos or such. She’s an army brat who moves all the time but she was staying at our school till she graduated- and now I’ve heard that she might be moving. I feel like a total bitch- even though I was kind of telling my side I feel like I over reacted. She’s alone right now and in a dark place and I feel like reaching out. AITA? Should I help her or retract what I said somehow? Idk what to do and kind of in a mental breakdown about this right now.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0daf2	2019-06-13 23:57:43	XYZREEE	WIBTA If I didn't tell my mom that I have a job	"Like in the title.

  

Backstory

When I was about 16 Y/O, I could work legally only with my mom permission.  
I asked her for it and she agreed, however when I got the offer she refused to sign the contract, because she didn’t want to interact with strangers that day. She has a history with depression and was going on therapy when I was 10-12. My biological father abandoned us, step-father had no custody of me. After few tries I started giving out leaflets without contract. My family took majority of my salary saying that “we are poor” but it didn’t stop them from buying decorative porcelain plates( my mom's hobby, she spends 10- 20% of family budget each month on it). Soon after they bought garden allotment. 

At the end of first year of uni I wanted to work part-time. Almost all workplaces required certification of food handlers -without it u can’t work with food, cost is equivalent of 2 full workdays. So I tried to borrow money from my family. Whenever I asked it was always “ask at the payday” and when it came “we have important expenses, ask at the end of month” and so on.

At the next spring my computer broke and cuz I'm IT student and my grades are very,very important to them, they felt obligated to give me possibility to replace it. They set rule-  they borrowed me money for aforementioned certificate, I gave equivalent of 5 full dayworks each month. After 1 month we already had the problem cuz they forced me to buy groceries for family of five and they didn’t even return part of that money back. My BF lived closer to my job so I spent almost whole time in his house. But my family still wanted at least half of my salary. Little reminder: Main target of that job was to buy computer  
 Another semester came and my family still demanded more money. For it to be worth it I either had to give up sleep or education, so I quit the job. Parents were upset that I stopped working, but “education is more important”.  
 

Last year my step-father found out he has diabetes. He had to change his food habits.  
My mom started to spend big ass time on web surfing and she heard about “social anxiety” on some cringy forum for teenagers. She saw so many shitposts( copy paste type) and probably due to her not fully healed depression- she stopped therapy before doctor said her condition is ok, she refused to take medications.She stopped interacting with strangers, going to the store is impossible. She prefers to walk 10 km to work instead of 20 min bus ride.

  
I spend significant more time in my BF’s house than in my family house. I don’t cost my family almost anything even my BF buys me food. They only have to pay for uni stuff( equivalent of my mom’s 2 days of work) and because they spend money on weird stuff like decorations for the garden, they weren’t able to pay.

TL’DR I don’t want to tell my mom with mental issues and diabetic step-father when I’ll start a job, cuz they used to get majority of my salary and spend it on random junk"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I had plans to have small 30 person wedding, however after planning out many of the details (and my mother buying me the dress), I found out I’m going to need a very invasive surgery. The surgery date was chosen for 3 months after the appointment with the surgeon. Luckily, no invites had gone out and no deposits put down yet.

I figured it would be smart to get married to my fiancé before the surgery (more for legal reasons than anything) but I still want a real celebration next year after I’ve recovered. I thought the next best thing would be to elope - have our 2 best friends there as witnesses - and not tell many people. I bought a cheap $100 dress and sandals...nothing fancy. We’ll all go out for dinner after.

I told my Mom about my plans a few months ago and she seemed fine with it. I texted her today to tell her it’s happening and she answered, “Well we’re shocked. Hope all goes well and congratulations...” Now I’m wondering if I made the right decision.

I (M17) like to sleep naked in my room without covers on and the fan on to keep cool while I sleep during the summer nights. Otherwise, I wake up in a pool of my own sweat. My mom wakes up periodically throughout the night and likes to check the house and check on all of us to see we're alive and okay. 

She opened my door a few nights ago and we were both met with an unpleasant surprise. She told me that she doesn't want to see me like that again, so I locked my bedroom door the next night. She has a problem with that too, since she can't check on me during her ungodly hours of night she's up. 

Her solution? Just stop sleeping naked. I tried to explain I can't otherwise I can't sleep and I wake up all sweaty if I do, but she doesn't wanna hear it. Do I keep fighting this or try to move on?

Edit: She's not crazy, she doesn't check my pulse or anything, she opens my door to see I'm in there, sleeping. I also don't really mind that she comes in unannounced, but because she does, I feel she shouldn't have a problem with it then."	Not the A-hole	0	0	16.0	5.0	0.0	0.0
c0d814	2019-06-13 23:50:59		AITA for wanting to take my wife out for religion?	"Long story short, I am a hidden atheist who lives in muslim community (not to provoke or something, do no not misunderstand me). I have been married 4 years now and I became an atheist about year and a half ago, while still hiding it. I would want to be open about my disbelief, but unfortunately there will be  consequences if I go public about it. Some scenarios would not be peacful at all. Now, I genuenly love my wife and do not want her to be unhappy. That is where the dillema goes.

&#x200B;

I want introduce her to atheism step by step, without rushing, so she will become atheist too in the end. I know I can do it, because I know my religion very well and I can use it's flaws to present them to my wife at the end of the last phase. Now, my problem is, that she is happy in this religion. The world is so much simpler to her right now. Everything has an explanation and no matter what happens, good thing or bad thing, it is God's will. It comforts her to know that everything is explainable and there are no mysteries. One more reason I am afraid to introduce her to atheism is, that I do not know what her reaction would be. It is unpredictable which way she will choose, be ok with it or just miss all peace and comfort she has in this life. On the other hand, I do not want my children to be indoctrinated by anything before they grow old enough to choose themselves. I do not have a problem with religious people unless it affects my life and the way I want to live (and it does affect me right now, unfortunately). My children are also free to choose whatever religion they want (unless the do not hurt or disturb other people ofc.) and I will be totally ok with it. This is the motivation I follow when I want to take my wife out of religion and be hiding it with me, while raising our children who can think critically and forbid them to live their life as they want to. To do this I need my wife and she has to be atheistic to allow it. And sorry for my bad english, this is not my first language."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My wife's dad is difficult at best, but for the most part I get along with everyone. We hangout, talk, and we all like to smoke cannabis. I think this is a great feature for in-laws because it makes talking easier and more chill. The problem is that they smoke aggressively. I'm talking these people between the 3 of them will smoke like a 1/4oz in a day. It blows my mind the wake and bake, smoke at breakfast lunch dinner and bed.  

Now don't get me wrong I like pot and I like partaking with them for the bonding, but this is a lot of smoking for me. Generally speaking I like to smoke later in the evening every couple days just to settle down. I can't keep up with them.  I always share when I break mine out, company makes the smoke better after all, but I have kept the same frequency.

So my wife and I went shopping and she divulged to me that my in-laws were upset that I wasn't offering my green as much as they are and they felt I should cough up some bud.

c0d70q	2019-06-13 23:48:03	Unnamedgalaxy	AITA for being upset over a friends success?	"So some background, I work at a company with a great manager training program but you basically need a degree of any kind to be considered. There are other programs you can go through but they are limited to the amount of people that can be accepted through.
I don't have a degree and I'm a bit on the shy and timid side so I never really thought about going for it but after alot of encouragement from my managers, coworkers and even customers I worked up the courage to ask my district manager about the opportunity and he seemed surprised and happy that I had finally considered it. We talked through some options and everything looked good.
It's been about a year now and nothing has come from it, not from a lack of trying. I'm ultimately fine with it, like I said it's a limited process.
The ""problem"" arose here recently that a coworker that I really like is basically in the same position. They would like to move up but without a degree never really actively pursued the issue. Last week our district manager brought her in and asked her about her future and what she would like to do. Within a week he calls back and has decided that he's very quickly putting her through the program and will be giving her a manager position in a nearby store after her 6 week training. 
I'm incredibly happy for her, she's a great worker and friend and I absolutely want her to go through with it but at the same time I was struck by a feeling of depression and anger over the fact that I have been given the brush off after a year and after one week someone who has not actively been trying to gets a huge promotion.
While I tried to put on a joyous face it was rough and people started to get upset with me for not unconditionally offering smiles and love. AITA for being a little bummed with the whole situation?"	No A-holes here	0	0	113.0	6.0	0.0	0.0

c0d5ap	2019-06-13 23:43:06	wardenofthenorthpole	AITA for not talking to a friend (F) after F invited my harasser to a meet up	"Backstory: me and the friend (we'll call them F) have known each other for a little under two years while the douchebag (DB) and F have known each other for a number of years prior to me and F meeting. I met DB shortly after I met F and initially thought he was an alright guy, though a little... Direct. 
One fateful day, due to some unforeseen circumstances, I've been left without lights, heating and any running water and my landlord refused to put me up in a hotel so I needed a place to stay for the night until the problem got fixed. I asked F, they were unavailable and at the time I didn't know many people where I lived. So I asked DB and he promptly agreed for me to stay. While I'm over, DB starts acting creepier and creepier, finally touching me and trying to ""get me going"" and ""to stop teasing"". 
After I left, I told F and they said DB has always been like that and that it's no big deal. 
Now we jump to present day:
I've stopped all contact with DB and haven't run into him  in over 6 months. I was planning to keep it that way. Me and F have remained friends, and helped each other through some more than rough times. 
Me and my new friend group have started a tradition of meeting up once a week to allow us to have a catch up with each other to which F was also invited. 
One week before the incident, we were having a chat at the usual gathering and somehow DB's name got mentioned. My tone went solemn and I told F then that DB was never welcome here . 
One day before the incident, F messages me, informing me that they're not feeling great and going through a rough time. I help as best as I can from far away and after I made sure they were safe I went to sleep as it was getting late. 
The next day was gathering day and I sent F a message to see if they were coming. They say sure. Shortly, after their reply I get a message from DB: I heard from F that you guys are meeting up. Am I alright to come along?
 My blood starts to boil and I immediately say no. 
Later on the night, me and my boyfriend run into F. I try to explain how it hurt that they invited DB but F stops me before I begin and say: Don't wanna talk. So I respect their request and shortly after leave. I was mad, but I wanted to diffuse the situation as soon as possible. 
I figured, they'd contact me if they wanted to talk. I got nothing. So I reached out to F to see how they were doing after a two month long MIA situation (personal life and career take their toll).
The response I got was as follows:
I'm doing awful. Everything is terrible but you decided being mad was more important than helping a friend who is struggling and asked for help. I'm trying to survive.
So, AITA for taking a break from the friendship? Did I overreact? 

Tldr: Friend invites sexual harasser ""friend"" to a gathering I specified the douchebag was not welcome to. Asks me not to explain why I'm hurt then blames me for not contacting them and helping them through a rough time. AITA?

c0d4j7	2019-06-13 23:40:53		WIBTA if I told my brother's friend who has been living with us since he was 14 to start looking somewhere else to rent?	This guy has been living with us since he was 14. He is now 28. A mutual friend of me and my brother and who lost his father at an early age. His family were too poor to care for him and his uncle literally threatened to kill him if he came back home. It was never planned, at least not from my part, but he kept sleeping over until one day he woke up and he was 28. Now I would not have a problem with him living with us had he worked and helped us with bills or grocery or something... something like doing stuff around the house. Nah, this guy literally wakes up at 2pm, goes to the hair salon he works at, comes back at 11pm, waits for dinner while he complains about working all day, then he plays with his phone all night then sleeps late. thats his cycle. The day I ask him to go with me and take the garbage out, I would be changing his routine. Sometimes he would even come home after he had dinner outside and he would not even invite my brother at least- then he comes back home to eat some more. and it bothers me, the ungratefulness bothers me. And especially that our life right now is terrible, we can barely pay for bills and get grocery because i'm currently technically unemployed (i do freelance graphic design and you do not always have clients), and this guy keeps spending his money on new clothes and dinner outside - not even save up so that he would someday afford to rent alone, nah, that idea never crosses his mind. I told another friend about it and he was like i would look like an asshole for asking him to pay for grocery or bills because he is more so close to my brother than i am. my brother agrees with me, but he has been friends with him that even he feels like he would be an asshole to kick him out. so much things to say but i'm just going to stop here because i'm legit annoyed.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0d22l	2019-06-13 23:33:38		AITA for moving on so quickly from a long term relationship (4 days)?	"So this has been something thats been on my mind for awhile lately and after the split responses from friends and family I am starting to wonder what an outsiders opinion may be. 

So my ex [22F] and I [23M] had been together for nearly two years and had a wonderfully positive relationship from start to finish. I know its quite rare and I am very fortunate and lucky because most don’t turn out like that. Sure we had our share of disagreements but surprisingly we are both mature, loving, giving individuals who really emphasized on the values of teamwork and honesty with communication. My Ex, lets call her Maria, was incredibly amazing, there were sparks, butterflies, romance and she ticked many of my boxes: latin girl, playful, short, athletic, personality...etc. This would have honestly been the woman i would marry in the future if it weren’t for the reason we split. 

Our careers were heading in two different directions. Her career was taking her to the East coast and mine was staying in Cali. We were both upset but supportive and understanding of each other and we both agreed long distance/online was out of the picture and niether wanted  nor would allow the other to sacrifice their dreams. So we decided to break up and she finally moved out two weeks ago. 

Now normally their is this idea of a grieving period where someone should be mopey and depressed or hate their ex after a break up. Spend nights drinking or binging on something....but eh thats stupid. There is nothing to grieve about. We both were in love but understandingly split. Now we move forward with out own lives while staying friends. 

Well 4 days after she had left I was just having fun at a bar with friends and just happened to spark with another girl. We simply chatted, bounced off one another with teases and insults, shared banter and finally swapped info. We jokingly took snapchat photos with silly faces and sent it on our stories. Nothing malicious just good fun. The next day we went out again for a local art festival nearby and the night ended at her place with drinks and sex.

Heres the trouble. My ex that saw my snap story and other friends/family are calling me an asshole for moving on so quickly and “not considering her feelings”. That i was “showing off” and “obviously never cared for her”. My ex herself hasn’t mentioned anything and i havent brought anything up but apparently she cried for hours on the phone with a mutual friend. 

The thing is of course I love her, i still do but that doesn’t mean I should be depressed and stay at home. I went out and had fun then I met someone. It wasn’t malicious intent or hateful at all. Nor was it forced or rushed. So AITA? should I apologize like everyone says?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0d0vs	2019-06-13 23:30:23	Throwawayaitastepd	AITA for not letting my step daughter move back home?	"My 21 year old step daughter is diagnosed with bipolar disorder. As of last night, she is in the hospital again after going off her meds. Again.

Back story: The last time this happened a year and a half ago, we got her set up on meds, helped her with her programs, and let her live with us, after previously running away from both our home and bio-moms house. She stole from us, she liked to us, and ultimately was asked to leave, so she stayed with her another family member, whom she also stole from and eventually was asked to leave. My step daughter then moved 20 hours away because she ""hated us"" and we ""made her life miserable."". After two months, she came back, to be with her boyfriend here. She moved in illegally with him into dorm housing, got caught, and got kicked out. She then moved about 3 hours away from all her family, and moved in with her boyfriend's mom, which brings us to now. She had been taking her meds, but went off them. She quit her job, torched her school (figuratively), and became manic. Last night she stole their family car to check herself into a hospital. BFs mom says she doesn't want her living there anymore.

I have 2 other step children, tween years. Part of why we wouldn't let her back is the drugs, people to fuck, and bullshit she brought into our house. She did this at bio-moms house too. I am also now pregnant, so we are concerned about her around that child as well. At one point, she drugged our dog (with melatonin) when we were sleeping so he would not alert us, when she snuck literal strangers into our home to fuck them and get high with them!! 

Here's where the AITA part comes in. Her boyfriend's mom is DESTROYING us, telling me, bio mom, and husband that we are pieces of shit, that we don't do anything for our daughter, and that we are ultimately killing her. In my heart, I know we have tried everything, from trying to help with rent in a city closer to supports, setting up therapy for her, offering to go to therapy together, and even getting her extra VA benefits thru her dad (dad is military).
It's hard to know because I feel we are too close to the situation, so Reddit, I ask: are we the assholes for denying stepdaughter to come move back in with us? It's hard not to snap at the bfs mom, but we are all so burnt out.

Edit: UPDATE

Thank you all for your responses. As I stated a few times, I needed the feedback and a reality check to make sure we weren't out of line. I was vulnerable, and you were (mostly) kind.

I had a long conversation with BFs mom and she broke down and cried. She said she's scared shitless because she is afraid her son will be with my SD forever, and that she can't handle her. I educated her on bipolar disorder, and she was like, ""omg, lightbulb! That's her to a T!"". Ultimately, the plan is for SD to go back to BFs mom house and take her meds, attend her programs, and then start up school again (it's still salvageable at this point, but only as long as she's in her MH programs). If SD quits school, she is no longer welcome at BFs house, and we, all three parents, will get her into a transitional house or halfway house. All of us, including BFs mom, agree. So, I'll never be friends with the mom, but at least she can understand our position now.

Husband and I tried to conceive for nearly a year with no success. Turns out he has a genetic issue that could cause infertility after a certain age. Doctors say we could keep trying but I’m getting older (34) too and we don’t think it’s right to keep putting it off. 

We want to go with a sperm donor but this is where we disagree. I want to ask one of my best friends, because I’ve known him since we were kids and I trust his character 110%. Husband wants to go with a donor, which makes me uncomfortable because we’ll never get to meet this guy and know what kind of person he actually is. I don’t care about height or eye color or degrees or whatever. I just need to know that the ~~father~~ biological parent of my future children is a kind and upstanding person. 

My husband is freaking out over my suggestion because he thinks it implies I have feelings for my friend, which is so ridiculous I can’t even start. I told him my friend lives in another country halfway around the world and I see him as a brother, but I know and trust him which is the key difference between him and other donors. 

So now we’ve come to a standstill. Husband says 1000% no but I think he’s being extremely closed minded and negligent of my fears and anxieties. I know it’s a pride thing for him but I wish he could at least acknowledge my fears. I simply do not want to get pregnant then raise a child with the DNA of a stranger. Is that so unreasonable? AITA?

**EDIT** : To add a few more details, this friend of mine has been staunchly childfree since his teens. He would not be interested in being in our kid’s life as anything beyond a friendly distant family friend. 

But another reason I want to choose him is that I like the idea of the kid (after reaching adulthood) being given the choice of reaching out to his/her biological dad and knowing about him. My own father died when I was 6 and I’ve always felt like there was a hole in me even though I had very loving stepdads. There were aspects of my personality that I couldn’t explain that was dissimilar to all my halfsibs but everyone I met told me how similar I am to my dad, so I can’t help but feel like children should know the person who gave them half their DNA, even if they don’t call him “dad.”

**EDIT2**: Copying pasting a comment I wrote below:


Ok obviously everyone is getting really hung up over the word “father” which I should probably edit out. 

I DO NOT INTEND ON THIS FRIEND BEING A FATHER IN ANY CAPACITY. 

When I said father I probably should’ve said “DNA donor” because that’s what I meant. I don’t need this guy to be a dad because my husband would be all the dad our baby needs. All I’m saying is that it would be nice to know about our dna donor in a more personal sense, since our literal child will be half him genetically. And I will need to carry and give birth to this child on top of that.

I don’t feel comfortable with anonymous donors because I’ll never get to know them as people or as friends. I know that people are going to say “personality is how you raise them” and I agree to an extent but not completely. I think some traits are inheritable and there’s nothing that can change that. And I think it’s pretty naive to believe that personality traits somehow can’t be inherited but intelligence, physical attributes, illness, etc. can. 

Finally, with my first edit I only meant that it would be nice for our kid to eventually have the CHOICE of meeting his/her “dna donor.” I know there are some sperm banks that have this option but again, without knowing who the guy is very well, I wouldn’t feel comfortable letting my kid know a complete stranger."

c0d0di	2019-06-13 23:28:58	WoodenCounter4	AITA For Being Pissed at an Employee	"So, this all started a couple of weeks ago. I work in the hotel industry, and being understaffed is a pain in the ass. At the time, we were already working on a skeleton crew (upper management at the time was kind of a pain in the ass on hiring). 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, an employee of mine (we'll call her AD), asks if she can take about a week off. I'm not going to go into detail for various reasons, but it was very personal and it involved grieving and spending time with family. While a giant pain in the ass to cover for, I figured why not? I'd be an ass to deny her that for the sake of covering and it was overtime. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, during this week, another employee just  quits without notice. Thankfully, I remember AD is back in town a little earlier than expected. So, I call her, ask her if she can cover part of my shift so that I can cover the other employee's shift. She agrees, all is well. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Next morning arrives and she calls me, crying that she's frustrated and wants to take the day off cause she's still grieving. Again, because it'd probably be bad to have someone who's a crying mess work a customer service job, I decide to just give her the day off and work the shift myself. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, here's my thing. If she was still in such a state, I would have rather her just told me no than change her mind when I was already planning to do things. I'm pissed that she told me yes and then all of a sudden called crying that she needed more time just as I was about to head out of town. I have no intention of taking my frustration out on her or anything like that because that would be unprofessional and such, but AITA for being pissed off at her?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

But we were together for a year start of 2018- to the end of January 2019 and sometimes she’d get mail (like flyers from bath and bodyworks etc) come through to my place and I never really minded. 

That all changed when I walked in on her in MY FUCKING PLACE going ham on a guys dick. Obviously we broke up straight away and I was really mad and sad because I’d actually fallen halfway in love with this girl. 

She basically ended up stalking me complete with fake tears and promises she’d do better. I even went to the cops after I caught her skulking outside my sons elementary and they suggested I file for a RO If it got bad enough but I never did. 

Anyway, sometimes stuff still comes through in her name, not anything important as usually it’s cosmetics samples, brochures, etc. I always throw them straight in the recycling bag as I don’t ever plan on talking to her again. I used to send them back with a note saying she doesn’t and has never lived with me but it seems these companies don’t care or don’t listen cuz it still comes through, 

We broke up in January and she finally stopped calling me or waiting for me outside my house around April. It’s now June and I’ve not heard a word from her or hers except today when her mom sent me a Facebook message telling me that my ex wanted to come round my place to get all of her mail. I told her if she tried to come anywhere near me I’d call the cops and told her all her daughters mail was in the trash because she has NEVER lived at my place and there was no need for her stuff to be going there.

Ok to make a long complicated background story short, my family back in January of last year adopted my little sister (14) who is high functioning but is non-vocal and cannot do much of anything without help (going to the bathroom, etc.)
I would like to state that before we adopted her I was actually strongly against it, not because of her being who she is but because we were already struggling, at the time there was already 6 people and 4 dogs living in our house and plus all the fun things that come from so many people living under one roof. During this my parents made a promise since she was moving in I wouldn’t have to watch her at all and that my mom was quitting her job to be a stay at home mom. (Which wasn’t the point but okay)
Fast forward to now, I babysit her and sometimes they asked, sometimes they’d tell me, but mostly they won’t say anything about leaving until they were already gone and send a quick “Oh by the way!”
Today I had been arguing with my dad about who was going to get her up and ready next week for summer school, while him and my mom take a trip, but I had made plans to go camping, to which my dad lost his shit on me about how could I do this and what in the fuck was I thinking.
I asked why couldn’t my sister (25) watch her? Since Just recently my sister, her wife and my niece, plus their 2 dogs, moved in so now there are 10 people living in this house, and all but 2 of them are 18 and above. I said I would only be gone for 3 days, no more no less, so they wouldn’t even have to do it for the whole week. Nope, and now he’s just calling me a selfish asshole for not thinking about their plans!

We've been doing them for around a year now, and at each meeting we have pizza from a chain nearby our office. This requires one of us to order the pizza, pay for it, pick it up, and finally deal with the reimbursement process from the company. Not a big deal, but I volunteered to be the one to do it every week.

What I found out pretty quickly is that this chain restaurant offers rewards points for your orders, so every week I've been putting the order under my rewards account. These points essentially are free for me because the company I work for reimburses me for the cost of the pizzas (around $50). I've racked up quite a bit of rewards credit doing this.

No one else knew about this until today one of my coworkers saw me placing the order and got extremely angry with me and accused me of ""stealing"" from our company. Since I volunteered to get the pizzas and none of us are actually paying for them, I never saw it as a problem.

As such, we are prone to critters of all sorts in and around the house. I am terrified of pest bugs and rodents. Butterflies and squirrels are cool in my book, but brown bugs and rodents with long fleshy tails incite a gut reaction in me that leave me incapable. No matter how much I tell myself that they can't hurt me, they are more afraid of me than I am afraid of them, I can't stand to be near them and the thought of them darting around or flying in my face paralyzes me. And the thought of them in my house, hiding, watching, munching on my food, leaving their shit everywhere, probably crawling all over me and in my mouth while I sleep, keeps me awake at night. 

As such, anytime one such creature is spotted or captured I am helpless and call my boyfriend to take care of it. I am sure this is annoying, and I am grateful he does anything at all, but he will capture the pest and release it outside instead of whacking it with a magazine and being done with this. He reasons that they have a right to life, they just don't get to live it in our house (except for mosquitos, because fuck that). I think they have a right to life, but this is our territory, and the penalty for invading is death - otherwise they will return. 

Even with things that can hurt us, like wasps, he will merely evict them instead of spraying the shit out of the nest. I get being compassionate, I'm empathetic to a fault with most things but I am completely without mercy when it comes to pests. Fuck them. This is my home. And you can't tell me that seeing a daddy long legs dancing around on their long spindly legs doesn't creep you out and make you want to burn your house down.

I am obsessive about keeping things clean and not leaving anything out that might tempt anything to come inside and set up shop. But my boyfriend is less so, and he is prone to leaving unfinished plates, food scraps, crumbs, and open jars of peanut butter out everywhere, in addition to forgetting to close windows and doors, after I've gone to sleep or am gone for a day. 

I know pests are impossible to completely avoid, but he should respect that they make me paranoid and uncomfortable, the danger they pose health-wise, and that he owes me for luring them inside with his slovenly habits. 

I presented these arguments to him and he repeated that my fear is irrational, they can't hurt me, I have no reason to be afraid of them. Well yeah. I know porcelain dolls won't come to life and murder me (probably), but I'm not going to sleep in a room full of them. Fears are irrational, that's kinda the point.

c0cte9	2019-06-13 23:10:51	Snoopfernee	AITA for not tracking the wedding date of my wife’s cousin?	"My wife and I use a joint shared Google calendar to manage our schedules. Been using it at least 4 years for vacations, appointments, kid pickups, dinners together, happy hours, and travel events. She claims it was my idea to use this solution and honestly I don’t remember whose idea it was. 

This week, she asks me if I’m picking up the kids bc she has a dentist appointment. I had a late meeting and her appointment wasn’t on the calendar, but I picked them up. When I asked her about the calendar, she said she made it while we were on our family vacation, so she didn’t put it on there. 

Tonight, I ask her what weekend her cousin’s wedding is. It’s in two weeks, and of course it’s not on the calendar. We were supposed to leave the kids on Friday so we could have some alone time. Turns out I have a work event that Friday, which I mentioned and put on the calendar. So I am annoyed that I have to back out of the event, but obv the wedding comes first. But what pissed me off is that she said, since I was also invited and it’s my system, that I should have put it on the calendar. 

If she doesn’t want to use our system, then say something. But don’t abandon it without communicating, and def don’t blame me for not managing her cousin’s wedding date.

c0csc5	2019-06-13 23:08:02		AITA for telling my friend something her family asked me to keep a secret?	"This happened years ago & I've always wondered if I did the right thing here. I will be fudging some details bc I have no idea if my friend or anyone connected Reddits.

 
Context: when my friend was single, she moved home for a bit to save some money after school and lived with her immediate family again. When she moved out, she left some boxes intending to get them later.

 

Fast forward some years & we're planning her wedding. We're 6 months out and I'm meeting with her family (mom, dad, & grandma) to finalize things. We get to talking about relationships and how lucky my friend is to have found her fiance and the mom & grandma drop the bomb. Apparently when my friend moved out and left her boxes, her mom and grandma took it upon themselves to rifle through everything. School items, personal papers, but (IMO) the most damaging was an ""ex"" box, full of correspondence from her last long distance relationship and they read every last detail. Extremely intimate things (graphic letters, etc) that they then begin talking about to me in detail, in front of her dad (!!). I am so uncomfortable I tune out and nope TF out as fast as I can but not before they swear me to secrecy bc ""my friend can never know"". I just wanted to get the heck out so I agreed and left.

 

After, I thought about it and I was pretty upset they did this. They put me in a horrible position telling me this and then making me keep it private. Hindsight, I should have told her right away but her wedding was mere months out and I didn't want to potentially be responsible for family turmoil. I decide to keep it to myself and move on. About 6ish months after the wedding, I'm chatting on the phone with my friend. She mentions that her and her husband were considering moving back in with her family to save money for a house. The whole thing comes flooding back to me and I'm agonizing over the fact that this would be a Very Big Deal to me if I were in my friend's shoes. After some thinking, I decided to tell her. I explained I never meant to mention this to anyone EVER bc I didn't think it would ever become an issue. This would be a huge piece of information I would want if I were making this decision, not just for me but for my spouse who is entrusting his belongs to the space too. She wasn't surprised and said it was mostly her fault for leaving the boxes there in the first place. She thanked me for telling her. I warned that her mom was likely going to be upset with me for speaking up but she's my friend and my allegiance was to her & it felt wrong to keep it from her any longer considering the circumstances. I apologized for not saying anything sooner and explained how I was worried about causing problems for her wedding. Overall, we ended up fine. Our relationship wasn't affected, however her mom is, as anticipated, noticeably much cooler to me than before.

Ok, so Father’s Day is this Sunday and my (19 F) mom reminded me to get him a gift. I have pretty bad eyesight (and it’s been going down a quarter every annual check up) and I’ve been wearing contacts/glasses for about 7 years now. I had glasses and contacts both but haven’t had my glasses updated since. 

I asked at 15/16 to get new glasses because my prescription was no longer valid and I cannot legally drive without any contacts or glasses on. Sometimes I ran into issues with contacts ripping or becoming bad quicker due to high school swim season, so I often switched to my glasses to stay on track with my contacts (6 month supply) and not run through them. My mom said yes at first then told me to put the glasses on a pending order so she could go in to buy them for me. She never did.

I reminded her, until I had my first job and she decided I could pay for them myself. I was only making $250 or less every two weeks and had to pay for my own gas - and car maintenance that came with it like new windshield wipers or was an old car- High school swim stuff (swimsuit, goggles, caps which came out to $200~) and contacts (which are $55 out of pocket). I was going to until she made me cut back on hours and I only worked two days a week, cutting my paychecks. Along with her taking half my checks for “savings” - I never got to see where they went and she doesn’t like being questioned -. 

Now, same problem except I make a lot more money, which she still takes half of, leaving me with about $200 a week. I spend $120 on gas because my tank takes 40 to fill and I drive an hour round trip each day, and I’m in the process of paying for my summer classes and textbooks for college.  Meaning, I’ll have to save out of the amount she doesn’t take for monthly payments.  This freshmen year, I ran out of contacts by the end of spring due to scheduling issues, being 4 hours away, and that my insurance covers around the same time I’m due for annual check ups -AFTER the end of the school year. 

My glasses with insurance are $130, and I’ll have to slowly save up for it to not blow through a check and still cover other expenses.

I will admit I didn’t pay for the entire car myself - I only used about $3,000 of my own money (leftover from a loan I took out myself for school) and my parents were kind enough to help me with the rest. Because they paid the “majority” my mom thinks they don’t owe me anything when they sell it. I sort of get it, they paid for most and have been storing it for me, but I did use some of my loan money and I’m still paying off those loans to this day.

So my husband and I were having some problems and I decided to separate we just had a baby and idk if it's that or I'm beginning to see who he really is, (married for 2 yrs) 
However I've been noticing him being super aggressive with my 6yr old and her behaviour has drastically changed since my marriage. (She approved of him at first)

So anyways I've been in contact with my twin who was basically saying hes a narcissist yada yada which I do see, and she encouraged me to separate and come stay with her 

(We are very religious and we dont drink or smoke or any of that) - keep reading 

So anyways I get to my sisters house with nothing. First few days is stressful but okay. THEN she turns into someone I dont know. 
Shes arguing all the time calling my daughter raggedy (to her face) because shes mad at me. She knows we have no food but takes the most and leaves me an my daughter to scrap the rest. 
Then she called up her ex and moved him into the house (no job or nothing) and hes not even of our religion and is smoking and doing drugs(weed) and I try to pull her aside like hey.. what are you doing sis. And this makes her even more mad. 

When I spoke up for myself she said I was disrespectful to her and her home. Even though I did nothing. 

Honestly I walk on egg shells her and keep my 5month old and 6yr old cooped up in a room so she cant find any drama to start. 

Yesterday she was laid up with ex BF almost all after noon while her 6yr old and 3yr old wreaked havoc along the house causing me to have to watch them on top of my 2. (Which she normally forces me to watch them since I'm living here) 
I came to her room an said hey I watched ur children all afternoon and she said my children dont need to be watched this is THEIR house. And I said something smart (under my breath) and she heard me and came in my room an threw hot water all over me in front of my children. 
She triangulates the children barely takes care of them an her house is FILTHYYY. 
Also I spent all the money I had on her and gave her most of what I had. I gave her my last 100s cus her electric got turned off on the grounds that she not hide food because i didnt have anymore money to buy my own stuff and the very next moment she takes her food out the fridge and hides it in the closet. Mind you this is dairy products too.

Mind you I'm not judging her. Simply trying to understand what the hell is going on.

Fell for friend **A.** Some weeks of getting close to them an incident that was 100% my fault due to feelings happens, i keep my distance for about a week in part of sheer awkwardness, guilt and regret. Friend eventually knows this. Everything resets but is never quite the same. We stay close but a few months later friend makes the friendship almost exclusively on their terms. Topics, places to eat etc are always on their terms. I don't mind at first, figure company and friendship is genuinely nice apart from moments here and there . Things get worse to the point were i'm angry at how one sided everything is. This time i avoid friend for a week till eventually bringing it up. They refuse to see my perspective at all and in fact, verbatim goes and says ""i thought this was how the dynamic was from the beginning"". Angry, but realizing i don't want to end the friendship on bad terms due to job situation changing for both (moved around the company) i figure, wrong time to bring it up. I don't apologize but pretend everything is fine, friend **A** is initially baffled but quickly does the same and pretends the conversation did not occur.

We barely talk till the next week were from nowhere they put the most amount of effort ive seen since the first month or so we first became friends. This lasts for about 3 weeks. Long story short we get into the conversation of dating on a friday. From my perspective it was honestly only exploratory. I wasn't trying to push for the relationship to change but just figure out why two seemingly compatible people don't seem to have more, nothing else. Conversation does not end on a bad note but it does end. Next day an aspect of what was said is brought up, goes on into the morning which friend **A** does not feel like continuing. Immediately I change the topic to something very personal that we discuss for hours that had nothing to do with previous topics or conversations. Fast forward a few hours later and things get weird, i realize something is off. Next day friend **A** acts really off. I ask whats wrong, says nothing. After days of this i ask for a fourth time and finally they admit that the conversation friday has been bothering them so their immediate response was to avoid me but refuses to go further as to what, why etc. This same conversation gets brought up several times and each time the reasons slightly changes but adds more perspective. We argue about Friday but it never goes anywhere. They refuse to give more information and each time it gets close they refuse to talk about it. I'm left angry, confused and sad why months of friendship is suddenly going down the drain. If Friday bothered them so much why did they continue to act fine till sunday late afternoon?

c0cmbj	2019-06-13 22:52:04	ToPrie	AITA for refusing to pay half of the repair of my computer when one of my classmates spilled water on it because I had the water bottle nearby my computer?	"This happened about a month ago, I was in English class doing some work on my computer while drinking water from a water bottle on my left side, then a classmate on my right side told me to remove the label from the bottle and started doing so himself, in the process of removing the label, he accidentally (I think) pulled the bottle and spilled the water into my computer, then it immediately turned off. I don't know if this was intentional or accidental because, firstly, who would spill water on someone's computer for a prank?, and secondly, my friends told me he was laughing while I was trying to figure out what was going on.

&#x200B;

Later, we take my computer to the IT room and they told us they couldn't figure out what was going on exactly, but the computer will obviously need a repair, then he said he would pay for my computer's repair and that he had an uncle that repaired computers, so I gave my computer to him and he gave it to his uncle. About a week later he said his uncle started to repair my computer, so I relaxed thinking I will have it in a few weeks.

&#x200B;

This morning, my mother said that I would have to pay half of my computer's repair because the mother of the guy who spilled the water thought I should pay half of it because I had the water bottle nearby and I should learn to not do that, I thought that was stupid and I wouldn't pay 50% of the repair. Later, I told my friends and my father, they all also thought that was a very irrational decition, although my mother thinks it's reasonable. I understand her perspective, I had the water bottle nearby without the cap on and that permitted his son to spill the water, but I think 50% is a high price for me minding my business, I think he should pay the majority of the repair as he was the main cause of the damage in the first place."

so, I have a friend who is trans and bisexual. My town does a pride dance/party thing at the college nearby. It’s basically a festival, and people hang out and chill. I believe there’s also a drag show, plus food and drinks.

This friend asked me to go to support him. I would personality love to, but I know that it’s a common debate in the LGBT community if allies should go to pride or not. I’m also nervous because (and I’d hate to use this as an excuse) I have bad thoughts OCD and right now, I always get worry thoughts about me being racist or homophobic.

Today I also invited my other trans and experimenting friend to tag along, as I know he’d enjoy himself. I also offered a ride. 

The friend who invited me also told me that I didn’t have to go, and that I shouldn’t pressure myself. I do want to go but I’m taking it to reddit. 

I indeed feel better typing this out, but I still get nervous and I just wanted to know if it’s okay. I’d like to hear your opinions. Feel free to ask any questions.

&#x200B;

Would I be the asshole if I kept a dog I'm fostering even though the owner wants the dog back eventually, especially if they are a friend?

About a year ago my friend rescued this beautiful German Shepard but quickly found out he has some behavior problems. He has severe separation anxiety, can be fairly aggressive and tends to be a bit of a escape artist. My friend came to the conclusion that even though he loves this dog, he cant care for him due to living situation and not having enough time or even the knowledge of how to start training him. He was talking about bringing the dog to a shelter and surrendering him when as a last ditch effort I offered to take him in. We never set a time frame for how long I'd keep the dog because originally we planned to see how well he settled into my household and go from there. We expected it to be the same situation and eventually have to cave and take him in and surrender him anyways. 

I've now had this dog for about 6 months, where my friend had him for only 3 weeks, and hes striving here. He gets along with my other pets, I have more time for him and more ability and experience with larger and more aggressive dogs. He has come along way from the scared timid dog he use to be and is truly happy here. In all honesty I've fallen in love with this dog. My friend still believes that he will move out into his own house within the next year, honestly doubtful as he is still in school, and will be taking the dog with him. I know he truly loves this dog, I can see it when he comes over and how he talks about him and future plans for the two of them but I don't know if I can let him go.  I want to sit down with my friend and explain to him that since his dog is doing great here, gets along with my other pets and because of his separation anxiety I think it would be in his best interest if I adopted him. I know he wont take it well and no matter the answer it might ruin our friendship.

c0cjoh	2019-06-13 22:45:11	Jasmine3186	AITA For Not Wanting To Spend Time With My Sister	"So my younger sister is 20 and moved out of the family home and in with her boyfriend at the start of the year. 

Both of them didn't finish school. 
Both of them don't have jobs.
Both of them don't have car licences. 
Both of them just smoke weed at home all day. 

I have tried to help my sister many times in the past.  I helped make an application to a course that would have helped her have a finished education and open up new opportunities in both work and study. She got accepted and then never went.

 I was a manager at a McDonald's where my sister used to work but quit. I repeatedly asked the hiring manager to take her back (my sister said she wanted to work again) and eventually he did, just for her to not show up to some shifts, walk out on others and ended up getting fired. As 
I was the one who got her re-hired as well as her sister, I got a lot of shit from the other managers and crew for it. She knew this and just didn't care. 

My dad tried to teach her to drive and she wouldn't listen, which meant she drove dangerously and my dad would of course flip and my sister would have a hissy fit and just get out of the car and walk off. 

My mum is constantly doing things for her and her boyfriend, giving them money, helping them with financial stuff in general, making and taking them to appointments. She knows she shouldn't but doesn't want to have my sister ignore her, like she currently does with my dad and I. 

She said twice that she was going to visit us for a weekend and both times wasn't feeling well last minute. We all know she's lying and has just been too lazy to leave the house. 

She has always put friends before family and even did this with a past boyfriend which didn't end well, which she clearly hasn't learnt a thing from. 

Occasionally she'll message me, pretending like nothing is wrong and I either won't  respond or my messages will be fairly blunt which results in arguments. 

I love my sister and just want her to have a good future. But she won't accept help (unless its help like my mum gives her which is just everything being done for her) and we can't even talk about these things because she'll have a fit. I mean a  breaking things and hitting people kind of fit. 
I would love to talk to her and spend time with her but I can't just ignore all the bad shit she does and how she won't have a good future. 

I WANT to be close to my sister, but I just feel like I can't.  I feel like I'm pretending to like her.

She live over 2 hours away, and me and her talk on the phone almost every day. I have interacted with her father, Mr. Bob, a number of times. He's a good guy, but there are a number of...personality differences we have that rub against each other just a bit. I've mostly kept quiet because if there's no need to disagree, then I let things slide. 

One of these things is that I've started searching for a job after graduating college. He has decided that it is his mission to push me to find one. I find his methods...outdated, but I go along with what he tells me for the most part because there's no harm, only annoyance. However, it seems like it's all he wants to talk about. On the only time I got to face chat with her in the last week, he interrupted our conversation to ask me about my job search, and to tell me that no matter how many places I applied to it wasn't enough, and here's another website to try. The next day when he interrupted our phone conversation and asked me how the website had helped, he seemed to think I was incompetent because it hadn't gotten me a job *instantly*. As it now stands, golem.network hasn't helped me at all.

Over the past few days I had to accompany my mother to my grandmother's place a few states over so my mom could make end-of-life decisions for her. I didn't know grandmother that well, but I had to care for my mom who was all over the place emotionally. So...stressful.

At the end of the third day I'm talking to the GF when she said Mr. Bob wanted to talk to me. She knows how I feel about him and the job search. I said that I was tired so, sorry, but no.

&#x200B;

He called me today and told me I had been disrespectful by refusing to talk to him, my elder, when he wanted to talk, that it is my scriptural duty to respect my elders (we're all Christian in this story), and saying I didn't have time for him was wrong. I told him I was sorry that *he felt offended*, but I refuse to apologize for something that (I think) I didn't do. Scripturally for my brothers in Christ, and in general for everyone else here, AITA here?

&#x200B;

P.S. He told me that he had been calling to ask about my spiritual welfare during the time of taking care of my mom. So he wasn't piling on about the job again."	Not the A-hole	0	0	3.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

c0chwk	2019-06-13 22:40:37	what-a-to-do	AITA? I don't want to visit father in law or have him to our property after he was injured at our house and subsequently blamed my daughter and myself	"The background: 
father in law has always played too rough with my kids, imo.  I, as well as my parents, husband, mother in law often have to tell him to take it down a notch. He does not intend to hurt them but I'm uncomfortable with very boisterous wrestling etc. And feel it leads to someone becoming hurt.
The incident: 
Father in law is visiting and gets kids too riled up, I suggest we take it outside to birm off extra energy as it's too much for the house (and me). I get the kids swinging on our backyard playset. Out comes father in law
 He sits in one swing, reaches for my son (4) on the side bar who he said was going to fall,  but just then my daughter (6) charges at him knocking him backward to the ground. Father in law injures his back and goes to dr for pain medicine. He returns home and misses some work, requires physical therapy and is worried he will need surgery or never recover. We, obviously, feel terrible an accident has occured and offer condolences and concern. He asks us to look onto our house insurance coverage. It is determined that a claim of assault would cost us $600 in losing our no claim insurance discount and we agree if needed he should use it, that's what its for. Luckily, he recovers fully with no surgery and he resumes physically helping brother in law with house renovations and attends ski trips etc
 We are happy hes fine.
The fall out:
We travel to spend Christmas with them about 8 months after the incident, gifts are exchanged, a good time is had. As we pack to leave, father in law asks husband for money to cover his initial dr visit etc and"" jokingly ""says otherwise he'll press to the insurance. We are surprised but pay him with a check. Then, he and mother in law both take the money but simultaneously insist they dont need the money, and it isn't about the money. They just wanted to issue a 'wake up call'. They reveal they blame my daughter and I for causing the accident because I failed to make it clear that the rough housing was over.
To me, the wake up call is that the inlaws have always been ""run of the mill"" judgemental of my parenting and out of touch with young kids
And the fact that they cannot stop playing immediately. (My kids get unsolicited compliments all the time for being sweet, well behaved etc)
Husband and I expressed that as a result of their taking money they didn't even need as a wake up call I will not spend time around  father in law without husband there. this will limit the potential for visits. And I think he should not be welcome back to property. I personally do not want to go visit their new house but husband wants to take kids and go. I think they should apologize first but won't stop husband from taking kids to the visit. AITA???"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

"So essentially my best friend  (16 F) has been dating her boyfriend (18M) for just shy of a year and she was absolutely smitten . They briefly split about a month ago as they were both heading in separate ways at the end of the year (her to our sixth form and him to university) and they wanted to end it on good terms. Essential he ended it with her and she was in tatters and I hated seeing her like that. Long story short they made up; its relatively important to note that I was very supportive during this period and spent upwards of an hour together  every day and it was unbearable to see her like that. 
Their relationship has always been steady but I had always had my doubts about him as I know he had never been loyal in a relationship and had never been a ‘relationship guy’. 

During the last month she has developed a close friendship with one of my relatively good mates- to give u a little background he is very similar to my but quite horrible to a lot of people. He is very arrogant and often walks into rooms and tells people how ugly they are. I have seen how horrible he is to people and warned her of this fact although she dismissed it as he wasn’t like This around him. My fears of this friendship was confirmed as he began to tell me and a group of mates embarrassing factors of her life and openly criticise her actions. I hate the thought of her having to pick in of us so I chose to say nothing; I am more than willing to admit that this was a poor decision.

Well now it has come out that during the time that they had been split the week that they had been split he had been intimate with someone else and she broke up with him as he had lied previously about this. Any way to bring it back to the issue I found this out today from someone else and that she had spent the day with the other mate (egoman). This honestly broke my heart as I knew how upset she would be and it honestly breaks my heart that she feels I’m not the right one to help her out.

We reach the gates, I let him in and as I’m walking away, I see from the corner
of my eye that a bus driver that was near the gates started giving shit to the kid. I went back and told the kid to go, that I’ll manage.

It's always a little weird when you have to buy items like these, and there's always that elephant in the room when you go up to the register. I appreciate when cashiers don't make comments and keep it professional in these situations.

so anyway, I go up to the register to buy these items, and the jovial black guy says something like ""well hello, looks like you'll be having a good time tonight!!""

He looks at me, I seem like a chill dude, and he expects me to laugh along with him. In the spur of the moment, I decided to give him a death stare and totally kill the mood for him.

I can tell that his failed attempt to make a joke really embarrassed him. He started to sulk and frown and stopped joking with his coworkers. Then I thought to myself, damn it wasn't really that big a deal. I didn't want to ruin his mood or anything. In reality I wasn't as offended as my death stare let on. Maybe a 2 out of 10 on the offended scale.

the first thing that threw me off was her (16f) saying “i like black boys... i don’t like black girls though.” this happened because we got lost while going to the library and i saw a black man walking by and asked for some help. he helped us before leaving and she said the guy is cute. i agreed and asked if she likes black boys. she said, “yeah, i like black boys. i don’t like black girls though.”

she is bisexual so i guess (?) that’s why she felt the need to say that. but was it really necessary to say you don’t like black girls if nobody said anything about them? i specifically asked if she likes black boys so i didn’t really know how to take it. i didn’t say anything but i definitely started feeling annoyed by her. i can’t really explain my annoyance because it’s not like i like her or anything, i just feel that comment was uncalled for and a bit rude.

last week we had a heated discussion about abortion and being forced. this left me angry for a few days so i avoided her. we started talking again and she didn’t really say anything wrong for a day or two. things were going well until the other day. i don’t know how we got on this topic because she said this out of nowhere, but she said, “mexican girls have gray vaginas. like a dark gray.” i really didn’t know what to say so i just wasn’t really saying anything. and then she said, “i’ve never seen a black girl’s vagina and no offense, but i don’t think i want to. it’s just not my thing.”

this also made me mad. why is she shaming women’s bodies in the first place? i’m trying to think of ways to maybe see her pov but i can’t. she has been saying really messed up things lately and i don’t know how much more i can handle. i haven’t really talked to her since and i don’t think i will. it also doesn’t help that a guy was just body shaming her private area, and i defended her. she was also saying it’s wrong to body shame and she’s basically doing the same thing.

yesterday i tried talking to her and telling her i am starting to think she’s racist. at first she was getting defensive and saying she’s not racist and that she’s fucking a black guy right now. but then she started saying she was raised by racists. then she started trying to call me racist. then she pretty much said that racism isn’t bad anymore because blacks are now able to sit on benches with white people. she said, “back then you would’ve got your ass killed.”

i am now stuck again. she’s a cool person but the things she has been are so messed up. i’m really angry but i’m trying my best to see her pov, it’s just all seeming fucked up no matter how i flip it.

WIBTA for dropping her?

i feel like some of you think i feel she should be attracted to black girls, which i don’t. we all have our preferences and that’s okay. i just didn’t think it was necessary to say that since i never mentioned black girls. and the way she said it just seemed a little rude, that’s all i’m saying."

We usually order food through the Favor app. When using Favor you can pay for your items and tip as soon as your driver has the items or at any point after delivery.

I always wait to pay until after delivery due to having in the past paid before delivery for items that never showed up. When that happens you have to go through a whole process with the company to get your money back. I usually tip between 15-20% based on how far the driver had to go, time of day, etc.

Well, after my delivery driver picked up our food he immediately texted me and said ""You can tip online before I get to the house""

This instantly pissed me off. Maybe it shouldn't have, but it made me feel really insulted. I get that they are working for tips and whatever they get paid by the app, but I find it extremely rude to basically beg for a tip on a service that has yet to be rendered. 

I ended up tipping the driver 10% when I normally tip 15-20% and let him know that the tip comment bothered me.

She found a convo where I sent a unsolicited picture and basically embarrassed me right there and then in front of everyone calling me a pervert and such.

I got mad and exposed her saying she's a slut that cheats on every guy she dates including the one she's dating now. Her boyfriend was there and broke up with her shortly after and all my friends are telling me I should say sorry to her. Some of my friends aren't even talking to me after I exposed her.

Like really... she can embarrass me like that and get everyone to laugh but I can't?

I know I shouldn't be sending unsolicited pictures but it was clear to me that the girl I was talking to wanted it, even if she didn't ask for it. Am I the asshole?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

The first time she dropped the dog off she scoped out the house and told us we had a nice backyard that her dog would like since he lived in an apartment. Every-time she would drop the dog off she brought food and supplies that the dog needed. In early May she said she was leaving town to go to IOWA.  But this time when she dropped the dog off she didn’t bring any food with her. She didn’t bring anything but the dog and his leash. Days turned into weeks and eventually it turned into a month. She didn’t call to once to check in on the dog nor did she call and offer to provide food for the dog. My brother finally heard from her yesterday and it turns out she didn’t go to Iowa she moved to another apartment in town. Now she is saying she wants the dog back. I don’t want to give the dog back because I have been taking care of the dog. He’s a big dog who needs to eat a lot and I’ve provided his food while she was gone. I walk him multiple times a day and enjoy spending time with him. Also he has a sensitive stomach and has got sick  during his stay. I bought him probiotics, anti diarrhea medicine, and aspirin and was able to nurse him back to health. He also had fleas and I bought him flea shampoo and medicine and got rid of the fleas. The dog is very attached to me now and won’t leave my side. He is also very attached to the other dog we have at home. I don’t want to give the dog back because I feel like she wasn’t worried about her dog if she dropped him off with nothing but a leash. BUT if compensated he will be given back with no problem. AITA??


EDIT:
Arizona (the state I live in) has a 6 day rule which is a law that says for liability reasons, you are the owner after keeping an animal for 6 days consecutively.  I will ask her to compensate me hopefully it goes well.. because if she does pay me I WILL GIVE THE DOG BACK WITH NO PROBLEM!!!!!!

c0c6gx	2019-06-13 22:12:00		AITA for wanting to drop a class that my parents paid for?	"First time reddit user, I’m just very frustrated and needed some unbiased feedback.

To some up the background I ended up missing 3 weeks of a college class because I got the dates mixed up. I’m a very good student and haven’t gotten a C or less in a class ever.  So me forgetting a class like this is very unusual.

My professor said I could make up the work but theres a catch. I had to do all three weeks of math class in one week while I’m on vacation. I did the math and in order to finish on time, I’d have to do 148 math problems a day for my vacation. It’s my graduation gift to me, and I already have other homework I need to work on besides that.

My other option is to withdraw and lose the $750 my parents spent on the class. I offered to pay them back the money they’re losing but they said no. (To clarify I have several scholarships that add up to $4,000 for next semester plus a $1,000 I saved up myself. My parents just paid for my summer classes.)

I tried to talk to them about my concerns and got two reactions. 1. My mom yelled at me for even thinking of withdrawing. 2. My dad laughed at me and told me that our family doesn’t give up like that. In the end they told me I didn’t have to try but they’d be very upset at me for taking this lying down.

I have severe anxiety issues that I’ve been working on recently, but this situation sent me over the edge. I’ve been stressed non stop since I found out about it all, had my first serious anxiety attack in years, and overall am not doing well mentally. Again like I mentioned I have another class I have to work on, and I work 20 hours a week on top of it all. I don’t think I can squeeze it into my schedule. 

I don’t want to let my parents down about it all and make them waste 750$ (they won’t let me pay them back.) But when even thinking about doing 138 math problems a day on my vacation I get extremely anxious and teary eyed. I don’t like to give up, but this seems so daunting towards me. I just wish I could pay my parents back and focus on work and my other class.

"For the past year I’ve had to endure sleeping in the same room as a buzz-saw. Whenever I suggested maybe something should be done about the snoring, it was the same response: I’m probably imagining or exaggerating it because nobody else ever heard him snore.

So I did what I enjoy doing best. Recorded the ‘mysterious’ snoring sound and turned it into an ’80s style movie theme track.

I thought a few people could share my burden of listening to the snore and also give him a giggle.

What I didn’t expect was the hundreds of listeners on day one to turn into thousands by day two.

I broke the news about the song to him by presenting him with a certificate once the track passed 30,000 streams. At last count, across all platforms it was nearing 50,000 streams and counting.

Luckily for me we share the same sense of humor, so he’s been awake most nights refreshing the song stats page.

c0c5lt	2019-06-13 22:09:55	NYG140	AITA for using my sisters toilet paper?	"I'm currently out of state staying at my parents house for a project for work. My parents live elsewhere, only my sister lives here full time. It's been just me and her for the past few days, we work opposite schedules so we barely see each other.

Her complaints started around day two that I shit too often (2-3 times a day, I'm a 6'2 male, 275 pounds who had his gallbladder removed). She only stocks about four rolls of toilet for the three bathroom house. She accused me of using up all her toilet paper. She also said I have a terrible diet (not untrue) and something is seriously wrong with me for having to take 2-3 shits a day. She accused me of using up all her toilet paper and demanded that I pickup a pack after work and bring it home for her. Total toilet paper usage after a week, about 3 rolls. After a few days she has begun hiding the toilet paper from me, for her use only.

Now, I can easily pickup some extra TP at the store, but I feel like she is just being so utterly petty about this that I want to dig my heels in and refuse. I can't imagine a scenario where I would demand a guest in my home bring extra toilet paper no matter how much they used, it would just be a non issue and I can buy more. If the situation was reversed and my sister was at my home, she would be welcome to use at much TP as necessary for as long as possible.  But then again, maybe I'm not a guest, because it's really my parents house and I have as much of a right to be here as her? So then I should provide my own toilet paper and not infringe on her supplies?

AITA for using the toilet paper? Should I buy her replacement rolls?

&#x200B;

EDIT: So after reviewing some on the comments on here, I understand that it is my responsibility to replace the TP I use. I get that and it make sense. I guess my stubbornness related to HOW this was addressed. Her exact words the first time this came up were ""I don't know what the fuck is wrong with your digestive system but don't come back home from work without any toilet paper"". While I agree she is correct in principle, I'm just pissed about the way she handled it, which may be out of the scope of AITA."	Asshole	0	0	340.0	23.0	0.0	0.0

I also play cello. Our school has a very large orchestra and some very talented students.

About a month ago I joined the orchestra and I have also been very involved in music within the school and the music teachers all like me. I have done grade 3 on the cello and me and my mom were looking at  new instruments and found a famous manufacturer that had a program where if a child was in a school orchestra then you could get 20% off of a cello. My mom and I both thought that this was great and without me knowing she emailed my teacher to ask. After it was sent I read it over and my mom comes off very cold in it so I mentioned this to her and about how I thought it seemed like she was making me go to orchestra to weasel an expensive instrument out of our struggling school as I’ve only been going for around a month. She laughed at me and I feel like she isn’t really taking in my concerns.

I feel like she hasn’t considered the fact that she came off a bit bad in the email, that the school is strapped for money and that I have to interact with the teachers and that I have been trusted by them and that it seems that she is using them and me. 
I love my mom and I know that she isn’t using any of this for her own gain but I’m just a bit annoyed that she has made us look like we are taking advantage of the school. I have told my brother and he thinks that I’m in the wrong for making a big deal out of this. We could pay for the cello without the discount.

Sorry I suck at writing so this is a bit messy 😕

I think that a-hole is a bit of a strong word for this situation so Reddit am I making a mountain out of a molehill or am I in the right?

Ok, so tiny bit if backstory...I mow lawns for a living as a one woman crew. As I'm sure you can imagine, it's very exhausting work. When I get home from work, I try to lay down for a little while to regain some energy to finish my day as a mom and wife. 

Well, we have this little neighbor girl that likes to play with my daughter. We have had issues in the past about her running to knock on our door without an adult with her. She's been told many times that this is not allowed. I've taken her home many times to her grandparents' surprise....they didn't give her permission and didn't know she was here. 

Today, after a particularly hard day/week for me.... there's a knock at the door. I ignore it because I'm not expecting anyone, and we are trying to rest. They knock again and then again and again for at least 5 minutes with short pauses in between. Like I said, we were trying to rest, so I am very upset by this point. I get out of bed and look out the window, it's the little girl from nextdoor! I open the front door and very sternly yelled at her ""If you knock on someone's door and they don't answer after the second time, you stop knocking! Banging on my door is very rude! Go home, now!""

I was dating someone for a few months and she broke up with me. The next day she was back on the dating apps. I wrote her letter about how manipulative she was to me and delivered it when I brought her her things back. She immediately blocked my phone number and all social media. 

Throughout the time we were dating, she had a friend who clearly wanted to date her. After we broke up, she got together with him for a short time and they broke up. Same thing happened. He wrote her a text about how manipulative she was, and she immediately blocked his number and all social media. 

I know this because he and I have become friendly recently, bonding over what happened with this woman.

c0c3ev	2019-06-13 22:04:28	heyuiuitsme	AITA - I insult my coworker on Reddit becuase I know she reads it	"I work in a small office with just five people. Three are in their own offices, and the other I share a common area. My common area coworker is not a Reddit user, however it became clear to me that she had some information that she wouldn't know about me any other way. 

I do have a real life stalker, who've I've complained about at work mulitiple times. My coworker could have only gotten this information from someone who is stalking me. Then, last week my stalker gave my coworker my user name and my coworker spend the better part of two days reading every post and comment I ever made. While at work, mind you. 

First of all, I am in no way ashamed about my past, which is what the majority of my posts are about. However, before I realized that my coworker openly communicated with my stalker, I did post a comment on a rant post specifically about her. When I did not realize she would read it or know about it. Just an anonymous rant about a coworker posted on a site she doesn't use. It was after that I realized she did have access to rants about her, but not the rest of it. Just based on her snide comments. 

After I realized she was, in my opinion, invading my privacy and probably telling my stalker stuff about me, I started insulting her on Reddit. Today is my day off and I told a friend about it, also not a Reddit user, and the friend said it was kinda mean. However, my coworker isn't exactly the easiest person to deal with. She's extremely petty. Often complains about me to the manager about things that I didn't actually do, or sometimes tells me to do something a certain way, then reports me for doing it wrong. She's also makes it a point to call me out on a mistake, loudly, in front of guests or representatives from other companies. If confronted, she acts like a victim or denies it happened. So, I feel kinda justified insulting her knowing she'll maybe read it later and get her feelings hurt. I just feel like she shouldn't be reading what I post on anonymously on my off time. 

Am I the asshole for insulting my coworker, knowing she reads it. Maybe this, maybe not. She only seems to do it while we're at work, and we're closed for the day.

Update - I wasn't going to update this, but now there's more. I found out my coworker was in fact stealing. I gathered up the evidence of the theft and told our manager. Then, I was fired for being vindictive. No joke. Fine, whatever. I'll just look for another job, no big fucking deal - keep a thief. 

Then, today I was at the grocery store and ran into a vendor that sometimes came into the office. They informed me that coworker had told them that I quit. Just left them in the lurch and poor baby coworker was stuck doing my job. Told them I'd found another job and just left without a notice. Lies, just all lies to make herself look victimized. But, also it hurts my reputation. I still have to find a job. These ""vendors"" are very valuable contacts for me in that regard, and she seems to be intentionally hurting my chances at finding another job. And, this is not the first I've heard of this. She has also called other people who work in our industry and spread rumors about me. At this point, I think coworker has ventured from meer assholelyness to lawsuit territory."

"My roommate and I have been living in a ground level apartment for over a year and we have consistently had issues with insects and bugs since day 1 due to the woods behind our unit and being on the ground level. Our apartment is kinda crummy but it’s cheap so you get what you pay for and management has “done all they can do” regarding the issue.  

We have been spraying the same all natural pesticide that is  “child and pet safe” since we’ve been living here with no complaints from any of our neighbors. It’s not a particularly chemically smell more herby and minty.  

I was spraying outside a few weeks ago and didn’t realize my elderly neighbor was on his patio above me.  I’ve met him before and he is always very friendly and I always offer to assist him with taking his trash out and carry groceries up the stairs for him. We chatted before and he’s always been polite and has never mentioned any orders or complained about us once. 
That day while I was showering he came down and yelled at my roommate for spraying “whatever you’re spraying” and proceeded to yell about “all the other smells coming from you (us)”.  I personally don’t know what he’s referring too but I know one of our neighbors smokes in their unit so that might be it. 

We’ve stopped spraying cause during his rant he stated that it hurt his lungs but like I said he’s never had a problem with it for the year and a half we’ve been here. The last few days I’ve had to deal with ants in the kitchen, spiders in the rooms and this morning there was a centipede in my bed.

c0c19t	2019-06-13 21:59:25	PlainJessGlory	"AITA for ""betraying"" my best friend of 20 years?"	"First marriage, no kids. Best friend, Jane, and her husband, John, got in a drunken altercation that led to him calling it quits on their 2 year marriage. 

The past month my husband and I have spoken with or physically been there for Jane daily. Going to lawyers, doctor's appointments, movies, swimming, tennis, breakfasts, lunches, dinners; literally any and everything to show support.

John voluntarily moved from their shared home. Has refused counseling or conciliation, won't speak or meet with Jane face to face. Instead has tried to establish all the terms of divorce through text messages. Leading to him constantly harassing Jane, who hasn't been a saint in this either, with texts at all hours.

Jane had an Order of Protection served. John contested the order. Jane asked me to come as a witness to show support in keeping the order through the divorce.

This was my final statement to the court, to show where I'm at with this all: ""Divorce is a deeply emotional and unsure time for those involved. Both (Mr&Mrs) hold valuable positions in our community, that they are completely dedicated to. (Mr) a K9 border patrol agent, (Mrs) a social worker. It would be a great loss to our community if either of these individuals were afforded an opportunity to act in a manner unbecoming their true character, out of anger, fear, or otherwise. For the protection of both parties and security of their positions in the jobs they are passionate for, it is, my humble request, in the best interest of both parties, that the Order of Protection remain valid through the dissolution of (Mr&Mrs) marriage.""

Judge granted the continuation of the order.
Jane and I were given a 5 minute ""head start"" to the parking lot. The municipal court in this town has a small parking lot. We were still standing outside the car when John came out. 

John could have exited without driving by, but in an attempt to talk to me he drove near us. With the window up waved me over. I motioned for him to go, he rolled down the window. Jane pinned me against the car and screamed, ""no don't talk to him!"" 

To make him leave faster, and avoid ""hanging himself"". I yelled, ""John you need to leave, just call me if you must!"" He drove away. (I've had no contact with and had/have NO intention of communicating with John)

I followed Jane as she ran to the police station to report John's violation. She listed me as a witness. I had to make a statement. I mentioned understanding Jane's percieved threat, but stressed John was attempting to speak with me and that I essentially threw him a ""hail Mary pass"".

Jane refuses to speak to me. I have ""betrayed her."" John was arrested for his violation and may now definitely lose his job. 

I feel no shame in my attempts to salvage any shreds of decency from this nightmare, for both their sakes; although it may cost me a 20 year friendship.

I feel like this whole wedding process he hasn’t shown that much interest (he’s not a planner) so for him to all of a sudden feel so strongly, especially negatively, really hurt my feelings. Then, he sees that I’m obviously upset and flips out.

I’ve grown tired of this because it makes us have to wake up early in the morning to get everyone ready so she can meet him but also adds an extra half hour to when I get out of work and just want to come right home and relax since we do the running around after work all week. My wife asked me today if I could have a coworker pick me up in the am so she didn’t have to leave so early to meet him. I told her she shouldn’t be meeting him at all and that he should drop her off/ pick her up from our house since it’s HIS day with her. Amita?		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We never really got along; he (and my grandma, if we're being honest) belittled me a lot when I was growing up and made it obvious he preferred my sister over me.  In addition to that he was very racist and homophobic, which is not something I agree with or condone.  

I'm sorry he's gone for my family's sake, but honestly I never saw in him what they do.  To them he was perfect and could do no wrong.  And when my mom calls him perfect and I don't immediately agree she gets very upset with me.  It's not like I sit and point out what a terrible person he was, but I just honestly can't agree that he was perfect.

So my question is, am I the asshole or I am justified in staying quiet?  I don't like upsetting her, but it also kinda hurts that she never stood up for me when I was young."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0bxvu	2019-06-13 21:51:14		AITA for ditching a friend	"Hopefully misleading title. 

Me and some friends are going to the springs for a friends birthday. The springs are a middle ground for us as we don’t all live in the same town. My fiancée and I were going to drive down with a friend who does live in town with us. However, due to some reservations we can’t stay at the campground we were hoping to stay at for just the one night. My fiancée and I like to camp so we decided to make this negative into a positive and turn the trip into a weekend long camping trip. 

Now comes the maybe asshole part. I drive a small hatchback and with all our camping gear only two people can fit in the car. So we told our friend he’d have to drive himself but could totally camp with us (he has no camping gear, no problem). His car runs fine he’s just always looking for a free ride. 

The main reason I don’t feel bad/am not sure if I’m an asshole is because he’s cheap and also somewhat lazy. He always assumes someone else will figure out the plans and he can just worry about himself. If we’re drinking he shows up with just a 6-pack then starts drinking everyone else’s stuff.

c0bxk3	2019-06-13 21:50:30		AITA for watching videos while I work?	"In my previous internship, I had a cubicle. Since it was my own private enclosed space, I would watch videos (and even full movies sometimes) or spend hours browsing Reddit and no one would give a shit as long as I got my work done (which I did). That internship was unpaid, if it matters. My manager loved me and gave me a good recommendation letter at the end.

Then there is my current internship. I don't have my own cubicle. Instead, there is an open space for everyone to work. I share a large table with the other interns. This internship is paid.

Like my previous internship, work does take priority here. I don't stop working altogether just to watch a movie or a video. Instead, I watch videos while I work. Some people work better while listening to music and I work better (in this internship) while watching videos. Some YouTubers put insanely good music and others just have nice commentary. Listening to them really keeps me motivated and keeps me in the right groove.

My manager sent me an email earlier today. He said I've been doing a good job with my work and that I respond to his critiques fast. 

His  compliment is, in part, due to me watching videos. Again, I don't stop working altogether just to watch videos. Instead, I work and watch/listen simultaneously - similar to those who work while listening to music - and it works out well.

However, my manager also said my video watching has been a distraction to other interns (he hadn't noticed me watching videos, but the other interns in my table apparently had). But here's the thing: I wear headphones, I don't make noise, and I get work done. 

To be honest, if other interns wanted to watch videos or even play a game while working, I would be fine if they didn't make noise. 

Why should they care about what I am doing if I am not making noise and especially if I am getting work done? If anything, this shows that they are not paying undivided attention to their work.

Watching videos keeps me focused on my work. I have missed out on a lot of intern gossip which would have in fact made me distracted.

So, AITA? 

If I am, should I start watching the videos on my laptop instead of my phone? Maybe me picking up my phone every few minutes once one video is complete to search a new one could be a nuisance. 

The downside of watching videos on my laptop would be that instead of the video being flat on my desk and only in my view on my tiny phone, it would now be visible on the big laptop for everyone who walks by me to see, but I'll figure some way to make the video visible only on a small part of the entire screen so I could continuously multitask like before."

I had NO idea this was a special thing because my other coworkers who have gotten married through our store got the same discount.

c0bsik	2019-06-13 21:38:48	Helloiamabaguette	AITA for telling my best friend to stop speaking a language that no one can understand ?	"My best friend (let’s call her Hannah) and I just got into a fight some minutes ago. 

We were texting on a group chat with another friend (that we will call Dave), and since our exams are coming up in a week, Hannah said that she had to stop texting us to study. She always has amazing grades, but she almost never studies, so Dave teased her by saying that he did not believe her. 
Then, she started speaking in Dioula (it’s a language commonly spoken in Burkina Faso, and since she was born here, and then migrated to our country, she speaks it very well. She often speaks it around us so we can’t understand what she is saying, and it really annoys me because, what is the point of saying something if no one can understand what you are saying ??). And tbh, I shouldn’t have reacted that way, it was pretty insensitive, especially since I know her origins are *extremely* important to her, but I told her it was annoying having her speaking in Dioula because no one could understand what she was saying. 
She then said « I’m not even responding to that », and my stupid ass thought she was joking, and as someone who has a very bad sense of humor, I just answered « Well, you just did ». 
She then stopped responding and the conversation went on with Dave about something that had nothing to do with Hannah. 

An hour later, she finally answered :
« (my name), if you think that’s funny, you are mistaken because it is not. You absolutely have no need to talk to me in such a way ». Dave then told her to chill and she just answered « Fuck you ».


On the one hand, I do think I was pretty insensitive, I shouldn’t have told her to stop speaking in Dioula. But on the other hand, I feel like she really gets mad over nothing, and I just wanted to tell her that it was frustrating to have a conversation with someone who will always randomly start speaking in a language that nobody can understand. 

What do you think ? AITA for telling my best friend that it was annoying having her speaking in a foreign language ?

So me and my friend are partners in an end-of-year spanish assessment that is essentially a spanish conversation about traveling recorded on an iPad. Anyway me and my amigo ask to go outside in the hall as it is quite loud inside the classroom with all our classmates talking, our teacher says sure. We then head outside and sit in the hall slightly away from the class and we begin our conversation (bit of context: we record on an app called notability and there is one rule set by our teacher which is don't pause the recording and continue, we have had similar assessments in the past and have never had any problems) so we had been speaking for a few minutes when my friend messes up, no big deal, then a few minutes later after deleting that audio and recording again I mess up. *This is where the fun begins* out steps an angry teacher (not ours another spanish teacher) and she is furious 

Ms. P: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

Friend: were recording a Spanish test

Mr. A: hey did you guys cheat on the assessment?

Both of us: No (I was a little shocked as he knew we were both good students) 

Mr. A: Ms. P told me that you two have cheated on your assessment, did you ever pause your recording?

Me: yes we did, we made some mistakes so we restarted the recording

c0brrh	2019-06-13 21:36:57		WIBTA If I remove the tip from delivery services because they refused to follow my instructions on the app?	"Long story short, I live in an apartment that cannot be seen from the street. To compound the matter, my street address does not match up with the closest street to my apartment. Because the way the apartment is built it’s in large square with the inner courtyard and all the addresses are for the main road bordering the north side of the apartment complex; however, my apartment is off center to the courtyard near another major road.  Due to some factors right now, I order a lot of Uber eats and deliveries from target and Walmart.  I am well aware of the challenges finding my apartment so I always include a detailed set of directions in the notes for every order. 

Without fail, if the app has a tracking feature, I can see the person driving around my complex and driving around again and again.  And I would say 9 times out of 10 the person is at least 20 to 30 minutes late from the time I receive a text message that they’ve arrived. To help, I will text the delivery person and say please read the notes, or even call them, to make sure they can find the apartment.  It often takes numerous phone calls and repeated assertions that the person must park and must walk into the apartment complex to find my apartment before they actually heed my instructions. Many of these apps have the ability to tip someone before they even arrive. I often do this so it’s easy and everything is taken care of before I receive my goods. However it’s now become a chore to order anything online, and it’s very inconvenient to have to find a delivery person and flag them down only to find they did not read the instructions in the first place.   Also, I also put the instructions in Spanish because I live in Florida and many people are more comfortable in Spanish.  

I am very well aware that these individuals rely on tips in order to make a living wage, what I’m saying is that I do everything I can think of to provide them with all the tools necessary to find my apartment without a problem. And they are ignoring it. So would I be the asshole if I remove the tip or stop tipping because the person refused or didn’t bother to read the instructions? I was thinking about even putting a sentence in the instructions that said if you read the instructions tell me, and you’ll get a bigger tip."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

It’s been a struggle to get back on my feet. I just wanna get home. So recently, starting from like last week, random people just kept coming and visiting me. Just for some info I’m a 15yr F. The first person was a really distant family friend. His mom and my grandma were a bit close but not that much. And he doesn’t know me. Like at all. He even admitted that he didn’t know what age I was when he was coming over. He got to my room and immediately starting talking to my grandma, effectively ignoring me and barely mentioning me at all. This went on for hours. It was time for him to leave but he wanted to see my dad? (My parents are divorced so he would have no connection to my dad whatsoever. The grandma I’m referring to is my moms mom and the guys mom is family
To my moms mom.) he had absolutely no reason to want to talk to my dad, it was super weird. He kept dragging out the conversation for another hour until my grandma really had to go. They left and that was that. Then, a couple of days ago, one of my dads distant friends decided to come by as well, again I’ve only met him once that was like two years ago. My mom was weirded out. Then again today, the daughter one of my grandmas closest friends visited. Again I. Didn’t. Really. Know. Her. Sure my grandma knows her but my mom barely knows her. I barely know her name. These aren’t people I see on a regular basis. I got pissed at my mom and grandma for just allowing random people into my room and they made the argument that well, they didn’t invite them (which is worse?) so they can’t just tell them no. In my culture, it’s seen as a really nice gesture for someone to visit a sick person at the hospital but I’m not in my old country so not a lot of people do it.

It’s a very competitive faculty, and the first round of job offers just went out.

My friend was devastated that he didn’t get a single offer, even though he had many interviews. I didn’t get one either (and neither did most students, it’s really no big deal and there will be many more chances).

I tried very hard to comfort him, but was constantly met with rude comments demeaning me and saying he CAN believe I didn’t get a job, but he CANT believe that he didn’t get one, because he’s a “harder worker” etc (not true, btw.)

He really made me feel like shit, and when I tried to confront him about it he did not apologize and instead asked me to make him dinner. I was at work and couldn’t leave so I said I could after and he said that he didn’t want to eat dinner later, he wanted it right away. I said I couldn’t do that and he got mad. 

I’ve been ignoring his texts ever since, but I feel really bad since we’ve been friends for almost 3 years now. But at the same time, I feel firm in my choice to end the friendship since he was always saying this stuff, it just used to be more subtle.

&#x200B;

I have had an on again-off again relationship with my ex for almost 10 years. In the last off again, I got pregnant from a one night stand. I didn't tell the bio dad I was preggo and have not included him in my son's life at any point, for personal reasons. My ex and I decided to get back together about halfway through my pregnancy. He was there for the birth of my son and helped name him. I never saw my child as anything but our child.

Until we got into a huge fight and broke up one day (our son was almost 2). It was mostly unrelated to parenting and I assumed he would call to see his child or check in within the week. But he never called. Not that week or the next or the next. Then finally, after over a month goes by, he calls to say he needs to be in our son's life. I agree to let him, after much reluctance/arguing, and I explicitly tell him that our son is the main priority, always. I tell him not to miss appointments you set to see him and that I expect him to be around for important events in his life. He doesn't get a second chance. This is his second chance.

Long story short, he messed up his second chance. Not only did he miss a hang out with our son but he is not putting our sons needs first in many aspects.

I think I am doing what is best for my son. He deserves a dad who is consistent and frequent. He deserves a dad that will fight all the dragons and bad guys. He deserves a dad that is a good example. I'll be the first to admit that I made a mistake by allowing my ex to be apart of our lives. Exes should stay exes. But do I owe him the right to try to be a good father? Am I being unfair giving him no second chances?

Since my parents were out of town for a bit I had to stay at school, since if I took the bus I had no way to get back. Me and a couple of friends decided to walk to a nearby restaurant for dinner. Since my parents were not at home they had given me a bit of money to use for purchasing groceries and stuff. I decided to only order a small portion since I didnt have that much money. 

However, when the food came it turns out that the waiter had made a mistake on our order and there was an extra portion. I tried to tell the waiter that she had made a mistake and I had not ordered it, but as I was speaking one of my friends kicked me a little and told me to just take it. So the waiter put the food on the table and left before I could really react. The food was a little bit on the expensive side, and if I payed for it I wouldn't have enough money to last the rest of the week. I tried arguing this with my friend but he just told me that since they had already made it should eat it. Eventually I just gave in and ate the food l. When it came time to pay I refused to pay for the extra order I got. Eventually the waiter gave up and let me go without paying for the extra order. 

As we were walking back to the school all of my friends just yelled at me saying that what I did was not proper restaurant etiquette and that they were ashamed to be eating with me. I just said that if I had payed I would have to have eaten less in the next few days.

But her ex scarpered, she hasn’t seen him since she told him she was pregnant. 

She as decided to keep and raise the baby. Despite him totally vanishing off the face of the earth. She has decided to keep it purely based on the fact that she is scared she would never fall pregnant again. 

She is telling me all of this so that I feel sorry for her, and tbh I really do. But I totally understand his point of view. He never wanted this kid and she is trying to force him into a position of responsibility because she is scared. She messages me and complains about him for not stepping up but she has never shown an interest in having kids(purely out of not being able to have them). I want to be there for her but I feel like I am having to hold my tongue when she is wanting me to justify her anger at him. 

I haven’t said anything as of yet because she is having a hell of a time, with being pregnant, alone and her mental and physical health is taking a toll. She has had to come off her medication because her doctor has told her is could damage the baby or cause birth defects. I just don’t know what to say to her.

"I [18 M] work for a local retail store who specializes in selling hiking apparel (Patagonia, Kuhl, Mountain Hardware, etc.) and the owner of the store is an extremely mean and greedy man. He had made multiple racist comments about customers as well as endless sexist and sexually suggestive comments about female employees and coworkers. 

In my job, we have reps from companies come in to train us about the features of this season's products and selling points, etc. Often times, these reps bring things for the employees such as discount cards or free t shirts or hats in order to incentivize us to wear the products we sell and test them out ourselves. The owner seldom lets us keep them unless it's something of little value. For example, we are supposed to get to go on Adidas website every year and pick one pair of shoes and use a code to get them for free. Our owner not only uses our (one use/year) codes to restock the store but also has his family members listed as ""employees"" so he has more codes to use to restock for free. Even stickers from Patagonia he kept from us and instead put out for sale.

Recently a North Face (my absolute favorite brand)  rep came to train us for their new series of Summer apparel and the rep gave a box of extremely rare unreleased shirts and explicitly told our boss they were for the employees because we sell more of their products than anyone in the surrounding area. I knew my boss would either sell them or give them as birthday/Christmas gifts, so I snagged one in my size when the opportunity arose.

c0bmu4	2019-06-13 21:25:47	Whydoesntitworktho	AITA for gaming with my sister's enemy?	"In the car today my sister called me an asshole for this and I wanted reddit's input. Obligatory throwaway account cause sensitive info.

Background info:

About a year ago now my sister was kinda sorta dating this dude (age 17). They mostly just snuck off and made out or whatever, I am not entirely sure what feelings were involved. One night he brought her dinner when she was alone in the house and straight up tried to get with with her, and she was not a fan. He wouldn't take no for an answer and there was a struggle, but she basically fought him off and he left. My sister hates him now to the point where she has anxiety attacks around him.

Jump to the present. An hour ago driving her (17F, im 18M) to her current boyfriends house, she said I was an asshole because I have not cut him out of my life entirely, I still play video games with him if he happens to be online at the same time as me. I would call him an acquaintance at best, we were never really friends to begin with. In the past three months, we have played together maybe three or four times.

The only reason I tolerate him is because he doesn't know that I know about his behavior towards my sister, and I don't want to open that can of worms with him. I would prefer to just play with him occasionally because in my mind, video games have basically nothing to do with his relationship with my sister and if I were to cut him out entirely he would probably suspect I know something about it. IRL, I would never let him near my sister and it's a whole different story but I feel she isn't involved in us gaming together occasionally.

My sister believes I shouldn't even be talking to him after what he did to her. In her mind, my gaming with him means that we are still friends and I am ok with him doing what he did (even though this isn't the case).

So reddit, AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Looks like I am definitely the asshole already.  So follow-up judgement, if I were to just cut off contact with him completely, would that help?  My priority right now is not escalating the situation so that my sister doesn't get any unwanted attention.  If I cut him out of my life, people will ask more questions and I feel that may be more painful for her."	Asshole	0	0	1.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

I asked if they wanted food from there on me and they didn’t deny it but said they’re not stopping and are coming home because they want to. I got irritated because although I’m not entitled they always do this every time anyone asks for them to stop for groceries or anything they need that’s within their reach (with full compensation of course). And every time anyone else goes out they get them food as well out of consideration despite their unwillingness to help. Sibling is also extremely ungrateful and short tempered so it’s all the more irritating. It’s more of an overall issue but it’s always examples like this.

c0bmny	2019-06-13 21:25:27	Jayjayanus	AITA for shouting at an older colleague?	"Let me start with the important back story: I am a 18 year old student, but at the weekends I work at a local restaurant as a waiter. The restaurant has two parts: a terrace outside and the normal restaurant indoor. Outside, the dirty dish is collected on a big tray because it would be to much work to carry every single plate from outside to the washing up area. The older colleague, let's call her U., is working inside the kitchen as a normal, standard kitchen staff for 15 years. All the young waiter (15 - 20 years old) don't like her, because she is always rude and judges us for unnecessary things and acts like our supervisor.

Now the story: at the day the incident happened, I worked inside for most of the time. It was a long day; I was tired and wanted to go home because I had things to study. But when we finished and cleaned every table, I was told to help outside, because there is still work to do. I did and the first thing I saw, the tray was completely full of dirty dish, close to being too heavy for me to carry. I carried the tray to the washing area and now 3 kitchen staff (including U.) groan very rude at me, because we collected all the dish outside instead of bringing in small parts through the day. If you remember I worked inside all the time and was outside for a few minutes, meaning I wasn't even responsible for this. I didn't want to put with the unfair judgement and because the other stuff was rude at me, I was rude to them and told them in a very aggressive and loud tone, that I am not responsible for this and they should shout at the people responsible for. Now U. comes at me and tells me to have more respect, because she works here for 15 years and I am not allowed to get loud with the experienced staff. Also, she said she is kind of my supervisor, which I denied.

Fast forward after work, I wanted to go outside, U. came at me and told me again, how many years she worked here, and I should have more respect.

But I also haven’t seen her in a while(we go to different out of state colleges), and I’m bad at lying, so I’m not sure how to respond to the simple “how are you??” question. I think saying “I’m doing great” would make me implode, bc like I said lying makes me itchy inside. I’ve been dealing with a lot of grief and shit in my life (mother has aggressive cancer, brother is a drug addict bipolar and our neighbor is pressing charges against him, my dog of 16 years *literally* was put down this past Monday, my scholarship in college is getting revoked bc I couldn’t properly deal with the first two and it affected my work). These were all things that I wasn’t sure how to be like “hey guess what” out of the blue over text or like Snapchat. 

A lot of my social media has been very clear that treating friends like a therapist is a trash move. And because I have the social and emotional intelligence of a rock with googly eyes, and a desperate need for everyone to like me so so much, I have no sense of a line to draw when it comes to sharing problems. I don’t wanna ruin the party or bum people out. I especially don’t want the day to be about anything but her.

It's really my fault that I've ended up in this situation but it's made me so angry; I have just now been clearing my Gmail as I end up with a lot of spam in my inbox (probs from reading clickbait articles and signing my email up for different things) and I came across an email from Amazon about suspicious activity in my account, I haven't seen this email before as my inbox is so cluttered I missed it.

To the point, someone hacked my account and purchased ~£80 between two e-giftcards, and some Borderlands DLC's which were ~60p each, according to the Amazon ""Thanks for your order!"" email, the hacker sent the gift cards to what I'm guessing is their own email, if they're careless, or more likely a throwaway.

The money I keep on the debit card linked to my account is just monthly student loans and a monthly pension, so it's not really money I earned but it's still a shocking and shitty thing to happen.

Since this actually happened a couple of months ago I don't think there's anything that can be done to rescue the money, but it's just stewing in my brain. It seems inappropriate to just attack this email address with a strongly worded email but I'm just mad as heck.

c0bjai	2019-06-13 21:17:41		AITA for not wanting to be involved in the upcoming crisis and drama in my family?	"So I have a great grandfather, lovely man, but getting along in years.  He lives with my aunt, my aunt's two daughters, and my aunt's two daughters' children.  He lives near, but not with my dad, and pays my dad's mortgage.  

My aunt is a sociopathic abusive chain smoker living off my ggpa's money, who really likes me and doesn't know that I know the kind of person she can be.  (Yay, recordings)   

My dad is a permanently drunk, in-and-out-of-prison abuser of any and all drugs who is absolutely brilliant, but can't hold down a job at all any more, and is living off his money.

Of my two cousins, one is schiziophrenic due to physical brain trauma at a young age and struggles to avoid staying out of jail, out of drugs and out of trouble.  She's currently succeeding!  But who knows in a few years.  The other is a vet who seems okay, from what little I know about her.  Both are currently living off his money, as are their daughters.

My sister's married to a broke unemployed guy whose last job was at Walmart, and is broke and unemployed, and now has a broke, unemployed adorable daughter.  My ggpa helps support them financially as well.  I hope you see the pattern here - he's quite wealthy, and pays for everyone who needs it.  

But a crisis looms.  My ggpa will die - maybe not today, tomorrow, or for another 15 years.  And that money will go into a will.  And that will is going to be **HOTLY** contested.  Everyone will claim they deserve more, everyone will claim they were the most loved or whatever, and there's going to be an enormous fight, physical, legal and mental, that looms on the horizon.  I've actually been concerned that if his health declines prior to an actual death, he may be abused by the family living with or near him - maybe to rewrite the will against his will, or just in an immediate financial sense with power of attorney over him.

As for me?  Self-sufficient, living thousands of miles away from all of them, and I'm so much happier now!  So happy, in fact, that I give zero shits as to what happens to his money - if I could avoid seeing my fucked-up, abusive family ever again, I'd gladly give up however much he has.  I don't want any part in that crisis - I still talk to my ggpa, and we've seen each other, but he knows why I'm distant.  But if he dies, I don't give a shit about funerals, and I don't give a shit about the will - I'd gladly stay away and let my family eat each other alive.  Does this make me an asshole for not wanting to be involved in that pending drama bomb?  The only thing I really feel bad about is the possible elder abuse by my family, since I REALLY don't want him to be treated like shit for his money.  I just have no idea what I could possibly do about it though, if anything - especially since nothing's happening now, and I wouldn't know if anything starts happening in the future.

He has an older sister with that I felt friendly with throughout our relationship and enjoyed spending time with- I didn’t have too many girlfriends, mainly two who I am very close with. Now we’ve broken up and I’ve still been in a texting relationship with his sister for about 4 months, hanging out very occasionally. I like her, she’s vibrant and funny, reminds me of an older cousin I looked up to as a kid, and is a fun person to share memes with and just some other chatting. 

We’ve chatted about him before, I’ll admit and she’s offered advice, but now that time has passed and I’ve gotten over it, I feel like I can be a good friend, as in a good friend to her totally separate from any words about her brother.

c0beid	2019-06-13 21:06:04		AITA for pursuing my now husband while he had a girlfriend?	"I want to state from the jump that NO cheating was involved. We didn't touch, kiss, hold hands, nothing until we were formally a couple.

I met my DH at an out-of-state conference. He approached me between presentations and I thought he was just being friendly and looking for someone to talk to. We ended up getting lunch and exploring the city together along with two of my girlfriends. We spent the whole day together, and it was obvious to all (myself, my girlfriends, random strangers...) that the dude was smitten. It was adorable and very unexpected. One problem: in the course of casual conversation, he mentioned a long-term girlfriend. Actually, he and one of my girlfriends were commiserating about difficult relationships. He sounded very ambivalent about her and said they had broken up a couple times in their two years together. He told my friend he didn't think it would last.

But still. Girlfriend. It gave me a minute or two of pause, but there was such a spark between us and a distant, unseen girlfriend was not a super strong dissuasion. One of my friends told me I had to honor ""girl code"" by staying away.

The next day, several of us drove out to an overnight retreat site 2 hours away. My now-DH and I rode alone together. After building up my confidence for a while, I finally said something like, ""Look, I can tell you like me. I like you too, but you have a girlfriend so I don't know what to do here."" He told me that he did like me ""a lot"" but that it didn't feel right to break up with his girlfriend for a girl he'd known for a day at this point. He didn't think he could even be friends with me without it being torture. We talked for a long time, but by the end of it, basically it was like, ""Maybe things will align in the future, but sorry, we aren't going to be a thing right now. I have to figure things out with my girlfriend."" And... that was it. We went back to our respective states and I felt pretty sad about it but pretty much thought I'd never see him again.

A week later, he calls me and tells me he broke up with his girlfriend. Not specifically to date me. We agreed to be just friends for a little while. But meeting me made him realize that their relationship wasn't going to go anywhere and they were done. We spent 8 hours on the phone. Well, good intentions, etc, etc. Our time as ""just friends"" didn't last too long. We got married 7 months later. His ex was totally devastated. There were a lot of mismatched expectations and she thought they were going to get married, though she has said herself that my DH told her all along he didn't think they'd last. She has since moved on and is with someone who seems like a great fit for her.

My husband and I have now been happily married for a few years and have two children, so there's nothing I can or would do differently now.

When we were dating, she became close with my sister as well and they still hang even though we’re broke up. Now that I am home from school, I can’t stand the fact she hangs at my house with my sister.

My mom is also somewhat close with her and they go shopping every now and then. My parents don’t see the problem with her being over all the time.

When she is over, I deliberately don’t say hi and ignore her in hopes she gets the hint. She still comes around it it pisses me off even more. 

Specific event that just happens was I came home and she was in our living room. My mom asked if I was in a bad mood for some reason and I pretended to be really pissed my ex was there and snapped back “now I am” then slammed the door.  This was mainly for dramatic effect to get the point across I despise when she comes over.

My parents and sister are calling me an asshole for how I treat my ex and don’t see why I can’t just be friends. AITA?

Edit: I broke up with her 2 years ago because she cheated on me

c0bbs3	2019-06-13 20:59:41	PM_UR_PM_NAME_LOOT	"AITA for calling my spouse a ""stupid fat hobbit""?"	"So context - there's a scene in Lord of the Rings where Gollum catches a rabbit, and Sam takes it and cooks in a stew. Gollum laments with ""You stupid, fat hobbit! You ruins it!"" hoping to have eaten it raw. It's one of my favorite movies and my wife like it too and is well aware of this scene (it's the source of the famous po-tay-to viral internet video from way back in the day).

&#x200B;

Situation - So my wife and I like a good steak every now and then. We both like them medium rare, but I didn't know until recently how strongly some people feel against well done steaks. Anyway, I've been seeing steak memes a lot lately about people over cooking them, and it was on my mind.

We pawned our kids off to her sisters for the weekend and decided we'd have a nice dinner at home together. She's cooking and I'm doing dishes and clearing the table. She starts searing the steaks when she gets a call. I guess one of our kids thought they left something so my wife goes running up the stairs to go look for something. A couple minutes later she comes rushing down the stairs having remembered the steaks and looks at them and says ""Crap! I guess we're having medium well steaks on this side. Oops!""

I immediately come in with ""You stupid, fat hobbit! You ruins it!"" in a bad Gollum impression. Her brow furrows and her jaw is slightly ajar with a disgusted look on her face. Afraid she missed the reference I start talking about LOTR. She cuts me off and says, ""Yeah, I know what it's from, don't ever call me that again, and I'm sorry I ruined your dinner.""

I try to explain that I was quoting a movie, not genuinely calling her fat and stupid, and that I didn't believe dinner was actually ruined (I don't mind medium well steak) but that it seemed to oddly fit with Gollum's situation. She wasn't having it. She wanted me to apologize but I didn't see anything to apologize for. We both stubbornly hold our side of things until she says I'm being a real asshole. It wasn't worth it to me to push any further so I relent and apologize to mend things but it's really been bugging me. I honestly don't think I did anything wrong, she overreacted and should understand that I would never just come out and call her fat and stupid. And I don't care about medium well steak, it's just been an internet thing lately to hate on well done steaks, but she wasn't seeing my perspective on that either. So reddit, AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the replies, I understand more of why I'm TA here. I'm not sure that my original post here conveys it well but I really didn't let this linger much before apologizing. We exchanged words for maybe 3 minutes between the moment she asked me to apologize and when I did apologize, but the bigger picture here is that I even though I did apologize to diffuse the situation with my spouse, deep down at the time I didn't mean it because I didn't think I was in the wrong. But after the judgement here and good advice I can understand where I went wrong."	Asshole	0	0	26.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"Backstory: i (26) move away from my home country and as soon i could bring my younger brother (20) to live with me. A friend that also emigrated to the same country had a lot of trouble and i offer ti let her stay in my house with me and my brother. Later that friend became my girlfriend (26) and we live together since (1,5 Y)

Now, my girlfriend has been complaining to me for some time about my brother, because he is sometimes very messy, he sometimes does not help to much in the house, and is not always very considerate towards us.

I have talked to him for the issues that are more pressing trying to guide him towards been a fully functioning adult. But many of the issues that my girlfriend complains about are not a problem in my eyes and not always tell my brother.

An example: a few weeks ago my brother take about 6 of his classmates to our house to do some homework, they cook food for themselves (they buyed it) and posibly drink some wine and left. My girl absolutly freakout about it, that he should have asked our permission (he did tell me but he did not ask for permission and i let him be), that they may have break someting (they didnt), that they would trash the place (they didnt), etc etc.

My brother is working a part-time job and studying his first year at collage.

My girlfriend is threatening to move out if i don't become harder towards my brother. She is quite quarrelsome and figths regularly with her sister and cousins, but is rarely serious about it. Neither i nor my brother or anyone in my family is conflictive but we discuss serious topics in serious  manner when necessary.

AITA for thinking that my girlfriend is going to far and that she wants to move not stoping her?

Father's Day is this Sunday and I've been right in the middle of my A-Level exams, which are probably, the most important exams of my life. In this time, I assumed my brother would take the initiative and sort out my dad's father's Day present without me and tell me to pay him back (we get joint presents usually, though this will be the last year I do that). 

However in the middle of last week, my brother asked if I'd sorted out his father's Day present yet. To which I said ""surprisingly not"" and he responded sarcastically with ""fantastic"" to which I angrily responded a out being in the middle of my exams and he didn't reply.

Then yesterday he asked again whether I'd sorted it to which I responded again, angrily, that I was in the middle of my A-levels and I was hoping he'd have taking the initiative to Google ""chef's blowtorch"" buying it and then telling me how much I owed.

So I just ordered the blowtorch, but I feel like my brother doesn't deserve his name on it because he's put no effort towards it, but I also feel like that's very petty and not nice to my dad.

When I was in middle school, we found out my dad was a heavy drug user. After finding out, my dads behavior toward me (23M), my twin brother, and our family became horribly. My grandparents, however, received the worst. A cycle of him walking away from the family and returning only when he needed money or a roof over his head continued for the next ten years. During his episodes of being back, he stole from my grandparents, threatened their lives, and took complete advantage of their love. 
    
    Fast forward to now, my dad has resurfaced in our lives. His health has deteriorated; his liver is failing. My grandparents, both in their 70s, are caring for my dad around the clock. Walking my dad around the house, cleaning him after he’s urinated on himself, and feeding him all of his food are now a part of my grandparents’ daily lives. All the other members of my family live over an hour away, myself included, so we aren’t able to visit as often as we’d like. If he passed, it would lift a huge burden on my already feeble grandparents. Am I the asshole for wanting my dad to die?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

I’m seeing this girl casually, and she’s a real sweetheart. The sex is awesome, and I enjoy having her over. The first time we had sex I was shaven myself, but I (obviously) noticed she wasn’t. It’s not like she has a whole rainforest with villagers living down there, she’s trimmed but still has a good amount of hair. After the first time we had sex, I started only trimming as well, and stopped shaving since I figured she doesn’t care about it. I much prefer shaven, but It’s not the end of the world if not.

I want to ask her to consider shaving, but I don’t want to force it on her, and I don’t want to be an asshole about it, especially when I’m not currently shaven myself. If she does begin shaving, I will start  again too, so it’s not like I ask her to do something I’m not gonna do myself. 
If she doesn’t want to, I completely understand that it’s her decision (as it should be), and I won’t bring it up again.

We are currently not speaking right now, and I feel kind of torn on whether I am being too harsh (an asshole) or if my feelings are justified. My husband has IBS which I understand can be rough for him and can cause him to miss work. He had a flair up on Monday and decided to call out of work. I sympathized with him and everything was fine. When I get home he seems perfectly normal in a good mood and everything, I didn't even notice him going to the bathroom more frequently or for longer periods of time. 

Tuesday he calls out again quoting IBS again. At this point I confront him, is it really due to IBS or has your anxiety gotten the best of you? This same  scenario has happened a few times in the past. He tells me it's a little of both. I offer to set up and go with him to the doctor for something to help him with his anxiety/IBS problem. We talk through it, I acknowledge his legitimate medical problem and try to be positive about this situation but now I'm starting to get stressed out. He has missed a lot of work in the past and I'm worried he will be at risk for termination. 

Wednesday he stays home as well. He tells me he is in contact with his coworkers and his supervisor who give him the ok to stay home then as well. I let it go, what can I say. 

Today, Thursday,  he calls out again. This time for a different medical issue that I dont want to get too much into due to privacy concerns. Let's just say he's had this issue a couple times in the past some requiring hospitalization, but it's a completely preventable issue if he would just take care of himself.  So now I'm pretty pissed. From what he will tell me I feel like hes having more anxiety issues than actual medical issues. Him missing all this work will be the end of his employment. I can't support us on my income alone. This whole situation is stressing me out. I texted him this morning telling him this is getting ridiculous. He told me thanks, don't message me.

Now I've had time to sit on the issue and I'm starting to feel bad with how I treated him since he really is not feeling well... but I'm still stressed the fuck out over the situation.  So am I the asshole?

Tldr: husband misses 4 days of work due to possible illness. I'm frustrated with the idea that he will probably lose his job over it. I wasn't very nice when he told me he wasn't feeling well. Am I the asshole?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

As time went by and I got older I realized that my mother and I didn't get along either, she's very much a textbook narc and made life as a teenager completely unbearable (i was kicked out for at least 4 months at a time 3/4 years of hs). The reason I keep my mother in my life is because I know her childhood herself wasnt the best and to be fair she's been through a lot being a single mother of 4. 

&#x200B;

After the divorce my mother was very adamant about not contacting my father at all outside of visitations (which stopped happening after 6th grade). My dad tried a few times contacting me (and me contacting back) but every time it happened, my mother would get very upset and I would stop replying. My father has done his fair share of bad deeds and I don't  forgive him completely either. At most I'd describe my relationship with my parents as ""family members"", I don't really feel that connection most people seem to feel with their parents.

&#x200B;

Near the end of high school I got back in touch with my dad and since then we've been talking from time to time (I see it as my attempt in salvaging a possible relationship). With this he's offered to help my with some uni costs, etc. If my mother were to find out she would be extremely mad, and I feel like I'm doing my siblings dis-service because they dont know about my father helping me either (they all choose not to talk to him). I've also been developing a better relationship with my mother now that I've moved out and she's been helping me out as well. I've kept the fact that Im talking to my dad again a secret, but Im also worried she'll find out.

I'm on mobile sorry for the formatting.

I (F, 13) and another one of my friends (Non-Bi, 14) are planning on going to pride Saturday (Thursday atm) and taking the bus to get there.

I am aromantic, and I really am just going so I could support my LGBTQ+ friends and the community. My friend (V) is going because they are Bisexual and Non-Binary and wants to be with people a lot like them. We would be leaving at 12 and coming back at 3. 

The issue is, we cannot tell our parents since we are worried to be disappointments.
V's family constantly talks shit about gay couples in public. Also they talk poorly about their Uncle since he is gay.
I cannot tell my parents because, the last time I wanted to join a club in my school, my mom asked me in a confused and disappointed voice if I was gay. I quickly shook my head and said that i wasnt. 

Me and V have been planning this for a long time, they have even made flags. I would give my parents an idea of where I am and have told my brother ""I'm planning to go to a festival Saturday"".

c0b743	2019-06-13 20:48:40	suddensmellz	AITA For not wanting to get tested for herpes?	"So my boyfriend had some sort of sore on his penis the other week. He got really concerned about it and went to the campus doctor and they said that it wasn't anything serious (eliminated gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, etc). They said it might be an allergic reaction, it might be from irritation during sex or masturbation, or it might be a herpes sore. He asked them if they could test for herpes, and they said okay but because the sore had already scabbed over, the test might come back negative regardless. Edit: They also told him it wasn't a big deal regardless and unless he was in a bunch of pain, not to worry about it. 

Well he had the test, and it did come back negative. Now, he wants me to get a blood test for myself for herpes to see if I gave it to him, in case his test failed. However, he's had no other symptoms. I've had no symptoms either.

Basically, I've been doing research on it, and it seems like everything is being blown way out of proportion. [Two-thirds](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-10-2015-globally-an-estimated-two-thirds-of-the-population-under-50-are-infected-with-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1) of the population has herpes already, so it's like... why bother being tested when the odds are we both DO have herpes anyway, gotten from friends or family? If neither of us have any symptoms except for one tiny sore (which went away in less than two days), then what are we supposed to do with that information? Even if we break up and see other people in the future, what are we supposed to say? ""Hey, before we kiss, I have herpes, but probably you do too, and so do 66% of the people in this bar, so let's make out?"" Seems a dumb thing to spend hundreds of dollars testing for, plus getting my blood drawn, going to the doctor, the whole shebang for what will ultimately be useless information an an asymptomatic situation.

Basically:

1. The test is expensive, painful, takes time, and isn't even that reliable.
2. In all likelihood he DOES have herpes already, before he even met me. 
3. The sore he had was just as likely to be normal skin irritation, and the doctors said not to worry about it. 
4. What are we going to do with the information when neither of us have any symptoms other than that one sore?

I don't want to spend my money and time on this, and he's really mad at me and the friends I've asked for advice have said that I'm irresponsible for not getting tested. AITA here?!"	Asshole	0	0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

So I'm waiting to cross the street across from the train station, when an older man passes me and crosses while the walk light was still indicating 'stop'. One car passes right in front of him, but another has to swerve to avoid him. He doesn't seem to react. This kind of pisses me off, because he didn't seem to be in a hurry, so it seems like an unnecessary risk. About 5 seconds later, the walk sign turns white, so I cross the street and head over to the train station entrance, where lo and behold, there's the same guy waiting to use the revolving door.

So at this point, I'm right behind him, and he walks in. I don't know what came over me, but as soon as I get inside, I walk up to the man and say, ""Excuse me. I saw you cross the street and almost get hit by a car. I waited for the walk sign, and I've been walking normally, and we're both here at the same time. So you just risked your life for nothing."" About 2 seconds of silence between us while he just looks at me blankly, so I just walk away to catch my train.

I don't know what I was hoping to achieve by saying that. Maybe I thought he would really think about what I said and take it to heart, but that probably won't happen. So now I'm wondering if saying that to him was even justified.

c0b39s	2019-06-13 20:39:56		AITA for not speaking to my mom until my pet's test results come back?	"Ok so, a little backstory: I had a ferret for a couple of years. I then got a puppy with a very high prey drive that made it close to impossible for the two to coexist. My parents were nice enough to take my ferret into their home due to these reasons. It was really hard for me to let me ferret go but it wasn't fair to him to stay with me due to the puppy.

I recently visited my parents a few weekends ago and when I was there, I found out my mom was feeding him dog treats regularly. Ferrets are obligate carnivores and have specific diets if they don't consume raw food, and mine didn't. I don't know exactly how much random stuff he ate but she gave him dog treats almost daily. When I saw this, I told her to stop and that it could be really bad for him, nutritionally and otherwise.

Sidenote: my mom has a really hard time accepting what other people tell her. I have talked to her about this in the past but ultimately she decides whatever's right in her mind, even if it's far from it.

I got a call a week later from my brother telling me that my family took him to the pet hospital because he wouldn't pee/poop. He ended going into emergency surgery because they found 32 gallbladder stones. 32! When he spoke to me, he let me know that my ferret was being kept overnight for observation.

My ferret passed away the next day due to kidney failure. And I really can't help but feel this was due to my mom's negligence in regards to the diet she provided him and her dismissal of my claims. Apparently my brother also told her to knock it off with the dog treats and she never did. She gave him a lot of egg yolks and he noticed that my ferret had a lot of diarrhea after eating that.

When I had dropped my ferret off at my parent's house, he was around ~2-3 since I never got an official birth date/birth certificate for him. He was around 5 when he passed. I feel like he passed prematurely.

I'm obviously hurt (and mad, it was a painful death for him) by his passing but I can't help but feel like my mom had influence on this. He was always a healthy ferret and did not have health issues. He was in the vet's office for a check-up in February with perfect health. I'm not actively speaking to my mom, like not responding to messages or calling to ask how she's doing. My brother still doesn't have the lab results back from the vet hospital detailing what exactly caused the gallbladder/kidney failure so he told me to be patient and understanding. I haven't told my mom I wouldn't talk to her, I just have been avoiding texts. She's acting like nothing has happened by literally not acknowledging it.

c0b2xj	2019-06-13 20:39:10	d3cuca	AITA for wanting only sex with an ex?	"A little backstory...
I'm a 23 y o extremely empathic guy who always though that being nice was a good excuse for a girls to fall in love with me (of course now I see that being nice is just basic). As an altruistic person, I mean no harm to nobody and want the best for everyone around me. My romantic and sexual life has always been empty and is one of my biggest frustrations to this day. 
So 2 years ago I came back to my home country for the summer (I'm studying abroad) and started dating this girl that I knew she was attracted to me. From the start I told her that this was only a ""summer love"" and that it was impossible for me to have a long distance relationship with her (that's what she really wanted) and even tho she agreed with the terms, that didn't stopped her to have feelings for me and be crushed when I departed. I lost my virginity to her (and slept twice with one other girl since then) and we had a good time even if I only felt emotional with her but I had no feelings for her at all. I was always honest from the beginning with her until today cuz I respect her. 
Flashforward to today, I came back to my home country a week ago, after 2 years, and got a cup of coffee with her to catch up. After a while it was clear to me that she still wanted to be with me and I told her that I couldn't have a serious relationship with her but if she wanted to be fuck buddies, that was ok with me. She told me that she's ok with it too so we kissed and fooled around a little bit (no sex, just hand stuff) and then came home to write this post.
She's always been really emotional and she's had some depressive episodes and even told me that she's still on medication even though she feels better today. 
I told her that I'm looking for sexual experience and that any relationship we have today, is not gonna involve any sort of feelings, which she agreed (but I don't know if she said it was ok because she wanted to spend time with me and that's better than nothing or she's said ok with the hope that I fall in love with her... Which is not gonna happen...) .
So that's my question...
WIBTA because I really want to sleep with her (more than once) and even though I established the rules which she accepted, I know that she's gonna start having feelings for me if we continue what we said we'll do. I even feel bad because I know that if I want to stop everything, I just have to tell her that she's having feelings for me again and I know I'll be right and she'll know it too... 
So I don't know if I should have sex with her when we want/can or just tell her that I'm afraid for her feelings and stop everything before she feels anything for me again and avoid being the asshole...

"So my sister’s (24 F) son ( 3 M) is in that phase in toddlerhood where he just wants to push his limits to see what he can get away with. He’ll punch, kick, bite, take your phone or other personal items and throw them into the wall, etc. My sister thinks he’s getting better because when he does it to *her*, she disciplines him.

The problem is, she won’t allow anyone else to tell him to stop. So when she’s out of the room or has her back turned, he all but attacks whoever is near him. Because he knows if we scold him, she’ll scream at us— not him.

I refuse to take this nonsense. When he bites I loudly say “OW.” If my sister doesn’t correct him, I say “you don’t bite people. Do you want to go to time out?” In a stern voice. Sister always acts appalled and lectures me angrily about “speaking that way to her child”.

The other day I went to see her, and while I was over my nephew was on great behavior. As soon as she left to go to the bathroom, he asked me to pick him up and take him to get some fruit snacks. I happily picked him up, and he chomped down on my hand so hard I felt the tendons move. He drew blood. I screamed a little in surprise and immediately put him down. I then loudly snapped, “NO, Nathan, we don’t bite people!”
He bursts into tears, sister comes running in, we have a brief verbal altercation to the effect of 

Sister: I told you not to yell at my child!

Me: if you won’t discipline him, i will!

She asked me to leave, and I received a text the next morning that said I’m not welcome in her home.

AITA here? 
I really think she’s damaging his development by only correcting his behavior when it’s targeted toward her. She’s making it difficult for me, (or other family members who avoid going to her house for the same exact reason), to even *want* to be around my nephew at this point, and that’s heartbreaking."

Now, Alex is a sweet kid. He’s definitely on the spectrum, but he never says anything mean to anybody, and all he ever wants is for people to talk to and pay attention to him. Unfortunately though, he doesn’t understand that not everyone wants the best for him, so he’ll usually do stuff that’s humiliating just because someone tells him to, and he doesn’t really realize it.

Anyways, I was on the bus for the first time in months, and I sat in front of Frank. Across the aisle from Frank sat Alex, who was happily listening to music. Two seats down was Jen. 

Once the bus started moving, Alex jumped out into the middle of the aisle and sat there in an attempt to get attention. But immediately after this, Frank and his sister started calling to him “Alex sit! Alex Roll over! Alex, bark like a dog!” And all these other things that you’d tell to an animal. They also asked him to twerk in the aisle and do a lot of gross dances. He did what they said because he didn’t really realize that they were laughing AT him and not WITH him. 

At this time, I didn’t do anything. I thought the bus driver would take care of it, but she didn’t. On the second day that I was back on the bus, they tried it again. Only this time, I actually told them off. I was aggressive about it too. I don’t LIKE confrontation, but I’m not afraid of it, and when I go off, I GO OFF.

So Frank tries making a joke out of it, but I shut him up by telling him that if he tried it again I’d report him and Jen both to administration.

My question is: Am I the asshole here for not just reporting him then and there once I had proof of his wrongdoings? Should I have passed the issue on to authority without getting myself involved? Some other kids on the bus have been telling me I should’ve just reported him and not said anything at all. I kind of agree with them, because I think I scared Alex in the process, and he didn’t really seem to have any problems with what they told him to do, and it seemed like he was always having a good time doing them. Am I the asshole?

Edit: After seeing everyone’s responses, I feel a lot more comfortable in my actions and don’t regret them as much. I’ll try to talk to Alex tomorrow to clear everything up and make sure he’s okay, and I’ll also report them to administration if they try ANYTHING like this again. Thanks for the feedback, and I’ll probably remove this soon so it doesn’t seem so much like a brag post."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c0b0ks	2019-06-13 20:33:47		AITA for thinking Barry is gay?	"So yeah, this isn't exactly some huge issue in my life or anything. I'm just curious. I hope this isn't as silly and petty as it seems to me right now, haha.

I recently got into a little bit of an argument over the movie 'Split.' The movie, as everyone probably knows, has a character with multiple personalities, one of which is Barry, a mildly flamboyant fashion designer.

I saw a comment in a YouTube video about Split, which briefly referred to Barry as being gay, and in the replies, a person was asking if Barry was actually gay, and I responded with this: 

>Not canonically, to my knowledge. But he's a little flamboyant, he's into fashion, it's fairly safe to assume he is. Not that every guy who's into fashion automatically has to be gay, but it just kinda makes sense to think that Barry might be.

The person then responded to me with this: 

>That is incredibly offensive to assume that. Not all gay people have to be into fashion and flamboyant? Seriously? That's stereotypes. Men can have feminine traits without being gay, and men can like fashion without being gay. Besides stereotypical traits, we have no proof or evidence that he is gay. we saw him for about like what, 5 to 10 seconds throughout the movie? you cannot predict this character's sexuality just on the basis of ten seconds at the very least. 

I apologized, and I see the other person's point, but I still don't really think I said anything offensive. I'm pretty sure the character was intentionally written that way, and I just thought it was something that everyone kinda knew, but just didn't talk about much since it doesn't really matter. But I could be wrong, and that's what I'm here to find out. So, what do you say, reddit? Was I really an offensive asshole here, or was the other person just overreacting?"

c0b0g2	2019-06-13 20:33:28		AITA If I Cut My Parents Out of My Life?	"(Throwaway Account)

&#x200B;

I am a 33F and my parents have been going through a divorce for the past 2 1/2 years. 

&#x200B;

Growing up they provided for me very well and we had a somewhat stable home life. 

&#x200B;

There are often times now where I have turned to them for financial assistance, and they have been there for me- but they have also expected to be repaid in return (anything given is with strings attached) and have constantly held the financial favor over my head, even when repaid- regardless of the fact that they are both considerably wealthy and I am not at all.

&#x200B;

I have never expected hand outs, I have also worked hard my entire life - multiple jobs at once at times- to provide for myself as an adult- but when times are tough they've been there- and I have always given back in return, even when I can barely afford to.

&#x200B;

I scrape by to pay for life saving medication I need monthly, that my father always promised to pay for me, due to the cost and that he can afford to help, at $100 a month.

&#x200B;

Since divorcing my mother he has a new girlfriend with two children. She is a lawyer and decided not to work and instead go on disability, and her adult children do not work and have severe issues and drama.

&#x200B;

He supports them emotionally and sometimes financially and is physically present in their lives.

&#x200B;

I have had to beg him for the medical and financial assistance since their relationship started, and recently he has not been reimbursing me and this has put me often times in debt. Yet he takes vacations, takes her on dates, out to nice dinners, Disneyland trips, etc. 

&#x200B;

My entire life my mother has been critical, narcissistic, self absorbed, and constantly contacts yelling and breaking down about how cruel my father is. She tells me detailed intimate stories of their relationship, his unfair treatment towards her, and has even gotten police and lawyers involved, and has tried to push me away from him and from his side of the family.

&#x200B;

I am always put in the middle of their personal and financial battles, and since I was a child have been given the most gritty and intimate details of their 'goings ons'.

&#x200B;

After two and a 1/2 years of trying to wrap up their expensive, messy divorce they are finally finishing up in court. 

&#x200B;

Both of them are fighting over their significant wealth- property and assets.

&#x200B;

They have recently reached out to my sister and I, trying to get us to testify for them in court, against the other, about who was/wasn't gifted a certain piece of property.

&#x200B;

I have had enough. But sometimes I need the financial assistance, so I stay in contact...

&#x200B;

My father also repaid a personal loan of mine- about $3k and I am slowly paying him back...

My wife grew up on a ranch and has no problems with dog poop, horse poop, cow poop, cat poop, or any other kind of animal poop. It’s kind of gross. 

It’s not like I didn’t know this already. When we were dating we would visit her parents at the ranch and occasionally a dog would poop in the house.  Nobody would clean it up for ages whereas in my house growing up if a dog pooped inside it was cleaned up faster than immediately. 

Today she dumped a bunch of used cat litter into our garbage cans out front. Not all of it made it into the can. When I discovered her mess two hours later our dog was feasting on it. So gross. 

When confronted she acted like I was a big jerk. She told me she cleaned it up the best she could which is what my kids would’ve said. I put at least two more shovels of grossness into the garbage can.

I'm 13 years and last year, my parents divorced and my mom met my step dad four months after divorce.
My step dad absolutely hates me, he doesn't tell me that, but he tries to make my life miserable.

Yesterday, we moved into a new house and the thing is, there is 2 adults (my mom and my step dad) and 4 children in my family (me and my 3 brothers). However there was only 3 beds and 1 mattress which was on the floor.

I asked where the 4th bed frame was, and apparently he forgot to order one, which he clearly didn't as he was laughing about the situation.

He told me I'll have to sleep on the floor.
I disagreed and he punished me by taking away my phone that I had to buy with my own money + took away my Nintendo Switch that I also bought with my own money with a Part Time Job. 
+ I was kicked out of the room and had to sleep downstairs.

So to keep things brief and honest, my significant other (28f) and I (31m) began our relationship through an affair. This, no doubt, makes both of us serious assholes. We dated a little in highschool, broke up due to the age difference and timing, and reconnected years later while she was married. It started as an emotional affair and went from there. My SO knew she needed to tell her ex-husband immediately that she wanted out and leave him, which she did. She told him everything, left him most of their assets and took what they deemed was fair of their savings. As divorces go, it was amicable and they were divorced pretty quickly. 

We truly love eachother more than anything, and wish we would have gone about this in a way that didnt cause people to get hurt. They are now divorced and we have been together for about a year now. We have admitted what we did was extremely selfish, hurtful, and wrong, but we do not regret being together. My SO does regret her first marriage more than anything, and wishes she would not have rushed into a marriage so young.

One of my good friends (I'll call Leo) decided he could no longer associate with me because of my actions. It hurt, but of course I understood because I did a terrible thing, and there are consequences to actions. He decided to tell me this at a party we hosted at our house. During this conversation he called my SO a slut, and said he would never be able to trust me around his new girlfriend. I didnt argue with him, and accepted that he no longer wanted in my life. He decided, ""for the sake of our friend group"" he would stay for the party, but just not talk to me. I didnt want anymore drama, so I let him stay. After that night, he actively tried to get all of our friends to stop talking to me, but none of them isolated me except for him. 

It has been about a year.
Cut to a few weeks ago. Leo reaches out and is trying to be my friend again. His dad was just diagnosed with a chronic condition that will be fatal, and he knows I went through something similar, and now he wants me to be there for him through this. I told him I was so sorry about his dad, but that he burnt all his bridges with me and I couldn't be his friend. My friend group is split on whether I should allow Leo to be my friend again.

My mom has a home daycare and asked if I would put my assistant license to good use, and work with her so she could take on more kids for the season. I said sure. I came up with an awesome lesson plan and I love the kids, it’s been great.

I do feel there are times my mom takes  advantage of me, she normally has me do most of the work with the kids while she does stuff on the computer which is fine (it’s bills, taxes, etc.) But then she gets mad if I need help or “mess up” (aka, she assumes I did but I didn’t). She talks down to me and I hate it. 

She’ll occasionally apologize when she realizes she went too far but it’s rare. She’s always been a bit of a narscacist. Then today, it happened again. I vented to my brother in what I assumed was private and told him given all I did, I felt I deserved more respect. My mom overheard and got mad. After the kids got up from nap, she told me to forget it and to only come out if the state inspector comes (partially why I’m there). She did this in front of the kids. I told her no, that I’m not going to sit around and do nothing. She told me not to argue in front of the kids and I said she started it and told her all I wanted was respect. She claimed she had apologized (she hadn’t) and that I should leave the daycare portion of our house. I didn’t and helped the kids with snack. I told her I planned the lessons for this month and wasn’t going anywhere.

Now we’re not speaking. I’ve told her I don’t mind doing what I do, since it’s my job, I just want more respect from her. She hasn’t made me leave since and is back on the computer, I’m with the kids. Reddit, AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	389.0	99.0	0.0	0.0

At least once a week, I will get stuck behind a school bus which stops at one house for five to ten minutes. This isn’t on a corner where many kids will come and get on the bus.

One day, the bus drove off without him because he never came outside. I sat there for 15 minutes that day. I have no idea why the bus stays for so long and doesn’t leave if he isn’t ready.

I want to report this to someone. If it’s illegal to go around a stopped school bus, even if the kid isn’t even outside, I don’t think that those of us trying to get to work should be inconvenienced for one child who can’t be ready on time.

So basically, my dad is sick, he caught a cold a few days ago, and my close family (me, my mon and my dad) are eating out at the moment (as in right now). He ordered another beer while I was still halfway through mine, but as it’s towards the end of the meal he didn’t want to drink it all. Therefore, as it arrived he took a drink from it and then poured about half of it in my glass. He does this often, not specifically with beer, but with other drinks too. He also does this with other things like if there’s only one desert spoon, he’ll want to share it.

Now, I don’t think I’m a germaphobe, but I do like to avoid getting unnecessarily sick, so I really dislike this behaviour as it effectively “taints” the drink/food/spoon for me.   

At the same time, I do feel like he does it for my own benefit, such as ordering a beer to share because he knows that I want to have a bit more but not a whole one or ordering a desert after I said I don’t want one, taking a spoonful, and then giving me the rest because he knows I’ll then eat it (psychology is weird).

About a year ago I changed jobs. My new job came with a significant pay rise as well as extra benefits. I also started my own business on the side that has been doing OK. All of these events have given rise to my parents both proclaiming their pride in what I have achieved.

One evening my mother starts to ask about the new job, why I left the old one etc etc and I told her about the pay and benefits. She asked me about my salary and, this is where I fucked up, I told her what I earned and the benefits etc. I asked her never to repeat it to anyone and that I didn't want anyone to know about it unless I chose to tell them.

About 4 weeks ago I got a promotion, I called my Dad to give him the news. He was delighted and told me that he would call me back as they were out for lunch with friends when I called. That evening my mother called me to say congrats and proceeded to tell me that when I called that afternoon she was soooo proud of me that she went and told the couple that they were having lunch with the exact figure and benefits that I earned. I was so pissed at her. I told her that she betrayed my confidence and that I couldn't trust her. I then asked her if she had told anyone else. She said that she hadn't. I pushed her again and she again denied telling anyone else. Then I asked her straight out .... ""Did you tell my sister?"" and she replied ""Yes I did but that's different, that's family"". So now my mother has betrayed my trust and lied to me. I lost my cool with my mother and hung up on her mid-explanation.

I followed up the conversation with a message telling her how I was disappointed in her and how she had betrayed me and that I could never trust her again. She responded with a message saying that she was ""Sorry for being proud of me"". I get that she was proud but she didn't have to tell the intricate details of my life to someone I barely know.

So I haven't spoken to her since that volley of messages and I honestly don't know if our relationship will ever recover. I honestly thought that I could trust her with this information. She still thinks that I over reacted but I think she stepped way out of line.

John has taken to joining us on Wednesday nights at the invitation from one of the church's admin assistants, who helps run the study with me. I don't necessarily feel unsafe around him, but he always monopolizes the conversation and I have a very difficult time steering it back on track. His personal hygiene is not that great and he has extremely long nails, one of which has nicked my arm before. John seems relatively bright, but the conversation tries to get back on track and John can't follow, he immediately tries to bring it back to something he's more interested in, essentially turning it into a social hour. It's very taxing for me to have to repeatedly get us back on track, and other people tend to laugh uncomfortably and indulge him or just try and keep their responses to his questions limited. He also does things like throwing salt over his shoulder and engaging in other superstitious beliefs/activities. I'm concerned that as people drop in or try to join in the study he's going to make them uncomfortable and continue to derail the discussion, which hasn't been particularly on course for several weeks. 

&nbsp;

John has been homeless for a long time, has refused all offers of assistance, and never seems to be particularly hungry or in need of anything. He has a relatively large circle of friends I work at a nonprofit (though I don't deal with issues of poverty and homelessness) and I have a large network of people who could point him toward everything from legal help to shelters to educational resources, but he doesn't want any of it. (Which is perfectly fine, I just say all that to say, we're not deliberately ignoring someone or turning him away from having his basic needs met.)

&nbsp;

I have thought of moving the bible study inside, to a small room with stained glass windows that would be perfect for it, and where John wouldn't go. (The weather stays pretty mild year-round, so unless someone affirmatively moves it we would generally have it outdoors all the time.) But I'm genuinely conflicted, and just typing it all out makes me feel like an asshole. 

&nbsp;

**TL;DR:** WIBTA if I moved a bible study group to a place where a homeless person wouldn't attend anymore to keep him from derailing the discussion or making attendees uncomfortable?

&nbsp;

ETA: John does not seem to want to participate in the actual Bible study. He follows along when we read, but his topics of conversation are always purely social and he tries to keep the conversation to socializing."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I have two classes with this boy who absolutely hates me for no reason. I've never formally talked to him before, nor did I even know him until this year. He doesn't like my friends and he goes out of his way to be obnoxious towards me.

He's done little things before such as locking class room doors when I'm trying to enter them, blocking me from my locker, announcing to the entire class when I've been on my phone and exaggerating laughter when I've answered a question wrong or a teacher made a comment about me. He's constantly looking and glaring at me. He's constantly talking sh\*t about me (allegedly) as well.

Today in class we were making envelopes for an ill teacher of ours. He came up to me, unwrapped a sticker, leant OVER my friends desk and MY FRIEND and threw the sticker at me. The sticker landed in my hair, and being as I have frizzy curls it got tangled in my hair. Before I could react, he grabbed a fistful of my hair and forcefully pulled the sticker out while laughing. I got very upset that he put it in my hair and told him to fuck off and never touch me and that we weren't friends, don't act like it. I think I crossed the line, but I also think he did too.

Get your heads out of the gutter.

&#x200B;

Yo guys. So this is the first post that I have ever made, so if there are some rookie mistakes, it may or may not be because I am a rookie sooooooooooooooo... ON TO THE STORY!

&#x200B;

So I occasionally play smash with one of my friends. The other day we were playing some matches. (we played about 3 matches) until I inevitably play my main (Falco). He goes one of his favorite characters (Captain Falcon), This is a matchup that I know really well, but we go through with it and we fight. While we are playing I can feel him gradually getting more and more frustrated. He starts to complain about the game and the fact that my main ""Takes no skill, It's just pressing buttons"" I just ignore them. You guys know how it is right? Sometimes you just have what I like to call a ""Rage Day"". I could tell that he was having one. Like 2 minutes in I get him with a b-air and I say ""Dang, I really got you with that one"".

&#x200B;

Well, apparently that was the opposite of what I should have said because he then says ""Thanks for pointing out all of my mistakes"". It was a statement absolutely SOAKED with sarcasm. The thing is I wasn't just pointing out his mistakes I was pointing out my own as well. Well, I beat him in the end, but it's not like I crushed him. It was a pretty close match. After that, we play one more match. He goes dead silent. When I beat him the second time. He quits, which I'm fine with, but before he left, he said the crucial words ""I'm gonna go, I'm just not having fun playing with YOU anymore"" which leads me to the question. AITA?"

We met at work (a hospital) because he was training me as a mentor. Before we met, I worked in another department and had another mentor. A girl, who I later found out had had a one night stand with my bf before we got together. I was shocked at first that he didn’t tell me straight the away, I worked it out myself and asked him if they’d had sex and then he came clean. No biggie, it was before we met and I liked her as a person. However, my boyfriend would always say she is bad at her job, she’s bad in bed and some other intimate details casting her in a negative light. 

Now last week my bf lost his phone so he left his messages logged in on my phone. I saw they had been messaging each other - he said he had lost all his sexy photos of her, she sent a few, there was sexting. She asked if he would leave me for her, he said no because he is in love but then called her ‘his weakness’. He then arranged to go over to her house for sex but when I confronted him he promises me he backed out when he got there. They just smoked a joint and he left because he felt too guilty

I was so angry I text her to confront her. In my anger, I decided to tell her exactly what my boyfriend says about her behind her back (see above). In retrospect I feel it was cruel but I was so mad I wanted to hurt her and let her know that he really doesn’t care for her like she fantasises he does.

c0am4p	2019-06-13 20:01:07	comicfan1918	AITA for not wanting my family to have my comics if I die	"I have collected comics my entire life. My dad would read them to me as a toddler, and I have loved them ever since. I'm 25 now and love them more than ever and have collected around 5,000. I even have a large Marvel tattoo on my leg. Comics were something my dad and I really bonded over. We loved buying them together, going to conventions together, and seeing all the movies opening weekend together. I have an older sister, but she has always hated them and ridiculed me for it saying it was embarrassing seeing pictures of my cosplay on Facebook knowing her friends would know that was her sister and I am such a nerd/loser. My mom would also tease me, but not as mean spirited.

At first, my dad said his collection (about 20,000 comics) would be split between my sister and I. I was totally fine with that, but my sister wasn't. She was adamant she wanted nothing to do with any of them- not even if I sold them and gave her the money. Dad even tried to find characters/covers that reminded him of her, and she would always reject them and throw them back in his face.

Dad died 3 years ago, and he had made it clear for years since my sister didn't want any, they would all go to me to take care of and love. He privately expressed relief they would go to someone who values them the way I do. However, my mom hit me out of nowhere last week saying, ""You know, if you die before you have kids, I am taking all the comic books and giving some to your sister."" I said absolutely not. I have a husband that Dad and I got into comics 4 years ago, and I want him to take care of them if I die young. Also, fyi, I am totally healthy and not on the brink of death (although cancer in your late 20s is prevalent in my family). My husband, who lacked a father figure until he met my dad, also bonded with him over comics and the two of them were close and loved each other.

I said for one, his original collection is now intermixed with mine, and I am not undoing that because I refuse to manage my favorite hobby around my unlikely death, but she isn't happy about that. I decided if I did die, I want my husband to keep anything he wants. However, if he gets remarried and his new wife doesn't like how much space they take up, I understand and in that case he is to sell them (he knows their values and how to do it correctly) and donate the money to a reputable charity for children's literacy. I have no doubt he would honor this.

My mom is still very angry. It has caught me off guard because she isn't some money-hungry crazy person. She does extensive charity and volunteer work in our community. She isn't calloused or unloving towards me either. I was very sure I was right, but she has really worn me down. So AITAH here? I know my dad saw the comics the way I do, and that doesn't include anyone making a profit off them- not even me. Am I wrong?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c0akx0	2019-06-13 19:58:31		AITA for asking for percentage based pay for installing a countertop?	"This summer I am working for my uncle who is a construction contractor. He has a big job building a house which I am happy to work for an hourly rate, $12 cash, but somedays when the weather is bad we can't work on that job. To keep a flow of work, he'll look ahead to see what days he can schedule side jobs so that on the days where we can't work outside, he'll have work inside. 
Today we went to a home of one of his friends to install a new kitchen counter top. It was just me and him and we finished in about 5 hours. He was cut a $500 check and we headed home. He asked me to record the hours on the day but I said I thought I was getting a percentage since we completed the job together from start to finish. He goes ""oh yeah? How much do you think you earned?"" I said $150 (a highball but I figured I'd start there at a 70/30 split). He says no way and says it's his job and I'll get paid what the agreed hourly rate is. He also says that if I didn't know how much he was paid we wouldn't even be having the conversation and it's insulting that I'm asking for that much. 

My rebuttle was that while the hourly rate is fine for the big job with lots of moving parts on his end (assigning various tasks, purchasing materials, communication with his boss, etc.), today's job was saw through completely by two people and therefore I should be paid by percentage of the job's pay. I also told him that if I didn't see the check I would have asked anyway then discussed getting paid based on the check. If I were to be paid my hourly rate it would come to $60 which when compared to the $500 payment made to him for the job, it seems like I'm getting screwed since we did it together.
Obviously he deserves more than me for being the finder of the job, having the knowledge to know how to get it done properly, owning the tools, and bringing me to the house; but I don't think I'm out of pocket for asking for a percentage rather than hourly considering the amount he was paid vs how much we both put into it. 

It was settled by taking the hourly and just accepting that I should be grateful for any opportunity to work and that he needs the money more then I do but I don't think I'm TA for asking for a percentage.

c0ajy9	2019-06-13 19:56:22	griefmarriage	AITA for getting upset that my wife started a relationship with our neighbour a few weeks after she split up from me.	"So about 18 months ago our baby daughter died. I set myself the task of supporting my wife and keeping our family together in the face of this tragedy. We tried to have another baby but after a couple of miscarriages my wife suddenly told me she wasn’t sure she wanted another baby and felt she needed to concentrate on herself. I told her that I would love another child but that if she didn’t want one I would support her. 

Around this time she started to pull away from me. I asked her about it and she said that I reminded her of our daughter’s grief. She stopped asking me about my grief and stopped supporting me through my grief. 

After a few months of this and her not telling me what was wrong she told me she didn’t love me anymore and wanted to split up. I asked if she would go to marriage counselling with me, suggested that this might just be a response to grief but she was determined to end the relationship. I obviously felt betrayed. I still loved her but felt she was abandoning me when we needed each other the most. 

I moved out and we agreed to remain friends in particular because we wanted to work as a team to raise our son. I said that she could keep our house for up to two years to help her establish a career she enjoyed not just take the first job that will pay enough (there is a very small mortgage) and I would move into a flat share because that was all I could afford. We agreed we would split everything 50/50 when it was sold. I would come and spend time with my son at our house because I couldn’t have him at our flat-share too much. 

My wife had been flirting with a neighbour for the last 6 months and a few months before she told me she wanted to split up (and for the first time in our relationship) I said to her I thought her flirting had moved beyond harmless. After we split up I thought that she might end up with him and I did that classic thing of going on a few dates with random people to move on and try to protect myself in case she ended up with this guy. 

About a month after we split up I told my wife I had been on a couple of dates. A few days later she told me that was going out with our neighbour. I got really angry and told her she was out of order. She said that I had been on two dates and it wasn’t my business who she went out with. I said that going out with someone I knew, only a few weeks after we split up was disrespectful. 

I told my wife that I didn’t think I could now spend time with my son at my wife’s house. That I now felt it painful to spend time with her on in her house. I told my wife that I wanted to sell the house so that I could get my own place and have joint custody of my daughter. My wife has told me that she doesn’t want to change her current job because she doesn’t want our son to spend 9.5 hours in school everyday.

c0ahd1	2019-06-13 19:50:32		AITA for only calling my dad when I'm asking for money?	"So to make a long story short, my parents got divorced seventeen years ago when I was six years old and my (then only) brother was two. Even when they were married, he was at work all the time and gambled a lot so I rarely saw him unless I happened to wake up at 4am when he would be leaving/coming home. 

After they got divorced, my mom got full custody of us but has always been very open with my father that he's welcome to see us whenever he wants, and if we wanted to spend time with him we could. The court also ruled that he would have to pay child support, as my mom moved us in with my grandparents because my dad didn't allow her to finish schooling or have a job while they were married. He never paid, and my mom was afraid that he would get a warrant for his arrest for not paying, so she signed something absolving him of having to pay her child support, despite us needing the money. She even went as far as to help him get set up at a pretty nice condo, which he later lost due to gambling his money away, and lived in hotels for most of my childhood. 

(Just for clarification, my mom remarried when I was 10, so we didn't remain in poverty and living with my grandparents for long.)

In the seventeen years since the divorce, he has never once reached out to me or my brother, and we always have had to call him first to spend time with him. When I became old enough to fully understand everything that had happened (around 11-12), I began to resent my dad and never really thought of him as truly being my father. He still acts like everything is normal, and always tells me and my brother how much he loves us and how we are his reason for living, but I just don't see him as my dad, and ever since I was 11-12, I only call him when I want him to give me money or buy me some food. Usually it was just $20 every other week, but in college I got angry with him because he wouldn't spot me $200 for a plane ticket when I studied abroad. He guilts me whenever I ask him for money, and always talks about how he ""doesn't have a penny to his name,"" but he always has a stack of hundreds in his wallet that I know he saves to gamble with. (I've gotten confirmation from my cousin that even though he swears he stopped and hasn't gambled in years, he still does every week.)

I do feel some guilt when I do this, but I feel like he owes it to us since he didn't pay my mom child support when she was really struggling. My mom bears no ill will toward him anymore, and has chastised me when I opened up to her that I only use him for money and don't think of him as my dad, saying that I shouldn't talk like that.

Even my brother, who doesn't remember when we lived with him because he was only two during the divorce, told me I should still love him because he's our dad, and that I should stop using him for money. 

I just can't decide if this is something that I'm justified in doing or if I really am just being an asshole."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

1. Me 
2. My EX-boyfriend == my now roommate. 
   1. We mutually broke up because he started doing drugs and I had an issue with it. At the end of the day though, we still love each other and ended on amicable terms. We were always friends first and a couple second. For now we are amicable roommates while I move out and find another place. 
3. My friend, Anna\*
4. Her husband, Manna\* == Manna is my EX's drug dealer friend. 

**The Incident:**

Last weekend Manna, my EX, and I were at the bar while Anna was home with the baby. Manna and I decided to play a game of darts. When I went to pick up some darts on the floor, I noticed he checked me out. When I walked back to hand him the darts, he whispered in my ear that I ""have a phenomenal ass.""  He gave me the 'fuck me' eyes. I pushed him and said ""don't talk to me like that."" Then he said, ""enough foreplay, I'm about to teach you a lesson."" When I told my EX about this later, he kept rationalizing his friend Manna's shitty behavior. IDK in my opinion, it's wrong for your friend to hit on your ex-girlfriend but that's just me.  I realized at this point that my EX is kind of a pussy. He didn't want to stand up to Manna for the sake of maintaining his relationship with his drug dealer 🙄My EX told me not to tell Anna anything. For the sake of keeping things civil between us, I kept what happened to myself. 

**Let's get back to my friend, Anna. Here is why Manna is bad for her:**

* A few days after the ass-incident, Anna caught Heather, a known drugs-for-sex prostitute, sitting on her husband's lap at the bar. 
* Also I recently learned, Manna told her that giving her a wedding ring was a mistake. 
* Manna also told my EX that his marriage to Anna isn't going to last. 

I know this is hard to hear, but Anna is in denial and all the signs are there. Manna isn't being a good man to her right now. This weekend, all 4 of us were at the bar again. Anna and I had to stop Manna from hitting on multiple young women yesterday. Anna was clearly hurt. I finally told her what Manna said to me last weekend. 

**My EX is mad at me now.** He says I'm fueling drama-- that it wasn't my place, I shouldn't have said anything, and that I had the wrong intentions by telling Anna this. Yes, I am upset Manna and his drugs ended my 2 year relationship. But I think Anna deserves to know her Manna f\*cking sucks. Frankly, I think my EX has his own ulterior motives with drugs.

So I was sitting in my science class and I had an immediate urge to run to the bathroom and throw up. (But in school you had to raise your hand to go to the bathroom and that took at least another 15-20 Seconds before the teacher realized.) As soon as she said I was okay to go I walked out of the door and started sprinting to the bathroom hoping to make it into a stall. As soon as I took my first step into the bathroom I threw up all over the floor and felt better.

c0af58	2019-06-13 19:45:23		AITA for calling my mom toxic?	"Since I remember myself, my mom has barely ever paid attention to me. I don't even remember her that much in my childhood, mostly, I've been raised by my grandma. Whenever I tried to tell her some story that I thought was interesting and excited me or was important to me, she always kept cutting me off, either with criticism or to just tell me to cut to the chase and finish faster. 

Recently, I started a new job, it's been a month and it hasn't been easy, I was under stress since I started working there. Today, finally felt like a good day, I didn't feel dead inside and I made some progress with new co-workers. I came home and tried to tell her how good of a day it was. I was genuinely happy and couldn't wait to share the news with her. I told her I was given much more work than I usually am given (I usually stare at the wall or read a book for most of the time), so I didn't feel like useless garbage and had a nice conversation with few of my coworkers, I got offered a drink (Redbull + Vodka) from my manager at the end of the shift. I work with the sales department and they usually get energetic drinks almost every day so I see no big deal with that, since I've had a few here and there during work before to stay awake. I have made it by myself at home while my mom was around and she was completely fine with it. But for some reason, before I even finished my sentence, she lashed at me ""ABSOLUTELY NOT, DON'T DRINK THAT, IT IS GARBAGE AND SO BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH"". For the record, we both smoke (she's been smoking since I remember myself) and she is perfectly aware that I drink whenever I go out with my friends at the pub. It was a bit of a surprise to hear that with such a serious tone as if I were a kid (I'm 23F) and I said, I know, but if you let me finish, you'd know that I said no because I wouldn't be able to sleep tonight properly. She wouldn't stop and continued how bad it is for help, which annoyed me and I just said I have had energetic drinks before quite a few times and see no problem with it, I drink with my friends sometimes when we hang out and she seems to be okay with it, so why won't she let me finish the story, let alone the sentence which wasn't groundbreaking at all . I got upset because all I wanted was to tell her a story and she wouldn't let me talk properly and started yelling at me. Left me feeling as if she hates that I'm happy or succeed at something. Then she out of nowhere tells me that maybe I just hate being happy because it feels unsettling for me and I made myself angry out of nowhere just for the sake of it. I was shocked and couldn't believe what was coming out of her mouth. I just told her that she is just a toxic person to be around and always has something negative to say. She felt insulted and told me to don't talk to her.

c0aeod	2019-06-13 19:44:21	theUnoDosTres	AITA for not wanting to care for my aunt ?	"Quick back story, my aunt has never done anything alone. When my gramma was alive, she supported my aunt, but when my gramma died, my mother took over. She is not mentally or physically disabled, just so used to being coddled that she cannot survive alone. 3 months ago, my Great aunt (mom's 55 year old sister) moved in with me, my wife, and two younger sisters, aged 24 and 20 (one of whom we pay to watch our kids).  This move-in was always only supposed to be temporary, with the condition that we all worked together to keep a clean house, etc. My wife was generally okay with her moving in, saying that she'd be more than happy to take care of her as long as she helped with the kids. 

Well, that hasn't been happening. My aunt has been talking down to my wife, complaining about her behind her back (with hits like ""Oh she's ruined my pots"" and ""oh you don't cook well"", both of which are untrue), to the point where my wife cannot stand to be in the same house as my aunt. Because I understand how grating my aunt can be and because no woman should feel unhappy in their own home, we decided to finish out this lease and move out in March 2020, on our own, with an open invitation to my sisters as they've done alot for my kids, and without my aunt. This did not sit well with my mother.

I talked to my mom face to face about this because she is my aunt's main benefactor, and let her know that we are not going to be living with my aunt come next year, and we planned to let her know. My mom basically called me an asshole and that she wouldn't survive on her own. I advised that my aunt move back home, where my family owns 3 homes. My mom says that she doesn't want to force my mom to move if she doesn't want to. When I told my mom that she can't force us to keep an AUNT AS SHE'S NOT EVEN EITHER OF OUR PARENTS, my mom flipped out and said FINE, I'LL JUST HAVE YOUR SISTERS LEAVE TOO. Mind you, one of my sisters watches my kids while my wife and I work rotating schedules to pay all the bills (My aunt only pays about 10% of the bills while we pay the other 90%). Taking away my sister would be a huge blow to our finances as we have two toddlers, and daycare for 2 kids is expensive, and my mom knows this. I know what you're thinking, my sisters are in their 20s! they can make their own decisions! Well, my mom is good at guilting people into submission so even though they both WANT to stay with me, she has her ways of manipulating them. 

I love my mom, but I just can't take care of my aunt anymore, and my wife cannot live with my aunt either.

c0aema	2019-06-13 19:44:14		AITA-For thinking that one daughter should get a worse punishment than the other when they both broke the same rule?	"Throwaway, because it’s mandated by the courts of the AmItheAsshole subreddit.

Our daughters...don’t get along. At all. One day Emily went to Ruby and said “Why aren’t you with your friends? Did they have better things to do than to spend time with a loser?” Basically, a generic insult. Ruby responded by saying “At least I’m not a dumbass attention-whore who will spend the rest of her life going to “$15 per hour” rallies because the only job she’ll ever get will pay minimum wage.” 

They both broke the “be polite” rule, but Ruby said is much more hurtful. What would insult you more, being called a loser, or what she said in response? 

Reasons why I might be TA:
1. I might be hypocritical.

2. Ruby was provoked, Emily wasn’t.

3. I spent much more time typing out my defense than I did for this.


Reasons why I might not be (TA):
1. What Ruby said was much less of a generic insult, and hurt mainly because what she said had some founding to it. Emily always had average grades while Ruby always had an A, and Emily is known to be overly dramatic. I’m not trying to compare them, I’m just saying why it was so hurtful.

2. Two wrongs don’t make a right. 

3. Ruby clearly had an axe to grind. Even though she said it in anger, it arguably shows how she views her in general. She wouldn’t have called her an attention-whore unless she thought that she would do just about anything for attention, knowing how she decides her insults.

Well follow Redditors who enjoy judging those who wish to be judged, what is my judgement? Also, if you can, please include a discription of why you chose your vote.

Side notes:
My husband said that he supports my choice, because I was the only one to see it happen. In order to avoid any confusion, both of our daughters are related biologically. (In case anyone thought they were step-siblings.)

Edit: Well, I’m the asshole. I’ve decided on punishing both of them, but Emily much more harshly. Also, apologies for those annoyed with my overuse of “probably”. Since this is a throwaway, I’m deleting my account."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0ac7j	2019-06-13 19:38:34		AITA for using the stove in my shared flat?	"I'm living in a flat that I'm sharing with my roommate. I didn't know her prior to me moving in 6 months ago but we get along fine. We're not friends but we talk a bit and we have the same level of cleanliness (which is a jackpot when it comes to roommates if you ask me).

I love to cook for myself because a) it's relaxing and b) I save money instead of eating out. Generally I use the stove about 3 to 4 times in a week and mostly for cooking larger amounts to last for several days. My roommate on the other hand cooks once every fortnight I'd say. The rest of the time she eats cereal, sweets, toast or fruit.

Shortly after moving in my roomie remarked in an astonished manner ""wow, you do enjoy cooking! Do you always eat a warm meal twice a day? That is unusual!"". I thought nothing of it (also, I do think that it's normal and that quite a lot of people eat a warm meal twice a day? Where I'm coming from we eat warm meals three times a day, e.g. rice for breakfast). A few days later texts she texts me out of the blue with photos she took in a book store. The photos were from a book called 'how to live environmentally friendly"" or something like that. All in all she sent me about 20 pictures on how to save electricity, how to clean properly... Tips like ""fill the washing machine to the brim, once it's running it's using the same amount of energy, no matter how big the load is"" (which is, in my humble opinion, a shit tip because stuffing the machine to the limit prevents the load to wash properly. But I digress) or ""heat water up in the electric water heater prior to cooking it on the stove"". I just thanked her for the tips. Everytime I cook and she's at home she wanders into the kitchen and remarks ""oh, cooking again? What are you making today?"" or something to that extent.

All in all I get major vibes that she thinks I'm wasting energy and racking up the electricity bill. Cooking is no longer enjoyable, often times I feel like doing something forbidden. I know that it's my damn right to use the stove in a flat that I pay half the rent for, but could she be right? She's never confronted me about it but I'm sick of feeling like sneaking around in my own kitchen while hearing those remarks.

I love my parents (except my step father) but me and my dad have always been be oil and water. We never fought but we never fully connected. The best way I can say about my dad is he was a bully in high school I would of been hes target if we were in the same school. Plus he wasn't always in the picture alot. ANYWAY now you got the context, last year my father has been asking me for money here and there for awhile it was small, 50 bucks one week, 100 the next and so on. One day he broke down and cried to me he was a heroine junkie. I was mad and I was hurt to know my own father was using the money to get a fix and putting that shit in him. I'm still hurt, I told him get clean or I'll tell my sister (hes daughter) because I'm not dealing with hes bs alone. Well he got clean....so I think. We tallied up how much he owes me which came to $400 dollars. Recently I learned that he borrowed $500 dollars from my sister (she is still unware of him taking heroine). Now he claims it was just for utilities and such, I'll give him a small benefit of doubt. However its almost been a full year. I still have not gotten back my money nor my sister and we are getting more annoyed because hes trying to buy a new truck... He can buy a new truck but he can't pay hes own kids back.

So I am a black female dating a hispanic guy and the majority of his friends are white save for a few more hispanics. We live together so we have a lot of parties at our place.

Part 1: Me (13m) is in 7th grade while this 6th grade girl keeps saying hi to me non stop evem though I don't know her. Her 2 friends does it aswell, but 1 of them stopped when I made it clear I do not like that. At first I said hi back out of kindness, but it's legit annoying now. Whenever the leader of the group sees me all she says is ""hi (my name!)"" And it's annoying tf out of me. I told her to leave me the fuck alone and they told me if I said ""please"" they'll stop, so I said ""can you PLEASE leave me alone"" but they only stopped for 2 weeks.

Part 2: the one who stopped because she knew I didn't like that actually said hi to me again and was probably sent to do it by her friends because I noticed they were looking at me. I looked her straight in her face and said ""I don't like any of you"". The smile on her face disappeared and she said ""huh?"" So I repeated what I said the first time so she just walked away. When we were switching classes this same bitch looks at me with an attitude, and in my mind I was like ""don't be mad because I don't like your ugly ass"". I didn't say it directly to her but after that she points at me and the boy sitting next to her looks at me. I said ""what the fuck are you looking at"" and walked on the other side of the wall so neither of them could see me. When they were all walking out of the class one of my classmates said ""the girl in the yellow ugly"". The only girl who was wearing yellow was the one who I was talking about earlier so I was damn near laughing my ass off but held it in. my main problem with her is that she's basically acting like I'm obligated to say hi to her when I don't even know her. Her brother is just as annoying and her older brothet who is in my class is also annoying. I actually was about to beat his ass once but he got scared at the last moment and didn't do anything.

c0a8kg	2019-06-13 19:30:10	filipinoJo95	AITA for refusing to go on Christmas holiday with my family?	"This Christmas 2019, my parents planned to go to Canada to see relatives. They initially offered to pay for me as I have just started my job after graduating, therefore I have not saved much. I even said I'd be willing to split the cost of flight as we are flying from UK, therefore flights will be around £700 at Christmas time.

&#x200B;

Cut to today, dinner, Dad says Mum ""accidentally opened and read my payslip from work"". Mildly annoyed, I roll my eyes but don't make a big deal out of it because believe it or not this does not come as a surprise (also because I'm exhausted from work). Coincidently, my Dad brings up Canada:

""Well, since you're earning \[X amount\], I'm sure you can probably pay for your own flights now""

I reply: ""I might not be able to because I can't afford it right now, I'm trying to save""

""But you are earning \[X\], surely this is nothing to you. Start saving now \[Y amount\] every month""

I stay quiet because them using my payslip against me AND telling me how to spend my money has severely put me off.

Dad, noticing I've stopped talking: ""I have no words for you... You can't even do this for your family""

Classic. 'Asian guilt trip method'. I reply: ""It's not to do with family, I just don't have £700 to be throwing around""

Mum: ""But you have the money for you and your boyfriend to go on holiday""

I knew they would go for this. That holiday cost less than half of what they're getting me to pay.

I once again repeat that I cannot go and promptly leave after this to avoid further stress.

&#x200B;

I might add that I'm not just being a cold-hearted brat, refusing to see relatives for Christmas. These relatives are ones I've not seen or talked to in almost 10 years, not very much in common, grew apart - thus you can see why I won't exactly be devastated. Second, if my parents hadn't gone down the ""let's mock/guilt trip her"" route I would've been far more inclined to go out of my own pocket. Who would want to spend Christmas away from family? However, their actions has just left a bad taste in my mouth and tbh, this is not the first time they've done something like this.

"For a little bit of background, my roommate and I work at the same job. We work with children who are between the ages of 5 and 12. Some of the children at work act a lot older than their age, and I know for me personally, I sometimes forget how young a couple of the girls in particular actually are due to how mature they act. In addition, I work very well with children and I love my job a lot, my roommate on the other hand tends to be super short-tempered. A lot of the kids gravitate towards me rather than her, and I think she was beginning to feel slightly bothered that they often pick to hangout by me. 

One of the aforementioned girls that is very mature came up to me right before my shift ended today and says, “I heard you have your nipples pierced. Roommate told me.” This caught me off guard, and I was with a group of a lot younger girls and boys that all clearly heard her say it. I shut it down really quickly and told her that’s not something she should be talking about and asked her to stop bringing it up, but the damage was done and I had multiple of the children ask me what nipple piercings are. I’m genuinely worried one of these young kids is going to go home, start asking their parents about nipple piercings, and when asked where they heard that, their response will be “One of the teachers at work has them.” And I will look extremely creepy to a parent that has no idea how their kid actually found out about them. 

I pulled roommate aside and asked her why she told children I have my nipples pierced, told her it’s not okay to be talking about that with kids, wondered why that was even brought up, and told her I plan on taking them out (even though they would never be able to be seen through my shirt at work), and that I was upset she was talking about me to the children, because who knows what else she told them. She quickly got defensive and told me I was being overdramatic and that it’s not a big deal. She thinks I’m being petty for taking them out. 

My boyfriend agreed that she was an asshole for telling kids that, but I’m not sure if I’m being an asshole for taking them out to basically prove a point, but also to try and prevent a further situation if an angry parent learns their child knows about my indecent piercings."

I keep having the nasty voice in my head but I decided until I get a reality check, I can’t do anything to help.

So basically my boyfriend is a streamer and very talented, I love video games myself even if we differ in the style we play, he was telling me about this website where this guy had put up stats on all the characters and “how good the characters are”.

Now I study psychology, and I know it’s dumb soft science that nobody respects but I have had MUCH training in statistical analysis; it’s the only part of my degree I’m proud of because it’s the only part that actually took work and showed progress.

So one of the rules of stats is that you can’t directly measure abstract concepts; for example you can’t say someone is “76% depressed” because we don’t have a way to measure direct depression, we can only measure symptoms such as lack of appetite or changes to sex drive etc. it should also be noted that the population you measure has to be relevant to the variable you’re measuring, you can’t be doing a study on how often women buy perfume if your population includes men buying perfume as a measured variable for a random reason unless it’s actually a goal to study it.

This guy had some variables listed that could be measured such as how often the character was chosen and how often it does, but he listed a few abstract concepts as well and some of his variables like for healing were measured with characters that don’t even have healing powers. Creating many outliers and skewing the data, I know it’s all virtual reality and at the end of the day nothing matters except whether or not you’re good at playing this character, but I suggested it wasn’t a great site to use for acquiring data and it might just be someone who was paid to promote the game this way and he says I just don’t understand the game, my pride was hurt I’m not going to lie, but I know how to read charts and I know how to look at proper variables and I just wanted to help him. 

I’ll also note that at the end of the conversation, it was just you don’t understand the game and me being a little upset but we’re not fighting and I’m not trying to control his style because he wouldn’t be doing as well as he is if he didn’t know how to do it. But AITA for pushing to not trust fake stats?

TLDR; my boyfriend used a website to acquire stats in best character to play for a game, I can read stats and found the measurements faulty and told him so, he says I just don’t understand the game


EDIT: I stopped in to talk to him and apologized if I lectured him and told him half my responses think I’m an asshole 

He responded: can you really trust that statistic?

c0a6qn	2019-06-13 19:25:59	Annabanaana	WIBTA if I asked my half sibling to ask our father to stop trying to contact me?	"Prepare for massive background story, not native English speaker, on mobile, you know the drill. 

I went no contact with my father roughly half a year ago. He has never been present in my life, I was always an afterthought for him, and he never honestly cared about me or my wellbeing. He had been an awful person to my mother. He has cheated on his wife with my mum, and is still married to the same woman. He has two kids with her, my half siblings, whom I’ve never met because he never wanted me to. But he also always insisted that he wants me in his life, and that I mean a lot to him - at least that’s what he said but never showed. He’s never been present, and when he was there physically he wasn’t there mentally. 

Most of his friends don’t know about me, they don’t know he had three children, not two. When we went out he’d never introduce me to anyone. No one would ever be told “here’s Annabanaana, my daughter”, only “here’s Annabanaana”. He also never paid child support, and in the few months when he did he paid below the legal minimum. 

I cut contact with him, after a culmination of many things, in November. He only said “fine then”, nothing more. Then he started asking if I’m “feeling better now”, or if I’ve “calmed down” over Facebook. Then he started calling, texting. I ignored everything. I do not want any contact with him ever again. But recently he’s started calling daily, messaging me wherever possible constantly. I want him to stop, but I don’t want to block him because I want to know when he messages me or calls me, so that I have proof later if needed. 

Essentially, I know my step brothers name, and once my father made me friend him on Facebook. Would I be the asshole if I asked my half brother to tell our father to stop calling and messaging? Should I not bring him into all this? 

Ps. I’ve started referring to him as sperm donor instead of father. It’s hilarious I love it."	Not the A-hole	0	0	332.0	132.0	0.0	0.0

My parents are giving me a hard time for it though and suggesting that I’m trying to make him a girl. I personally see clothing as gender neutral. If he likes it he can have it. But they’ve said I’m forcing it on him?

While in class, she was playing with an eraser and chatting with another classmate. Then she accidentally threw it at me. So I threw it back at her and asked her if she was even working. She responded “Yes” and I so I yelled at her “Well it doesn’t look like your working!”

She and her husband have said they are looking into fertility/sperm donors (he's transgender, so they can't naturally have kids, but that's nothing to do with my issue). There are several reasons why I think she's wrong here...

a)I've known her my whole life, and she has never wanted or enjoyed kids. I have a lifetime of examples of her showing disinterest in babies/children. b )I (and my whole family) think her husband is pushing her to have kids and she's only agreeing to save her marriage. There's also a feeling that he's emotionally abusing her and her marriage has been strained for years. c) Knowing her as I do, I really think she will resent the kid later on and possible cause emotional abuse toward the child (intentional or not). She can be quite cruel to those she's annoyed with and I worry for the kid. I also think the father would do so, and also be an irresponsible parent. 

I'm considering mentioning all this to her, my parents already have, but she just insists she wants a kid too. It's not wrong to honestly want or not want a kid. I just think she's doing this for all the wrong reasons and the most important part here is that no child deserves a mother that never wanted them. No child deserves to be mistreated because the mother resents it for keeping her in an unhappy marriage or living a life she didn't want. I feel some sort of due diligence to say all this before it's too late. Am I wrong here?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

A couple months ago my friend (let's call him Jack) got rejected by a girl he was really into (we'll call her Anna). It was really hard on him, and he told me that she really meant a lot to him. They've remained friends since then, despite her having a boyfriend. Just a few days ago, though, Anna broke up with her boyfriend. Anna contacted Jack, and they now have plans for a date this weekend. Sounds like a happy ending for Jack, right? Maybe, but something else happened between the time he got rejected and now. Another girl (let's call her Kate) professed feelings for Jack, and basically asked him out herself. Jack told me personally that he wasnt that into her and that he wanted to keep the relationship on the DL, but that he would give her a chance just because he didnt really have a reason not to. So I was like ok, this could be beneficial if it helps you get over Anna. Jack and Kate ended up doing it the first date. I was honestly a little disappointed Jack told me about it as it seems like something personal, but I didnt say anything. I also didnt tell him that I thought it might be a little inappropriate to do it with a girl he didnt really have a ton of interest in on the first date. This stuff seemed like none of my business, so I just let it go. But now, with Anna back in the picture, Jack just dumped Kate right on the spot. This time is did call him out. I dont think he should have just used Kate this whole time as someone to just fuck around with, waiting for Anna to become available. Now, Jack is pissed at me for criticizing him about his actions.

My boss came and discussed with me other things he had for me to do and told me if I’d like to leave early that day I could work later the following day as compensation. So I told my girlfriend about this and mentioned picking her up from school because I’d be free then.

So I inform my girlfriend I will not be able to pick her up and she proceeds to give me hell for it. Telling me it was the second time I did something like this blaming me for not being able to leave.

&#x200B;

**Background Info:** We were high school sweethearts. After our bad break up, we did our own thing after high school for years. Our paths crossed and started dating. I want to be as fair as possible and will let my partner read this. 

&#x200B;

**Situation:** We were talking on the phone and money was brought up. My partner asked me how I got into such huge debt that I am slowly paying off. I responded honestly that most of the debt was my long-term ex's. He then asked me how come I don't make him pay me back, and I just said I don't want to see him ever and I don't mind. It's the price I pay for lending someone money, even if they are my SO.

&#x200B;

For record, my partner owes me a lot of money currently. He has paid most back, but it has been a while. I don't mind being patient because he has always gotten me whenever I am low on cash.

&#x200B;

Then my partner said, ""wow. What a jerk off. If we ever broke up, *I would still pay you back no matter what.* I would never do that to you.""

&#x200B;

I responded back, ""actually, you have. You owed me like $70 in high school. After we broke up, you even flashed the money in my face at \[teacher class\] and said 'I will never pay you back' in front your friends. So, don't say you would never do it. Because you already have. You can say 'you would never do that to me now' and I would believe you.""

&#x200B;

He said he doesn't remember that event, but I promised him it happened because I remember the pain I felt.

&#x200B;

Then he started to get upset and asked me why I brought up the past and trying to hurt him. I tried to reassure him that I didn't bring it up to hurt him, I only mentioned it to correct himself that he has hurt me before. This lead to me not believing him that he would pay me back after we broke up. Since I ""believe"" he won't ever pay me back, he would just give me back all my money and never ask me again. I tried to convince him I don't think about the money, but I was honest that sometimes I do think he won't pay me back since it has happened before, but I trust him. This lead to a fight about me not trusting him ever while I was trying to explain I wanted him to understand from my perspective, but if I really didn't trusted him, I would have never lent him money in the first place.

&#x200B;

The fight eventually ended and we both apologized. I told him I wasn't sorry about mentioning high school because it was something that has happened, but he still thinks I should have not mentioned it at all since we both agree our high school relationship is completely different than our current relationship.

&#x200B;

So Reddit AITA for bringing up an awful memory from high school?

"SO needs me to pick him up at some vague time in the afternoon so he can move his work truck from one place to another.  It's an hour drive from where I work and I have a meeting in the afternoon I have to work around.  He asked me earlier what time I was available and I said ""after 12 PM but I will have to work around my mtg"" and then he didn't really respond after that.  I called him at around 1130 AM to get some info so I could plan the rest of my day and he told me he still doesn't know because apparently now his truck is broken and he needs to figure out where to get the part, when to fix it, etc.  I asked a couple questions (I can be a little too ""gung-ho"" about planning and wanting to know what's going on) like what happened with the truck, why did it break again, could he give me at least an hours notice etc. and he got super annoyed and told me I asked too many questions and was stressing him out and he brought up some issue from a couple days ago saying it was my fault that the truck was broken.  This resulted in an argument because I felt like he was treating me like an Uber by keeping me in the dark and just wanting me on standby until he needed me. He then told me I was ""being dramatic"" and had a bad attitude, that I was just making his day worse and hung up.

I feel terrible right now because I never had fights over such stupid things in relationships previously (eg, if my exes needed me to pick them up they would tell me and if I asked them what was going on it would just be a discussion) and I'm wondering if I really just have an entitled attitude with him or something in regards to information? Like I guess he's not obligated to tell me what's going on? But I also feel like he's being really rude when I'm going super out of my way and taking time off work to help him? Was I being an asshole?

ME: Hey when do you need me up there? Can you give me like an hours heads up?

Him: Why

ME: Because it takes me an hour to get there.

Him: Oh well I don't know when yet. I need to get a part to fix my truck because the air is leaking:

Me: Oh shoot it's broken again? What happened?

Him: It's been broken because you made me leave to hang out with you two days ago because you had to go home, as always, and now it's worse.

Me: I'm sorry I didn't know it was broken you never mentioned it to me - I wouldn't have asked you to come hang out if I knew? Can you not blame it on me?

Him: Whatever, I don't need this shit right now. You're just making my day worse. I'll call you back later. (Hangs up)

Me: (Angry) Wtf can you not hang up on me??? I'm sorry i won't ask so many questions I just didn't know your truck was broken and I'm not an Uber so I just wanted to be in the loop.

Him: Your attitude is horrible. I don't need your shit right now. If you don't want to help me don't help me. Are you going to help me or not?

Me: (Crying) Yes I'm sorry.

c09q6g	2019-06-13 18:48:44	aitadaddy	AITA for not visiting my dad and younger sibling because of their disgusting house	"This is my first post on Reddit, but this is a difficult situation and i dont know if my actions (or lack thereof) are justified. 

I live with my mother and brother, and visit my father and younger sibling a few times a year. They live in a different country, but it hasnt really been an issue since i could visit any holiday, and i usually stayed a month over summer every year. The last couple of years though, it hasnt been as often, because i really have a need for personal space, and they have a small 2 bedroom house. That means my brother would stay in the loft, and i would have to share a room with my younger sibling. This wouldnt be a problem, but they are MESSY. Im talking cat piss, old food, and all of their clothes on the floor. My sibling also has toys everywhere, and my dad is pretty much a hoarder, as he hasnt gotten rid of anything since me and my brother were babies. 

However, my dad built an annex of some sort, basically a spare bedroom for me in the garden. It was great, there was very little mess, if there was any i could easily tidy it up, and i got some much needed space. I have never had my own room over there before, so it was very much appreciated. 

This is where the problem comes in. My dad has a mate who has now moved in to my room, and is paying rent. So he cant really kick him out (he’s in a bad place economically) and i havent got a room. My dad said i could take his room or the living room (both incredibly messy+everybody would come in and i wouldnt have any privacy). This makes me not really want to visit, and since its summer he’s used to me staying for at least a few weeks.

So AITA for not visiting? I have a great relationship with my dad and sibling, and i love the city theyre in, so its not an easy decision."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

  A little background:my dad and mom got divorced when i was young and soon after he started dating this women. This women proceeded to abused me and we lost the court battle and my dad didn't believe she did so he just thought i jist didn't like her. Now to the story:My dad gets visitations every other weekend and this was his weekend and he got married a few days earlier. When we where talking he said that he was sorry that he couldn't invite me because it was a small wedding and that my half sister wasn't even invited. I said that i didn't care but i guess i said it in a way that sounded like i didn't care that he got married. He started asking why i didn't want to go, i only said that i rather sleep then go since i was drained from energy due to testing. The true reason was because i hated the person that he married but i couldn't say that so i made bulls*t excuses. In the end we sat in silence for the rest of the time untill we got to his house and he left to have a meet up with the people there. Am i the asshole for saying that i didn't want to go to my own dads wedding.
Edit:The reason why i wasn't invited was because it was for adults in the close family and im a teen,i didn't think i needed to clarify that but tell md if you need more info."	Not the A-hole	0	0	22.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

I feel really bad for this guy cos on friday i know theyre going to her house and probably going to do the deed, i just feel guilty for not saying anything? i have one more exam for GCSE's and then im going to a different college than her, so its not like we'd still be friends.

Here’s my situation: as a whole I hate when people ask me questions in a way I consider to be putting my words into my mouth


Examples 
 “you guys don’t work on this, do you?” 
“You don’t like music, do you?
“You don’t like food huh?”
“It’s expensive huh?” 

I get customers who called in and ask these questions  sometimes they are fluent English speakers sometimes they need some work grammatically but overall I’m not explicitly making it harder for customers whos first language isn’t English.

Cust: “Hey you guys don’t work on roll up doors, do you?”
Me: “uh, we do”
Cust: “ it’s expensive huh?”
Me: “ I didn’t say that”
Cust: “ -on the phone silent- uhmmmm what?”
Me: “I didn’t say it was expensive.”
Cust: “oh uhm how much does it cost?”
Me: “I’d need to know more information, but it can start at $75”
Cust: “it’s too late in the day huh to take it huh?”

Fuck man it’s just like a circle that I get so impatient with. 

If one of my friends does this I’ll usually call them out for putting words into my mouth. A common joke with my brother and I is “who said that? I didn’t say that did you say that?

c09ien	2019-06-13 18:31:41		AITA Spilt Beer on a Rug	"So I live with my cousin (M28). He has a rug be got from his parents house. Its a nice rug. This past weekend, myself (M24) and friend were at home having a few drinks, and spilt a coloured drink on the rug. Shit. I immediately texted him knowing how he is about his things. Told him it was an honest mistake, and he began berating me calling me names and asking questions about what we were doing, wanted me to get it professionally cleaned (money is tight for me, so not an immediate option). I genuinely told him about the spill to avoid the onslaught of annoying asshole he can be.  


Fast forward to yesterday. I left work an hour early, went to the store, got some cleaning solution, raced home, scrubbed the shit out of the rug. I literally was dripping sweat by the end of the process. Let it dry overnight, hopefully its gone in the morning, if not I will try again today.

&#x200B;

This morning, he messages me asking how I cleaned it because there were still stains on the rug. There are other stains on it that isn't my beer, so I am not sure if my scrubbing worked yesterday. The messages started by him telling me theres still stains on the rug. I (fully knowing how this converstation will go from here) asked him to clarify, what stains, where, can you send a pic? He responds he will be fucking pissed if I dont do anything about this. And his mom is already pissed at me. I then got triggered because why would he tell his mom... Were adults (kind of funny LOL). 

&#x200B;

Long story short, he offered to help me pay but now has leverage by using that against me when we inevitably have a conversation about this and my main argument for not calling a professional was that I could try to clean it myself. Finished the conversation by him saying if I don't do anything by the weekend, were going to have a totally different conversation, passive aggressive/threatening AF.

c09hfe	2019-06-13 18:29:33	Ninx27	AITA for acting petty towards a customer?	"I work at a grocery store that sells sandwiches made fresh in the morning, then get put on sale 2 hours before closing to sell as much as possible by closing time. An unofficial rule we don't tell customers that if there are too many sandwiches or if the sales are slow, we can start it half an hour earlier (2 and a half hours before closing). This is the time we usually go by.

Now there was a customer none of us really liked, rude customer (RC) was a standoffish Asian woman that looks to be in her 40s. RC would just point to the sandwiches in the case and say ""this, this, and this"". She'll be sure to tell you that you didn't pick the exact one. If there are 2 sandwiches of the same kind and you didn't pick the one she was pointing at, RC would raise her voice a little and say ""No."" then taps on the glass again to point it out. It becomes a game to reach for each one and check her reactions.

RC would also try and demand that we start the half off sale early. Our closing time could be 9 pm and RC would come in at 6 or even 5:30, ask ""half price yet?"" then demand to see a manager when we tell her no and that we won't start early for her. We were polite to her everytime but she never showed the same kind of courtesy or respect back.

The tipping point for me was when RC actually snaps her fingers at one of my coworkers and waves her hand to come over like a servant. That ticked me off.

A few days ago, RC showed up early again and we do the whole routine again. She asks for the manager who tells her no and to wait for the 2-hour mark, which we complied to wait as well. After getting told off, RC hovers around the department a little until the 2-hour mark comes. I made sure to be the one to serve her.

I then proceed to move as slow as I reasonably can to tick RC off. Normally I'd grab all the sandwiches in one go to speed the process. This time I picked one up, place it on the table and go back for the next one. I did the same when cutting the sandwiches, one at a time with a leisurely pace. When other customers show up, I asked my coworkers to help so I could devote my time to RC. After cutting the sandwiches, RC told me she wanted them heated as well. We have panini presses but only one was working at the time. She just wasted even more time as I worked the panini press while humming to myself. I eventually got her sandwiches done the ways she wanted and she left in a huff.

My coworkers and I were laughing in the kitchen and the coworker with me even told me RC had an annoyed face on everytime my back was turned. It felt so good.

However, my family doesn't agree with what I did. They said that working in customer service means you have to deal with them and not stoop down to such petty action. They said I should be helping her more and that I was wrong and rude for doing that to RC.

I never acted this way towards a customer until RC and I don't think that what I did was that bad. AITA?"	Not enough info	0	0	360.0	11.0	0.0	0.0

And all though out our history together he’s had trouble finding a suitable relationship. I want to make it clear now that I NEVER meddle with his love life before. 

He had a girlfriend in high school but that failed due the him being cheated on. Since then he craved to find someone that could be special to him. He’s the nice type of guy and often women overlook him for someone more into the scene, that bad boy I guess. So 2 years ago I moved to Texas with my girlfriend and a couple of months after he found someone. I was excited, I knew how much it meant to him. He’s very much in love with her so I was dying to meet her. After all she’s taking care of my best friend. I soon found out she was transgender. I have nothing against transgender people but this instantly made me think that he’s just settle for whatever he could get. So I felt bad for him and spoke to my girlfriend who told me to mind my business and let him be. Months passed me and my girlfriend move back near my best friend and I meet her for the first time. I was honestly shocked she was transgender because you would have never known but I guess in all honesty it just made me feel a little more uncomfortable with the idea of them being together. I acknowledged my bias and set it aside only looking at what’s best for him, or what I believe is best for him. She can’t give him a family which I know he wants, or a life where he doesn’t have to be worried about who’s going to make fun of them, surgeries, and all that extra stuff. So I tried to break them up but was stopped by my girlfriend who let me have it after she figured out my plan. She’s currently pissed and says she’s disgusted by my actions and my best friend won’t talk to me. 

Once again, I do t have anything really against her, my discomfort is something I have to deal with but looking at the big picture here...she can’t do much for him. 

Serious question, am I the asshole for trying to lookout for my best friend? I mean I just want him to have a life he can happy with and I don’t know if his “girlfriend” can actually provide that."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c09ftr	2019-06-13 18:26:00	wutheringsights	AITA For telling my Mother what I do is none of her business?	"This may be long. I apologize, hopefully this all makes sense.

So I am 25F and still live at home with my parents, along with my two brothers. 
Lately my mother had become increasingly more obsessed with knowing every detail of my life.

So the small stuff:
•She’s always texting me wanting to know where I am, with who. If I don’t answer her, I will keep getting texts.
•If I tell her I’m going into town(just for shopping, or date) she needs to know why, exactly where I’m going and with who, and if I don’t tell her before I leave, she grills me when I come home.

The big thing that started this:

So the other day I went to lunch with my brother and his girlfriend. We had a great time and that was it. We saw a friend of hers with her husband, and said Hi. 

Then this morning my brothers girlfriend(BGF) gets a text from my mother wondering who came with me to lunch. BGF then corrected her saying that it was only us 3 at lunch. 
Well mother’s friend has told her that she saw another man come and sit with me...which did not happen. 
So my mother starts grilling BGF thinking that she’s just lying and covering for me. 

So, at this point I’m furious because again she’s trying to figure out everything I’m doing, but this time she’s trying to get the info from others.

Then later on I get a text from her that went like this:
“My spy told me that she saw that same guy with you that was at (another location) last week”

Now, her friend, without going into too much detail had a medical episode earlier this year that has left her memory less than ideal, so I said:
“Your spy has memory issues. There was no one else there except me, (brother), and BGF”

Mom: “I’ll ask (friends husband) if he saw anyone”

Me: “There wasn’t. And even if there was it’s none of your business.”

Mom: “oh really? That’s pretty rude.”

—————
So there we have it, I’ve been pretty upset about her boundary issues for some time.
I also know that she’s going to blow this out of proportion and completely be pissed at me for wanting some freedom.

I have a friend though that says I’m being too harsh on her and just tell her where I am whenever she asks.

c09dn6	2019-06-13 18:21:08	johnsmith_md	AITA for accusing my coursemate of lying about her claustrophobia?	"I am a university student. We are currently trying to decide our accommodation for the next academic year (starting in September). There are enough rooms for all of us; however, some rooms are obviously better than others. There are a few basement rooms which aren't great and tbh, no one wants them. So, to make it fair for everyone, we decided to put all of our names in a hat (basically a ballot), and as names are drawn out at random, the person can choose the room of their liking.

&#x200B;

This became awkward when two of my coursemates (X and Y) said that they have claustrophobia and would therefore not be comfortable in a basement room. X then said (of her own accord) that she would be willing to provide a doctor's note to prove that she has claustrophobia. I agreed with this, and subsequently said that it would only be fair if X and Y provided doctor's notes. Y said that we should be able to appreciate that she has a phobia, implying that a doctor's note shouldn't be necessary. I replied saying anyone could claim to have a phobia, so some evidence would in fact be necessary. Y replied assuring us that she isn't lying. I replied saying that we need to be sure as we want to make this ballot fair for everyone. Y got pretty annoyed by this, basically saying that I was being mean. I replied saying that if she has genuine medical reasons as to why she should be exempt from this ballot, it shouldn't be that difficult to get a doctor's note.

&#x200B;

Some of the group side with me, whereas others think I was a dick. AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: The prices for all the rooms are based on their size and independent of the floor on which they are located, so they are not in our control. Also, the accommodation is owned by the university, so they set the prices for each room.

&#x200B;

"Tl;Dr: I run a Dungeons and Dragons game and one of my players didn't speak to me for a month while they had some mental illness problems. I planned a mini campaign for the other players to fill the time, but now the friend is back. WIBTA if I told them I wanted to finish the mini campaign without them?


Okay, there's a lot more nuance to the situation but I tried to make a concise TL;DR. 


At the beginning of the year I started DMing DnD for my friends, there's 6 of us including me. The youngest player is 21ish and the oldest is almost 30. Everyone has different schedules, but I keep on top of everything to make sure we get to meet once or twice a month.


One of my players (let's call her Sarah), had a pretty major surgery in early June so I knew we wouldn't be able to play for a couple weeks while she healed up. She started feeling better and wanted to know when we could meet again (at her house, so she didn't have to sit in the car). 


I was trying to organize everyone's schedules, but another player (DJ) was not responding to any messages. Sarah and DJ are close, and one day Sarah told me DJ was having some mental health problems and wasn't in a place to speak to anyone. Obviously Sarah couldn't tell me exactly what was going on without betraying any trust, and I was okay with that. I was a little frustrated DJ couldn't even pass a message along that he was feeling unwell, but I get it. 


After the current story ""arc"" in my campaign, I was going to let my boyfriend DM a mini campaign where all my players could make different characters (and I would play too). Since DJ was AWOL, I asked my bf if he could prepare his campaign sooner and we started to play that instead. 


We have played one session of the minigame with plans to do another this weekend, when DJ came out of the blue and said he was ""back from the void."" No vague explanation, no apologies, nothing. DJ has not spoken to me for almost a month. So, I'm a little miffed. I understand mental illness is really rough (everyone in the group struggles with it) but it's still frustrating to me that they won't give me a little courtesy apology.

My boyfriend said I should tell DJ we are going to finish the minigame without them, and I'll let them know when the regular sessions are starting back up.


I guess that's a good compromise, but I'm worried that they may take that really hard (especially since they've just had a really hard time) and that my other friends (especially Sarah) may think I'm being rude. While DJ didn't speak to me for a month, we only could actually play in the past 2 weeks so maybe I'm being harsh as well. I honestly don't want to play the minicampaign with DJ, because it will take forever for them to make a character and I just want to continue what we started.

c090le	2019-06-13 17:52:47	-worryaboutyourself-	AITA for not letting my nephew move back?	"My SIL lives in a small, foreign country (SC) that had a conflict last year. She has 4 children from a previous marriage and 2 from a man she married in SC. She has a disability that ensures she gets payments each month for herself and 5 of her children (the 5 born in the US). She does not have citizenship in this SC so she is forced to come back to the US at regular intervals. Child 1, 3 and 4 live in the US with their bio dad and child 2, 5 and 6 live in SC with SIL and her husband.

About a year ago, her husband in SC called my husband to explain that SIL was being crazy and trying to move back to US with his 2 children (5 and 6). He said a lot of very mean things about her and insulted us by saying we didn't value family as much as he did. After this argument, SIL contacted us about child 2 staying with us in US and going to school in our small town. He would go to SC for school breaks and summer breaks. We agreed because #2 said that her husband had been very mean (we never got the full details and didn't badger him as he is only 13) and he wanted to leave SC and stay with us but still visit mom in SC. When they came back to US a couple weeks later (SIL, 2 and 6) we decided that 2 would stay with us. SIL was in US until Sept and he moved in with us then. We only ever received about half the money she gets for 2 at intermittent times to help out. She gets this money from the gov't so she definitely receives it every month but doesn't always pass it along for 2.

This year, 2 has decided that he wants to live here in US for a couple months so he can do a fall sport and attend school here, and then move to SC and do online schooling and then come back to US for a spring sport and school. I expressed that online school is not ideal as 2 needs a tutor in a couple subjects and it's important kids have a routine and going back and forth between 2 countries is not a great idea. She informed me that she is the mother and this is what her 13 year old wants to do and I have no say. Technically correct, but he's living in my home and disrupting my children's routine as well by going back and forth all the time. My home is not large enough to accommodate a person who only lives in it for 5-6 months of the year. My 2 children are sharing a room so that 2 can have his own room.

I let SIL know that this arrangement of going back and forth between 2 countries is not going to work for me and my family and certainly not for her son. I told her she will have to find other accommodations for him if this is what they want to do. Am I the Asshole?

TLDR: My nephew moved in with me for the school year due to family issues. Now that it's been a year, he wants to only live here half the school year and the other half in a 3rd world country with his mother. I told them he can no longer stay at my home with that arrangement because it disrupts my family's routine and I don't agree with providing an online education for him from 3000 miles away."

I told her I do it out of habit and I try to use “baby” instead of “my baby” 

Yesterday I used “my” again and she snapped and I got fed up and I told her is not my fault how her previous boyfriend treated her and this is a different relationship. I’m not possessive nor manipulative and I definitely know she isn’t mine as in possession.

c08v2v	2019-06-13 17:40:57	caartgirl72	AITA for not telling my best friend/former boss that his current employee was leaving to work where I am working?	"Some backstory:  I was an Operations Manager for a residential facility for about 5 years, working for one of my best friends (also the CEO of the company).  Being in that position essentially required being on call 24/7 and after 5 years, I was pretty burnt out.  I left that job about 3 years ago to work for another company.  The current Operations Manager contacted me a couple months ago to inquire about a position that was open where I currently work.  She feels completely burnt out and her health has been negatively affected. And, she is also a friend of mine as we worked closely together at that organization and became very  close. She asked me to please not tell the CEO (my best friend) that she was looking for other jobs, that she would tell him once she knew her plans.  I told her I would not as this was her business with him.

About 2 weeks ago, she interviewed at the place where I work.  After she told me that she had interviewed, she told me that she had told the CEO/my best friend that she was looking for another position because her health was being impacted by the stress and long hours.  The CEO stated that he had hoped she would be able to stay.   Several days ago, my current boss asked for a reference for her as she was going to offer her the job.  So, they offer her the job, she accepts and then she promptly gives the CEO/my best friend her two weeks notice.  

Within a few hours, I get a text from my best friends significant other, who also works there, asking how long I've know that she was going to leave and come to the place I work.  I tell him that I knew she applied for a couple of positions  and that she had interviewed within the past week.  He proceeds to send me shitty texts saying that if I was a good, loyal friend I would have given him a heads up she was leaving.  I responded by saying that I was under the impression that he knew she was looking and that she asked me to keep her confidence and frankly, it wasn't my business to tell him.  He responds with more shitty texts pissed that I was ""in the know"" the whole time and didn't reach out, and that she only gave 2 weeks notice and if he had more of a heads up he could've been trying to find someone else.  I told him again that was not my responsibility how she did it or how much notice she gave.  He responds again basically saying I'm a shitty best friend and it was awful that I betrayed him to keep her confidence.  I ended the conversation by saying that I was done and he could think what he wants.

So, AITA?

TL;DR: I didn't tell my best friend that another friend was leaving his company to come work where I work.  His SO thinks I'm a shitty friend for not giving my best friend a heads up."	Not the A-hole	0	0	19.0	5.0	0.0	0.0
c08ueg	2019-06-13 17:39:27		AITA For exploiting someone's social anxiety?	"Okay, hear me out.

Ever have that feeling when you're on your bicycle and you're behind someone and they're just that tad bit slower than you? Of course you're going to overtake that person but since you're at nearly the same speed usually that person ends up eventually overtaking you again and it always makes for an awkward moment.

Anyway, this happened today for me.
I was behind someone on bicycle, he was a school going dude, probably 16 years old and was behind me. He overtook me and about 15 meters afterwards started slightly slowing down to his I assume normal pace, which was below my normal pace so I gained some ground on him. He looked back and saw me getting closer so he speeded up again. I have no clue why I did it but I also speeded up a little for I guess a little race? So eventually, about 2 kilometers further (it's a long bycicle road) we were at 27KM/H and I saw he was getting rather tired and slowed down. Nothing happened after I overtook him but I found it rather funny that someone would go to those lengths to not be overtaken.

Of course I shared this story with some classmates and we all had a great laugh. After coming home I told this at the dinner table and my dad thought it was pretty funny, but my sister said I was a massive asshole, and how I would've felt if someone did that to me.

c08u1t	2019-06-13 17:38:39	rastogishubham	AITA for giving being angry at my mom	"TL;DR: Dad lent money to Mom's brothers who didn't pay it back and since they apologized mom wants to give them a free pass. I got super angry because of that and cussed them out, mom got upset because she didn't want me to be disrespectful to my uncles as they are elder to me.

7-8 years ago my dad had loaned a large some of money to my uncles, my mom's brothers. With the agreement that they would pay it back with a certain amount of interest. Since it was family, my dad didn't sign any sort of agreement.

Stuff was fine for a while and they were paying back in time, but around the end of 2016 they said that they wouldn't pay the rest back. There was quite a hefty sum left, even without counting the interest. I was in college at the time with my last semester left, I also have a twin brother who was also in college, so my dad was counting on that money to come in time to pay for our college tuition. 

When they met to discuss this further, apparently they were both super rude to my parents. They insulted them and said a lot of disgusting stuff like my mom is the reason their dad (my maternal grandfather) died etc. It became a huge fight. Luckily my dad had an emergency fund of sorts which he used to pay for college. 

We stopped talking to them. A year or so later my uncles said that they would pay back the money slowly and they started doing so. In the end they paid back the principal but not the interest. They said they won't pay the interest as ""they don't have money"" but the evidence is to the contrary as they both bought luxury cars in the meantime, one of them bought a new (pretty expensive) apartment and their kids are studying abroad too. Which means they don't have money to repay their debts but they have money to pay for all of their extravagant lives. 

So cut short to yesterday and my mom and dad are visiting me (I have graduated and am since working in a different country than my parents live in). Mom told me that she has started talking to her brothers again because they repaid the principal and ""apologized"". This pissed me off a lot because they insulted my mom, jeopardized both me and my brothers future, used the money they owed us to buy whatever the fuck they wanted and said something like they are sorry and apparently that's enough to get a free pass. 

My mom said that because they gave the principal back, she is okay to forgive them, but my argument is, if it was a bank, could you just do that? Could you just take a loan on a house, default on payments and then give back the principal and not pay the accumulated interest? Not only that, insult the bank in the process? 

So in anger, I told my mom that I was extremely angry and didn't accept her decision at all. I also cussed my uncles out to which she said that I should never disrespect my elders (we're brown so that thing is kinda important). So now I feel conflicted, so am I the asshole here? Is my anger justified?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	2253.0	324.0	0.0	0.0
c08tlo	2019-06-13 17:37:37		WIBTA if I helped my sister get high?	"Excuse my formatting, I’m on mobile.

I (19M) was hanging out with my sister (16F) last night and she asked me if I’ve ever smoked [weed] before, and if I’ve ever gotten high. Initially I lied to her, saying I haven’t, but I later decided I didn’t want to lie to her, and I told her the truth, that I have smoked and I have gotten high before.

She revealed to me that she’s never done anything before, she really wants to try it and get high. She said that she has no idea how to get weed, and that none of her friends do it. That made me rather relieved, because I hate today’s teenage drug culture. Everyone does it irresponsibly and sometimes it leads kids down bad paths (i.e. prioritizing it over school, always doing it, etc.). That’s besides the point.

She asked me if I could help her get weed. She says she really wants to  try it, but I didn’t like her reasoning. She said she wants to try it “so she can say she’s done it”. I don’t like that, but who am I to judge other people’s reasoning? I don’t get high anymore, and I don’t see the appeal in it. Our dad is also anti-drug, believing that you don’t need it to have fun. It was after a conversation with my dad that I decided there’s no need to get high anymore. However, I tried it for the first time at an age younger than her, and would it be bad of me to deprive her of the opportunity to experience something?

WIBTA if I gave my little sister edibles to get her high?
This way she can experience the high without necessarily smoking. My reasoning here is that if she really wants to do it, she’ll end up doing it. At least this way, she can get it from me, which would be safer than some teenager getting stuff from who knows where. She’d do it at home, and I [sober] would be with her.

c08tes	2019-06-13 17:37:10	ameba_ameba	AITA for not wanting to rearrange my plans to accommodate my sis and BIL with a 1YO?	"My immediate family (all married adults) is planning a big family trip to Disney and trying to figure out where we're going to stay. We want to stay on property for the convenience and full Disney experience. We go every 2-3 years and have done both on and off property hotels and prefer staying on.

Sis and BIL want to share a room with someone to cut costs, but their 1yo is a challenging sleeper who goes to bed pretty early. Whoever stayed with them would be pretty put out on a fun vacation by having to be super quiet in the room and potentially being woken up in the night if he's fussy, so no one is volunteering.

Sis and BIL are getting upset because they're saying they can't afford it if they have to pay for their own room on property. They're talking about not going because of it or at least staying at a different hotel off property. While we obviously want them to be able to go and would love for them to be able to stay with us, so we could spend more time together, if they can't make it work, they can't make it work.

Either way the problem is that they're already playing the guilt card. They don't want to feel isolated by either not going or not staying near everyone else, and it's our fault because we wouldn't share a room.

Are we the assholes for not going out of our way to accommodate them?

Edit: thanks everyone for the input so far! I want to clarify that we completely understand if they decide not come or to stay somewhere else. No one is pressuring them to do anything one way or another. I think because it's a family vacation, they just don't want to feel left out which is fair and completely understandable."

We were always very close even though I always had a strained relationship with her mother, my older sister. I helped raise my niece until I moved across the country when she was a teen. We talked here and there and she visited me a few times but we're not as close as we used to be. I've gotten married and started a family of my own. 

She's 30 now. Last year she cut the whole family out of her life. I was very heartbroken. Before she did it, she sent me a long email bashing her parents, mostly her mother. She said that her mother ""severely"" neglected and abused her while doting on her son, my niece's younger brother. She shared a lot of personal and disturbing information with me and I was uncomfortable knowing all those things because i respect my sister's privacy. My niece said she tried to work it out with her mother many times but her mother either ignored her or verbally abused her. My niece decided to give up and say goodbye for good. 

My niece said that she wanted to give me the whole story to get me to understand why she cut ties with her immediate family. She said she still wanted a relationship with me. 

I called her and told her that I would not get in the middle of it. My sister had a rough upbringing and she has issues, but she loves my niece with all her heart. She has always talked about my niece with a lot of pride and joy. I think my niece may have exaggerated some things but I didn't tell her that. I told her that I would pray for her and I still wanted a relationship with her as long as she didn't bring up her issues with her mother again. She was silent for a few moments, and said ""OK"" then hung up. She never answered any of my calls or emails again. She cut me out, too. 

My husband thinks that I should've been more compassionate. But honestly I have my own problems to deal with. I don't have the time or energy to argue with my niece or my sister.

"i'm in college and i am 20 years old and my roommate just turned 19. she has been seeing a guy for 2years. There has been times when she has told me that he doesn't want to have anything to do with her, but they always end up getting back together. she first told me he was 25. Then she told me he was 30. and well she then told me he is 35.

&#x200B;

a little more about him, is that he has a car dealership business, has been divorced, no kids, oh and he owns a Ferrari. i'm pretty sure he sees he as a ""trophy wife"" because she has told me that he doesn't think her hands look lady-like and how she has to always look good and have her hair straight because one day he told her that whenever she has her nature hair done which is curly, he has said that she looks like a wet dog. he also made her go on a diet and make her go to the gym. and tbh she is actually slim but he thinks she is fat also my roommate is pretty tall and as tall people they weight more she also told me that she has 27% fat and when the nutritionist said that she told me that he was like ""WHATT?! thats a lot"". so for her diet she has to eat 1,500 calories to be below weight average. even the nutritionist told her that she doesn't have to lose any weight. oh and let me not forget that he made her become a vegan so she can lose weight ""faster"". totally forgot to mention that he has been seeing other females because she caught him texting other females. i guess one good thing he has done for her is taking her to Las Vegas and then California . there are many other things that he had said and done but that will go one forever. i also have met him and he definitely looks like a sugar daddy.

&#x200B;

one day she and i were talking and then she is telling me how he wants to retired by a certain age. i told her ""hey you are always telling me a different age every time you bring him up, whats his real age"" she then said ""who?"" i said ""what do you mean who? who are we talking about"", she then mumble ""oh he like 47"" a week or so goes by she calls me 3 time and on the third call i pick up and she is crying about how he doesn't want to see her anymore so she goes to his house to get her things and well i guess they made up because she was gone for like 3 days and i wasn't worried as much because that always happens and she is also gone most of the time since she stays over there with him. if you are wondering why she doesn't move in with him is because he says that he likes to have his own space.

&#x200B;

after she came back i asked her again about his age because last time she mumbled his age. she got really defensive and said that i don't need to know and i was like ""sorry i was just curious and you doesn't have to be embarrassed about if you really love him"" she said ""don't ask me that again"" and well i was pushing her buttons a bit because i said

""\[roommates name\] he is old and he doesn't treat you good"" and well she got more mad and hasn't spoken to me in 2 weeks.

My bf and I ran into a friend of ours and he invited her to the event. The first one goes well as she brought her own friend and I spent my time hanging out with my new group of friends.   
The second event we spent all our time with her because she came by herself.  I introduced her to all our friend and it went well. I felt obligated to be there with her throughout the entire event. 

I sent her links to both so that she could come to these events. There's one girl she wants to meet and is coming to the next event. 

She decided that she wants to come to every event. 

I want to spend time with my new friends, but I don't want to hurt her feelings if I don't spend 100% of my time during the event with her. My bf said I'm probably insecure and that's why I don't want her to be a part of this circle. We see this friend like once a year and she had offered me a place to stay when shit hit the fan with my family a few years ago. 

I kind of don't want her to send a link every time since she follows them on all social media platforms. Technically nothing is stopping her,but I also feel bad if I don't send this link.

For instance, J and MB call D “Consuela” pretty frequently due to her being Latino, MB frequently calls J and I “gay” because we joke about being sweethearts/bros all the time, etc. As I’ve become friends with more people around the office, MB and some of my other black friends have started affectionately calling me their “ninja” because I’m quarter Japanese. I took this as a major compliment. 

&#x200B;

Since I’m a big fan of hip-hop, I’ll frequently post random lyrics to our chat group of J, D, and MB because I’m bored. Things like “You don’t a bus pass for me to bus yo ass” and “I want five of em I show five fingas”, etc. Silly shit like that. Recently, I was listening to Denzel Curry’s song Carolmart where the chorus says “I got a pocket full of money, and my teeth glitter, something about being a trill ass \[n-word\]”. It’s insanely catchy, so I randomly post it and replace the n-word with “ninja”. This was a pretty dumb move on my part, and if I would have thought about it for a second instead of being hyped up on Denzel and coffee I wouldn’t have posted it. MB just sent back “Wow. Your ninja pass has been revoked.” I apologized profusely and said that was really dumb of me to say and everything seemed fine. 

&#x200B;

Recently, though, she has been acting much more harsh and sassy to me, culminating with me posting something random (which I do frequently) and not even vaguely related to this situation in the group chat. I was talking to D about something innocuous like Parks and Rec or exercising or something (I literally don’t remember because it wasn’t even close to being related). She just responded with “classic OP, randomly interjecting with something ignorant, un-relatable, un-respondable, and very awkward.” I was super confused, and decided to just not respond, and then the topic was changed. This was a day or two after my comment, so I immediately connected the dots and thought about apologizing again, but wasn’t sure if it was warranted after she essentially called me ignorant. I’m a whole lot of things, please don’t get me wrong, but don’t think of myself as particularly ignorant. I really don’t know what to do and have never navigated a situation like this before. Should I apologize again for my ninja comment, or did she go a little far? AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	17.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

c08hov	2019-06-13 17:11:17	TheOmerAngi	AITA for only wanting to go to the pride parade is because of my favorite actor?	"Ok so I live in Israel and we annually have big pride parades in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
Because these parades are the biggest pride parades in the Middle East, it has gotten some attention (regardless of the Israel-Palestain politics you hear every weekend).

My favorite actor, Neil Patrick Harris, has announced that he will be attending this year in the pride parade that is taking place in Tel Aviv because of that.

Now I am am more of a conservative (non religious in any way) and personally I don't really care about pride parades, let alone going to one. I simply am a big supporter of the LGBT community but also think pride parades are kinda stupid (don't judge me I have my reasons), but hey if they want to have a parade heck I don't mind go ahead.

I'm 18M BTW if it's relevant in any way(straight).

As I said, I'm not the guy who would usually go to a pride parade to share my support (I share it in different ways) but since this year Neil Patrick Harris is coming this year I decided that I'll go, not mainly to show support of the parade but more like to be around when he is.

My gay friend states that since the only reason I'm going is to be around when he is around and possibly meet him in person makes me a huge asshole.

So what do you say Reddit, am I the asshole?

Edit: I don't know if it's relevant but the parade is tommorow in Tel Aviv and I'm going with my girlfriend (who also going only because of Neil Patrick Harris) and some of my friends"	Not the A-hole	0	0	627.0	339.0	0.0	0.0

c08dcy	2019-06-13 17:01:48	jackofnotradess	WIBTA if I asked to switch my shift on the 4th?	I recently started at a new job back in December. Apparently during the interview I should’ve been told working one holiday a year would be required. I wasn’t but whatever I can live with that. I was told I’d be working 1st shift on the 4th this year. At the time I was a little nervous because this would require doing something’s I hadn’t been trained for yet. After being told I would be first shift I over heard my coworker who would be working second shift say that first would be better for him. As soon as I got home I had an email that we were switched. Since then I’ve had a lot more training and feel confident I could handle first shift on my own. Normally I’d just suck it up but my commute to this job is about an hour. On the 4th it’s most likely going to be around 2 and I won’t be leaving until 11. The thought of driving an hour home during a popular drinking holiday late at night makes me extremely nervous.

c08cg7	2019-06-13 17:00:00		AITA for adding fuel to the fire with a creep harrasing my girlfriend?	"OK, so there's this weird creepy guy who has been obsessed with my gf since her senior year in college (which is like nearly 2 years ago). And from time to time he ends up sending weird and creepy messages to her. He's started doing it with me too, with things like how he has a martial arts license and I better be taking good care of her, or how when my car broke down and I posted on FB to get some help, he responded with how I should be better taking care of my things if [insert gf's name here] is going to be riding along in it.

You know, just weird stuff that I can ignore but it's starting to annoy me.

I don't know why I thought to taunt him, but when he ended up messaging me the same shit again, I just decided to prank him a little more. I responded to yet another message about making sure I take care of [insert gf's name here] with a somewhat suggestive photo of the two of us. Nothing revealing or identifying (it was one of the bad ones we got when we were trying to take some intimate photos) but enough to show two people getting intimate, let's say.

My gf is perfectly fine with it and doesn't care, just fyi. But this clearly irritated the shit out of the stalker and he ended up blowing up my phone and my girlfriend's phone about how I was distributing porn of us. He even called me and left a voicemail with vague threats. Clearly I was having fun and he doesn't enjoy getting his buttons pushed but like he was asking for it. 

Strangely enough, after the initial burst, he's stopped messaging either of us and it's been like a week or two of quiet.

Yesterday evening she asked if there was anyway I could get a ride to work on Friday and not borrow the car. I asked her point blank did something come up and she needs the car? She said no no just wondering. Ok.. whatever. 

So then at 10:30 last night she texts me asking me to try to get a rental. I called her frustrated and asked her if she needs the car. Again she was like no I just want to make sure you checked all the options. This was the best option, the least amount of money and I’m not inconveniencing my mom because she can work from home. I just felt like if she didn’t want me to borrow the car say it two days ago so I could have sent up a rental situation.

My husband said I was being rude to my mom but I honestly think its more rude to ask me to find a rental last minute when she could have said no to begin with and I could have time to figure out a new game plan."	Not the A-hole	0	0	90.0	3.0	0.0	0.0
c08bj2	2019-06-13 16:57:51		AITA: I went off on EX and his GF yesterday. IMBTA.	"In Apr 2018, I was engaged to a loser. He was emotionally & physically abusive (physically towards property: he'd punch holes in walls when he was mad at me, for instance). I finally kicked him to the curb 5/1/18, but not before being dumb enough to co-sign a loan for him. I know, I'm an idiot.

Fast forward to last July: He was texting me about missing me & was housesitting for me while I was going to go out of town to see my ailing stepmother (final stages of cancer). He came over because my flight was out at 5 am. We had sex. No big. Neither of us were in relationships, I told him I was using him, etc.

Last Nov, EX doesn't make the payment on the loan, & for the first time in months, I text him to see what's going on. We agreed if he couldn't make the payment, I would. Just communicate, no harm, no foul. He said things were tight but he'd make the payment & he'd let me know if he ever got close to not making it again. Chill, no big.

Rinse and repeat in March. I tell him, ""I'll take over the payments & recoup in small claims. I just want to be done with this."" He gets SUPER pissed, tells me not to contact him again. In May, I check & he didn't make the payment. Once per week from then to now, I send one text asking for an update. I'm basically building my court case. (I was a paralegal x12 years.)

Yesterday, I sent a message to both him and his GF, basically saying, ""Look. I need to know if EX is alive, and if he's planning on catching up the loan. If I don't get an answer, I'll understand that as he prefers to do small claims, & that's chill."" EX responds with a general, ""Fuck off, be patient you stupid cunt"" and I'm like, whatevs. I don't respond. Then she sends me a message telling me how I'm crazy and how it's such a small amount, I must be poor to not be able to handle it. She says something to the effect of, ""In the year we've been together, he's shown himself to be the best.""

This is where I might be TA: I said something the effect of, ""If you've been together a year, you should probably know that he asked me to work things out in July of last year and I turned him down.""

She says, ""Oh, I know he misses you. We've been together since May 2018. I'm not worried he'd ever run around on me. He's too good of a man.""

I seriously had enough of hearing how my abuser is so good. I literally said, ""He has you snowed, babe. Good luck. I only kicked him out May 1, 2018. The last time we had sex? July. The night before I went to my stepmother’s bedside.""

He left the conversation; she blocked me; I likely will now have to pay for this loan and sue him. But I'm feeling guilty about letting that cat out of the bag. I did not set out to ruin someone's day with all of this. I just want this stupid loan caught up.

TL; dr: Ex, abusive fiance refuses to pay loan. Current GF of ex tries to tell me how great a man he is. I lost my temper and told her the truth. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"Long story short, my mum was abusive growing up which led to me cutting contact the second I left home. The main form of abuse was saying I'd never amount to anything, was retarded, work at mcdonalds despite loads of evidence on the contrary. Even after I received an offer from Oxford med she kept telling me not to bother cause I'd drop out which was so wrong looking back on it.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 7 years, I've recently become a qualified doctor and my mum wants to ""try having a better relationship with me"". We haven't met in person yet but have spoke over the phone where she seemed nicer than she used to be, but I insisted she called me ""dr \[my name\]"" or i wasn't speaking to her. At first she thought I was joking so I hung up and rejected her calls for a few weeks, and from then on she has used it.

My brother (mum was far nicer to him) has complained to me that I'm being a massive bell-end. To be honest I'm barely willing to speak to her, and not bothering at all unless she shows proper respect. AITA?

&#x200B;

I'm sure it's going to get asked and no, I don't insist on being called dr outside of work, ever. At work I don't care either and although many people do call me dr, I don't expect it or get offended by its absence.

I'm in Bali rn with a group of uni ""friends"". People on the outside see us as a friend group but tbh I feel like its come to the point where we only hang out because of familiarity. It's what were used to, but were grown now and have changed a ton. It doesnt make sense that we hang out anymore but that's besides the point. 
When planning the Bali trip I really didnt want to  come. But I've been doing this thing for years where I say yes to every opportunity that is presented to me. I struggle with depression so it's really easy for me to just isolate myself and see the worst in everything. Saying yes to everything has never failed me. I thought okay I feel like shit now but once I'm there I wont. Its Bali. 
Now that I'm here I feel even more shitty. I spent all this money and time and now I'm sitting here writing to u guys. The people I'm with exclude me from everything and i legit feel like a third wheel in a group of 8. I feel myself going into a downwards spiral so I'm thinking about changing my flight date and leave (going to cost me more money). Its probably gonna cause a scene and turn this vacation into a shitshow for everyone. Someone leaving mid trip because they were being a little bitch is not going to go well. There is no way I'm leaving without them asking why and I cant lie and say my dad is on a death bed cuz they know my fam.

I have an unflattering driver's license picture. I was 30 lbs heavier, had an unflattering short haircut, and was wearing an ill-fitting buttondown shirt. Now my my style is polished and feminine.

When we were on the elevator with two of our coworkers, he told me he had just gotten a new driver's license and that the picture was awful. I pulled out mine to show him and said, ""Worse than this?""

He laughed (which was fine. I know it's a bad picture) and said, ""You were in full-on Dyke mode.""

I don't like that word. It's a slur that I really don't like people using, especially when referring to me. I've never used it to describe myself.

c08748	2019-06-13 16:47:59	Fishehhhhh	AITA for telling my girlfriend she can't do shrooms without me?	"First off yes shrooms are illegal and if I'm just an asshole for trying them then I dont really need your opinion because that's not at all what this is about. 

Me and my girlfriend of 2 years have been thinking about doing some shrooms recently and not too long ago one of her friends acquired some. Me, her, one of our mutual friends, and the girl that got them all paid our part and are waiting for a good safe opportunity to try them out. I should also mention we haven't used any substances before other than marijuana and occasionally alchohol. 

A couple of days ago they suggested doing them the next day and I say that I can't because I have work that day. They say we can hang out over the weekend and do them again/let my do my share while they watch this time. I said hell no tripping alone sounds awful. 

Later find out from my girlfriend that they are thinking about doing it without me despite my objections. I tell her I dont want her doing them then, and she gets upset. She gives excuses like ""it's not up to me it's up to who bought them"" I tell her its fully her decision if she joins and I'm going to be upset if she does. 

I never get a real promise that she won't but the whole thing falls through while we were arguing so it doesn't happen anyways. 

That's the story which you can base your judgment on alone, but here's some backstory to go along with it. 

I have trust and jealousy issues from previous relationships and being cheated on often. I can usually control those feelings but they get really bad when my depression gets worse (either from forgetting to refill meds or being stressed or something really awful happening) those feelings really take over. I was on the tail end of one of those depressed times and was exhibiting some jealous and controlling behavior besides and I know it. She went to a concert hours away and stayed the night at a hotel with her best (Male) friend who she's known since elementary school and I told her how I wanted her to go, but it made me super uncomfortable and i was probably just going to turn my phone off for the night, drink, and try not to think about it. So that was fresh on her mind and I'm sure other stuff was too. 

We have made up about this already and probably learned more about each other in the process, but I dont know how easy it would have been for me to forgive her had it not been cancelled and she did it anywas (which she might not have by the end of our argument anyways.)

I want to share our first time doing this together and also I just didnt wanna feel left out if I'm being honest. 

I keep going back and forth between feeling like I need to control my jealousy and feeling justified in my objections.

Edit: I know it's only been an hour but I feel like the judgements already been passed. I'm the asshole. Regardless I feel a lot better about it now that I've seen the outside perspective. 

I still think my feelings of being left out and upset were justified and that sucks but it doesn't matter because of the way I handled it. I let my controlling side get the better of me and I knew it.  Before now I was having a hard time keeping those two feelings separate. 

Now I have an apology to make and a doctor to visit with.

It seems like I have two issues with this:

1) Im sure that I would stop associating the name with her dead father but I am not comfortable calling my son that name. Furthermore, Its begun to feel as if my wife is treating this child as the reincarnation of her father - it makes me uncomfortable. 

2) It's not a good name for a child in 2019,i understand that tons of people have unique names with unique spellings.... But I'll pass.

&#x200B;

For the longest time I've felt like my parents have given more to my brothers, who are both older and recently graduated from college. I'm still in college. I also feel like my parents give them more respect, as often feel like I'm being babied.

&#x200B;

My parents have spent a lot more money on my brothers than they have on me. They paid thousands of dollars towards my brothers' tuition. I'm sure they would have paid mine, but I got a full ride. My parents have also bought both of my brothers cars pretty early on. When I was 18, I got a job and several months later my parents bought a new family car, but they told me it was basically mine. I was very grateful, but I was never allowed to drive alone. After a year, I'm allowed to drive alone unless its on the interstate. I have been told I can only drive on the interstate when I'm with them. (I have a full license and everything, but it's my parents' car so I respect their wishes.) This rule never applied to my brothers though, which seemed unfair.

&#x200B;

Yesterday some friends wanted to hang out, and we decided to go out to a restaurant in the evening. I told my parents my plans in the morning. I asked to use the car, and was told that I could use it. An hour before I was going to go, my mom told me that my brother was going to go out with some friends, and he needed to use the car. (His isn't working properly.) She told me to ask some of my friends if they could pick me up, and fortunately one could. (I've had to ask several times before and I feel terrible about it.) The evening went well, but I didn't exactly feel right about that. I had basically reserved the car ahead of time, but I feel as though my brother's needs outweighed my own, and that kind of hurts.

&#x200B;

While we were out, my friends mentioned that their lease is ending next year, and invited me to live with them when they find a new place. I told them I'd consider it. This morning I asked my mom if I could speak to her, and I basically told her how I felt. I told her that I feel like I'm getting unequal treatment, and I told her I was seriously considering out moving out next year. I then did something I'm not proud of. I asked if it would be a possibility for them to buy me a new car to use, since they have spent far more on my brothers. This got shut down immediately, and I was told that I needed to quit college and get a full time job if I wanted move out. Honestly, I think that's a fair point. My mother then told me that I ruined her already lousy day, and stormed out. Now I feel like an ungrateful, petty asshole, and I feel like I'm in the wrong. I'm am so thankful for everything that my parents have done for me, but I honestly feel like they care more about my brothers. Whenever I try to even bring this up, I just get immediately shut down and I end up feeling like a jerk. So, am I the asshole here? I feel like I should just apologize and not bring this up anymore.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks everyone. I figured I was the asshole. I just want to say that I never thought that my parents loved me any less for this. I was just upset because I've been being treated differently. I'll try to be a better person from now on. Sorry."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c07zwk	2019-06-13 16:31:45	LatterEngineer	"AITA for not doing a ""good"" enough job translating for my mom?"	"This just happened, and I'm not sure if I did something wrong or not, so I'm asking all of you.

This morning my mom needed to make a phone call to the customer service of a company. She doesn't speak English, so she asked me to translate. By ""translate"" I don't mean relaying her words directly, she just told me what she wanted beforehand and I made the phone call with her beside me. Occasionally she will ask me to say something, or ask a question and I will relay the important bits to her with the intention of summarizing the entire call after the fact.

So I tell the customer service rep her requests, and all seems well, until one detail pops up. She told me to ask a question, I did, then quickly told her the shortened answer before continuing my conversation with the rep, going onto the next item on her list. Apparently she wanted the *entire* answer that instant, so she interrupted me mid sentence with the rep and made me translate the entire response while the rep was waiting on the line. She interrupted me a couple times before I did this, with me giving the ""in a second"" gesture the previous times. She didn't like that and got very annoyed.

Finally, she made me translate essentially the entire conversation *while the rep was waiting on the other side*, instead of hanging up first, making me repeat certain parts until she fully understood. Apparently she wanted to make sure every possible thing was to her liking before she let the rep go. This didn't bother me that much, a lot less than the previous part.

After the conversation (which accomplished everything she wanted out of the call), I basically told her (admittedly with a an annoyed attitude), that she should have waited until I finished a sentence before asking me to relay information to her. She exploded, berating me for doing a terrible job and how I should have catered to her while translating, adding that if I help other people like this, they will end up hating me afterward, and if that's my attitude to other people I will do horribly in life. She didn't want to remake the call if she (I) didn't accomplish everything she wanted, and I didn't want to get interrupted mid sentence, inconveniencing the rep on the line and making me lose my train of thought.

I'm obviously not a professional translator, but I still think I did all the right things and that she was being unreasonable. Am I wrong? Was I the asshole in this situation?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	84.0	78.0	0.0	0.0

c07zhu	2019-06-13 16:30:50		AITA for not telling my friends I'm dating my ex again?	"So I am having a real problem with this dilemma in my life. 

Important background info: So a few months ago, I broke up with my ex-boyfriend because he was being a generally really shitty person. He then proceeded to find out I was hooking up with one of my friends and then broke into my apartment to demand where I was in front of all my friends. My best friends never really liked him but that really sealed the deal to them hating him. Fast forward a few months and I was dating the friend I had been previously hooking up. We broke up because I was clearly not in an emotionally healthy place to date him and I drunk texted my ex (very shitty decision of me, I know, and I seriously regret hurting my friend like that). For a while after that, I was simultaneously talking to both my ex's and they both knew about the situation. (terrible move, I know). Throughout this whole situation, I have been letting my best friends know a little bit about this shitshow and since they fucking hated my first ex's guts, they would've much rather me go with my 2nd ex (and previous friend). 

Dilemma: After a few weeks of seriously talking and working on changing our previous behaviors, I decided to get back together with my first ex. I did not tell my friends because they generally hated my first ex a lot and I am the sort of person who just doesn't really share much in my life. I wanted to keep it low-key but I put a drunk snapchat of us on my story and deleted it shortly after. My friends then proceeded to make finsta (a fake personal instagram) posts severely shading my boyfriend and basically telling me I was out of the friend group. I will be honest, I was really taken aback by all of that, and honestly extremely hurt. I understand their trepidation about my boyfriend but I let them know that he will not interact with them and that I don't plan on bringing him around them. (my boyfriend understands and is on board) When I talked to one of my friends, she mentioned that they were really hurt that I don't tell them about these things but I find it extremely hard to do that when all they do is continually bash my ex. One of my best friends/roommate has literally never ever liked him and a lot of my best friends have never really gotten along with him because they are extroverted and bubbly people and he's a lot more reserved and introverted. I am also the kind of person that really does not like sharing about my personal life and I have always been really uncomfortable with the idea due to some childhood trauma (that they do not know about). I do feel bad for not telling them but I think that them publicly blasting me for it is kind of an asshole move still. Do I deserve to be upset or do I deserve it for not letting them know?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Neither I nor my SO has Facebook, nor do we have any other contact with any of our relatives. I have not talked to any of them in years, and most of them have never met my SO.     
    
Our wedding is coming up, and while we have not tried hard to kept it a secret, we have not announced it to anyone. If it wasn't for my mother being unable to keep her mouth closed, no one asides from my parents would know about it.

Well the cat is out of the bag, and some of my relatives have tried to get in contact with me and my SO to find out what they should give us as gifts, but I have ignored their attempts to contact us, neither of us likes social situations like that.

Now my mother has suggested we make a wishlist for items we need and let my mother post it in the Facebook group chat, feed, wall or whatever Facebook uses. And in the process announce to all our relatives that we are getting married. My question is. **Would we be assholes to post what is basically a list of things we want relatives to buy us on Facebook?**   

We barely know them, they don't owe me anything, and I don't want to owe them anything. I am not going to buy any of my cousins any gifts, nor attend any weddings of theirs. 

I can however not deny that we would benefit a lot from the dozen or so gifts we would probably get. So I am considering doing it just because of that."	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

He used opioids very heavily and since he was so big he had to take 2x the amount that an average person would need to use. One day he told me he was gonna come scoop me up from my house and we were gonna go out. At this point I hadn’t known he took multiple Percocet and oxycodone before he came to get me (if I knew I wouldn’t have gotten in the car with him).   So as we are headed to the mall which was like a 10 mile drive. About halfway to the mall I started noticing he wasn’t acting right almost like he just woke up out of a deep sleep disorientated. I got his attention and told him to make sure he’s watching the road, 45 seconds later my friend is now seizing with spit drooling from his mouth, violent shakes and no ability to control the car. We started to drift to our right which was just an embankment with trees. I tried to grab the wheel and keep it under control but the car was already moving to fast towards the trees.

We flipped once and then smashed into the trees. Neither of us were seriously injured although my friend was unconscious at this point. All I had was a few cuts and bruises as well as a broken arm. 

So a few days had passed and he was out of the hospital and asked me to meet up with him so he could tell me sorry and thank me for trying to save his life. But I told him he put me in such an uncomfortable situation where I had absolutely no control. I told him I’m a polite way I didn’t want to see him honestly ever again. So am I the asshole for saying that or should I have given him the time of day?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c07yad	2019-06-13 16:28:07	sparkly_nightmare	WIBTA if I outed my brother's friend as a total creep?	" 

My brother and I have always been quite close and I often go to parties with his friends. One of his friends broke up with his girlfriend a few years ago and he started being quite flirty with me, and I generally avoided talking to him much when we were drunk for that reason. We ended up very drunk after a Christmas pub crawl and we made out for a bit. My brother text me at that party and told me not to hook up with him, which he has never done before (my brother has the patience of a saint and doesn’t usually get involved in my decision making). He helped me sneak off and get an uber home. 

Six months later I was having a farewell party as I was moving overseas. I was super stressed about the move and saying goodbye to everyone and I got way too drunk way too quickly. I woke up the next day after blacking out and was just embarrassed that I missed the party. I found out that I had kissed him again and thought nothing of it. My cousin had been looking after me, but I didn't see her until a year later when I went home for a visit.  

It came up in conversation that when I was removed from the party and passed out that he was insisting he come into the room I was staying. My cousin had to guard the door and keep watching him to ensure he didn't go into the room where I was COMPLETELY unconscious. Obviously he didn't do anything but I can only imagine what had happened had she not been there.  

We live on opposite sides of the world, and this was a year ago now (I think he even has a new girlfriend), but I really want to out him to all of his friends and my brother. It makes me super uncomfortable to think of him being alone with our female friends if they are too drunk, and it would be awful to find out he did something to them. But he didn't technically do anything to me, so WIBTA? "	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Some years ago I made a friend that got me a job with her in another country. Boss provided housing and some coworkers lived together there.

Some months after, my friend's boyfriend also came to work and live with us.

He keept making some mistakes, wasn't making a good job and was unfriendly.

My coworkers went and told the mistakes to the boss, but because the boss had a shortage of workers he stayed.

This evolve for some time and he started badmouthing everyone in his/my language. Almost no one understood what he was saying so he was keeping the job.

One day he and his girfriend started a fire in their room by throwing a cigarette butt in a waste basket. They left the room without noticing the fire until all of us started to smell the smoke.

They begged for us to not tell the boss, but some coworkers went and told the boss, who kicked them out of the house but kept them employed.

He got the idea that because I could understand everything he said I was the one snitching on him. And he started saying threats under his breath. He had a really aggressive tone that made me so nervous that I would be shaking while working. I should also mention that we worked on a kitchen where we handled kitchen knives with a foot long blade, that added to my fear that one day he would snap and hurt someone.

One day he starts talking with me about how good of his girlfriend to haven gotten me the job and that I was ungrateful, and accused me of trying to set them up and trying to make them look bad. He ended up saying something on the line that I was lucky to have the job but that came with me being away from my family (they were all in my original country) and that it would be a pity if something happened to them while I was away.

I went straight to the boss and said I wouldn't work anymore with this person, or he would be fired or I would pack my things and go. He ended up being fired.

"I met my best friend at college orientation, and we are now incoming seniors and have lived together for 2 years, this past year in a house with 5 total girls (so 3 other friends). We have had some typical roommate/best friend tiffs but truly nothing we couldn't resolve or something that lasted more than a couple days. Point is, we got along well and had good communication.

&#x200B;

Come February and March, when its time to renew our lease, she tells us she cant afford our current apartment anymore, since only 4 of us were staying and rent would have increased. The rest of us don't want to move, but we understood her concerns and began looking for and touring other places. She didn't make an effort to find places in her range, and wasn't willing to compromise (smaller room=cheaper rent). The day we were supposed to sign she pulled out and told us she was moving out, giving us almost no time to sign a lease/find another roommate. Luckily, we found someone and were able to sign a lease so me and my 2 friends are sorted. BFF also signed another lease starting in mid-may, ours ends at the end of June.

&#x200B;

Since the day in April she told us she was moving out, she hasn't slept at our place or stayed there for significant periods of time, only coming to grab clothes or pick something up. She's been actively avoiding me specifically, which is beyond hurtful, and hasn't explained what happened or what went wrong. She has continued to pay for utilities (which she managed) and rent. 

&#x200B;

She gave us 5 days notice for her shutting off all our utilities, so we scrambled to pick up service and order a new wifi box, so I am now in charge of all the utilities. It's now time to pay, and I divided our monthly total by 5, equaling $32 each. Everyone was charged the same amount and everyone except for her has paid. I gave her a week and then sent her a text, letting her know I had charged her on venmo and she could pay me whenever she could. She denied my venmo charge and didn't even reply to my text.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend says I should just let it go but as someone at an unpaid internship this summer, I just want to get my money and move on. This is the last month she would have to pay for. I know \~legally\~ she has to pay but I'm not going to take it that far. AITA for expecting her to pay? And AITA for sending her one more message and venmo charge?

One day she up and left, buying her own house without telling or consulting my parents. Through other family drama, grandma’s children are scattered and there is not any sense of family. All of my mom’s siblings dislike her (she’s the successful “city slicker”) and they do not communicate. My parents and grandma had a falling out, we believe due to her children telling her my parents only wanted her to move in to have control of money when she passed. My parents and grandma have not spoken in about a year.

I recently graduated college and established contact with my grandma. She was thrilled to hear from me and we have been keeping in touch for a couple weeks. She has reiterated that her issues only lie with my parents and she loves and misses me and my sister very much. She recently told me she is in the process of selling her house. She also said she does not have a definite plan yet, she does want to find a senior living community (not a nursing home) but she does not have one picked out or any solid plan yet. She finished telling me this by stating “This is just between you and me” read as, not your parents.

"My mom passed away a few years ago, about 2 years after my mom had passed he told his side of the family and me and my wife that he was seeing someone. Of course for me that will always be awkward but i understood and had no issues with it. So I am extremely close to my moms side of the family but not my dads, they never where around when i was growing up etc. So i broke the news to my moms side of the family and surprisingly they where all very supportive. Fast forward to now they have been together for about 2 years and recently he moved in with her about 8 months ago. It has been 2 years and they live less than 70 miles from us (my brother lives out of state) and we have yet to meet her. I still see my dad but no where near as much as i use to, i have a 4 year old daughter that adores him so that is why this is important to me. I found out a few months ago that she does not like him going to events like Easter, Thanksgiving etc. with family from my moms side, but this is the only family I and his granddaughter go to so its really the only time he has to spend the holidays with her but she wants him to only attend holidays with her and her family. I also found out that she referred to my moms side of the family as ""his dead wife's"" family which put my wife in tears as she was very close to my mom and has ruined any chance of my wife wanting to meet her. So my brother and i called him not to long ago and pretty much unloaded on him about all of this, how he has changed, how family members have stared to distance themselves because of her immaturity, and the comment about ""his dead wife's"" family. All of which he said was true but insisted that he didn't understand why everyone was over reacting. About and hour later he called back and for the first time in 2 years i heard her voice as she let out a half ass I'm sorry, blah blah. . . agreed that it was wrong that my dad had met her entire family but shes never met one of us we all agree that it would be the right thing to meet i mean they only live an hours drive. All this took place like 5 months ago and still no one has met her and when I see my dad its always the same thing, shes working or got called in or something. The messed up thing is every other weekend they are going to concerts, casinos, or road trips so she clearly has the [time.So](https://time.So) lately when i talk to him i don't ask about her, how they are doing, or even offer the invite to her to come to a event to meet. To be honest if he was to call and say she wanted to meet i don't think i would, to me that ship has long sailed and she has shown her true colors and i want my family to have nothing to do with her.

c07s7o	2019-06-13 16:14:32		AITA for accidentally setting the house alarm off?	"I live in a student house with three other girls, all of whom are close friends of mine. My relationship with two of them is a bit strained at the moment for unrelated reasons.

At around 5am this morning, I was really anxious and couldn’t sleep so I decided to go downstairs for a cigarette. I couldn’t find my lighter so I went into the kitchen to light it on the hob and run outside... only for the house alarm to start going off.

I panicked **hardcore** and immediately put in the code to turn it off, it was only on for a few seconds. We never usually put the alarm on unless we’re leaving the house, the box is on the wall directly facing the stairs - but I don’t know what it looks like when it’s on and there were no obvious signs that it was. The only time I put the alarm on is when I’m leaving, so I put the code in and immediately close the front door. And then when I come in and the alarm is on, it starts beeping so I go in really quickly and put the code in to turn it off. So... I honestly don’t know how it looks when it’s on.

The box that makes all the noise is in one of the housemate’s bedrooms, above the door. She’d already been struggling to sleep and she had stuff she needed to wake up for at 9-10am. It would have absolutely woken her up and I have no idea how quickly she would have fallen asleep again.

I was so upset and panicky over it that I didn’t even end up getting to sleep til 9am. I’ve briefly seen the housemate when she came home from the stuff she had to do, I started apologising and she said we’d talk about it later because she’s had a bad day. I offered her a cup of tea and she politely declined, but she wasn’t being normal with me really. I offered her a joint but she turned that down too because she’d just gotten a bag with someone else.

I’m literally freaking out so much. It was an honest, genuine mistake and I feel absolutely awful. Didn’t know the alarm was on and didn’t know what it looks like **when** it’s on. I feel beyond horrible about it.

Me and my ex-boyfriend had dated for five years. Things were great the first year but it began to go downhill after that. The last 6-8 months have gotten bad. In February he broke off our engagement, but said he still wanted to be together. We worked really hard to repair things and I was feeling hopeful. 

Last Monday he was acting distant. On Friday I confronted him about it and it resulted in him saying he hasn't been in love with me since February, and he wants to break up. 

I was heartbroken. Couldn't eat, sleep, shower, stop crying, etc. I was going to give him until the end of the month to move out, and he was fine with that. Then I found out he's been talking to another girl on Xbox live. They've been talking since before the break up and I always had a bad feeling, but he sore to me they're just friends, and he still swears that. However, he always is taking to her, where I can hear him. He even admitted he helps her fall asleep at night by talking to her for hours in bed. The other day, I stayed over at my friends place, he  slept in my bed without permission and talked to the girl all the while. 

It was the last straw. I told him if he wants to call her he needs to do it outside because neither me, or our roommates, want to hear it. 

I told him he now has a week to move out. He says I'm being heartless. He has friends who will take him in, but he still refuses to move even though his name is not on my house and he has no right to be here. I'd like to clarify, this girl isn't the only issue. It's the fact he's doing this after years of abuse towards me. Let me give you the highlights. 

He was messaging girls on Craigslist for sex two weeks after we moved in together. He was traveling for work at the time. This was a week before my birthday. He wouldn't give me money for food while I looked for work, but he offered to pay for girls to come see him. 

Took pictures of my breasts while I slept naked and sent them to people without my knowledge or permission. 

Has said many times I don't deserve respect and that I was a bitch. Has said many times that I'm stupid and made fun of my dyslexia. 

Said he wanted to kill my parents because he didn't like them. Even though they gave us money for food and gas on multiple occasions during his months of unemployment. 

Job hopped despite having literal thousands of dollars in child support debt. Then would always blame me for how little money we had even though I currently make double what he made and used to pay his car payment. 

Always made comments in front of me about how he wanted to fuck my (married) best friend, despite me asking him not to. 

Hit our dog over the head with his phone and then yelled at me when I told him to stop. 

That doesn't begin to cover all his emotionally abusive behavior over the years. Between that and the recent situation with that girl, it's too much. So, Reddit, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

But a few days ago he posted on Facebook about how he was feeling nervous, his mother had some condition involving blood veins in her arm and needed to have surgery very soon otherwise she could need to have the arm amputated or even die. Also the condition is pretty rare so there was no doctors available at the hospital in her town who could operate, she had to be brought into a big city hospital two hours away. A pretty awful situation and you could tell how stressed he was. I posted on there my sympathy and that his mother and his family would be in my prayers.

Later when we were messaging asked if I meant that literally or if it's just a general condolence message. I told him it's literal and I've already prayed for his mother. He got pretty upset at me and talked about how I know he's an atheist so why would I tell him that, he believes it's useless anyways etc. I explained that yes I know he's an atheist but I thought he might at least appreciate it and the condolences even if he doesn't believe it works. He said he would never want people thinking talking to an ""imaginary friend"" would help and was starting to aggravate me. Plus i know he was raised in a church so his mother is religious and was probably praying herself.

As it stands the surgery was successful. I had to stop myself from posting ""Thank God!"" in a reply to his post announcing that.

Side note, my brother is going to college next year and he almost NEVER asks me to hang out, its like, a good DC movie coming out, only once or twice, ever. 

So at first i really didnt want to go since i only recently made a lot of friends and in the past i mostly never hung out with anybody, so this was rare, but my crush was also coming. Both situations were fun, but i had to choose.

I choose my brother over my friends. I told them that this isnt like me (which it isnt) and that this was a complete coincidence and that we will have time to hang out this summer before i move.

Now, both of my friends are really upset at me that i left, am i really the asshole here? I honestly believe that im not, but i need to hear ur opinions."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c07q0h	2019-06-13 16:09:53	allahyokkimk	AITA for refusing to help out my mentally ill sister?	"A bit long, but there's a TL;DR at the end.


So guys, my sister and I had a very rough childhood. She was my sole caretaker until I was about 9.


When I was about 9 (she was 18 by then), she went off to university and made me relocate to my dad's in a remote town so that I could have a better life there than I would have had if I had stayed with my mom. Things didn't work out for me there, and I was all alone by the time I was 12.


By then, my sister had her first psychotic attack and she has been on and off of mental wards ever since. I would go out of my way to be there for her in the hospitals she had been admitted to. I even lived with her for a couple of years to take better care of her, didn't work out for us in the end but even after I got my own place I have always been there for her when she had to be hospitalised, making sure she was taken care of etc. 


The thing is, she absolutely refuses to seek help when she's seemingly sane. She, in her own words ""doesn't believe in psychiatry"". I always told her that she had to seek help, I even personally got appointments from psychiatrists for her, but she never went. As a result of this, the last time she had an attack, which was roughly 1.5 years ago, I told her that I was not going to be there for her the next time unless she tried to get help. She did not.


Struggling with all this, I developed depression and an anxiety disorder which was solely about the fear that I will have a mental illness like hers. I have been able to manage them with the help of my amazing psychiatrist and the drugs they have prescribed me, but I still can not be around people who are not making sense(drunk people, people on drugs, mentally ill people etc.), I get panic attacks, my anxiety goes through the roof and I basically feel like I'm losing my mind.


So I got a call from my sister last night and she just started talking to me in random, nonsensical and incoherent sentences. I swear I was going to die from the fear, the heartbeats and the like right there and then. It was apparent that she was going through psychosis again and that she was going to be hospitalised soon. I hung up the phone in fear, and tried to go to bed. I should also add that she's now living with my dad and step mother at the moment, so I knew she'd be ""safe"" or at least not alone.


Today I woke up to my relatives who I have no relationship to calling me, telling me that I should come around immediately and take care of her. I tried to politely tell them that I couldn't be there for my own reasons, but I was told that I was being a horrible to my sister.


TL;DR: Sister is mentally ill, I owe her lots since she took care of me when I was younger. I have helped her out every single time until now. She refuses treatment unless it is forced upon her. It started affecting my psyche, so I am refusing to go out of my way to help her out this time."	Not the A-hole	0	0	278.0	18.0	0.0	0.0

c07orw	2019-06-13 16:07:07	wu-tangkilla	AITA or is my dad selfish & controlling?	" This all sounds kinda pathetic since I'm a 23 y/o male, but I wanted others opinions. I live in the UK, my dads only child and I've lived with him for most of my life, my parents split up when I was 1 which honestly I can't complain about.

IMPORTANT - my dad is a light sleeper.

I pay keep, clean up after myself, rarely ask for help, I'm considerate when coming in late or anything like that but my dad seems to think that I'm the complete opposite, especially with regards to noise. I also work 9-5 Monday-Friday and dad is semi-retired working probably a couple of hours a day overall.

Some examples -

He won't take my clothes off the line if it starts raining and I'm not home, he almost refuses to put a wash on for me if I'm away and need work clothes washed for the next week. If he does they almost always end up smelling damp. (He refuses to get a drier even if I paid for it).

I'm not allowed my girlfriend round to stay the night, I get you'll probably think it's the sex thing but given how light a sleeper he is I just wouldn't be having sex if he was in the house, and he told me his main issue was that it means there's twice as many people to get up for the toilet in the night, increasing his chances of being woken up.

On a weekend I'm not allowed to get up/stay up to watch the boxing, NBA or UFC on the TV downstairs because he will hear me getting a drink, going to the toilet or coming back to bed (I'm pretty confident he doesn't hear those things).

My TV basically has to be off when he goes to bed because he will hear even if I have the volume on 1 (I'm sure he almost imagines it because he thinks he will hear it), I'm also rarely allowed to watch TV downstairs out of his way because coming back to bed will be ""too noisy"".

I've been shouted at numerous times ""wtf are you doing up there?!"" etc when I'm just moving my computer chair in my room (takes like 2 seconds), leading on from this -

I've asked to change the flooring in my room but that's too much work, even though I would pay for it and do any DIY stuff needed, I want to paint my room but I got such a negative response I just don't want to bother with the hassle anymore.

TL;DR - My dad is a light sleeper and won't let me have the TV on quietly if he goes to bed, I can't watch the TV downstairs because he will hear me coming back up to bed, I'm not allowed to have my girlfriend stay the night because there's a higher risk that one of us gets up to use the toilet and wakes him up, I can't watch the NBA or Boxing live because I might wake him, I'm not allowed to decorate my room or floor because it's a lot of work (that I'm willing to do). He also wont wash my clothes properly if I'm not at home on a weekend and they either end up unwashed or stink of damp because he hasn't hung them out on the line for long enough or at all.

I need to get out of this fucking house.

c07lz4	2019-06-13 16:01:07	NeurobiologicalWorld	AITA St. Louis Blues Parade vs Washers Tournament	" 

Hi everyone.

Let me set the stage. I have a very close friend and his cousin passed away from cancer when we were all teens. His family then began a charity organization for teens with cancer. Every year (well for the last like 5 anyways), they have held a charity washers tournament that I have attended. My BF and I are slated to be a team and I already paid to participate. This year it also falls on my close friends birthday but we rented out a private clubhouse with a pool to have a party that evening, too.

Enter the St. Louis Blues. BF and I are avid Blues fans. We attended preseason games, we attended games when they were last in the league, a couple later season games, a second round playoff game and finally a watch party at the Enterprise Center last night for the final game which was also my boyfriends birthday (!!!!!!). The Blues won their first Stanley Cup EVER. Boyfriend had to work extremely early today so festivities ended early for us.

The moral dilemma: they are hosting what is slated to be the largest celebration in STL history this Saturday downtown with a parade and a street celebration. We want to go very badly. This could be the only Stanley cup they ever win and this is a very historical time for this sports centrist city. I was born and raised in STL and have a lot of pride in my city. We are still attending the pool party and I don't expect my money back. Our other three friends are still going to the tournament. My friend is furious with me. Am I the asshole here?"

c07lw9	2019-06-13 16:00:55	Cuddlefish5	AITA for telling my dad he cant go with us while my mom can	"typing on phone so i apologize for any errors.

 my wife and i havent been on a vacation for two years. a lot has happened in the last two years,  my wife and i had a baby and recently got married months ago. we recently told my parents that we wanted to go on a vacation with our kid ( he will be a year old then). my mom offered to come to help with our kid so we can do a day excursion and do date night one night. we will be in florida for a week so i thought it would be a great idea. my dad at the time said my mom could come abd that he will be away for the week anyways for work. so we were like yay that works. 

So now we are a month out and my dad called me and said he has those days off as well and he was wondering if he could come. i told him no because we wanted to kind of have this time for ourselves because he tends to make his own plans and he wants us to abide by it. he said fine he will just stay at home with his dog. ex. years ago we went on a trip to mauai with them and for a week my parents would argue everyday and my dad wants everybody to do whatever he wants or go wherever he wants or he gets pissed. his logic was he pays for everything. 

the next day he called me saying that he’s looking for an airbnb near where we will be staying and that my mom will stay with him so they will be out of our hairs and we can still do what we want. we told him no again and that the reason mom is going is because she says she will help with our son. he got mad and told me i was being rude and that i dont want him going on a vacation. he also told me it is wrong to have mom babysit the baby at the condo all day by herself while we go out and have fun and also sleep on a couch. we mistakenly booked a one bedroom condo with a queen size sofa bed in the living room. my mom said she doesnt mind sleeping there at all. my wife planned some excursions for us to do that includes my mom but she said she just wants to stay at the condo with our kid. i told my dad he is being selfish and that he is being disrespectful of our wish and he didnt take that lightly he was saying im being mean and unfair. i was so frustrated i just hung up.

c07lsi	2019-06-13 16:00:45	pifor	AITA for telling my mom she couldn't come to an event all her grandkids are going to?	"My  in-laws live waterfront in a nice place and are incredibly kind people,  especially when it comes to opening up their home and beach front for others to enjoy. For Father's Day they are hosting a dinner/BBQ and  invited my family - their son, me (wife) and our two littles and also my  Dad to come out. My husband also asked if my sister and her family  could come along.

My parents are divorced  and civil around each other, but even though it's been years, it's  still awkward and my Dad never seems at ease. I don't feel at ease  when  they are at the same event.

I love my  mom, but she is a bit cooky and also an alcoholic, there are always  random people hanging out at her house. Well, she found out all her  grandbabies and two daughters are going to this function, and asked me  if she could crowd in and bring 3 others.  I feel guilty saying this,  but I don't want her to come. A couple of reasons...1) because she  embarrasses me when she gets really drunk.  2) it's always awkward with  her and my dad together 3) I don't want to further impose on my inlaws  who are already hosting a lot of people by asking if I can bring my mom  plus her crew, though they are so nice they would of course say yes.  4)  it's FATHER'S DAY, and I just want to celebrate my dad and not have him feel weird 5) she was just out there for mother's day and she brought  along a bunch of random people and got really drunk, hence my  apprehension. I mean, the inlaws like to drink beer and have a good  time, but my mom just takes it way to far.

So  I ended up telling her that I would check with the inlaws. And later I  said that my inlaws would probably love to have her out, but lets go a  different day when they aren't hosting so many people. Now she's  butthurt. But I feel like an asshole because I feel small-minded  for  being embarrassed by her and for not being honest because  the inlaws would say  yes but I don't want her to come because of my own hang ups. She  doesn't get to see all her grandkids together very often. Am I an  asshole for telling her no? Should I get over myself and let her come?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c07l9c	2019-06-13 15:59:36	Ittibitium68	WIBTA for not scratching my mom's back	"She's asked me to scratch her back my whole life, and it seemed normal. But yesterday she asked me to scratch her back (no bra on) while my boyfriend was in the room. He politely mentioned that me scratching her back bothered him. He also said he doesn't think she should ask me to do that, because I'm not her slave. 
She has done other things that are uncomfortable for me in the past that I just got used to over time (e.g. walking around the house naked when it's just us).
I predict she'll get defensive and not see the problem if I say I won't scratch her back, even if I tell her I don't feel comfortable doing it anymore (now knowing it's not normal). She'll think I don't like her or something (which I'll deny, cause I do like her).
Judgement?

Edit: My bf apologized for saying the slave bit. (He is lovely, and we are close.) And I should've mentioned that the way she asked me to scratch her back bothered us both. She came up to us silently while we were playing a game, right as we were smooching for a second. And, maybe the fact she did that right before asking me to scratch her back turned me off from wanting to do that for her."	No A-holes here	0	0	2.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

I have bad anxiety when it comes to driving and this summer was going to be the year that I get it done. I just got admitted into physical therapy school and graduated with my bsc. So my mom decided to reward and surprise me with plane tickets to go visit my grandma that I haven’t seen in a decade. Obviously I’m super excited to go and will be going but I have to neglect my driving since I don’t have time. I also start PT school right after I come back which is super intensive so I probably won’t be getting my license until March. My boyfriend is annoyed by this and told me that he’s not going to date me without my license forever. I asked him if he’s tired of driving me around and I offered to just pay for Uber. He drives us out on our dates which happens once a week or so but I usually bus to his place and stay the night and bus to school from his place. It’s not like he’s my taxi. He told me that he’s not tired of driving me but he finds it weird that I don’t have my license at 23 and that I have my bsc before my license. AITA?

One of our first friends was someone I'll call Gus. We hang out with Gus once a week and at first it was fine. Only recently have I started to notice that he's a little sexist. 

It's really little things, but it's starting to really bother me. When I try to navigate, he'll constantly question if I know where I'm going (like every minute). Not so with my boyfriend. If I've made plans for the group and am telling people the plan, he'll ALWAYS tell me to calm down. It's not like I'm yelling - I'm just letting people to know where/when to show up. I've only see him tell women to ""calm down."" He's also made comments during movies like ""as always, it's the woman's fault for not communicating"". 

A mutual friend (Tom) wants to start a new regular weekly activity. This is an activity that Gus has always wanted to do but hasn't had a group. One of the first things Gus and I talked about was how awesome it would be to do this thing together one day. 

I told Tom that Gus would love to do it but I wouldn't be attending. He questioned me about why because he a) knew I was free that day and b) knew I liked the activity. I eventually told him that I'd feel bad excluding Gus but don't want to spend even more time with him. I cited my reasons above. 

Tom encouraged me to join anyways. Since he's only a passing acquaintance of Gus, he said that I can just tell Gus I wasn't the organizer and was filling in the last spot. 

I'm seriously considering this but feel like an asshole for excluding Gus from something he'd love to do. Gus will definitely find out so I can't just keep it a secret."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My father came into my room and told me he had emptied the dishwasher and that I had to do the washing up. This is the fourth or fifth time he has done this and after the third I told him to stop emptying the dishwasher and then expecting me to do the washing up. As the job I am expected to do is emptying the dishwasher though I don’t have do it very often as we have some help that comes everyday (other than Tuesday, so I normally have to do it then). 

So to get back to the story he comes in and says he has emptied the dishwasher and wants me to do the washing up, I huff and puff a little and he gets a little angry and grabs me by the back of my waistcoat and starts to pull me rather forcefully but because he is rather old now he’s not very strong. 

So I get free and stand in front of him and tell him “stop emptying the bloody dishwasher and then expecting me to do your job; I will do my job and you do yours.” He then calls me an “ruddy ingrate” and starts pulling things out of my USB ports (headphones, mice, that sort of thing) and goes to turn my pc off. 

So I grab his arm (not very hard but enough to over power him,as I had some unsaved stuff that I didn’t want to lose) and he his quite angry now and shouts at me to do the dishwasher I stare at him for a moment and then leave to wash up. 
There was literally just some afternoon tea accoutrements that don’t go in the dishwasher (the teapot, milk jugs(really small and very fragile) and the cake stand).

Also I’m not convinced my father did empty the dishwasher as the “help” (basically a part time maid or like a cleaner++) had come at midday to do the jobs.

One of my coworkers, and a (sort of) friend came to me asking if I could take her shift on the Friday because she won't have anyone to look after her child that day. She told me I didn't have to and wouldn't be mad if I said no, she'd figure something else out. I told her that I'd think about it.

This morning she brought it up again, mentioning how our manager has refused to let her also take that day off, and told me ""You know for a fact I'd do it for you."" It's worth mentioning that her tone wasn't rude, but it still bothered me.

The dogs would probably be fine on their own as long as I went at lunch to let them out for a bit, but I really don't want to break up my vacation time like that.

The occasion was that my friend has never been to Vegas, so we thought it would be nice to go a month after her birthday, but it still counts as her birthday celebration. The group consisted of the birthday girl, her boyfriend, two other co workers and my friend which we will call Michael.

&#x200B;

To fast forward some personal stuff, I got a new job which made it unclear whether or not I would be able to go on the vacation but I ultimately got the time off.

&#x200B;

About 2 months ago Michael ended up meeting some other friends of mine, let's call them Pam and Rebecca. The four of us hang out quite often to the point Michael invited the girls to the Vegas trip. I end up agreeing to room with Rebecca and Pam since I didn't have a roommate yet. It was after that when Rebecca let's me know that Pam has a crush on Michael, but we both know Michael doesn't like Pam. However, Michael would still be willing to have sex with Pam

&#x200B;

Fast forward to last week, I hung out with Pam and Michael and it was the most uncomfortable time of my life. There was so much sexual tension to the point they talk about having sex on my bed in Vegas. Michael started to laugh about how uncomfortable I was and while it might have been a joke, it's something I never want to experience ever again. Now I simply don't want to go to Vegas because I don't want to have these two make the same jokes or start dry humping around me for three days.

&#x200B;

Rebecca flat out told me that she wasn't going anymore, which is fine, but I have more of a stake in this. We are celebrating my friend's birthday, but the people I would spend most of my time with would be making these same jokes and most likely make myself & everyone else uncomfortable. I haven't talked to anyone about the situation, but I don't want to be the one who ruins anyone's fun time by saying a month before the trip that I'm not going, especially if I gave them a hard time planning the trip early on.

&#x200B;

So WIBTA?

So for my birthday, my parents bought me Spotify Premium, which I was super happy with because that was something I had mentioned I wanted. 

My mom then said that she heard there was some deal that you can get both Spotify Premium and Hulu for the same price, and wanted me to try and get that because she really wanted Hulu. I looked it up and told her I couldn't because you need to have proof you're currently enrolled in a college (which I don't have because I'm not), and she said ""oh, that's too bad. That's part of the reason we decided to give you this gift"".

At this point I'm a bit upset that my gift she was getting me was also supposed to be a gift for herself. But then that night, while I'm out with friends, I also get a call from my dad saying that he decided that the whole family is going to get a family plan. So now my gift is the entire family's gift. On top of that, when I asked my mom a few weeks ago if she could tell my extended family (they often contact her asking what to get me) to not gift me makeup (I have sensitive eyes so I don't wear makeup that often, so I have five eyeshadow palettes from previous birthdays just sitting unopened in a drawer), she said that she didn't want to, but if I get any, I can just give it to her. 

At this point, I just feel like my birthday is an excuse for my parents to get gifts too. So Reddit, AITA for wanting a gift just for me?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

KL: Hello? Are you the owner of this phone?

Me: Yes -thanks her profusely-

KL: I actually picked it up in -describes location-

Location is within walking distance of my house and I assume she's still near that location.

Me: That's great, could I meet you at my block? It's within very short walking distance.

KL: Oh I actually drove off already.

Me: How about I meet you tomorrow morning at your workplace? Where do you work?

GM: Hi, where are you?

Me: At home. I could meet you tomorrow morning.

KL: I have to work tomorrow morning.

Me: What about after your work ends?

KL: Hey then I guess I'll turn the car around. What's your address? I'll be there at 9.20pm, could you go down to wait for me there?

Me: Sure thing. Thank you so much, I appreciate it a LOT.

KL: No problem, bye.

I decide to eat a snack. At 9.13pm I finish eating and wash my plate then plan to go down immediately.

9.14pm: KL phones.

KL: Hi, I'm already here.

Me: Oh. Just a minute I'm actually washing a plate now? I'll go down immediately when I'm done.

GM: Could you please come down now? Otherwise we'll drive off if we have to wait for you.

Me: Okay I'll go now. -dries hands-

Downstairs they pass me the phone, I thank them profusely.

GM: Just something to take note of, next time if something like this happens again, you should probably sound more sincere. Don't ask the person to go to you, you should go to the person instead.

Me: Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I just assumed you were still around the original location that's why I asked. I did ask afterwards if I could meet at your workplace though.

GM: Yeah but you still sounded very insincere. I was a bit shocked when I heard you say that.

KL (super politely): Also, please come down early. I didn't want to wait for you, you should have been here earlier.

Me: I thought we agreed 9.20pm. It was 9.13pm and I was juuust finishing up something, I was gonna go down immediately after.

KL: Okay. Just next time don't make people wait for you.

Me: I'm sorry. Also thanks so much for bringing it back. Is there anything I can do for you?

KL and GM: No, it's okay. Just remember not to be so insincere next time.

We said goodbye, with no hard feelings, and went our separate ways. KL was very nice about it but GM was the one being grumpy at me. 

My mom agrees with GM, but i didn't make them come back, I asked to meet at their convenience and they offered to come over so I don't think I was in the wrong for that. But I do think I may have sounded assholish at first. The timing thing was just a coincidence that made me look bad.

c079ah	2019-06-13 15:32:01	130poorer	WIBTA if I asked the people I invited for an informational to Venmo me for the several expensive drinks they ordered?	"My cofounder, tech lead, and I are bootstrapping a startup. Last week, my cofounder met a man (we’ll call him Alex) who works at a major company in the advertising industry (our target market), and my cofounder ended up inviting Alex out to chat over coffee or a drink. The context was that we wanted to get his advice on an accelerator program that his company just launched and that we recently applied to. Alex responded that he was happy to chat “over a beer or Joe”.

He offered to invite his colleague who is more knowledgeable about what we’re building. Even better was that his colleague is a mentor in the accelerator program. Alex then sent us a few suggestions for bars we could meet at. We ended up choosing the bar that seemed not too noisy and was between the other two options in terms of price point. It also had a happy hour selection.

When we got to the bar, Alex surprised us with another colleague he invited to join us. She wasn’t as relevant or connected to the accelerator program, but was friendly enough, very talkative, and did give us a bunch of her opinions on what we should do. (It turns out none of the advice we got was actually directly useful or relevant to the accelerator though, but was good insight on their company.)

Here’s my question:

My team stuck to the happy hour menu and limited ourselves each to one drink so we could keep our tab down. We were mentally prepared to pay for the three people’s drinks since they were giving us info. However, we often find that most people are kind enough to offer to pay for themselves knowing that we’re a startup and financially strapped, or they would show some restraint and only order one drink with a reasonable price. So we kind of assumed that was the case here especially with so many people we didn’t directly invite. So we didn’t pay much attention to the drinks they were ordering.

After about an hour, the people from the company said they had to leave and asked if they could give us cash for their drinks and we said sure, no problem! They left, we got the check, and our jaws dropped. The bill came to $130. Between me, my cofounder, and our tech lead, we ordered about $24 worth of drinks. So the rest of that was from the three. It turns out Alex ordered several bourbons, the woman ordered several proseccos, and the accelerator mentor guy ordered a few expensive drinks as well. Alex, who left the earliest, left no cash. The woman left only $3 dollars. Thankfully the mentor guy (who gave us the most helpful advice) threw in $35, enough to cover his own drinks. So we had to pony up for the $60 worth of drinks Alex and his female colleague ordered. Is this normal?

I think I would be asshole to ask them to Venmo us more money. Plus I can’t think of a way to do without making things awkward at this point. But is there a tactful way to handle or avoid this kind of situation in the future so that I’m not an asshole but not a pushover either?

Edit: Thanks for everyone’s input. It’s clear that I would be an asshole if I were to ask them to Venmo me and I certainly agree. I really had no plan to do that but had to make my post to fit the AITA format for my post to be allowed. I have no issue with buying people drinks but I mostly wanted to know what’s a tactful way to schedule informationals without going broke. I got some really great advice from many of you, so thanks a lot! I’d offer to buy you a drink if I could."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

c077fb	2019-06-13 15:27:34	alonelysaber	AITA for complimenting on a customer's skin color?	"So a little bit of context. I work in a shop that sells colorful(not white) Hawaiian style wedding dresses. I'm not gonna name the store for obvious reasons. The store is basically based for people looking to get married in exotic locations. I should also mention I am a salesman, not a manager.

&#x200B;

So last week we had an Asian couple come in saying they were looking for a beautiful, colorful and elegant wedding dress for their wedding in August. I guide them around the store showing them our best dresses and the guy starts to carry a few dresses they agreed were contenders for the final winner. I move to the next section and pick out another dress and say ""This is one of our finest. As you can see the color really goes well with your dark skin tone.""

&#x200B;

Upon hearing these words, the girl looks at me, and then to her boyfriend who seems similarly surprised by what i just said. ""I'm sorry?"" says the guy looking at me with utmost anger. He throws all the dresses on the floor and starts shouting at me and I'm as confused as ever. We've had multiple dark skinned couples in our store and none of them had reacted the way this particular one was. He continues to go around the parking lot screaming ""THESE GUYS ARE RACIST CUNTS!"" and all sorts of gibberish to other customers.

&#x200B;

Well what next, the manager(who is already a huge dick) says i won't get pay for the next month and I'll have to work weekends too.

c075p8	2019-06-13 15:23:36	abdiboolbool	AITA for getting my daughter to hang out with other children in the neighbourhood?	"My daughter Amy is... different. From a very early age she displayed behavioural issues such as stealing and violent behaviour and was completely defiant to me and my husband. We sought help for this and Amy has had help from specialists for many years which has made a world of difference. 

Unfortunately Amy is incapable of empathy or remorse and there's nothing we can do about that. She does not frighten easily and openly admits that she does not love or care about us which is heartbreaking. Nevertheless she is logical enough to understand that actions have consequences and that she will be punished if she acts out. Amy is very intelligent and is advanced for her age across the board. 

Amy is very charming however. She makes friends very easily and at home speaks in a very ''adult'' sort of way. She can easily hold her own in conversations with adult relatives and family friends but at the same time can act her age and when with her friends speaks like any other 13 year old girl. Her friends parents all find her delightful. In spite of her issues Amy is not that different from anyone else her age and even came up to me the other day asking for advice on a boy she had a crush on, which brought tears to my eyes since it was the first time I've seen that kind of vulnerability from her. 

We also have an 11 year old son, Ryan. Ryan often hangs out with a few boys and girls who live on our street. Amy has no interest in this sort of thing but recently a group of kids from another street have been coming to steal the ball that Ryan and his friends use. I asked Amy if she'd be willing to hang out outside with them and then call me if any trouble starts. 

Yesterday Ryan came running up to the door, saying that Amy was hurt and that I needed to come and see. I found Amy on the floor bleeding and crying in pain. She was severely injured, with the worst being a broken arm. I called an ambulance and she was taken to hospital. 

Ryan told me what happened. Apparently Amy started encouraging Ryan and his friends to go after the bullies and start a fight with them for the ball. They did this, unfortunately one of the bullies had an older sister who came and attacked Amy. Amy said this was all true. 

I feel so guilty. Amy's care plan makes clear that she is not to be left among younger children as she is a danger to them. I took my eye off the ball and thought no harm could happen, and she provoked a fight and got herself severely injured. 

I feel like I deliberately ignored Amy's needs out of convenience to myself."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My son is 7 and I divorced his mom 4 years ago but we separated when he was 1.

We are in our 30’s and I pay child support of $450 a month. I see my son every Saturday for 5 hours although the visitation schedule gives me a lot more time. I’d try to see him more but between school and his activities it is hard. He is also very close with his mother and doesn’t like to stay with me overnight.

She got remarried a little over 2 and a half years ago. I don’t really know the guy. He seems okay. Like he has never been an asshole to me or my son. 

My ex is generally okay a lot of times although she gets real defensive about our son and will swing from nice and accommodating to downright mean when she thinks I am doing well by him. 

It bothers her I don’t take more time and she will demand it sometimes saying he needs his father to see him. 

She recently decided that a way to incorporate me more would be to invite me along to their things. When they go to a fun thing, my son calls and “invites” me. I wouldn’t mind going with just him but it feels awkward and forced if she goes along or if she offers to pays for it. 

I decline when they invite me to special events at the school that they are also planning to go to. She always says “ we will be there but we won’t hover. You can spend time with him but I will be there to scoop him up when you are ready to go or if he needs anything.” 

Her husband keeps saying we should grab a beer sometime. 

She recently invited me along with them on a big trip to a very large and famous theme park that would involve a hotel stay. She said I’d have to feed myself and pay for my incidentals but she would cover the hotel room since my son would want to sleep on my room and park admissions and flight. 

Apparently she is making plans for the trip and asked my son if his dad (me) would be interested in maybe going along. He got real excited and she told me she told him I might be busy with school and unable to go but we could ask. 

She again said they wouldn’t hover and we could take turns taking him to things instead of us all doing the parks together. 

She put me in a bad spot. I’d rather we all just go separately but I can’t afford it right now on my own so I told him he and I would go maybe in a few years. 

They would be on the flight. They would be lurking around. I’d have to see them together when I drop him off. It just bothers me. Like it isn’t natural to be close to your exes. I just don’t want to be a part of their family. 

A part of me thinks they want me to go so they can have some alone time together. She was upset last year I wouldn’t watch him during the week so they could take a trip. I couldn’t.

"We live close by and my nephew has been close with my daughter basically since they were born (they are both 10), and so he often comes over to play (and even more so recently). Roughly last year I found out that he's been borrowing and wearing my daughter's clothes when they play in her room. 

&#x200B;

When we found out, my wife and I talked with him and asked him a few questions, at first he was scared he was getting in trouble, but after assuring him it's okay he finally talked. I asked why he was wearing my daughter's clothes, but he simply said he didn't know. I asked if he wants to be a girl and he said he didn't know again. I asked if my daughter pushed him or suggested that he should wear it, he said she didn't make him wear anything and he was the one who wanted to and begged her to let him wear it. And finally asked if his parents should know, and he was scared and begged me not to tell. After some deliberating, we decided not to tell his parents yet, and should let him decide when to tell them. Of course I told him he could bring us with him when he does, and that he should tell his parents (which we remind him every now and then). He's also free to wear my daughter's clothes when visiting and even bought some feminine clothes for himself that we keep here so he doesn't have to borrow them all the time. Now maybe I overstepped my bounds, but I don't really know if he's trans or just non conforming or just he simply likes the clothes, and I don't really think he knows either. We decided that he should be free to explore this without fear at my house, and whatever he finally figure out, we would support either way. However yesterday my sister found out and things got bad. She was angry at him for wearing girl clothes, but she was furious at us for letting him and she told me that we were basically forcing him to wear these clothes and confusing him. At this point, I was quite surprised by her reaction, since although she wasn't what I would call an enthusiastic ally to LGBT+, she and BIL was at least in the live and let live camp. He was crying so much at this point, so I told her he wants to wear them and she should try to understand that it makes him happy and that she shouldn't be mad at him, but she said we were out of line and simply left with him.

There are many reasons for this, my biggest being my brother being used as a weapon when they fight, he has physically assaulted me before for trying to prevent him taking my brother from the family home with the threat he wouldn't return. He's called me and my sister awful names. Even when they aren't together, if he comes round he acts like he still lives there. He has threatened to kick me out of my home for not walking the dog on a few occasions before the split. I'm not comfortable with him being at our home, especially considering he is my boss and I have to listen to him insult her regularly. I've heard him insult her choices, her friends, her size, and her job. She worked in McDonalds on the night shift for a while after my grandad passsed (she was his full time carer) and went through a severe mental breakdown. His main concern was whether she had the money to pay off the catalogue. He didn't even know what the little message at the bottom of her note meant, which is said because he's heard her say it to all of her children. It's something she picked up from my grandma.

&#x200B;

They recently got back together, and I made it very clear I don't approve of it. I'm terrified of things going wrong for her. She's only just starting to seem like herself and he's pulled her back in. He's been at our home every day, acting like everything is okay in front of my already very confused 6 year old brother. He came round on my sisters birthday for a ""booty call"". Today, she asked if he could stay the night. She already knows I'm uncomfortable with him there even if he's just visiting especially since they have literally just reconciled. I said no, I couldn't care less that she wants him to stay if it's at the sacrifice of not just mine but my sisters happiness who dislikes him just as much as me, maybe more. So, Reddit.

\*EDIT\* Thanks guys, I know there isn't many comments but it really has helped me reflect on the situation. I'm standing by my decision that I don't want him staying tonight, simply for the fact I know they're going to want to do adult things and I'd rather not listen to it tonight. However I am going to sit down and have a conversation with my mum about staggering his visits so that we can all get used to him being around again. Me and my mum are extremely close, there's only 20 years between us and we're incredibly similar. I love her to bits, and I want her to be happy. And I can let her be happy without trying to control how she gets to be happy. It isn't fair for me to outright say ""no, you can't be with him"" but there needs to be boundaries, for all of our sakes."	No A-holes here	0	0	101.0	8.0	0.0	0.0

"My grandfather's brother died recently in the funeral is held in the midweek. I have not visited him often as a young child and have no strong bond with him. Today, I received an email saying that I was accepted to a youth program that takes place in a college in the summer that last for a week and I'm pretty sure that in the camp will interfere with the funeral of my great-uncle.I called my mom and she said that she might force me to go to the funeral even know that the camp is important to me. I did say that the camp was important to me in that would rather go to that then to the funeral. AITA for not wanting to go to the funeral?

Edit for all questions asked: I received the letter today, my great uncle died on Monday, I only see these people every other Thanksgiving, I live in Iowa and the funeral is in Chicago, the camp and the funeral will in fact overlap and the camp is an all week overnight stay type of camp."

The company I work for has a really strict policy when it comes to being on time the people and if someone has uninformed lates for more than 4 times per quarter they get a huge hit on their incriments and what not. That being said if somone is late and they inform me I approve their late 100 percent of the time, but the rule is that they have to remind me again to mark it as an approved late(they can see if its not) and even come to me and get it approved beacuse I have over 50 people working under me and I am actually bound to forget sometimes. 

So today one of my workers was up for a promotion. She had 6 lates of which 2 she had told me about and i never got to approving them. I told her not to worry about it and I will personally go and talk to the HR and get this fix. I spent half of my day working on her case and rather screenshots of our conversations so I can prove to the HR that these were actually approved leaves and not me tryign to help my people (I do this a lot). So after gather all the advance I needed I booked an appoint wihh HR which would be in three hours  and I did all this infront of her. I told her again not to worry and I will get this worked out and told her to go back to work.

An hour later I got an email from her. It was addressed to my manager and I was in CC. It was about how it was not her fault she was not marked late and it was totally my fault. It even included all the screenshots that I had gathered.

I got a call from my manager (we have a great relationship) and he was like do you want me to do something about it or ignore it. I told him to just ignore it.

So now, am sitting here if I should just chance my  meeting with the HR beacuse what she did actually pissed me a bit off. Like I am helping you and I am going to go to the HR and tell them its my fault. You don't need to go to my manager, I mean this only makes me feel she wants me to get in trouble


EDIT: just to clear something out. I manage a huge team which has shifts on diffrent timings. So the system that I have put in place (which everyone knows of) is that. If you are late you let me know all you have to do is let me know and even if I say it's approved I will consider it has approved.
The second stage is to come to me when i am in the office and get the late approved. And yes she did inform me, but according to the system that she knows of she has to come to me and get them approved which she never did


EDIT:  I did go to the HR meeting, and I did tell them that she fully followed the process( whchb she did not) and that I am the Dumbass who made the mistake. The lates have been removed  ( which she knew would be once I talked to the HR) and she will get that promotion. Given she will be still reporting to me I do still think I need to sit down with her and tell her this was not cool, and that going forward her lates will only be arlpproved if I have responded to texts/ calls stating they have been and she will still have to come to me and get them approved.

c070e8	2019-06-13 15:11:48	bflaw	AITA for ending my friendship with someone who's family would criticize me over normal things?	"So a backstory is helpful here:

In grade school, I was bullied a lot because I was a sheltered kid and a goodie-two-shoes.  In fifth grade, a new girl came to our school and she was starting to get bullied too.  One day, she was playing a game with people at recess and something happened (I can't remember since it's been so long), but she ended up running away and sat on the ground crying.  I really sympathized for her since I myself would often go and sit by myself crying when I had been made fun of or excluded.  So I went and sat with her and comforted her and we became best friends.

Her family was even stricter than mine and a little weird but we always had fun and she was my closest friend.  Flash forward to 8th grade/high school.  My friend started to get really competitive with me about unnecessary things.  For example, her family sat in the front of church, and my family sat in the back, and she would tell me that it's ""better to sit in the front"" or more holy or something stupid like that.  Also, she tried to compete and see if she got more money than me from family and friends for her 8th grade graduation celebration.  (like excuse me?! that's private - but I also got more than her so that really backfired I guess).

High school rolls around and I start to wear a little makeup (like freaking mascara and blush - nothing crazy) and I got a cell phone (literally nothing crazy).  Her mom used to make snarky comments like ""oh you're the makeup queen now.""  One time I overheard her mom tell someone ""we don't let our daughter have a phone because we have good morals.""  (This was back in like 2010 so cell phones were the normal thing).  Also, she started to get super competitive grade wise.  I am fortunate to have always gotten really great grades, but I would never tell people what I received because I didn't want to seem braggy or competitive.  One time I remember she asked someone to ask me what my grade was just to see if she did better (which not to be braggy but she didn't).

Over time, I really lost respect for this friend.  I was maturing and becoming more ""normal"" and less sheltered and really didn't like how her family criticized me and how she became so competitive with me.  I slowly stopped hanging out with her and got new friends.

To this day, her family gives me dirty looks, and when I see her around she sometimes ignores me or is just super unfriendly.  It really makes me feel like they think I ditched my ""friend"" and left her to become friends with other people.  I feel bad about it to this day, but my family tells me I'm not in the wrong.

c07090	2019-06-13 15:11:28	throwmymumaway	AITA for wanting my bed to myself?	"Posting from a throwaway. So my dad used not to live with us, he worked in a city a few hours from home and would come visit every fortnight or so. That all changed this year when he was diagnosed with cancer, and he had to move back home to be close to a larger hospital for regular treatments. So here's the situation. Obviously parents haven't slept in the same bed for a while, and basically my mum didn't want to start sharing now so as not to disturb my dad. So, what was originally her bedroom has now become his. We have a spare bed downstairs that for the first month or so she initially used, while I slept in my bedroom. However, what has recently started happening is that she has started sleeping in my bed because she ""can't be bothered to set the bed up"" downstairs. The first few days it was fine, but it's been several weeks like this now and I'm not sure whether I like this long-term. For reference, I'm a female in my 20s. She snores and steals my blankets and, hey, I just want some alone time for peace and quiet by myself. She also wakes up much earlier than me which just gets frustrating in the mornings.
Oftentimes, I have helped her to set up the bed but then she chooses to sleep in my room anyway. One time she asked and I said I'd rather just have my bed to myself that night, and she got so angry she slammed the door on me and didn't speak to me the next morning. I haven't refused since (well, she's never asked since then, just fallen asleep before I got to bed)

I know that this is such a small thing in the scheme of our family issues and my mum's had to carry a big load supporting my father, but this is really starting to bother me.

TLDR: My mum's given her bed to my recovering dad, and no longer sleeps on the spare bed but rather in mine and I want her out; AITA?

Edit: thanks for the responses so far. A few more tidbits of info I forgot: 
1. I'm 21, and Asian. Moving out is absolutely not an option (parents would never let me). I'm a full-time student so I wouldn't be able to afford it anyway! 
2. I pay for about 40% amenities  & food in my family of 4. I didn't pay for the bed (but I don't think the spending aspect matters in the situation consideration)
3. The spare bed's one of those ones that fold up into the wall (I've forgotten the name, is it a Murphy bed?) It doesn't take much time to set it up, you literally just need to pull it down and pull the legs out and then put the blankets/pillows on."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

&#x200B;

So long story short my sister in law is a crazy toxic person. I could put in a litany of crazy things she's done, but frankly it's just not that important to the story and would take forever. She somehow convinced someone to marry her, we'll call him Bob. So they stay married for about 3 years and Bob and I start to hang out, BBQ's, video games, and the occasional beer.

&#x200B;

So of course the marriage falls apart and Toxic sister in law moves away. As the dust settles, one night I'm playing a steam game while wife is out having girls night, and Bob pops up. We start chatting and play some Borderlands for an hour or so. Over the course of a few weeks I start inviting Bob to guy’s night and other stuff. Honestly I just figured the guy was probably depressed or just out of sorts from being divorced.

&#x200B;

I mentioned this to my wife, that I was still hanging out with Bob and she got pretty upset. I wouldn’t say she went ballistic, but she's normally pretty calm and not the type to make a big deal out of small stuff. She said that ""I should be ""on her sisters side"" whatever that means. When I brought up the fact that she herself has told me on multiple occasions that she knows her sister clearly has some emotional problems and the times she has interacted with Bob he seemed like a cool guy. She said that didnt matter and her sisters needs come first. I didnt realize we we're taking care of her sisters needs but whatever.

c06xft	2019-06-13 15:05:05	didhugh	AITA for not giving up a spot in line?	"The grocery store near my office has a sandwich counter in the deli section, where I sometimes eat lunch.  The other day, I get into the line for the sandwich counter when I hear a voice saying “excuse me, there’s a line here.”  I turn around and I see a man standing behind me by himself in the bakery section, by a display, a good 4-5 feet away from me.

Now, I get not crowding the person in front.  I usually leave a gap big enough for an average sized person to comfortably walk through.  I think any more than about 2 people’s width is a bit excessive, and 4-5 feet behind me (which would make him about 7 feet behind the person in front of me), in another section of the store, is completely ridiculous.  If you’re that far away, you are not actually in the line any more.  But, whatever, it’s a grocery store sandwich line and not a hill worth dying on, so I step back and wave him forward.  He doesn’t move.

About 20 seconds later, the line moves and I step forward, still leaving enough space for him to step in to.  Then he says; “well?  I was waiting here before you.”  He still hasn’t moved and clearly expects me to move behind him.

At this point, I decide that I’m not going to give up the spot that I still consider rightfully mine  if he’s going to be a dick about it, so I say “yes, there is a line and I’m standing in it.  You’re not.  You were waiting before me but you weren’t waiting in the line.  This isn’t take a number, we’ll call you when it’s your turn, this is a line.  You need to stand directly behind the person in front of you, not some place kinda close by.”  Then I stepped forward to close the gap and not let him in.

He says, “well, I guess not everybody cares about personal space” but steps up so that he’s directly behind me.

So am I the asshole for finding a 7 feet gap between people in a line to be completely absurd and refusing to honor someone’s place in line if they’re that far away?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	225.0	21.0	0.0	0.0

In the beginning of our relationship I found a journal he kept and I read it (I know this is wrong and a violation of trust and boundaries). X's journal detailed his unsureness in dating me, and had several pages comparing me to a couple other women who probably had no interest in dating him. One being a 19 year old girl he met once and had nothing in common with, but she was thinner than me (X is 26 so I find this particularly disturbing). The other being his fwb of several years who he slept with without a condom days after asking me to be his girlfriend. He compared us sexually. He also said I was boring, but I had a car and she didnt so that was a plus. He never would have told me about the unprotected sex, and we had unprotected sex afterwards. Which is what really upset me. He felt horrible and I agreed to forgive him except I havent, and instead it has made me feel not good enough for 2.5 years, and unable to trust him fully. He has worked hard to make up for this and has been my support through what has been a particularly difficult year for reasons I won't go into. I still can't trust him, and last night he told me his ex gf messaged him, and he was comparing me to her now. He knows this is a huge fear and insecurity of mine because of the journal, so it was a difficult thing to hear. But I've never fully forgave him in the first place so I feel this is all my fault.

c06uus	2019-06-13 14:59:18	RelentlessRogue	WIBTA For bailing on my friend's bachelor party?	"I've been struggling with this one for a while and I need outside opinions. 

&#x200B;

I have this friend (Let's call him Jake) from college, we've been friends going on 10 years at this point. Jake's getting married in September to a lovely girl named Jenny. They already live together (they recently bought a house together) and have been dating for 3 1/2 years. 

&#x200B;

Jenny has been very up-front with Jake about what she expects from him, from day one. She wants to start a family, eventually stop working to be a  stay-at-home mom, ect. She also expects him to be more mature than he has been, ie, no all-nighters drinking, no playing video games til 4 am, things that we did during college we shouldn't be doing anymore. She's also said, many times, she explicitly is not okay with him going to strip clubs. Her exact words on the subject were, ""If he went along for someone else's bachelor party, and didn't get any dances or anything, I *GUESS* I could be okay with it. But the second he's getting lap dances, I'm done.""

&#x200B;

Jake's bachelor party is coming up the first weekend in August. He's already expressed his explicit desire that, regardless of what we do during the day, every night he wants to get hammered, do drugs (marijuana at the least, but he's experimented with other substances before when drunk) and go to strip clubs. He already has one picked out that ""caters"" to bachelor parties. We will be in a different city than the one we all live in. 

&#x200B;

Now, WIBTA if I bailed on being a part of all of this? I'm one of his oldest friends, and I even offered to help plan the damn thing, but based on his desires to over-indulge and deliberately do things his future wife isn't okay with, I really don't want to even be there. I've 'grown up' a lot over the last year, and I've even realized that he's used me being a single bachelor as an excuse for doing things that upset his fiance, such as staying out drinking. He also talked me into going to strip clubs with him before I knew she wasn't okay with that happening. I realize that, if one of his oldest friends bails on his bachelor party, it'll raise questions, and possibly make his fiance suspicious, which honestly, I would probably be okay with.

"Background: I work an extremely intense work week as a physician at night with high physical,  mental and emotional demands for a average of 90 +/- 5 hours over a 7 day period.  I rely on my wife, Jessica, currently for just about everything to ensure the time I am at home is focused on achieving sleep to make me sustainable in my role for as many years as my body and mind will tolerate.  Jessica is fantastically accommodating for this lifestyle, and enjoys the 26 weeks of off time per year this 7 days on/7 days off style of living has allowed.  

Jessica is a highly educated/intelligent person who has chosen not to work to be able to enjoy the 26 weeks off per year together this schedule has allowed and will always have the option of returning to work if she desires. It would require me taking another position, as I would not ever even consider being sustainable in my current position, without her by my side in her current role.  She knows that motherhood aside I would always support her going back to work if she choose to do so. 

With a child forecasted over the next 8 weeks we couldn’t be more excited! But I have gotten a ton of push back regarding expectations from family, friends and even colleagues(in less time intensive roles) saying this situation is far from reasonable. My wife is all for it and it was something we had addressed even before conceiving.

Essentially 50% of the days I will remove myself for the parenting role altogether right from the start.  I’ve never felt that my wife, or any woman, should be assumed to stay home and care for children but believe this to be a mutually beneficial situation even gender roles removed.

I work at a super tiny hole-in-the-wall coffee shop. I work for a couple that owns the business, but the wife runs about 70% of it, and I’m the only employee they have. I’ve been working at this place full time for about a month or so. I work 5 days a week and I’m not allowed to ask for any days off or call out until December (don’t ask me why- it’s their weird policy). 
Since I’ve been hired, my position has drastically changed and instead of just being a barista, I’ve now had several other responsibilities put onto my plate like social media coordination, event planning, and they now want me to redesign their website. The problem is that they keep throwing these things my way and I’m now expected to work off the clock at home... and start coming to long, unpaid, hastily scheduled meetings on my one full day off. I really don’t get paid too much and I have responsibilities once I get off the clock. I have a lot of free time at work, so much free time that sometimes I won’t see a customer for 2 hours and my boss is always here, so I don’t see why she can’t talk to me about the contents of the meeting while I’m here on the clock, not on my day that I have to unwind, relax, and not think about work. My boss then asked me about some sensitive topics that I’m uncomfortable discussing at a workplace (trauma from a prior event and my menstrual cycle?) and then demanded I attend this unpaid meeting. 

At the same time, I know my boss has a lot of stuff going on because she runs another small business as well as the one I’m employed at, and she’s been going thru her own rough patches as well, so I try to ask if she needs help with stuff every so often but I feel like she’s taking a mile when I’m offering an inch. 

They’ve briefly mentioned the topic of a raise, but it wouldn’t be for another 3 months and it would only be a very small one. I feel a little unappreciated and uncomfortable at how quickly the relationship with my boss turned from boss-employee to being a hand and foot servant. 

AITA if I stay home? I like the job for the most part but I’m starting to feel like I’m overextending myself.

c06oal	2019-06-13 14:43:43		AITA for telling my girlfriend she should have called the police?	"I (M22) had a conversation with my girlfriend (F23) yesterday which ended with her in tears because of something I said. AITA?

She'd been to see her family in another city the previous weekend. Her family live next door to a house which has been converted into flats - one upstairs one downstairs. The downstairs is occupied by a family of 4 and the upstairs has recently been occupied by a young (mid 20s) Indian couple and their 8 year old son. 

On the Saturday at about 8pm her and her sister had walked out of their house and heard a woman screaming from the window on the upstairs floor. In Hindi she was shouting ""mum help! He's hitting me!"" or words to that effect. My gf understands Hindi.  

She then heard some shouting from a man (presumably the husband) and then nothing, as the woman had moved away from the window. 

My gf told me this in an 'isn't that awful' kind of way and said that her parents had heard similar stuff in preceding weeks. 

I was completely shocked that this was happening in such full view of the street and asked her whether she'd called the police or gone to the house / asked someone to investigate. 

She said she didn't want to get involved in somebody else's problem, and that the family living in the flat below should have reported it if they heard anything. She said she'd seen the wife go to an event the day after so she clearly wasn't that hurt. 

I was really taken aback by this. My gf is usually a really compassionate and thoughtful person and I was really confused about why she didn't seem that bothered about the suffering this woman was going through. 

I had a, mini, rant about how serious this stuff was, that this husband might kill the wife if he was hurting her like this and the kid would be traumatised growing up in a house like that. 

I also said that she shouldn't rely on the downstairs neighbours and be a bystander to this. The neighbours might not even speak Hindi so she should have at least tried to help/ report it. 

I know she's reported something to the police before regarding another neighbour neglecting their dog so she's clearly not afraid of speaking to the police. 

At this point she started crying and it took a while to calm her down. 

I feel bad that I laid into her a bit, but I'm more concerned that she didn't do anything, and doesn't plan to, when somebody else was in danger. 

So Reddit, AITA for pushing the issue? Is it her right to do nothing? Is it my place to say what she should or should not have done?

c06o7s	2019-06-13 14:43:31		AITA for dating a friends ex-husband	"## 

Throwaway account just in case. So, here is a little backstory. My timeline might be a little flawed. I (27f) dated this guy, Roger (31m), when I was in my first year of high-school. We were from a really small college town. We fell in love too quickly. Our parents wanted us to break up because of our age difference. Roger was also worried about the legality of it and decided to break up with me after 3ish months. After a few months of ""grieving"", we ended up staying really good friends. We both dated different people during this time.  

I had a friend-group of about 6-8 girls through high-school. We were all pretty close and stayed close through college.  I invited my friend group to a party at the end of our senior year that Roger was going to be at. One of my best friends, Maggie, met Roger at this party and told me she thought she had a crush on him and that she wanted him to ask her out. Of course I was little jealous, but I was not going to tell her she couldn't because that would have been shitty of me, and not my decision anyway. A few days later, Maggie and Roger started texting and hanging out and eventually dating. I stayed close friends with both of them as a couple and separately.

A year or two into their relationship Maggie started getting distant and asked Roger to stop being my friend altogether. She was extremely possessive and controlling. Out of respect to Maggie, Roger and I only ever saw and spoke to each other at group occasions. They ended up dating for about 8 years and got married at about their 9 year mark. I had moved away from our small town to a bigger city a few years prior but still visited with our main friend group and Maggie when I could. About 6 months after Maggie and Roger's wedding she ended up leaving him for someone else.

About 6 weeks after that, Roger reached out to tell me what had happened. We talked for a really long time and fell back into our old friendship fairly quickly. Things were strictly platonic for about a month when Roger admitted he had feelings for me still and asked if I did too. I was angry that he waited this long to tell me, and he admitted that he had been scared and thought I moved on all those years ago. I thought I had, but I quickly started to fall for him again and we started dating. We kept things secret at first because I did not want to hurt Maggie or any of our friends, but I knew I needed to tell them. I told that friend-group and they basically all isolated me and now want nothing to do with me. I am extremely happy with Roger, but of course being shunned like this hurts even if it was semi-expected. I have other friends, so I am not friendless, but I feel I should reach out to the others in time. Was I in the wrong? I know Maggie and I had sort of fallen apart as friends, but she was my best friend for a long time. AITA for dating Roger even though he's a friends ex-husband?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c06nyg	2019-06-13 14:42:54		AITA for getting angry at my friend?	"My friend and I are lab partners for school. Going into it, I didn’t know his work style. Turns out he’s a super slow worker. (Types with one hand while leaning back in the chair). Not only that, but it takes forever for him to understand what’s actually going on in the lab. I explain it to him numerous times but he still doesn’t fully grasp what we’re doing. I keep suggesting that he review the lab beforehand but he never does. 
Because of this, I end up writing most of the lab reports. At this point, I’m just doing this for myself to get good grades. 

For our most recent lab, we’re supposed to derive two equations. It’s simple but just takes a while so I take it upon myself to do it. Now supposedly you can use an algebra program to do it but I decided it was easier for me to do it by hand. On Monday, I tell him I derived the equations and he’s super thankful and asks how long it took. I say 45min - 1 hour. Of course I mention that I’m not 100% sure the equation works but say that part of the assignment is to run a test case to ensure it does. He starts saying that we should go to the Teaching Assistant but I say that there’s no point because the whole assignment is based on deriving the equations and using them. They’re not going to explicitly say if our equation is right or wrong, and it’s not like we need help to derive the equation since I already did. He keeps insisting so I just agree to go. I feel like an absolute idiot while asking and of course the Teaching Assistant just says that she has a different equation (there are intermediate variables so it’s possible). 

On top of all this, he keeps mentioning that another person used “x” program to find the equation. I finally snap and tell him that it took me 1 hour to find the equation, at least try it and see if it’s right before going to get help or suggesting another method to find it. I say something along the lines of that he has no right to be so picky if he didn’t try doing anything. 

There’s about 3 other people there and the Teaching Assistant. We were off to the side but I’m pretty sure they heard the whole thing. He starts being apologetic so I just go with it and just end it with saying that it’s my perspective of the whole situation.

We had to work on the  report the next day. I thought he would work a lot faster, but I still ended up writing the whole report by myself. He took ages to enter numbers onto the computer. At the end he tells me how thankful he is and that he needs to “pick it up”. I mention to him again to go over the lab beforehand and he admits that it’s low on his priority list. I was fed up at this point and just calmly remarked that group projects are always my top priority to finish first because I don’t want to hold other people back.

Since this whole debacle, I’ve noticed he stopped sitting beside me in class. Although he was my only friend, I could really care less because he was deadweight and holding me back. If anything, it gave me the push to meet new people.

c06mp2	2019-06-13 14:40:05	DropDeadTyrant	AITA For Refusing to Help Pay the Cable Bill	"Backstory: My family has been struggling financially since I was 9. When I was 12, I had a surplus of $3000 from relatives and my grandfather especially, who was investing in my future. My mother, in 2012, took the entirety of that $3000+ and paid the mortgage, electric bill, water bill, and car insurance. She has yet to give it back.

Scenario: So today the cable was cut off again. In a matter of fact way, I said while I was getting ready for work, “Well, there’s no reason I can’t pick up the double shift Saturday since we don’t have cable anymore.” My mother replies, “you can offer to pay the bill since you’re making money now.” Now notice, she’s been unemployed for years now. I got this job a week before my birthday. On my birthday, my grandmother gave me $500 and my mom took $300 of that to pay the bills. With my birthday money, I had only $600. After my first paycheck, I had $750. But, she took a $100 to get her account out of the negatives, then $200 to get the car insurance paid. So, I never even got to touch my first paycheck. Now, I’m on my third paycheck and she’s fussing at me for not offering $300 to pay another bill. 

AITA: So basically, throughout my life I’ve had over $3000 and I’ve never once gotten to spend it. The only thing I have to show for it is a $40 old navy sweater that doesn’t fit. When I did have $3000, I tried to buy a $1000 pc and she fussed at me for not saving. If I even mention spending $20 on a portable charger, I’m yelled at for not wanting to save.  But its perfectly ok for her to completely drain my account for bills I shouldn’t have to pay.

He had a brother that I was also really close to, but he died a few years back. I am the main person who takes care of Tigre. I feed him and give him water. Change the kitty litter and spend time with him. My brother completely ignores him and does nothing to help with the cat. Yesterday he comes home with a 6 week old kitten. My mom said he could get it since it was free and there were only a few left. I thought about getting another cat but ultimately decided not to because I just wanted to focus on the cat I already have and not prioritize other cats. So I am frustrated that my mom just let him get a cat on a whim when he completely ignores the one we have had for years. He is gone a lot and over the summer he goes to my Dads. Guess who is going to have to take care of the new cat? Me. The responsibility is now on me to take care of the cat when he is not around. No one else will. I just wish I was included in the decision since I am the only one who takes care of our current cat. I'm just really frustrated and I don't think it's fair. My mom said that it could be good to care for something. Yet he didnt take care if  himfor the past 8 years? It should have been a family decision. In the past I've talked to my mom about this and agreed that I am the main one who takes care of the cat and my opinion should be considered. Not anymore I guess.

I'm not upset that I'm not allowed to bring anyone, but I feel like she's only now going back on this because I came out. I can't help feeling that it I brought a boyfriend and just said he was a close friend she'd pay for it. I am 100% aware I'm lucky to even get a holiday paid for.

We went out for drinks, had a great time and were hitting it off really well. I'm not getting my new apartment until Saturday, and until then I've been living with my ex. Horrible idea, but it's my only viable option. Last night, my ex said she wanted me back by 11 because she was going to deadbolt the door so she feels safe. Fair enough, but I wasn't going to make it back by 11 from the bar that was half an hour away and she never responded after I asked her not to lock me out. I assumed I didn't have anywhere to stay, but it turns out she left the door unlocked and pulled out the bed from the couch for me to sleep on which was super nice of her. She called me about 6 times this morning before I woke up wanting to know where I was, and I feel like a total piece of shit. Her and I haven't been nice to each other in a while, neither of us were good in the relationship. We argued way too much. Am I an asshole for sleeping at another girl's apartment?

So my birthday is on Sunday, and I’m turning 17. As far as I can remember, there’s always been some dumb drama (examples include: my dramatic ass cousin somehow managing to make my sweet 16 about him not getting me a birthday gift when I didn’t give a shit, my parents inviting over people when I say I would like a family only thing, and in general just dramatic Indian family members) that’s occurred on my birthday and at this point, I’m really tired of it. To avoid something like this, I just decided to treat my upcoming birthday as no biggy, and not do anything to celebrate. 

However, I’ve gotten some push back (idk if this is the proper term) from a few people that are really close to me about my decision and it’s got me wondering if this is a good idea. My mom said that it felt like I was ignoring all the work she put in to bring me into this world, and I definitely felt bad when I heard that. I love my mom, and I don’t want her to feel bad over my choice. My boyfriend also seemed kinda hurt that I didn’t want to do anything and I got where he was coming from, but he found out he’s not going to be in town, so in the end he didn’t really end up caring. One of my closest friends, K, really wanted to do something, but understood when I said I didn’t want to celebrate, because I was adamant about this when I’m usually not. 

K wanted to come over to celebrate school being over and hang out, and I was fine with it as it seemed more of an end of school thing. My parents have met her and she’s been over to my house before, so her coming isn’t an issue. However, I’m worried that she or my parents will try to spring birthday activities on me and am worrying whether it’s a good idea as the date approaches. I’m hoping that none of them will as they know that I hate surprises, but ya never know.

c06itf	2019-06-13 14:30:51		AITA for abandoning my best friend when she's pregnant	"Never posted before however found this sub and thought it would be the perfect place to explore my current dilemma. I'll try to keep it brief...

My best friend Hannah\* is pregnant and engaged to Tim\* who she has been with for 2 years. She's changed a lot since they got together and we became increasingly distant as friends (we were previously very close). I spent quite a bit of time around Hannah and Tim (when Hannah moved in with me) and found him to be obnoxious, provocative and arrogant. I confronted Hannah about this and she acknowledged he can be ""controversial"" however assured me she has brought a lot of these things up with him. I eventually got to the point where I couldn't be around them and our friendship broke down (due to lack of communication amongst other things). She moved in with Tim and within a month was engaged and pregnant. I was genuinely happy for her that she finally got her dream of getting pregnant despite my reservations about Tim. I agreed to meet Tim however when I did we ended up arguing - it wasn't pleasant. Following this I told Hannah I needed space from this unhealthy situation as it felt really uncontained and messy. She was very resistant to me backing off and insisted we resolved things. I explained I did not want a relationship with Tim and could only see our friendship continuing if I have nothing to do with him. She said she needed space to figure out what she wanted. 

We last spoke two months ago. A mutual friend told me she is struggling with her mood in her pregnancy (now 7 months in) and hasn't been very supported by people around her (such as family who also have reservations about Tim). She told our friend that she still isn't ready to speak to me. AITA in this situation for refusing to be civil with Tim? I still feel hurt because it feels like she has chosen Tim but I'm also aware that she's now pregnant and engaged and feel like our friendship may seem very insignificant to her now. I'm not asking her to end things with Tim (he's now the father of her child after all) but I want her to at least acknowledge a few things and I think I'm struggling with feeling like the bad guy.

c06hnq	2019-06-13 14:28:03	eliza_vic98	AITA For being mad at a stranger who keeps chaining their bike to my house?	"So, some context, I’m in college, 21F, I live less than 5min walk from a large college campus, right on a main street, 5 other housemates (all good friends). We have drunk people on our porch a lot, people think it’s cool to park in our driveway, and we’ve had a bike or two get left next to our own bikes for a couple weeks then disappear. Not a huge deal. One-time issues, if we see the people responsible we talk, they apologize, no biggie. 

Then there’s bike guy. From what I’ve seen from the back of his head across the alley, he seems to be around my age, Asian, pretty scrawny, and has no respect for other people’s property. 3 days in a row now, I’ve come home from class to see his bike chained up next to mine on the back of my house. At first I assumed it was one of my housemates, but come to find out nobody knows where it came from. After about 3pm, it disappears, and then reappears the next morning. I’m pissed, y’all. Accidentally leaving your bike somewhere, in a rush one day, whatever, and then retrieving it later? Fine. Using my house a public bike rack? Not cool. 

So, I duct taped a sign to the bike today, which reads: “Do Not Park Here. This is not your house. Go away. If you park here again, I will cut your lock, and you won’t see your bike ever again.” 

Will update if anything comes of it, but am I overreacting?




*****Update*****

The bike is gone, and the note was folded/crumpled up and left in the middle of my driveway. Will update again if he returns!




*****Update and more info*****

For clarification, the “bike rack” is a railing attached directly to my house. He would have been less than 5ft from my back door to lock his bike there. 

I saw him today riding through the alleyway next to my house heading toward campus. I was going to try to flag him down (to say something along the lines of apologizing for how harsh the note was) and maybe work something out, but my cat tried to follow me out the door and chaos ensued and then he was long gone. 

For those saying I’m the AH for the note: yeah, the note I left was pretty harsh. I agree, I was being petty and should have said something nicer as a first contact. 

For those calling me a racist for using the word Asian: I’m sorry I got nasty with some of you. I stand by my defense that it’s just the way I write and I would have used white if that were the case. However I shouldn’t have reacted as I did. I understand where you all are coming from. I am a *student* in social psychology and have done a decent amount of research with my faculty regarding prejudice and discrimination, so yeah I got touchy and defensive being accused like that. Sorry. I won’t be responding to comments anymore regarding that aspect of my post.  


Lastly, thanks all for your insight. I have come to the conclusion that my frustration/anger here was due to having some control issues I need to work on. If he had asked, I would have been fine with it, which tells me this is more about me having control over the situation than it is about the situation itself.

He’s evidentially on campus for the summer, probably taking classes based on the regularity of his schedule that I’ve seen, so if I see him again and have the chance to strike up a conversation I will update y’all. Until then, ✌️"	Not enough info	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I have been torn up about the possibility of my mother coming to help when our baby is born (I’m seven months pregnant with our first child) and have been considering tell her I don’t want her to come.

Some background: I am an only child. When I was fourteen or fifteen my mom had been slowly working to isolate me from my father which I didn’t realize at the time. She requested a divorce from him and I ended up cutting ties with my dad slowly at first then completely. (Now as an adult I am trying to mend this relationship, but it is still difficult). I moved away from my mom when I was eighteen to live with my grandparents (her side) because she was taking away my paychecks to the point where I didn’t even have gas to get to work and was told that I just had to figure out for myself or take the bus. During my time of living with my grandparents I grew closer to my now husband and ended up moving to his state (we met online when we were thirteen and had talked on and off over the years) to be with him. About a year and a half later we were married. My mom strongly dislikes my husband as she was convinced he was being used as an escape route from her and to hurt her. None of which was true. She, in the nearly nine years we have been married now, has NEVER tried to even get to know him nor his family. In fact, he is not even mentioned on the phone when we do talk.

Anyhow, I have been seen to see (and still am seeing) psychologists due to current issues I have. During these sessions I have discovered she used parental alienation (now considered a form of child abuse), manipulation, guilt trips, and her talking down to me has completely destroyed my self-esteem over the years. When I told her that my husband and I were pregnant she immediately changed her tune. She has been pushing to be more involved in my life suddenly, wants to know details of my pregnancy and more (things she’s never wanted to know before), and has already decided that once she knows I am in labor she is flying out here to stay and help. Since hearing this I have been stressing over it and in knots about the idea. I am having a little girl and I do not want her to face the manipulation and everything that my mother is. In fact, I would rather her not be a part of my daughter’s life at all. 

So, my question is WIBTA if I told my mom I couldn’t cope with her being here after our daughter is born on top of trying to figure out how to be a new mom and dealing with a newborn? Thanks to anyone who answers."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My father in law had been looking after this house since his father passed and was using it as a personal storage facility whilst keeping all of his parents belongings in the house, his mother passed many years before his father.

So when we asked to move into the house as it was bigger than our own he agreed, as long as after we get it all sorted out that we pay a 'peppercorn rent'.

It turns out this rent is nearly as much as our old mortgage but we can afford it. The issue is though we cannot use one room of our 3 bed house because he has stored lots of old books and timetables (really into trains) in this room. We have managed to fit one desk in here but other than that it is unusable.

I'm getting pretty annoyed because we had asked him about moving the belongings and he said to give him 6 months. It's nearly been a year and nothing has been moved, but everytime we try and broach the subject he basically throws a hissy fit saying that he's nice enough to let us live here.

I can't pack away some of our belongings or have a place to properly study as we don't have an office. I'm having to use the dining table for my desktop.

WIBTA if I just packed away and moved the items out the room or at least asked if they can reduce the rent since we literally cannot use one of the rooms in our house?

I moved to a new city and a few months later my friend followed. It's nearly impossible to get a rental here so we decided to move in together. I found the apartment and set everything up, paid our first rent and a one-month deposit. She hasn't paid back because she doesn't have much money. I do okay, so I haven't hassled her for it.

The first few months we had no problems living together. Then she started having problems with her job and I got her an extra job at my work. Since it was my job to begin with, we agreed that she would only do the shifts that I couldn't do. However, as time went on she started doing shifts that I could have done. I told her that this wasn't really fair but she just gladly accepted the work and basically told me to stop being a bad friend, she needed the money too.

She also has a dog. We agreed that she would be 100% responsible for the dog, no matter what. I would help out and take the dog out if she was working, but that would always be up to me and not expected. She has been asking me to walk the dog a few times a week and always telling me it's because she's working long days. I usually take the dog for a walk but instead of her coming home after work, she goes out with her friends (never invites me along BTW) and comes home around 03:00-04:00. I feel like she's only asking me to walk the dog so she can go out and party. I told her this is not OK, I would take the dog out if she actually does have to work but if she just wants to party she needs to take care of the dog first and then go out. She agreed but continues to do this anyway.

The dog also destroys our things and pees and sh\*ts everywhere when she's away. Roommate told me that I don't have to clean up after the dog at first but then got mad at me when I didn't clean it and told me she wouldn't pay for the damage caused by the pee/sh\*t (this would come out of the deposit I paid for). So now I'm cleaning pee and sh\*t every single day, sometimes multiple times a day.

We also agreed that we'd let the other person know in advance if there was going to be someone staying over. I've honored this rule and let her know when my boyfriend is staying over. She has not. Once I came home to find her and her date going at it in the living room. She apologized profusely, and we agreed she'd tell me from now on if she had someone over. She brought home another guy the very next night without telling me.

She also eats my food and lets me know afterwards. She always promises to buy me more and so far has been keeping her word. But it annoys me that she doesn't give me the option to say no.

This is getting on my nerves, so I'm considering moving out. This would leave her in the shit because she has no steady income and it won't be easy finding an apartment with no income and a dog. She thinks that I'm being a bad friend, but AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
c06ehh	2019-06-13 14:20:13	Ghostreed	AITA For not wanting to stay friends with a dead guy?	"This all starts when two years ago, my buddies and I started hanging with this guy at school, we’ll call him Y. Y was a seemingly nice dude, fairly funny, and shared some common interests. We all became fast friends. Life was good and as we got closer he told us that he had some medical condition that caused him a lot of pain around his ribs/heart, that’s all that was said about. Then, out of nowhere, he disappeared, stopped coming to school. A few days later, we got a text from his phone saying he was dead. We were told he died due to a surgery complication, there was no funeral, which we thought was odd, but we didn’t know his folks so we couldn’t press the issue. We moved on.

Now, two years later, I get added on Snapchat by a stranger who then calls me, it’s Y. I was in shock, in my mind I was talking to a dead guy, but it seems now that he isn’t as dead as we thought. He tells me his side of the story and it turns out he disappeared because of a surgery because he had bone cancer. In that time someone he was close to had stolen his phone and told all his friends he was dead, he did not know about it until just about the time he was out of the hospital. However, when he got out he didn’t want to go back to the old school and moved away. He didn’t tell anyone from our school, he just left. He had called to apologize and see if we could still be friends, but I’m skeptical at how much of this is true.

In our time of being friends, the others and I caught him in some white lies, we had come to the conclusion he may be a compulsive liar. He had also either 
A. Exaggerated major stories about his life or
B. Lied completely about them.
Because he also tried to one-up the others problems. Now at the time, we didn’t really care cause it was no harm no foul. But with that at the back of my mind it makes his story hard to believe. 

I don’t know whether he’s telling the truth or not but that doesn’t change the fact that he’s back. He didn’t tell us he was alive and this really changes the situation. I don’t want to become friends with him again because my trust was betrayed. Am I the asshole for not wanting to let him back into my life?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	9.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

I have been with my fiancee Alesha for four years and have been engaged for six months. She is Sri Lankan and I am English. She was sent to the UK to study and then work and we met at our company. 

Alesha's parents are what some would describe as ''old money'' in their country. They are extremely well off with wealth going back generations. When both of her siblings got married, they were gifted a large sum of money, their currency's equivalent of around £20,000. Alesha said that amount is also coming her way when we marry. 

I'm conflicted. I've prided myself on earning everything I've got. I worked hard at school, went to university, built myself a career and earn a great salary, as Alesha does too. Obviously I don't want her parents to feel like I don't appreciate their generosity but I've always had a thing (which I recognise) as a problem about not accepting help from anyone. I know it's just a silly ''manly pride'' thing but it's hard to get out of that mentality.

A little background: I am a trans (29 MtF) person who has separate circle of friends. There's my gaming friends, my weab friends, and my MtF sisters. I have always been close to the first two circle prior to me transitioning (just hormones, not post-op or anything). The MtF circle came along as I made the big jump and they helped me both settle and with the medication I started taking. Really supportive and helpful girls they are.

So onto the meat:

Ever since I started the whole transition thingamajig, I never really cared much if people ""adapt"" to me to a sense that, even if people call me a ""guy"" or ""sir"" even if I totally pass, and is full time. Hell, even with my other circles, we still joke about ""guys being guys"" and even with the random ""duuuuude"", ""bruh"" and stuff. I honestly do not care because I am that kind of person who's not ""overly gay"" (in fact, I don't even like guys) or is sensitive about those things. I never really needed the approval of others to feel comfortable in my own skin. Problem is, my MtF circle constantly flares up on people who ""misgender"" (their term, not mine) me, and always gets ""offended"" on my behalf, and would often go ballistic even if I say everything is okay and that I am fine and not offended, jfc they even had a rough brush with my other circles about it. They say that with me behaving like this is like me telling and empowering the people who do the ""misgendering"", giving them false impressions that the same behavior will be okay with other trans people which apparently, is not okay. 'Ya know, being all SJW and stuff. I have told them time and time that it's just me being me, and that my other cirlces know how to respect pronouns and stuff but they refuse to budge and called me an asshole and a cancer to the whole LGBTetc community cuz of it.

My friends who are interning in my home city this summer want to take a trip to Canada this weekend. Our plan is to leave late Friday, explore Saturday, and leave Sunday.

Now this coming Sunday is Father’s Day. The plan is to leave Canada Sunday at 10:00am by the latest and get back by noon. I feel guilty cause it is Father’s day, but I figured I’d probably be sleeping in anyways on Father’s day and I could still spend noon onward with my dad, maybe get some dinner, go to a movie, and give him his present.

For some context, I called him and told him the plan, and he’s okay with it. But part of me feels like maybe he’s just saying that. My biggest worry is that he will feel hurt or something will happen that delays me coming home, but this is an opportunity to go to Canada which I’ve never really explored, hang out with these people who I’m only going to spend 3 months with until I don’t see them for a long time, and I will be back by noon (if everything goes well) and fully plan to spend the entire afternoon with him.

c06678	2019-06-13 14:00:31		AITA for cutting a good friend out of my life for sleeping with a guy I had a fling with even though I’m in a relationship now?	"To start this off, I believe that I’m 100% justified in my feelings and my decision to dump her. I’m writing this because others are saying that I’m overreacting and should forgive her because I’m in a relationship and I was never with that guy. I get that, but to me it goes much deeper. 

Firstly, she and I lived together (I just moved out). During my fling with this guy, she was there for it all. Not only that, but she’s kind of the reason things didn’t last. Once he met her, he couldn’t stop asking me about her and badgering me to hook them up or have a threesome. Basically being a major fuckboy douche. When I told her these things (amongst the many other douchey things he said and did) she acted like she was disgusted by him and basically encouraged me to drop him. In all honesty, I wanted to keep seeing him because the sex was incredible but I really didn’t want a riff on our friendship so I cut him off. 

I got with my boyfriend soon after and basically forgot about the other guy. We only knew each other for about a week so it wasn’t too difficult to “get over”’him. I was and still am very happy with my boyfriend and didn’t feel an ounce of regret about cutting off the other guy especially since he was such a dbag to me. Life was amazing for a couple of weeks..until it wasn’t. 

I came back to my apartment from an outing to see my ex-fling in his underwear, my friend’s door wide open. The way he looked, it was obvious that he didn’t intend for me to see him. I felt an overwhelming rush of betrayal and nausea. I ran outside and I was so sick to my stomach that I puked on the pavement. I started screaming and crying and ran to my other friend’s apartment to tell her what happened. I ended up falling asleep from exhaustion and I woke up to a text from my “friend” apologizing. I promptly told her to fuck off. Which I don’t feel guilty about because when I went back 2 days later, guess who I saw again?

So, she’s dead to me. She was one of my closest friends, probably the closest, but she showed me that our friendship meant less to her than it did to me. This probably wouldn’t even be the case had she told me beforehand, but she didn’t.

c0664q	2019-06-13 14:00:20	throwaway_proposal1	AITA for not wanting to tow my fiance's car 50 miles to get it worked on?	"My fiance has a car in their grandfather's name. It is, as far as anyone is concerned, my fiance's car. That is, until something is wrong with it, in which case it is *suddenly* my fiance's grandpa's car and it needs to be serviced by grandpa's mechanic. Grandpa lives 50 miles away. (Until now this hasn't been an issue.)

My fiance and I each have a car. Without this car, they will have to take my car to work and I'll have to uber/cab. (Fiance works farther away.)

A couple of days ago, the car broke down again. It won't start because of an ignition issue. My neighbor who is a mechanic looked at it, and said it's a less-than-$100 fix.

Grandpa is out of town, so we ask fiance's mom and stepdad--""Hey, can we get this car fixed today? We have a mechanic we trust and we'll pay for the fix.""

They say no. Not only that, but they know I have 100 miles of free towing from AAA and they want me to tow the car 50 miles so it can sit in Grandpa's garage until he gets back from vacation so that, *then*, the mechanic can work on it. That'll be sometime next Wednesday.

I tell them that's not going to work. My fiance won't be able to get to work and might lose their job. I again offer to pay to fix the car myself, which will cost significantly less than the lost pay from my fiance's car.

They again say no, and demand that we tow it back to them.

Most recently, I told them that I will tow it back to them, but they really should compensate us for the uber/cab fare. My uber to and from work would be about $25/day. I figured, if they're going to be unreasonable about the mechanic, then I'll try to meet in the middle.

I instantly got pissed and I couldnt contain myself and I wanted to get him back. I knew that he once got an integrity violation before in his coding class which is a class know for cheating and passing over code to one another during tests.

I learned relatively quickly it's a rough household. My girlfriend is exceedingly controlling of her daughter. Not allowed out, not allowed to have a job, not allowed a cellphone. She doesn't protest because she can't go anywhere else. It's either live by mommy's rules or be homeless to be frank. There's no abuse other than mental/emotional, just so I'm clear. She's all peachy keen when my son (17) comes over, it's like she's a different person. She's a good ""stepmom"" to my son but an abysmal mother to her own.

I kind of took a passive approach to this. I didn't interfere because she's not my child. She wasn't too friendly with me early on but she's grown to like me enough to open up about these things. At this point two years in, we're very close. She even calls me ""dad"" which struck me as odd but she never had any father in her life, at least not this long.

I think the turning point for me was when we decided to bring a puppy into the home. I grew up with lapdogs who roamed free throughout the house, but she decided this dog would stay in a cage for 18-20 hours a day and only let out to eat and mess outside. Despite my protests and attempts to let her roam free, my girlfriend eventually put a key lock on her cage. We became very distant after this.

The daughter proposed to me that we all leave this relationship. She's an adult and wants to make this decision to flee her mother. She wanted my help because she can't otherwise. I was going to leave my girlfriend anyways over the treatment of the dog. I can afford a good 3bdr apartment, easy, so a +1 I think could be a good idea. This could also be her only way of escape. My plan was to have an apartment with my son and dog, but the addition of stepdaughter wouldn't hurt.

Am I the asshole for effectively stealing away my girlfriend's daughter to live with me?

I’m finishing grade 11 soon. My dad around February scored a great job, unionized, on almost the other side of the country. His family all lives there, and he accepted it. 

Obviously I’m happy he got a good job to support our family, and I never ever would ask him to not take it because of me.

My mom and I, as well as my younger sister, stayed while my dad worked to get enough money for them all to move down. My younger brother lived with him, as he wanted to move more than anyone.

My mother and sister moved a month ago, and here I am, still here, but now living with a friend.

My reasoning was pretty sound I think, but a lot of my family is acting like I’m an asshole for it, and my friends parents frequently comment that they’d never let their kid live apart from them before turning 18. They treat me like my parents are letting me have too much freedom, and I’m an entitled prick.

I chose to stay for a lot of reasons. Firstly, I don’t want to move for 1 year, only to move again the year after for post secondary. Also, I want to graduate with the people I’ve grown up with, not strangers. I view my current living situation as just part of growing up. 

I am employed, living with a friend, who’s like a brother to me. I’ve known his parents for years and they accept me as another son. I have a relationship, tons of friends, and a school I like. I am safe, happy, doing what’s best for me. AND, I am in almost no way financially supported by my parents, aside from the occasional loan (always paid back on payday). But people call me selfish, frequently.

I’m on great terms with my parents, and while they don’t agree with my decision, they allow me to make it. However, my aunts, grandparents, etc. are all pissy with me for choosing to live my own life.

I know my decision was for my benefit rather than my parents, and my parents are unhappy with me living so far away at a young age. I’m aware that it stresses them out, I’m aware that they’d rather I be with them, and I’m aware of the legal mess that could ensue if anything happens to me prior to me turning 18. But, at the same time, I feel as though I’m at an age where I need to start living like my own person, rather than acting as my parent’s child.

c05z5x	2019-06-13 13:42:37	TheDandiestGentleman	"AITA for angrily stopping a kid from ""playing"" with a dog?"	"So, the story begins as I was walking home from work. I live and work in China, and was walking up to my apartment building. I was just about to turn to walk into the small elevator area for my particular block of the building when I saw a trio of small kids (difficult to age, but I'd estimate between 6 - 9 ) playing with a dog. Now, this was a small dog (I'm not a dog expert, so I couldn't tell you the breed, but it's about a foot tall at the head), and it had one of those collars and harnesses on it. I see it around that area a lot, and I think it belongs to the peeps who own and run the restaurant beneath my building. In China, from what I've seen, it's not uncommon for dogs to be off the lead outside places of business, and for kids who don't know the owners to walk past and pet it or play with it because...well, kids will be kids.

&#x200B;

Anyway, them playing with the dog isn't an issue. Not my dog, not my place, right? But the problem was how they were playing with the dog. They had one of those almost fabric-y plastic mailbags, the kind of sacks you get certain packages in that are tied up at the mouth with thick string, and I watched as they placed it over the top of the dog. To be clear, they didn't attempt to shove the dog into it, they didn't pick it up, they didn't jump on top of it. All they did was place the bag over the top and around the dog, so the dog was standing on the floor with the big bag over the top of it. 

&#x200B;

I immediately got angry; I hadn't seen the kids around that much before, so I didn't know if they knew the owner of the dog, and I was thinking that this was exceptionally dangerous. The dog can't get out of the bag if it wants to, and can easily become tangled up. It could twist or break a leg, and the kids are not going to be able to safely handle a flailing, panicking dog if it does get stuck. So I storm over there, take the bag off the dog and throw it in the nearby bin. I give the oldest of the kids a scowl and the upturned-palm, spread arms gesture of ""What the hell is wrong with you"" and call them stupid. She looked at me with an absolutely shocked expression as I walked away, which I put down to Chinese culture in general being very much a ""Mind your own business"" thing, where people aren't used to strangers getting involved; people tend to look away and hurry along down the street if they see somebody that needs help, or an altercation or something.

&#x200B;

I came down for dinner a little bit later, and as I walked past that restaurant, I saw one of the cafe owners quizzing the girl on her schoolwork, with the dog curled up at her feet. Suddenly I had doubts; does she know the owners? Is that her dog? Is that how she plays with her dog? The dog didn't seem overly bothered by the whole thing, so did I overreact and insert myself somewhere I had no business being?

- I also just politely explained how I would be uncomfortable if he ever asked me if I thought a guy in our class was cute, if he ever asked me to wing man with him, things like that etc.. 

- I also just expressed to him that I don’t mean to be rude if I get uncomfortable or awkward if I see him hooking up with a guy.. idk I just get awkward seeing it..

AITA for expressing these things? He didn’t get upset but he wasn’t like “that’s perfectly fine with me” either.. I didn’t want it to be like a list of ground rules but I just wanted to express some things initially.. AITA?"	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c05x63	2019-06-13 13:37:31	yeahthatsucks4real	AITA If i let my ex and myself get evicted...	"Background:

We lived together for almost two years and we broke up 4 months ago. I am overseas and I alone have paid all the rent in full up until we broke up. We made an agreement about who would pay what on the remainder of the lease in exchange for furniture and other arrangements etc. I paid my part months ago, and I had my family retrieve the things we agreed I was keeping (personal item, clothes, some furniture etc..) 

I broke up with her because she was lying to me and cheating on me behind my back with a guy she is now together with. I have no hard feelings towards her as we were honesty both unhappy during he last several months with long distance and all. And I also have moved on in that regard. 

Now that the remaining balance has come down to $350 ish and we are about to get evicted tomorrow on the 14th of June, she wants to back out of the agreement because she says she has no money, here’s her email to me  

“I know the last thing in the entire world you want right now is to hear from me. I’m sure you’ve read the email the apartment management sent. I’ve paid all I can afford this month. My van is broke down so I don’t even have a vehicle right now. I have no other choice but to use that money to fix it. I spoke to the management and they understand that I cannot afford to pay anymore. They said the responsibility is still equally yours. The money simply does not exist in my bank account. I’m just trying to get on my feet and get a fresh start. If you never want to hear from me again please just pay the remaining balance. It’s only $364. I’ve weighed every option and I can’t pay it. The last thing I need is my credit being ruined when I’ve barely even started out. You don’t even have to reply to this email and you won’t hear from me again.”

The last conversation we had she talked about how she was going to spend the weekend of her birthday (this weekend) in Galveston or some shit at the beach. 

I am comfortable financially, and I am far away from the US and have no plans on returning to the US for another 8 months at least.. 

AITA for letting us get evicted?

EDIT: She has another place already as well.

Edit: thank you everyone for nudging me in the right direction. I paid it. Not for her. For me. Even tho I’m probably moving to Thailand, I did it because I worked hard on becoming financially responsible and secure long before her and I intend to be that way long after her. 

Also, I really do wish her the best. But she definitely taught me a life lesson.

Thank you guys and girls again. You all really helped me.

c05wvi	2019-06-13 13:36:37		AITA for wanting to go to a local game store event 2 days before my wife is due?	"Hi everyone, first time poster here but my wife frequents this sub a lot and has given me permission to post. Me and my wife are expecting our first child in late July and are both excited/anxious for the baby the to come. Now here is the issue:

My local game store has an event at midnight that celebrates a new expansion for a card game, I went for the first time 2 months ago and had a great time and planned to go to the next one. In total it was about 3 hours from 12am-2am on a Saturday. 

The next event that is being held is 2 days from our estimated due date and I told my wife that I planned to attend. I told her the game store is about 15 minutes away and if there was an emergency that she could call me and I would immediately go home to attend to her. 

She was not happy about this (it might also because I said it quickly in the car ride to the hardware store) and told me she was uncomfortable with the idea of me being away in the middle of the night so close to the due date. She argued ""what if"" something happened and she needed me right away, or was unable to call me. I mean that could be true but wasn't sure what the likelihood of her being unable to phone me was. I told her if she was so concerned about that scenario, why was she not worried when I would be at work for 7 hours that day (also my last day before patenrity leave) and she argued that day and night are completely different. 

So reddit, I personally think my wife is a little bit sensitive but don't want to invalidate her concerns as a first time anxious mother to be. Am I the asshole for wanting to attend my game store event for 3 hours in the middle of the night before my baby is due?"	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c05wui	2019-06-13 13:36:32	throwaway-account-1m	AITA-For body-shaming, according to my cousin?	" 

In order to celebrate school ending for all of us, we voted to go to the beach. This beach might be unique in that it’s a bit of a hook-up beach. The unofficial rule is “bikini implies that you want a hook-up, other swimsuits implies that you don’t”.

The main problem is that my 14-year-old sister looks mature. She wouldn’t pass for 21 or anything, but she would pass for around 16, which is the age of consent in our state. It’s usually not that much of a problem, but at a hook-up beach...I don’t want someone to get arrested because he unknowingly hooked up with a 14-year-old. I’m also worried for her as well, she doesn’t really know how to have safe-sex, she’s a virgin. I don’t want to be judgmental, but I don’t trust a first-timer and a 16-year-old to have safe-sex, especially since she’s extremely pro-life (and would refuse abortion). I’m also worried that she might get a STD. Condoms are meant to stop this, but they don’t help much if you don’t use them correctly, and I don’t want to risk it.

My solution was offer her a more conservative suit. She agreed happily because she loved the design. I thought that it was all over after that, and felt rather proud of myself. I whispered to myself “Crisis averted”.  When my sister was at her friend's house, I called my bff and told her what I did and why I did it. Well, my cousin overheard, and said “Why are you so jealous? Why can’t you just let her wear what she wants? Stop trying to body-shame her!” 

Why I might be the asshole:

1. I assumed that she wouldn’t be able to have safe-sex, and I didn’t want to risk a pregnancy that she would refuse to end.
2. I didn’t include this, but I went and said that I gave it as a gift, so that I wouldn’t have to tell her the real reason.
3. I “forced” her to wear something because of unofficial rules that others set.

Why I might not be:

1. It is arguably reasonable to not want to put trust in a 14-year-old virgin and some 16-year-old guy to have safe-sex, considering the stakes.
2. Lying is justified in this case, because it didn’t hurt anyone and it would’ve been incredibly awkward to explain why I really did it, especially the part why I don’t trust them to practice safe-sex.
3. While I perhaps should’ve protested the unofficial rule, it’s not worth risking my sister’s pregnancy over.

"the other night my boyfriend and i drove to visit my parents for the night. had dinner, my bf had just bought a new car and it’s a stick shift so he let my little brother take him for a ride, etc. everyone’s having a good night. i will say that my dad was stressed about work or something and kept yelling at the dogs to stop barking which was just a little tense, my dad has had some major anger management issues especially when i was younger so it’s always tense for me and my siblings when he yells.

after dinner my parents want to play some game (they are HUGE on games). i should mention that my family is very fucking competitive when it comes to games. like, we haven’t been able to play Risk in years. it’s just bad. my boyfriend is the opposite - very calm, takes a lot to get him worked up, literally never yells about anything. “if you’re trying to make your point, make your argument better, don’t make your voice louder. being louder doesn’t make you right.” that kind of thing (which is so true)

i won’t go into every detail about the whole game but basically two people draw cards, each of the cards contains a different phrase and you have to shout out the answer to the other persons card quicker than they can shout out the answer to yours. the phrases can be innocent but they can get pretty crass. so at one point my dad and i each draw a card, his card is “a johnny depp movie” and my card is “slang word for sperm”. so i immediately shout out “edward scissorhands” and while i’m in the middle of the phrase he shouts out “cum”. i start to argue that since i began my answer first, i should get the point. (jeopardy rules - whoever buzzes first gets to go). my youngest brother and my boyfriend both disagree, saying with that argument you could just start with any syllable and drag it out until you think of an answer, and that the solution would be to think of a shorter phrase next time. my brother more-so than my bf just keeps repeating the same thing over and over, not letting me get in a word edgewise, and at this point i’m getting frustrated, not even about whether i’m right or not just that they literally won’t let me state my point or talk, my brother had talked over me four times at this point so i snapped at them both, gave my dad the point and just got over it. 

i’ve examined it and i really don’t feel strongly about the rule, it’s a game. i was upset that i wasn’t allowed to even give my opinion! AITA ??

TLDR; playing a game w family, arguing about a rule and nobody will let me get a word in. i snapped, not because i was wrong about the rule but because i was being talked over."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c05p65	2019-06-13 13:16:28	drinkinThatHaterade	AITA for refusing to give up a washing machine to a mother who ran back to get more clothes?	"**Tl;dr**: I removed a single child's shirt from a washing machine and proceeded to put my own stuff in it when the owner of the shirt showed up with additional laundry and wanted me to remove my stuff so she could put more of their stuff in, and I refused. 

**Background**: 
I am working an internship out of town this summer and my friends offered to let me sleep on their pull-out couch for free (so I can then pocket the measly housing stipend I was given from my internship). There is a community laundry room on their floor with 2 sets of washers and dryers.

**The incident**: 
It was 8:30 PM on a Sunday and I didn't have clean underwear for the next day. I walked into the laundry room and saw both washers were running, and when I walked back to the apartment I remembered my friends mentioning they were doing laundry (I didnt know if they had both washers or just one). After the time was up, I reminded him to go switch it, and then I walked over like 2 minutes later so I could put some in. 

I walked in and there was no one there but there was a laundry basket sitting next to the washers and one of them had stuff in it. I went to the one that looked empty (the lid was up) and saw a single child's shirt at the bottom. I figured it got left behind when someone switched the machine and took it out and placed it on the table next to it. I then threw some laundry pods in the machine and started putting some clothes in when this woman walks in (for context, she seemed like a nice lady and it seemed like English was her second language) She was the owner of the laundry basket and started apologizing for taking up the machines.

It was then that both of our eyes went to the machine I was putting stuff into. It was super awkward and she started asserting that ""didnt she have clothes in there?"" And that she had just ran back to her apartment to grab some more clothes to fill up the machine. I super uncomfortablely explained how and why I had removed the child's shirt. 

At this point, it was awkward, but she was treating it as some silly misunderstanding and clearly expected me to remove my stuff from the machine and let her have it. I was shocked that she expected me to remove my stuff and figured we could both just use one. She seemed shocked that I didn't offer to remove my stuff. 

After like 30 seconds she seemed annoyed and she just said ""its fine"", took her laundry and went back to the apartment.  Turns out she is my friends next-door neighbor. Shit.

I feel bad about it for a few reasons. AITA?

Edit: Just to include relevant info/points mentioned in comments: 1. The shirt was dry. I was running on autopilot and didn't realize until afterwards that it was impossible for the shirt to have been dry and left behind like I initially thought since the machines had just ran a cycle. 2. I do not pay rent here, she (presumably) does.

Edit2: Just to add, not that I think it makes a difference, but the machines are not free. We pay per load."	Not the A-hole	0	0	546.0	27.0	0.0	0.0
c05ovx	2019-06-13 13:15:48	confused-_-plant	AITA for leaving my 2 month old daughter to go on a night out?	"So i have a 2 month old daughter. My friends asked me and my partner to go out clubbing tomorrow for one of my friends 21st birthday. The town were going to is a 40 minute drive from where i live so instead of paying for a taxi we split an airbnb and decided to stay the night there and come back in the morning. Before agreeing to go or paying for the airbnb i made certain i had a babysitter for the night, the people taking care of her are my very capable and excited aunt and uncle who is also going to be my daughters godparents. This is the first time i will be away from her over night. The longest I’ve let her out for is 4 hours. 

Now, the problem is my in laws. My partners parents think Im wrong for only waiting 2 months before leaving my daughter for the night and they also had ago at me for not asking them to have her. They also said because my daughter wakes up through the night for a bottle im ‘selfish’ for expecting other people to deal with that. I explained that i did actually think of them but as it’ll be Friday going into Saturday and i know my partners dad works Saturdays and as they said themselves, she wakes up through the night, i asked my aunty and uncle to have her. They weren’t happy about this and still believe im being selfish for A) not asking them, B) going out after 2 months and C) ‘expecting’ someone else to deal with my baby. After i went home my partners mum text me to ask of they can have her next weekend, i said no because im not letting her out 2 weekends in a row plus ill be home so theres no need but the next time i do go out they’ll be the first people i ask. She asked when that will be and i said i dont know. She didnt reply and hasnt spoken to me in over a week, she usually texts every day to ask how baby is doing. 

I did explain to my aunty and uncle how she wakes up through the night and sometimes doesn’t go back to sleep for a few hours so obviously if they dont want to deal with that i wont go out, they told me not to be silly and to go and enjoy myself for once. They’ve also been texting me how excited they are and thanking me for trusting them with my little treasure. If needed i will be going home to look after her myself. 

I obviously felt a bit guilty about agreeing to leave my daughter for the night but i am really looking forward to be able to just let my hair down with my friends for the night. Im debating on just not going because of what my in laws said."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Really sorry about the length, just a bit raw.

So I was friends with this woman (completely platonic, was not interested). She's always wanted to model and I love playing with camera equipment so I borrow my friend's camera and we go out to the streets. 

It wasn't working. I tried to make conversation, talked about my family, her husband. Just random chit chat. I won't lie, I was getting a little annoyed. It's her thing and she wasn't putting any effort and it's about 90 minutes to my friend's house. We were closing up when this random guy asked her if she could pose for him. She said yes (without asking me) and I said I'm heading out for a coffee.

Fast forward 30 mins, she finds me in the Starbucks, tells to never leave her like that again and she was soooo embarrassed. Gave me the stink eye and left.

Photos were shit, she always reacts bad to shit photos and I didn't send them for a day, this is on me, it was a dick move and I apologized.

She stopped answering my texts. She has borderline personality disorder so sometimes she disappears and self harms so I was worried.

Four days later, she tells me she didn't want to talk to me and a list of all the things that are wrong with me, tells me to have a nice life.

There was a bit of a back and forth here because I considered her family and sometimes families fight you know? She said some things you can't unsay.

I was angry, I really was but I just couldn't keep arguing. 

A few months ago I lent her some money because she was really short (around $250). Look, she was like family to me. It's been five months since she borrowed the money and she's bought clothing, makeup and a daily pack of cigarettes.

I guess I snapped after everything she said, told her that since we were friends I didn't bug her about it. After all she said we were not friends and I asked her for my money back.

She went ballistic, telling me I'm a greedy bastard and I only stayed friends with her because she owes me money and other colorful expressions.

At this point I said something like ""I'm not your friend, I'm a bank. Your loan is overdue. It's been five months, in three weeks I'm taking this to small claims"".

I put up with a lot of her BPD crap but this time I was so hurt I felt that's the only thing I could to at least get some feeling of worth back.

I’ve gotten to know the boyfriend over the time they’ve been dating. We aren’t friends, but he’s a nice person. 

One of the times they were fighting he reached out to me about her cheating, did I know. And partly because he was trying to turn people against my friend for doing this to him. 

At the same time her and I were arguing about something, it was a pretty bad fight and we didn’t speak for a few days. And I, at the time, had no intention of continuing the friendship. 

When the boyfriend reached out I chatted with him a bit. I told him I hadn’t known about the cheating and I thought it was awful she did that and commiserated a bit about being cheated on. 

A few days later I calmed down and my friend and I talked and somewhat worked things out, we’re friends again. We haven’t really talked a lot since this, about a month now, but we aren’t not friends. 

My friend and her boyfriend decided to work things out too. She is my best friend and her loss in my life would be huge. It’s not a friendship I would give up lightly. 

He went through her phone one night while she was sleeping and saw her and I were talking again and got pissed. At me. Sent me a long message telling me how awful I was and calling me a liar. Then blocked my number and blocked me on social before I could respond. 

Now, a month later they are fighting again and he unblocked me, but only to make nasty comments to me about me, calling me fake, etc. 

I feel bad for him, he’s in a shit situation and my friend is being an awful person. And I’ve told my friend that I think this.

It's all fun and games and neither of us get upset when this theme of playground insults are being thrown around. Now the problem arouse when he started talking about family. 

Tbh, i always thought the sorta unspoken rule of shit talk and line you dont cross is when you talk about family, so i never brought it up or involved his family while we were in our little playground insult banter battle. 

Regardless of this, he started to insult my family members and making jokes about them. Stuff like how my sister is so hot and he wants to have sex with her, or how my brother is a retard because he has autism or poking fun at his autism, etc etc.

If i'm being honest it did bother me a bit at first, but then i learned to just take it as a joke, and not get pissed or upset. 
But because he opened this can of worms, i feel its fair game for me to retaliate.

His father is bald and is in a wheelchair for the time being because hes awaiting surgery for his back, and his brother is in prison for life.

With this information, i made a little joke about how his family is basically members of the x-men, and how is dad is basically professsor x, and that he should team up with magneto and break his brother out of prison. 

This got him really upset and he seemed super pissed about it, and told me that it's fucked up that i would make a joke about that.

I would usually agree with him that it would be fucked up to do that unprovoked, but he's the one who decided to erase the lines when he decided to start making jokes about my family, and i didnt make a big deal out of it and i assumed it was fair game.

Our bedroom/ living room area is basically in the finished attic space. Since heat rises, it can get pretty hot up there. We have four small windows, in sets of 2 on opposite walls. One of the windows on each side is screened the other is totally open. We currently keep the screened windows open and usually have a box fan set up in one of them.

I’m a cold blooded person and don’t mind the heat, but he always wants it cooler. He suggests opening the additional unscreened windows for extra airflow, but I am extremely uncomfortable with this idea. I have a crazy fear of bats getting in! Just thinking about it is giving me anxiety. I’m tolerant of the extra window being open during the day if someone is in there and it’s covered by the box fan, but definitely not at night or unobserved. 

He thinks I’m being unreasonable, but even allowing a slight chance of getting rabies is too damn high! I realize it’s a little irrational because the chances are really low, but I’d rather know I’m safe than feel an extra cool breeze.

I’m a definite believer that people should be comfortable in their own home, but it seems like a lose-lose to me. If he’s at a comfortable temperature, I’ll be really scared and feel unsafe. If I feel secure and comfortable, he’ll be too hot. 

AITA for basically prioritizing my mental comfort over his physical comfort?

Edit: I didn’t put another screen on these windows because they’re an unusual size, and I haven’t found any that fit. Didn’t search high and low since this issue doesn’t come up a lot but ya that’s why.

Edit: it seems like a lot of you are saying I’m TA because I’m being irrational but I acknowledge that. The question is not am I being irrational it is - I have a very specific phobia of bats in this extremely specific scenario and should that be respected?

I stood in play and it kept on trying to jump in my arms and it kept putting it's paws near my inner thy so I starter petting it for about 10 seconds before the owner came, yelled at her dog and the dog sadly walked away while still looking at me. The woman looked at me angry as if I was hurting her dog so I quickly sped walked out of there. AMTIA?"	No A-holes here	0	0	40.0	4.0	0.0	0.0
c05io3	2019-06-13 12:59:52	uuuuhhm	AITA for becoming fed up with my best friend’s negativity	Throwaway account. One of my closest friends is struggling a bit right now with school and her family life and i really do feel bad for her. She often comes to me to rant which i used to feel kind of flattered by (because idk it means she’s trusts me?) but am slowly becoming tired of. I’m trying to help her and honestly i think my advice is quite helpful but anytime i provide any kind of solution she ALWAYS has a way to discredit it. For example, she’s having trouble finding a job, i offer as many genuinely helpful solutions as i can, i send her any job applications that she matches the requirements for, i offer alternatives, i suggest people and places she can go to for help, and i generally try and do this for all the issues she comes to me about. But she’s starting to exhaust me. She can literally think of an excuse for ANYTHING and her attitude is so negative that it begins to ruin my mood. I don’t know how she’s going to get anywhere in life if she continues her stubborn ( and i mean STUBBORN ) way of thinking/living. Also, touching on the job note, i recently got a new job which i am very grateful for because i’ve also struggled finding one and she immediately started making resentful remarks. I wasn’t expecting her to shower me with praises or anything but i’ve really struggled trying to find a job and it would just be nice if she felt happy for me instead of making jokes (i honestly don’t know if they are jokes tho, it’s hard to tell whether she’s being serious or not) about how i dont deserve the job, and why isn’t SHE hired? sorry if this is too ramble-y i just feel bad that i’m starting to kinda dislike her now that i realise how awful her attitude toward everything is but at the same time i really am trying to help her. Am i an asshole for not wanting her to come for me for help anymore?	Not the A-hole	0	0	3.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

c05iil	2019-06-13 12:59:24	mailboxrunin	WIBTA if we “forget” my husband on Father’s Day?	"TLDR My husband didn’t wish me a happy Mother’s Day or birthday.  Should his day be overlooked as well?

For context:  on both Mother’s Day and my birthday, my husband was very aware of the events (we were going to brunch with his family on Mother’s Day; my 7 years old wished me a happy birthday in front of him).  I didn’t expect an extravagant gift and in the past it has varied between homemade to something bigger for both of us.  I didn’t get a card, gift, or verbal acknowledgement from him this year.  To be clear, the thing that hurts me is that he never said anything/recognized me on either days.  

I did say something to him after the fact that he didn’t wish a happy birthday or Mother’s Day to me and he replied that he was sick on my birthday (he had a cold) and was angry with me on Mother’s Day.  I was running late trying to get my oldest and the baby ready to go.  In my defense I started two hours before the agreed upon Mother’s Day brunch time but since it was our first time going out with the newborn baby, I just couldn’t get it together in time so told them to go without me because I didn’t want my daughter to miss out on seeing her grandma.  They did go without me btw.  

He did eventually get me a small birthday present, which he left on the kitchen counter but it was one of those “too little, too late” situations and I still feel hurt.  

So WIBTA if we “forgot” Father’s Day this year?  

I’m conflicted and honestly confused.  As I’ve said, I’m still.. hurt by what happened and have no desire to recognize him on Father’s Day.  At the same time, this isn’t for me; it’s for my daughter and I don’t want my feelings to impact her day with dad.  She did make him a homemade Father’s Day card for the day though so he will get something..  

Also when I take a step back to see what this would achieve, I don’t think it’d be productive..  but I’m still angry and I don’t think he should have a day this year.

"I am 15 so please understand that I don't know everything and things are probably different than they were when other people in high school. I just need some judgment here about what to do and what not.  

I am in summer school because we need a PE credit to graduate and summer school PE is more fun because you go bowling, go hiking, visit dogs at the Human Society and what not.  Since we rarely stay on campus we have the same bus driver every day and she's one of those ladies who has probably been driven crazy over the years by stupid kids. You can tell she was once nice but is just sort of broken now. Our PE teacher has already expelled on kid for acting out on the bus well that just made things worse with this kid Aaron. Aaron is the worst kid I've ever met and even when he's being quiet it drives the bus driver insane because even quiet he's mocking her. Does that make sense?

Well Aaron was staring at the bus driver with a smug look in that mirror thing that's above her seat but he was being quiet. The bus driver pulled over into a parking lot and demanded the teacher do something about it. The teacher said she was sorry but Aaron was sitting quietly but she would move him to the back I was in the back seat as well but in the opposite seat and what not. I was looking at Aaron and all of the sudden he dropped his pants and literally shit right on the seat. It was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen and what not. It smelled so horrible. 

As we were getting off the bus for pick up Aaron came up to me and told me that if I ever said anything he would be the crap out of me. I told him I wouldn't. But I feel so bad for that bus driver having to clean up human shit. I know she's weird but that just seems so over the top and like something she shouldn't have to do but Aaron is a super senior and he would seriously kick my ass if I said anything. Would I be the asshole if I say anything?

c05gzp	2019-06-13 12:55:20	DevilInTheHat	AITA for asking someone to attend to their own screaming child?	"Post was previously removed due to exceeding the character limit so I will try and make it as concise as possible. 

Golden rule is that you should never tell someone how to raise their child but this is different. 

Girlfriend (J) and I lived in a terrace house next door to D(m) G(f) and their daughter L. We were there for exactly one year. 

During this year we became friends with D and G and we had multiple conversations about how we could hear everything that happened in each other’s houses. No exaggeration, we could hear D sneeze or cough through the wall. There is a lot of context here which I am omitting but it’s only background but they were not considerate at all in many respects. 

Now, L was suffering with a hearing problem so would scream for her parents to come attend her and would only stop screaming when one of them got to her. For a couple weeks, we lived with it because L couldn’t help it and screaming was the only way she could tell her parents that she wanted help. Our issue was that she was left screaming for over an hour sometimes until someone came to her, bearing in mind that we’ve had conversations about how little sound proofing their is. 

They took her to the doctors and this stopped for two days. Then she would scream and scream. We asked D if he thinks he should take L back to the D’s and he said there’s nothing they can do, she just needs to run the course of medication. 

Jump forward about three weeks later so five weeks in total of screaming every night. L must have been screaming for an hour and a half with one one coming to her aid. I text D saying “can you please go and see L”. D was pissed up so passed out on the sofa which he often is. G must have decided that D should be the one to attend her as she’s been with her all day. 

D tries to apologise but G falls out with us for sending that message. It wasn’t saying they were shitty parents it was just asking them to go pick her up. Five weeks of screaming every single night until one of them went to her"	Not the A-hole	0	0	544.0	25.0	0.0	0.0
c05fy1	2019-06-13 12:52:25	LivingWave	AITA for telling my friend to go duck himself	"So this happened like 10 minutes ago.

I was playing a game called ""Dead by Daylight"". During the game that lasts around 10 minutes, my friend sent me a few messages on skype and since I wasn't replaying for a few seconds, he decided to call me. Once he called me, my whole game stopped for about 5 seconds and I lost sound for about 20 seconds. Now keep in mind that in this game every second counts, and without sound you're 60% useless. Now, there was no way he could've known I was in the game and it was my mistake that I didn't put ""do not disturb"" status. So I dedicate a few more seconds to send him a message ""don't call"", after which he replied ""I am not calling"".... and after 5 seconds - he calls again. Now after that I admit I lost my shit and I wrote him ""go fuck yourself"". He wrote ""don't whine"" after that, to which I replied something along the lines of ""fuck off"" (can't really translate the word from our language). Few minutes later he says that that reaction was way out of the line for ""just a game"" and he no longer wants to talk to me. 

I understand I overreacted, but I apologized to him and told him I was frustrated, but he doesn't want to respond.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Friend called me and after I told him not to call, he called me again which ruined my game. Told him to fuck himself, later I apologized but he refuses to talk to me.

c05ffe	2019-06-13 12:51:02	foolsdayeveryday	AITA for not wanting my dog to be blind?	"I have a dog I rescued from a kill shelter in Kentucky while I lived in the northern Midwest. I got him when he was about a year and honestly the love I have for this dog is unreal. However, he absolutely hates anyone new as a result from being heavily abused before I got him. He will attack anyone that comes into my house or, if we’re at my moms house, hers if they’re not walking in with me. He already has a strike for attacking one of my sisters friends. My dog has massive amounts of anxiety and freaks out if someone walks up from behind him and he doesn’t know. Overall, I got him as a comfort pet but have become his comfort human. Sometimes even if I’m home he’ll still go after people, I understand this is him protecting his territory but again someone has needed to get stitches before. 
My dog also suffers from glaucoma, which was discovered about a year and a half ago when taken to a vet for extreme eye rubbing and lethargic behavior. My dog was about four at the time so when I expressed I was worried about it being glaucoma due to research, a tech told me there was no way due to his age. The vet came in and told me he did  have glaucoma and its a super rare type she hadn’t seen in fifteen years. His iris was growing around the glaucoma due to him having it for so long. My boyfriend at the time and I made the decision to get a surgery, about 1000 dollars, to remove the eye due to it causing my dog to be in extreme pain. The doctor warned me to be aware that his other eye will soon suffer a similar fate.
A little more back story now: that boyfriend and I had gotten my dog together when he was one and have since broken up as of a year ago, and my dog just turned six. I try to let him see the dog and if I’m going away for a weekend or week he’ll most likely watch him for me. My ex and I were together for about five years or so and we NEVER had the conversation on what we’d do if we had to remove the other eye. 
Now my dog is showing obvious signs of discomfort and it has made him slightly more aggressive.
I decided to discuss this with my ex since he obviously still loves and cares about my dog. My mom and I had decided that we’d put my dog down if he needed the surgery because he would have a lower quality life being blind due to his aggressive behavior and extreme anxiety. My ex however is upset because he believes any dog can live a happy life completely blind. Whenever I kept saying but do you believe Olympus, my dog, would genuinely be happy he just kept saying tons of dogs live happy lives completely blind.  Side note; he won’t pay for the surgery which makes sense because the dog isn’t his anymore.
I don’t have the money to do a 1000 dollar surgery and if that doesn’t work out put my dog down. My dog is also a bit older now because he is a large breed and is age is starting to show a bit.
Am I the asshole if I put my dog down because I don’t believe he’d have a better life blind due to his anxiety?

Edit: I have done a lot of training with my dog. Such as enlisting my dog in a program called A Sound Beginning when he was younger. Through the years we have tried to socialize him more with other dogs and people. My dog absolutely hates my ex’s dad, and we lived with him for about two years, and all his dad would do was give the dog meat and try to be friendly but nothing changed. We have done numerous exercises recommended by behaviorist.

Also I have gone to the vet and they said it is ultimately up to me to make the decision. They said they’re more than happy doing the surgery, but also due to his aggression understand putting him down."	Not the A-hole	0	0	12.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

I always shower at night, she showers in the morning. I asked her last night if she would start showering at night so that she doesn’t bring the city into bed with her each night, and she got very upset. Said that it felt controlling and that I was asking her to change her entire routine, and that it was her body that I was asking to make a change to.

I gave her the example of “if I rolled around in mud, would you let me in the bed?” and while that’s of course an extreme version, I think it sums up that we all come home way grosser than we think, especially due to where we live and her job, and I don’t think showering off real quick before bed is a huge sacrifice to ask for.

We've both tried our best to avoid spoilers, unfortunately I've been luckier in that regard. She was spoiled the ending and a few other things along the way. Here's where the problems started. She didn't literally share the spoilers with me, but she stated that she lost ALL excitement for the show, and that the last season wasn't nice for her anymore. I got sad that she would share that with me, as we were still planning to watch all of it together. I told her she shouldn't have shared that she lost all excitement, because it would clearly ruin my excitement for watching the show with her. 

She got upset and didn't get why I reacted the way I did, and she felt like she wasn't allowed to share her feelings with me. We ended up having this big fight over nothing and concluded that we wouldn't watch it together anymore, in a rather aggressive way.

c05bsj	2019-06-13 12:40:43	zsszddeccf	AITA for going back on my offer to give a friend money	"Hi guys. 

Backstory-

I’m 25 and married to my 31 year old husband. We’ve been married about a year. Together much longer.

He has a friend who is around 30 who also became my friend due to how much we’d all meet up.

About a month ago, this friend started claiming he was in debt to a credit card agency aswell as his landlord. He would also make claims that he had no food to eat at his apartment. This worked once with me. I truly believed he needed food and I ordered him a takeaway, only to see the next day on Facebook that he was drinking with some buddies. This should’ve been the end of our friendship, but when approached about it he claimed it was his buddies that had bought him drinks all night. I couldn’t really dispute this. 

2 weeks ago, he came to our house crying and claiming he was going to be evicted from his apartment soon and that the credit card company were chasing him. My husband and I, being the kind people we are, offered to lend him $1,000 to sort himself out. 
He near enough instantly stopped crying.
He said $1,000 wasn’t enough, and he’d need ‘more like $12,000 to clear it all.’ Of course this was a ridiculous figure, and we said we’d offer him 1k.

Before this money could be transferred, thankfully. We got a call from our doctor to say that my husbands test results had come back saying he was infertile. We’ve been trying to start a family for 2 years. The doctor told us we’d need to proceed to IVF.
We were prepared that this may happen, and have saved money just in case it did.

We discussed it together and decided we would no longer be giving the friend any money at all. We need all the additional money we can get now to start our family. Plus, when my husband and the friend sat down and talked things through about friends finances, my husband discovered friend is only $500 in debt to a credit card company and $150 to his landlord. He had been lying to swindle more money than what he needed and he didn’t think my husband would catch him out. My husband is a very clever man when it comes to finances and realised right away that this guy wasn’t in as extreme debt as he had made out. Not only this, this ‘friend’ is still regularly going out drinking (whilst claiming to me that he’s starving and has no food) and in recent days had had three HUGE new tattoos that would’ve costed a pretty penny. Upon being asked how he afforded these tattoos, he again lied (we assume) and told us his friend was a tattoo artist so he got them free. 

It was unfortunately me that had to tell the guy yesterday we’d no longer be giving him money. He has made out we’re total and utter assholes. He said we should’ve never promised to give him money if we weren’t going to do it and we should’ve just told him from day one we weren’t giving him money so he could’ve ‘sorted something else out’ whatever that means.
It’s safe to say, our friendship with him is now officially over because he’s clearly a liar.

c059ib	2019-06-13 12:34:30	machocereals	AITA for telling an abused girl not everything's about her?	"I (16F) have a friend Grace (16F) who's very emotionally and mentally sensitive, she was abused as a child (which she told me when i was 11 in very extreme detail when we were swimming in a pool) and lives in a very controlling Patriarchal household, Due to that she's got a fear of failure and hates confrontation of any kind. Even if its just me and other friend arguing about if you should bake mac & Cheese  she'll tell us to stop fighting and start getting sensitive even though it was clearly just a joke. 

The problem is that with my friends when we do a test she would start crying or freaking out after that she's failed it and all 3 of us would come to her aid and help her out saying it doesn't matter even though we've all sat the same test and are feeling the same thing she has. Then we get the results and shes got an A, were im sitting with a C and the other two haven't even passed.

This happened quite a few times already when she started crying after an exam and I genuinely couldn't cater to her emotional needs as i was sitting there thinking i messed up really bad. I just didn't say anything and tried to just eat my lunch and ignore her but she kept going about how if she fails it'll ruin her life  and it just got to me and I just snapped at her telling her to get a grip on herself and her fear of failure and that everyone else is going through shit themselves and not everything is about her. I stood up and left and a few of my friends said i shouldn't have confronted her like that and i was an asshole but i didnt know how else i was meant to say anything because everytime i have a serious conversation about her emotional dependance on me with her she says she doesn't have anyone else and its always just a onesided conversation and i feel really terrible and just let it go midway. 

I talked to my mum( a nurse) about her multiple times and she suggested talking about therapy with her but every time i mention it she shoots it down and Im so tired of dealing with all of this emotional draining things especially when she's said some really insensitive things about me and my situation with my dad.

So am I the Asshole? I know i probably should have handled it better but idk what else i was meant to do :/


Update- I just want to make it very clear that her abuser is not in her life anymore, her dad is very controlling and strict but he has not abused her. Her mum and Dad don't care about her grades and her Dad doesn't bother going to her Parents meetings. I realise i never should've let it go this far my family is going on holiday for the whole Summer so im just going to put my phone away and enjoy it. Im planning on sitting down with both my parents and telling them everything thats going on and they can deal with it. Im been kinda avoiding her and I'm probably going to still do that till I've come back from holiday in a month I still want to keep being friends with her but for now Im giving her space and setting new boundaries when i come back. Thank you to everyone for letting me see this from a new perspective,I've realised this goes a whole lot deeper than me and my outbursts."	No A-holes here	0	0	24.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
c0595z	2019-06-13 12:33:32		WIBTA For asking a girl to stop laughing like a horde of Dothraki war criers?	"I'm currently having cake with my colleagues in the communal kitchen. Our work space is broken up into several groups, with ours being about 15 people, another group on our floor being similar in size and two groups which total 20. We all share a small kitchen (that echoes badly) with space for about 25 to 30 people, and we all tend to each lunch with our respective groups. 

We always end up having lunch at the same time as the other 15 member group, and generally it's fine. For years they've always been a little loud, but rarely that bad and we've never minded. A new girl started there last September, and to put it plainly, she laughs like the sound of a dozen of seagulls being strangled simultaneously. But in addition to that, she fucking scream laughs. I mean you can actually hear her when you're about 50 meters away from the kitchen, around a corner with two doors closed between you and her.

It so frequent and so often, that every day we have to stop talking at our table, wait for her to finish dying and resume our conversation because you literally cannot hear someone speaking a meter away from you. I am in no way exaggerating. Sometimes it's so constant we've left the kitchen to eat at our desks (which we aren't supposed to because we work in a lab).

For a joke we downloaded 'noise measuring apps' on our phones one day, and one said she is as loud as light city traffic, and another said that the volume was likely to cause minor hearing damage. I shit you not.

So just a moment ago, our boss actually turned to stare at her for a second, then looked back at us and said 'is it just me or is anyone else's eardrums ready to burst?' We all cracked up laughing, because while we are all in our twenties and make jokes like that all the time, he's in his fifties, rarely joins us in the kitchen and *never* passes remarks about anybody. We've seen several other supervisors stare at her when she does it in the past - it is definitely not just our perception. 

It's literally painful. I'm normally sensitive enough to noise, but everyone in our group is sick of it so I know it's not just me. A couple of my colleagues just don't eat lunch in the kitchen at all anymore, or time it so she isn't there. But unfortunately their whole group take several coffee breaks a day, every 1.5h, so it's hit and miss whether or not you can avoid her. Would I be an asshole for *politely* informing her that she is effectively shrieking like the sound of 1000 angry harpies? I would obviously be more tactful about it and do my best to not make her self conscious about how she laughed, but I feel it is necessary to talk to her about the volume. She's so obnoxiously loud, I'd rather a 5 hour bus journey where everyone watches videos on their phones on full volume without headphones."	Not enough info	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My s/o and I share an audible account and you get 1 free book credit a month. I have about 5 books on there total and was able to return 2 of them for additional credits. I found 2 rather short books that I wanted to listen to but I needed an additional credit to get the last book I wanted that should last me the whole trip.

My s/o has about 16 books on the account, and I saw there was a book she had finished 7 months ago and she isn’t one to read a book more than once. So I returned it to get a credit to get my last book. Note that my other books were over 365 days and I could not just return them. It’s also worth noting that she was at work during this time and I did think about texting her but she doesn’t like it when I text her at work.

Fast forward, she calls me when she gets off work. We chit chat for a bit then I tell her, “hey I returned “book x” for a credit, I needed another credit to get a book I wanted for our trip. If you wanted to keep that book you can exchange another one and get that one back or you can wait until after vacation and I’ll return one that I read.”

She became furious and now refuses to talk to me until I apologize for “stealing her book” without permission.

I tried to explain that we don’t actually own the book but we have this credit system allows us to trade and that if she wanted the book back all she had to do was ask so I didn’t think it was a big deal.

She told me she has 0 intention of listening to that book again, but it was a manner of principle. 

She said that it was very rude of me and she’s still furious about it.

"girl from the car/window open saga and everything has gotten worse. my mom and i have never had a great relationship but this is too much. she shut off my phone service, went into my room when i wasn’t there and is currently keeping my laptop hostage (remember i’m a sophomore in COLLEGE), refuses to let me drive(even to the job that she made me get) and yesterday i didn’t have any way to get to work and she made me beg to use her car. this morning she threw me to to the ground to *inspect* my room. she said can i come in, i said no(because i didn’t have clothes on and we have been not getting along so i just wanted her to go to work so i could sleep) so her immediate response was to be physical. it’s doesn’t seem like much but this has been going on since i was little and i’m old enough to know that this isn’t right. 

my moms wedding is next week and when we were on better terms she asked me to be a bridesmaid (she doesn’t have any friends). I HAVENT SAID ANYTHING YET but i don’t feel comfortable doing that anymore with the way she’s been treating me  especially in the last month or so; complete disrespect for my feelings and constantly belittling everything i do. my stepdad always takes her side(she never explains that there’s a reason we don’t get along and that she beat me mercilessly until i was 16 so obviously there’s some hard feelings) and is generally very condescending towards me.

so WIBTA if i didn’t go or recused myself from being a bridesmaid? i don’t have anything positive to say about her rn but she deserves to have a happy day, i just can’t act like everything is fine and congratulate her when she has been making my life miserable for 18 years"	Not the A-hole	0	0	10.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c0522i	2019-06-13 12:13:05	thestonehealer14	WIBTA if I refused to take a picture with my dad on Father’s Day?	"So my father said “peace out” when he found out my mother was pregnant with me. So much that so that he actually left the country to get as far away from responsibility as possible. My mom raised me and while she has some major issues and we don’t see eye to eye most days, she’s the only parent I know. 

My father didn’t bother reaching out to me till I was 13, when we communicated via texts and phone calls for all of 2-3 months before he ghosted me. He disappeared yet again from my life and didn’t show up again until I was 18. (No, he has never paid an ounce of child support.) I became independent very quickly and learned that the only person I could rely on to take care of me was ME. I’m now 26. 

The relationship my dad & I built is superficial at best- the guy doesn’t even remember my birthday every year and never calls me. He did have 2 more small children with his current wife & I can’t deny that he is a good father to them. And while a small part of me resents that he never tried to do that for me, I really love his kids and that keeps me around. Anyway- I was suckered into flying in (they live in another state) for this weekend under the pretense that I would be attending an event with my little sister. I had NO idea this was Father’s Day weekend until my step-mom mentioned it a few days ago, along with the little piece of information that we’re going to a brunch to celebrate my dad. 

Here’s the thing: my fathers a boastful man and only remembers he had me when someone sees how accomplished or attractive I am. That’s when he’s all “oh yeah (pounds chest*), I do make some pretty amazing kids, huh?” No- he didn’t. He’s got nothing to do with the woman I am today and he deserves zero credit for it. Because I know how much he likes to show off in front of people, I personally just don’t feel like actively participating in Father’s Day brunch. Sure, I’ll show up because my bf & I are in town and staying in their home- but I will NOT smile for a picture just so he can upload it to FB and have his friends comment what a stellar kid he’s got. I fucking refuse. I’ve NEVER celebrated Father’s Day & I’m not about to start now. Yes, I know it’s petty but I feel strongly about it. AITA here?

Edit: a couple of people in my personal life told me I should try to be agreeable and avoid a scene/making anyone feel bad, and that I should think about how the little kids will perceive my aversion to taking the pictures- hence why I’m asking here.

UPDATE: I wanted to post an update- I spoke to my stepmom and explained how I felt about the situation and that I could not force myself to fake something I didn’t feel. I told her he wasn’t a father to me and if I had no celebrated this holiday in my 26 years of existence I wasn’t about to start now. She actually saw my perspective and understood and told me I didn’t have to come along on Sunday. Thank you everyone for your advice!"	Not the A-hole	0	0	149.0	30.0	0.0	0.0

c04zzz	2019-06-13 12:07:10	DrLilyPaddy	WIBTA if I left a note for my neighbors	"So, I live in an apartment on the second floor, and one of our first floor neighbours, Maria keeps getting packages (she probably likes to order online, which is okay). Problem is, Maria, and her flatmates, are rarely ever home, so the postmen and couriers keep ringing our bells, because they're never at home, and the third flat in our building never answers the bell, even if they're home. Since my room is closest to the door, the doorbells make an extremely loud (and the landlord won't let us change it) noise here, and since my flatmates all live further from the front door, I am usually the one who answers the bell, too. See, I wouldn't mind if this was an occasional case, that's normal, but this happens literally all the time.

I am a full-time student, and I am often awoken by people bringing her packages at 8am, even in exam season, when I tend to go to sleep late. But overall, I am just sick and tired of running down 2 sets of stairs to get her packages about 5-10 times a week.

I thought about writing her a note about it, saying something like 'Dear Maria, As I am constantly bothered by postmen and couriers bringing you packages, I would kindly ask you to make sure they stop ringing our bells when you aren't home.'.
(Most sites in the UK have an option for you to leave a note for the couriers, so the only thing she would have to do is type 'please don't ring my neighbours bells' to that box when she orders something. It's easily manageable.)

I told this to my flatmate, and he asked me repeatedly whether I want to write the note, because he thinks it's not a big deal and I'd just start conflict. So would I be the asshole if I left her a note?


EDIT: Many of you suggested putting up a note onto the main door, might do that, howeverfor that I need permission form both of my flatmates, as I'd put our flat number on it (we don't have names out, just buttons with numbers), might try doing that, though.

c04wig	2019-06-13 11:57:12	PhoenixCheg	AITA For Cussing Out and Cutting Off My Best Friend For Choosing His Friend Group Over Me?	For a while I had a set of friends. 4 of them were just friends and the 5th was my best friend of 7 years. We played a lot of video games together and would hang out everyday after class during middle school. High school comes around and we all head our separate ways, Best friend(Who we’ll just call N for now) was now homeschooling while I went to a charter. Anyways, they all played games on PC and I played on console. So N was starting to get along with the other 4 way more often due to the fact they had the same tech. And after a while the 4 began to harass me and make fun of me for stupid reasons. Calling me things like “Libtard” (I’m not even liberal) “Weeb Trash” “Retard” and anything else they could come up with. But one day they pushed too far. They had created an Instagram profile made solely to harass myself and my SO(Long distance relationship, also another reason they made fun of me) posting pictures of my SOs face crossed out and a photoshop of an anime character in frame instead. Pretending to be a fan account at which point they would make posts about how they wanted to sleep with me, things like that. I. Broke. Down. Luckily they were busted. I was livid. After they were busted they apologized to me and did whatever they could to make it up to me. But I knew it was just to save their skins from their parents. We’re still in high school. I decided to end my “friendships” with those 4 but I kept N cause he had nothing to do with it. I asked him later if he could cut ties to them. He refused saying he was too close to some of them to let go. During this time N had taken a break from his favorite game. But basically I was extremely upset. I didn’t lash out but I did say that I honestly wasn’t okay with it and said that they ruthlessly fucked with me and hurt me. He said he understood but didn’t change his mind. Saying I would just have to leave at that point. After a while of thinking it over I approached him again and said I was fine with hanging out with all of them again as long as I was included and not left as the outcast. He agreed and I asked him to message me and invite me the next time he got back into his favorite game, which he also agreed to do. A day passes so I check if he’s online. He was, and guess what? He was playing his favorite game with the other 4. Excluding me. I snapped and lost it. Telling him he’s a backstabbing piece of trash and a horrible friend. At which point I cut him off almost immediately without even giving him a chance to respond. Was I right to make that decision and say what I said? Or AITA?	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

I just don’t understand why someone her age should be playing a game designed for kids. On a side note, her playing has ruined the game entirely for me because, trust me, when you engage in a raid battle with YOUR MOM of all people, you realize how much this game is NOT for middle-aged people. Now, from time to time, she complains about there not being any shiny Pokémon in the wild, which I take offense to because as an avid player of the original games, I know how hard it is to get a shiny Pokémon; however, Go players get all these stupid community events where everyone can get a shiny Pokémon, eliminating the challenge the original games had where you never really knew if a Pokémon you encountered was shiny until you knew. Anyways, AITA? Please let me know, I’m just trying to help my mom put away this child’s game.	Asshole	0	0	189.0	32.0	0.0	0.0

"Hello AITA peeps , as I describe shortly in the title I have a father who I haven't seen in quite some time and even when I did he would make a poor excuse of a father but i would bear with it. ( But he was a major alcoholic and a trully shitty person in general)
To not get into too much details over this as it gets far to tangled to say the least my father scammed me a big amount of money which were meant for when I would turn 18yo and i am 20 at the present moment.
I realized as I was pondering about that that based on court my father had to pay child support for all the years i would be underage but he never did and i have a lasting grudge which I am thinking its about due time to clear.
I don't intent to keep the money , not by a long shot should I get anything from the charges , I only intend to help my sister not go through the 3 years I am working my ass cause I was poor to begin with and to my mother , I am fine with my salary as my own personal money.

Tl;Dr : My father never paid child support scammed me money and i want to file charges against him to get what should had been mine.
So then WIBTA should I press charges against him AITA people? 

Feel free to ask info and not a throwaway cause we all have our piece of issues and I'm with okay sharing them (Although i dont know his present location).

Edit 1 : a redditor informed me that the proper term is child support , so to clarify the post , i was indeed talking about  a child support not an alimony since im a legitimate child but my parents weren't married to divorce."	Not the A-hole	0	0	14.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

About eight years ago I was sharing a house with 3 other friends whom I knew prior to moving in. All 3 of my house mates B, D and S worked in a bar together whilst I worked in a retail store.

B didn't really see the value in spending money on trivial things like food, his money predominantly went on the essentials; clothing, alcohol and paying into clubs. Because of this I'd often wake up to find my eggs eaten or get home to find out that I didn't have that chicken I thought I'd eat for dinner. When pressed on this B would generally admit to having to steal the food but his replacements were *always* cheaper versions of what he had taken.

On top of food going missing so did my grooming products. The 3 of them would often work 'the keg shift' which meant getting up super early in the morning and every time this happened I'd wake up to B in my room and spraying like 8 sprays of my aftershave, using my deodorant and using my hair gel. I was usually half asleep so that I wouldn't really protest then and there but these were the only times that I was in my bedroom to see him. I never used much hair gel, at all. But I'd often see massive two finger scoops taken out and he liked his hair GELLED.

I had told B that it annoyed me and to stop doing it but it just never seemed to get through for long. We had an argument about it and I told him not to touch my stuff because I never touch his and he agreed not to anymore but I didn't exactly believe him.

I was still pretty annoyed from the argument a few days later and again some food had gone missing and so a night before a keg shift I placed a squirt of Nair in the gel.

The next morning I woke up to B who had crept into room and was using my aftershave and then proceeding to gel his hair with my new product. He left and after I heard him go down stairs I shouted down to him explaining his new reality to him and that he better was his hair quick if he wanted to keep his usual style. This resulted in him absolutely bounding up the stairs and running his head under the shower whilst shouting obscenities at me as small tufts of hair were coming out in his hands. I think the bottle said like keep it on for 4-5 minutes and this was 2 at most so it didn't exactly decimate his hair but it did get thinned out a bit and he couldn't really stick it up the same way as the nairgel had kinda cut some of the hairs in half. He basically had to go get it cut really short to make himself look like a normal person again.

Making someone's hair full out does seem like a bit of an assholey thing to do. But my argument has always been that A. I told him not to use my stuff, B. It was my stuff to Nair.

Him and most of our mutual friends are sure that I was in the wrong here as sharing products is what people do. It'd be good to get perspective."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1909.0	44.0	0.0	0.0

At this point she gets angry and says that I should have just told her that I will not hold her spot.

Every time I'm getting ready for school they ask me for food/drinks while they sit on the couch. They're older (60-70s) and don't know how to get it themselves, which I understand. They also come from a third world country and they don't have a lot of luxuries back home that we give them here in Canada. When I ask my mom why they're here she says it's so they'll have a better life, and I feel like an asshole. 

 My parents and brother work full-time jobs, and I have a part-time job. Any free time I might have to myself I have to cut to accomodate them. 

 I told my mom (while angry crying) things like: ""Either they leave or I will,"" Send them back,"" ""They're not our family."" 

 What set me off was walking into our main bathroom to find the walls and toilet seat smothered with poo. I've had to clean up after them before but I can't blame them, they're older people. My anger is that, these two have a son back home - and they have lived with him for all their lives. Why do they need to live with my family now? 

 These parents are also very loud, just sit on the couch asking me to bring them food and drinks and then I wash their dishes/clean up after them. My dad tells me he doesn't want them here, but my mom always wins these battles. They both feel sorry for them, but we have so far had the aunt in our house for two years, and now her husband is here.

One time, I asked her about it and her response was ""oh, it's harder for girls to take pictures and make them look good, we need to angle it better"" and that really got to me so we basically argued about it. (stupid, I know.)

I urged her to remove the video, which she eventually did. We stopped working together for a bit, but got back together later on.
However, it feels like now that she ‘has’ this song she doesn’t want to work together anymore. I am now focusing more on my own music and I really want to use this song as it is one of the best songs I wrote. I feel like the way the song is right now doesn’t go with where I am musically. The other day I came up with a nice progression on the guitar and want to use it for this song. I am torn whether or not to use it as she has played the song live at her school a few times, without me but I did give permission back then as long as she didn’t take full credit. But on the other hand, I wrote the lyrics completely on my own and I don’t think we’ll ever release the song together.

Tl;dr
I wrote lyrics for a song, worked together with a friend to finish the song. She used it for a competition without telling me. We don’t really work together anymore and I’d like to rewrite the music to fit my current style."	Not the A-hole	0	0	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c04im7	2019-06-13 11:14:57	Unitarded_antivax	AITA for not letting my mother see my children anymore.	"I have always had a complicated relationship with my mother, but since my children are here we have mended relationship. She loves my children aged now aged 7, 4, and 5 months, and loves it when the older two visit her as she lives across the country it isn't easy to get them there as often as she wants. The Netherlands may be small but it is still a two hour drive.

The problem however is that whenever they spend a night at her house they will always come back with expensive gifts, gifts that are in the birthday / christmas price range of 100+ euro's. 

We have told her to stop giving such expensive gifts. She told us she would stop and the next time they spent the night they came back with a game for my nintendo switch. They can use the switch when they want but have a limit of 1 hour a day. 

We again told her that it was too expensive and that she should tone it down more. She got angry and told us that if she can't treat her grandchildren she wouldn't want to have them over anymore. 

We broke the news to our children and they were understandably upset. 

Fast forward 15 months. We have had multiple phone calls, text messages and even letters from multiple of my family members calling us every name in the book. We hadn't told her about the newborn or even our pregnancy as we didn't want her to come over. My brother had told her and she got angry.  When she was at the door we asked her what she was talking about and send her away (at this point our newborn was already born) 

We decided to tell her we did have a baby and that we were still angry at her. But we would try to have her in our lives again. It went well for a month and our children asked her if they could spend the night again. She asked us, and we told her they could if she wouldn't buy them expensive gifts.

The next day they asked if they could spend another night. As we had our hands full with the newborn we said yes. When we went to pick them up from her house. They both had a nintendo switch in a box with 3 games each. We loaded them in the car and drove off without saying anything to my mom.

At home we decided to let them keep their switches with the same rules as for my switch, but that for their birthday they can't ask for anything expensive, a game for their switch at the most. We also had to explain that a nintendo switch is really expensive. The oldest told me that the bill was over 1000 euro's, so I think he understood.

I also called my mom to tell her she was out of control, she replied with:

I wanted to treat them as I hadn't seen them for over a year. You don't give them what they want so I have to.

I told her that the children can't go to her house anymore, and that if she is allowed to come to ours she cannot bring anything.

AITA for not letting my mother see my children anymore?

EDIT: something I should add. The oldest child is starting to get entitled whenever we buy him something. His last birthday we got him a game for his birthday, we got it second had. When he opened the gift he immediatly told us that grandma could have bought it new instead of second hand

Edit 2: something a lot of people don't read or don't read well. Is that she can still see my children. She just cannot have them spend the night there anymore. She can come over to my house if she doesn't bring expensive gifts"	Not the A-hole	0	0	2.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

As I was reversing into a parking spot, simultaneously a car which already appeared parked in the spot behind me was attempting to slowly pull forward into the same spot I was reversing into.

As she was honking I basically said oh well and just kept backing up. To be clear She was already parked in the spot behind me, she just wanted to pull up through the spot I was reversing into. She proceeded to call me unsafe and reckless for backing in and said it was quite obvious she was pulling through to that spot...As she’s screaming and cursing at me while I’m getting out with my 2 yr old son I was just straight up baffled. I try not to engage with angry drivers, but I don’t like to be bullied especially not while my kid is with me. I asked her to please calm down (which probably made things worse LOL) She just kept telling me how she got it all on camera...and asked how can I drive so reckless with a child in the car. Keep in mind I was backing into a parking spot with a 4 door extended bed truck, crawling basically at a snails pace. So I asked what she thinks I did wrong and what she will do with this supposed camera footage and without further clarification she said she will take it to the police. I didn’t really get a chance to talk it out with her any further, I might have even apologized even though I don’t think I did anything wrong, but she proceeded to storm off while screaming obscenities. There were plenty of other parking spots, and if I realized sooner what she was trying to do maybe I would have felt bad enough to let her, but it was the way she reacted to it all made my fuck it switch flick on and I decided on taking the spot.

Fr - do you wanna fucking answer?

Fr - fuck off

M - what?, it a video about his tour, he looks funy ill check him out tho

Fr -  i find it funny that after 2.5 years of friendship you start to have feelings for me but because i dont have feelings for you you stop talking to me

M - what do you mean?, i've had a test this week and i didn't have time to talk because i was studing

Fr - that's bullshit, like you never had a test this year, but i guess because you know you aren't gonna sleep with me you dont want to talk to me anymore

I’m 20, turning 21 in a few months and I’ve always had issues with my family, particularly with my Mother and my older brother (11 months seperate us). My mum is somewhat of a narcissistic person; she’s so good at making you feel bad that I guarantee she could make you cry for something that wasn’t even your fault to begin with. 

I work a well paying job, it pays significantly high and I’m normally paying my bills and other things, but ever since I got the job, my Mum and my brother have always been asking me for money. Every fortnight like clock work, 5 minutes before payroll drops my earnings into my account I get the regular “can you give me some money?” text. Whenever my brother calls my Mum for money her immediate response is “ask your sister.” 

Now don’t get me wrong, I want to help, I do. My brother has two children and lives with his girlfriend, but the thing is, he earns more, if not TWICE as much as I earn, but his money always dissipates almost instantly. 
The money they ask for has started to get bigger and bigger each time they ask. It used to be $20 here and there, but now it’s upwards of $250-$300 a fortnight and it’s not like they DON’T give it back, they do, except it’s in other forms of payment, just not always money. 
When I refuse, and tell them I don’t want to give them money, they either beg to the point of me just giving it to them to shut them up, or they tell me I’m selfish and horrible and that I am such a terrible person for not wanting to help them and my Mum will go to extremes and start telling me that she’s sorry for being “such a useless bother” and that I should “forget about it, she doesn’t matter to me”. 

I want to cut them completely out of my life for other reasons that aren’t solely money based, but I just don’t know if it’s well deserved.

c04fdk	2019-06-13 11:05:21	Diabolicus666	AITA for reminding my collegues to make new coffee?	"I work at a small architect office with a dozen employees, one boss and his wife who does some administrative paperwork. Most valuable coworker: Mr. Coffee Machine. Yesterday, the boss' wife threw a tantrum because yet again someone had emptied the last drop of coffee without putting on a new pot. Boss called everyone together for an office-wide emergency meeting. Under threat of future caffeine deprivation (boss pays for coffee supplies) we all had to nod our collective heads in shame and promise to never ever treat Mr. Coffee Machine with such disrespect.

Personally, I thought the whole debate blew up hilariously, and I found it hard to not burst out in laughter but remain serious during this telling-off. Judging by the suppressed collective face-palming of my collegues I wasn't the only one. It happens to all of us all the time: You want to grab a cup of coffee, but the pot is empty. No big deal, make a new one, come back 2 minutes later and enjoy your steaming hot coffee. Murphys Law dictates that I usually get a phone call or some other distraction and forget I just made a new coffee, only to find the pot empty 5 minutes later. Such is life, mildly infuriating. In fact, the [first webcam ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot) was invented as a solution to exactly that problem, maybe I should set one up as well. Anyways: I thought it would be a helpful for everyone to put up a reminder in regard to the coffee, so I printed out a sign of Uncle Sam (you know, the famous Uncle Sam 'I want you' WW II draft sign) and dubbed it ""I want you - to make new coffee"" and put it up in the kitchenette.

Now one of my collegues approached me and said the sign was rather provocative and insulting towards our bosses wife - which I genuinely did not intend it to be. AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1001.0	44.0	0.0	0.0

c04d5u	2019-06-13 10:58:55	sarahjayney	AITA - Flatmate vs. Friend vs. Money	"So....me and a girl I knew a little bit previously moved into a two bedroom apartment last year. It’s a one year lease. I am the name on the lease. I moved out a cute, but over priced studio to do this and was happy to at the time. So yay, I’m saving money, have more space and closer to work!   

She just relocated back to the country and had a suitcase, I had all the kitchen stuff, bar a few odds and ends, of which I had to sell off my white goods, having not finished paying for them as the apartment we’ve moved too had these anyway.  I also own the sofa (which is now accidentally bleached/ruined-not my fault), but still fit for sitting on, tv, extra bits of living room furniture and outdoor furniture - it was a big studio! I took the smaller room, with separate bathroom and smaller wardrobe space. I was happy with this. Her en suite is bigger, bedroom bigger and has masses of wardrobe space. She bought a bed and any other furniture to kit it out. We bought a few items for the dining area and shared the cost. We discussed the larger bedroom costing more, it works out too around £20 more per month than what that smaller room would be. I was trying to save money at the time so did make a play for the smaller room.   

We half the bills 50/50, electric and AC together plus the internet bill. Around £50-60 a month each. I do have the parking space, but I use it 50% of the time as the car park is a hassle to get into and parking is plenty outside the building.   

So we pay the rent every three months, for the following three months. I can’t remember what we did in the first cheque, as money was going backwards and forwards and we needed to move. 

The second cheque is due, and I ask for half the amount plus her additional. Then a few weeks later I sent her the bills for the month for her half. She questioned me, thinking she’d already paid it and then I explained the additional was for what we agreed on the beginning, bigger room etc, not the bills.   

Now in this time, she has met a bf, who has stayed at the flat pretty constantly at one point (for 2-3 weeks last month) and likes his AC on and had his clothes washed and neither contributed to the cleaning of the apartment in this time or a lot of the time outside this period! This is a bit more personal, but it did annoy me as I didn’t know if he was there half the time when I was in on my own, and was freezing most nights! 

Anyway....I wouldn’t have asked for anymore money for the bills as they’re fairly low and I feel it’s a bit petty.   

However, now cheque three is due and the matter of payment of the extra money has come around again. I have just justified why I feel the extra money is due, but am I being a petty a-hole for not just letting the extra cash go and we pay the same?   

We’re friends at the end of the day but this is causing me anxiety like you’d not believe and I hate talking about money, but I feel there’s a bit of a principle here too."	Not the A-hole	0	0	21.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

Now when me and my friend started looking for a house (hers is so awful she just lives with her BF the whole time now) I told her I don't mind not heavily drinking in the flat and not doing tonnes of drugs BUT since 13 I have ALWAYS smoked weed I have a couple before bed every day, personally it's just what gets me off to bed and it's something I enjoy.

We moved in together and she ended up saying her boyfriend wouldnt be staying if smelt any weed here. Which I replied saying I don't really care, I'm paying good money for this we originally agreed that it was OK and I'm already bending around a tonne of things (limited friends and drugs) due to her boyfriend already.

c049rm	2019-06-13 10:47:27	omlwhyamilikethis	AITA for getting offended by a joke implying I’m overeasy?	"I was raised in a religious household and have always been very innocent up until last year, when I became very close best friends with this guy and we exchanged sexual texts and I explored my sexual side. He was super sweet with me in the beginning of our friendship. I admit I developed some romantic feelings for him as time went on but knew it would never work out between us due to us wanting different things.

Later on in our friendship, there were times where he would call me a hoe or a slut as a joke and I would be very uncomfortable due to my nonexistent sexual history and since he was the only guy I had been like that with. I would have a sexual moment with him and then he would call me a hoe soon thereafter and I’d have all these feelings of doubt and insecurity. I’ve expressed how I was feeling with him many times and he’d get upset and say I was overreacting and I’m super insecure. My confidence was at an all time low. 

I had a fall out with him because of this earlier this year. I got a boyfriend during that time and he was always very respectful and sweet with me. It was so different with how we interacted compared to my friend. Everything was going good in my life and I felt like I should reconnect with my friend since I felt guilty about how things had ended. He was very weird about my boyfriend when he found out, immediately asking when I’d have sex with my boyfriend and calling me a hoe as a joke whenever I’d mention him. It was very awkward at first but then we started making jokes again and being friendly. My relationship with my boyfriend got complicated since he moved back home for the summer so we ended up breaking up.

So earlier this week, one thing led to another and my friend and I slipped back into flirting and ended up exchanging nudes, which was a very big step for me. So today he asked me how I liked my eggs. I replied over easy and he responded with “yep that’s you.” I was offended and told him that he had hurt my feelings to which he said “sorry didn’t mean to.”

I explain that I was hurt because I had just trusted him with my nudes and he’s making a joke about how I’m over easy. He goes on to say I’m insecure, I’m dramatic, I always do this, I need to stop taking everything so personally, and I need to get over myself. I ask him why he’s getting mad and he says he’s mad that I’m overreacting and he’s sick of it and leaves the conversation. 

I feel so confused at this point and just want to know if I’m the asshole and overreacting about a goddamn egg joke.

Now this particular incident happened about a week ago and I need some insight to help understand if I am wrong. 

My (no longer) best friend of six years is very bad at handling money. She once got $14,000 after a car accident (I will give a little detail later) and she blew straight through it on whatever she wanted. Anytime she gets any money, no matter the amount, she spends it immediately on clothes, getting her nails done, or just buying pointless things. She is very materialistic but she definitely does not have the funds to be. Her mom also gives her whatever money she wants most of the time. She managed to rack up close to $1,000 in credit card debt and her boyfriend paid it off, which means she is now in debt to him. He said that she did not have to pay him back right away, so she continues to borrow money from people and then pay them back from her mom or however else she manages to get money. Keep in mind she has been unemployed since April and she has not made any efforts to get a job since. No one tells her no to anything, so she always ends up getting whatever she wants or however much money she wants. She also had no reason to quit her job. 

So last week she asked me if she could borrow $250 as a birthday gift and she even said she would pay me back with interest. 

The conversation went as follows:

Her: “so are you gonna let me borrow 250?”

Me: “did you ask your boyfriend for it?”

Her: “I know he would say no because I already owe him $700”

Me: “did you ask your mom”

Her: “she wants me to come home and clean the house for it. I would rather get a real job and pay someone back.”

Me: “that’s actually a good deal from your mom, why don’t you do it?”

Her: “I don’t really want to”

I then proceeded to tell her that as her friend I am trying to offer good advice so that she does not accumulate more debt. She told me that “last time she checked, friends help each other”, to which I replied that I was trying to help her. She told me that she would help me if I needed something, but here’s the catch. She wanted the $250 for an Invisalign (just clear braces), but she did not want to wait. I suggested that she wait until she has a job and she did not like that. At the end of the conversation she threw a car accident, that we were in together, in my face and reminded me that I hurt her. I regret that everyday because it ruined my car and it caused my best friend to wear a neck brace for three months, and she knows this, yet she wanted something so bad she threw it in my face. I did not reply because I had no idea what to say and I have not talked to her since. 

So AITA?

I'm subletting a room from my roommate, who has since become my friend.

She's pretty tidy. She wants shoes off in the house, lights off when you leave a room, dishes cleaned within 24 hours, no backpacks or purses on the couch, and half-full smelly trash outisde (when I can't even smell it).

I don't get why she cares about some of these things. But I've happily agreed to and 95% abided by everything she requests. In the past, she's had problems with bugs and mice, and since I've lived here, the infestations have gone away.

I left the country for 10 days. On my way out, I made sure to do a bunch of things she requested and barely made it out the door on time.

That morning, she went into my room (which is fine) and was horrified. My room smelled and I'd accidentally left an empty yogurt container next to my bed. She had some other complaints (which imo are total bullshit) and apparently, it made her anxious all morning.

She sent me a long string of texts. I apologized for the yogurt and the smell (it was pretty dank), I promised not to do it again, and I apologized for stressing her out.

But when I came back, she wanted to talk about it. She was *so* precious and ""concerned"" that I felt like it was okay to do that shit and felt like I didn't ""respect our home.""

And I'm pissed. Why are her cleanliness preferences the default?? I think our culture's standards of cleanliness were largely invented by marketers. I take pride in the fact that I'm not owned by my possessions. What kind of idiot respects a house??? It's an object.

She has no reason to think I'll forget a yogurt again. I recognized that was bad and I've always followed her rules.

It seems like she just wants me to feel like this is As Big A Deal as she feels like it is. And I don't. I think she's overreacting. I think if the existence of a gross room behind a closed door makes you anxious all morning, you're neurotic. 

I'm pissed that she's acting like her preferences are holy writ and mine are a moral failing. I've bent over backwards to accommodate her needs. Why can't she just appreciate that???

I'm actually very pissed, and I'd like to talk to her about it. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

The fact that she chose me to be her Maid of Honor (MOH) was kinda surprising and awkward (she never officially asked me, but simply just had my mom casually tell me that I will be the MOH).  My mom and sister are both very stubborn, and I have lived my life but always just biting my tongue and doing what they say because I always convince myself that it's not worth the fighting. However, I feel that I may be the AH here because it isn't my wedding and should just bite my tongue. 

&#x200B;

At the beginning of the planning process, I tried to help, but I felt like my ideas were being ignored and my mom and sister clearly had ideas of what they wanted anyway. Furthermore, I'm in graduate school in other state most of the year, so I feel that there really isn't much that I can do to help while being away. For her Bachelorette Party in Las Vegas, her best friend (who clearly should have been chosen as the MOH) planned the entire thing, and my sister told me how annoyed she was that her friend had to do all the planning when I'm the MOH (even though I told her that I know nothing about Vegas with clubs or anything to do and said she would make it more fun for her and everyone if her friend planned it). Similarly, I got in an argument with my mom recently about how uninvolved I was in the planning as well, when it kinda makes me think: shouldn't my sister's fíance or actual good friends who know her really well be helping with the planning more than me anyway?

&#x200B;

This all really just confuses me because it seems that I have just been chosen as the MOH because my sister and mom are concerned with what people at the wedding will think, not because I'm her friend. I've known her my whole life, but we really know nothing about each other at all.... So Reddit, AITA??"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c043ur	2019-06-13 10:27:28	gnnathrowitallaway	WIBTA if I ridicule and expose my co-worker's intention to spy on me?	"First of all, I do not want to make this post long. And secondly, I would also like advice on how to handle this.

Me and my co-worker run a small business from the basement of his house. Our work is going good, and it has been 9 months in this office. My work in the office starts early in the morning at 9 am, with my co-worker joining in at 1 pm to work through the evening. This means that I pretty much work in an empty office for a good 4-5 hours. 

Today, while just taking a break from work, I  noticed that there is an old webcam camera set up and pointed at exactly where my desk is.  This camera was hidden inside a pile of boxes, but plugged into a laptop next to it. The camera also seems to be placed in this position for quite some time as it had a little dust collected on top of it. The laptop looks clean and is still active. I have no intention of looking into it, because I'm certain this was set up to spy on me

Now you may ask why would anyone place a camera? Well, your guess is as good as mine. I feel cheated in some sort of way, or that he or someone in his house does not trust me. His mother is very nice to me, and I have had no problems with him whatsoever. I know he doesn't feel I have stolen anything, because he is a very confrontational person and would have just asked if anything was missing.

I am angry. I am disgusted, and If he or his weird family is spying on me then I want everyone in my friend group to know about it. WIBTA if I confront him in front of all my friends?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c043es	2019-06-13 10:26:06		AITA for yelling at my mom with profanity for smoking at the dinner table	"i am a 16 year old girl and i hate smoking. my mom is 36 and she smokes cigarettes everyday. she’s smoked with me in the womb, she smoked around me and my siblings as we grew up, and she and stepdad smoke in the car with me and my siblings. in our house the garage was the place where my mom, stepdad and grandma smoke and all other relatives who visit and smoke too.

&#x200B;

two situations i’ve gotten into because of my moms addiction, i was probably in the 5th grade and my friend next to me smelt my jumper and complained loudly that i smelt of smoke, i was so embarassed and i couldn’t even smell it because i was so adjusted to it. i was probably 7 at the time of this other incident. so i was sitting on my moms lap and drawing at the dinner table. she was smoking, my grandparents were smoking and i pretended to smoke too with my pencil. she was moving her legs up and down which made me fall down and the pencil got stuck in my throat and i was immediately rushed to the hospital. i got surgery and stitches in my throat. the smoking is so bad, sometimes if my cats have been inside all day, i can smell the smoke in their fur when i hug them and bring them close to me.

&#x200B;

it’s winter where i live and it’s extremely cold. and the garage isn’t warm enough for my grandma, so they decided to set up their smoke station at the dining table. they’ve got a basket full of cigarettes and other cigarette things like rolling paper, (i don’t know anything about cigarettes) the ashtrays are set out on the table and the smoking in the dining room has begun. this absolutely angered me and i ended up yelling at her telling her that she can’t be smoking in the dining room because it affects me and my younger siblings, as well as my 4 cats.

&#x200B;

my mom, step dad, grandma and siblings got angry at me and told me that i have no place in yelling at my mom or ordering her around, and told me that i should move out and live with my real dad (scum person) if it was that bad. i’m not a violent or aggressive person, and swearing isn’t in my vocabulary but i started swearing at everyone and began insulting everyone! i called my mom, stepdad and grandma stupid for smoking and stormed off.

&#x200B;

my younger brother thinks i’m a terrible person and that i hurt my moms feelings and should apologize immediately, my step dad is trying to talk to me and discuss how i was so out of line to talk to my mom like that, and my grandma is disgusted with me. but my mom doesn't even want to be in a room with me or see me. i feel bad. 

&#x200B;

tldr; mom, stepdaddy and grandma moved their smoking station to the dinner table and have now ruined my life, the health of me, my siblings and cats...which caused me to overreact and cuss them out (not a very me thing to do.) and now i‘m being called an asshole!!"

c040nh	2019-06-13 10:16:26	dxisyridley	WIBTA if I ditched my childhood friend to hang out with my real friends?	"I’m a teenager and I know we do some pretty lame stuff so I wanted to ask you guys about this.

The school year ends this Friday, and my flight out of the US is on Wednesday, so I have around 4 full days to hang out with my friends, many of whom are leaving for college this year. Long story short, my family’s trying to get our green cards, meaning we have to leave the country for an indefinite amount of time, so these might be my last few days to spend time with my friends before they go to college.

One problem: our family friends who currently live in texas are apparently coming to visit. They used to live in the same country as us because of the dad’s job, their two daughters were the same ages as me and my sister, and they lived across the street from us - so obviously, we were friends, but they moved away before middle school. A few years ago (between middle and high school), she found my skype and started talking to me, which lead me to discover he had some pretty right-wing views (not as in conservative or republican, i have no problem with those, but the things she said were pretty alt-right lite). Eventually she sent me some....... interesting videos. 

Some background: I’m Muslim. My friend knows I’m muslim, hell, the country we used to live in was Muslim-majority.... so I was pretty shocked that she’d send me 3 videos from ex-muslim atheists basically denouncing Islam and telling the viewer why it’s such a “bullshit” religion, and why everyone should ditch it. I asked her why she’d send something like that, she said they were so I could “reconsider”. I know for a fact that her family is NOT islamophobic - her parents are super sweet, if a little strict, and they themselves are an interfaith couple (mum is catholic, dad is jewish I believe). Now, yeah, this was a while ago, but it left a sour taste in my mouth in general and I’m not sure if I’d wanna spend much time with her without her apologizing first.

My mum is fine with me hanging out with my friends granted I take my friend along, especially since she’s apparently a loner at her school and doesn’t have many friends (i think there might be a reason for that, unless she’s done a 180 on all her views). I’m really hesitant to do this because I go to a pretty diverse school, so I have a pretty diverse friend group. I’m scared that if she tags along, she might say some pretty unsavory stuff. There’s also the fact that I just kinda want to spend time.... with my friends, and not just wheeling her around everywhere or trying to integrate a new person to the group dynamic for like the last one or two times we’ll hang out as a big group. 

We live in DC, so it’s not like she won’t have anything to do if I’m not around!

She will wake up or come home from work and be her normal self. Laughing, talking and playing with the kids but the tiniest thing will send her into a tailspin and she'll begin snapping at all three of us. She claims this is post-partum rage.

Recently it's gotten worse because her parents had to move in with us when her father got laid off. They're doing what they can to move out but haven't been very succesful. I think it's been great having them around because they are both very helpful around the house and are willing to babysit. 

However my wife hasn't been able to ""self-medicate"" with weed because her father disapproves. It came to ahead last night when I made mention my sister dropped by our oldest's school for a quick visit. Our son adores his aunt and had a blast ""touring"" her through his pre-k class. 

My wife thinks this was WAY over the line and has caused my family to believe they've done something wrong (my mom suggested my sister visit him). I don't think they have. So this caused a fight between us and I suggested my wife get professional help even suggesting we go together. This sent her into a fury because she believed I was siding with my family over her (I haven't said anything to my family).

Her mother is actually on my side and said to me that she is acting like she was when my wife was a child living with her and believes like me, that she needs therapy.

c03tdv	2019-06-13 09:50:38	DenisTwoToo	AITA for not knowing what she expected from me	"Short background. Me and my GF come from the same country, but met each other in a different country where we currently study and work. We've been living together for the past 5 years and of Course my parents and her mother(father not in picture anymore) come to visit us once in a while. Usualy when they come to visit both our parents come at the same time and stay in our Apartment. Every time they come there is a lot of stress from everybody wanting different Things and just being very different characters.

So last month they came again to visit us. But this time I couldn't take time off from work so my gf was stuck alone with all of them. Five days go by and when I arrive home from work my gf takes me aside and tells me my mother started moving Things around the house telling my gf,  who told her to stop that, that ""when I'm here Things are going to be put where I want'. Also telling my gf that ""I'm cleaning your home because it doesn't look clean at all"", after we cleaned the whole Apartment before they came to visit. So I took that as usual stuff, nothing out of the ordinary, because I was used with our parents just doing what they like and just waited for them to go home and our life to resume as normal. Fast Forward two days and there is a huge fight between my parents and me my GF and her Mother. My parents started the fight, and it was just about us not respecting them and letting them do what they want. The fight ended with my gf and her mother packing their stuff and going to sleep somewhere else for the rest of the visit to get away from my parents.

After they're all gone we go home and my GF sits me down and tells me that she is very dissapointed in me that I didn' say anything to my mother when she told me after those 5 days how she talked to her. And she told me that she doesn't think our relationship can go on much longer because she doesn't want to seem my parents anylonger and even if she forgave them, they will never Change and there were always going to be fights when they visit. I told her that I didn't know I was supposed to tell my mother those Things, because I thought she was also used to my mothers behaviour and was also just waiting so they go back to their homes. We didn't break up on the spot after this conversation, we just said we will see what will happen in the future for the Moment.

Fast Forward two day ago. Was doing some Research at uni and we met at lunch to eat at home because she works very Close to our home. I ask her how's work and she says ""stressfull"", but immediatly continues ""but not as stressfull as remembering you didn't tell your mother all those Things I told you"". And she closed with ""I don't want to be together with someone who doesn't know what he wants from life, a pu\*\*y"". Yeah that hurt.

c03rcz	2019-06-13 09:43:00	AnonsDreams	AITA For Wanting To End An Innocent Online Friendship?	"TL;DR at the bottom.


I used to be pretty active on some fandom website, at some point I got a message from someone, and we started to have a decent conversation. It lasted hours, and we soon became internet friends after it.


He never asked for any details of me. He just wanted someone to talk to, and we shared a lot.


He used to struggle with familial and friend relationships, and has mentioned having some pretty negative thoughts as well. Over time he's told me that he's more positive and is doing better for himself because of me, saying I'm his only friend.


I'm glad he's doing better for himself, but ever since last year, I've found myself growing completely frustrated. He's not a bad guy, certainly not a 'nice guy' or 'neckbeard' either, I know he has good intentions. I just  don't have the will or energy to engage in hours of back and forth messaging anymore. 


My biggest regret is being so naive in the beginning. I had messaged him saying things like ""Where have you been all my life?"" Without  knowing how much weight those words can carry. I grew out of it, but unfortunately he's still holding on to them. He asks me if I could ever see us being closer, or meeting in real life. I let him down easy, though I loathe the idea of that or anything else he suggested (even though it was never anything intimate or sexual). 


Why? Because *every* time I go on Twitter and do virtually *anything* that's interacting with someone else he is *ALWAYS* responding to it. If there isn't already a message in my inbox, within 3-20 minutes, there will be a reply, like, retweet and/or message. *EVERY.* *SINGLE.* *TIME.* On a *DAILY* basis! For over a year! If I don't respond after a few days he starts messaging more frequently asking if I'm okay. 


So even when I do have the time, I avoid using Twitter at all. I'm sick of the constant messaging. I can't keep up with or respond to people I follow anymore because I don't want for him to see it.


The messaging has only continued and has no signs of stopping. I've told him that realistically, I think we'll grow apart someday, and this seemed to only reinforce things. I wish he'd realize that I don't want to have a deep conversation every time I log into my account. I don't have the mental space to encourage someone else to be positive whenever they need it, I am not a therapist! I want to be able to respond and like a post without someone giving me commentary. It's embarrassing when the people I follow notice him. We can be in the middle of replying in a chain before he has to disrupt it.


I hope we grow apart fast or that he'll eventually stop messaging me altogether, or maybe, he'd at least find something else to do with his free time. 


TL;DR - I no longer want to be associated with an online friend of 2-3 years. He has restlessly given me daily messages for months with no sign of slowing down. Despite good intentions I'm sick of a response to *everything* I do.

Edit: I see some responses saying I should talk with him directly about this. I should've mentioned before that I have told him I feel suffocated, and that he shouldn't rely on me for bettering his mental health. We've argued in the past about it, and at one point stopped talking for a while once I found out he was starting a romantic relationship with someone else. I told him I didn't want to infringe on it in anyway, and he got angry about it. He apologized, we made up, though I'm positive he's hoping we'll become closer or that he can possibly start a relationship with me.

I haven't told him eeverything I feel because his past negative thoughts prompted him to hurt himself and consider ending his life.  I've had a *terrible* experience with someone else who threatened those same things to me in the past if I didn't message them (they were blocked). I know now that it was a manipulative tactic, but I'm still terrified of potentially prompting that for him, because then it'd be real.

Edit 2: Not sure if anyone would read this,  but I'd like to say thanks for all the advice and criticism.  I finally had the balls to confront this guy about how I feel and while it was hard to find the right words at first, I'd say things went pretty well. Thanks to everyone that's responded, you guys really helped."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

Last summer, we started planning for a month-long hiking vacation and vaguely agreed on doing it September of this year. In January though, her best friend asked her if she would like to join her on a three week hiking trip to somewhere else, planned for June this year. She agreed. 


Suddenly she was all excited for that other trip and started planning that, and she started working overtime so she could go on both vacations. We barely got to see each other, we basically ate and slept together and that‘s it. Two months ago, she told me that she thinks her boss might not let her go on both vacations, and asked me if we could do our vacation next year. I really hate this. We hadn‘t booked anything yet, but I was really looking forward to this trip. 


She has done big hiking trips with her best friend a few times already, and she says she‘s never had as much fun on vacation with anyone as with her bf. This might be true for her, but we‘ve been on one long hiking trip before also and it was the best vacation I‘ve ever had. It actually makes me mad because her best friend is really bossy and on their last trip my girlfriend kept complaining over the phone about how they were constantly fighting.


It seems like we might only be getting a weekend-long vacation together this year, which I pay for because it was my Christmas gift to her.


I‘ve been thinking of going on vacation without her when she comes home. None of my friends like hiking, so I‘ve been thinking about doing it alone. Would that be asshole-ish?


Just so you don‘t get the wrong impression about her, she‘s not cold-hearted and she does care about me. She actually cries whenever we‘re apart even if it‘s just for a weekend sometimes. I think she just got excited for both trips and realized they both won‘t work in the same year. But I think she should have known that before agreeing on the trip with her bf."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Some of my other friends however didn't like her(when asked why? they were unable to give any specific or valid reasons and one guy was straight up salty because she rejected him albeit very politely and they still kinda talked to each other).

So on the day of the incident i had planned to spend the day with my newly acquired friend and then meet up with my other friends who didn't like her at around 6. The other friends didn't know i was meeting her for lunch though. However after lunch and a few drinks, somehow i got really drunk, even though i hadn't consumed that much alcohol and ended up passing out.

Now my friend was freaking out because she had no idea how to help me and she would maybe get in trouble with her and my folks, keep in mind that i was out cold so she was also scared if i was sick or something. Then she called her other friends and was trying to sober me up, but it wasn't working. 

Then my other friends see this whole fiasco and instead of trying to help me they thought i ditched them for my new friend and thus just weirdly stood a little distance away from my passed out self and my other groups of friends trying to wake me up. Mind u this was all happening in a park.

Then watching them stare from a distance like that, my friend freaked out and sent a guy who was cool with both her and my other friends to ask them to help and if they wouldn't to just go away. This apparently pissed them off so they just left my passed out self there at wnet their own merry way.
 
Later when all this was over and i explained everything to them. They asked my to apologize to them and also demanded that my other friend apologize to them. I obviously didn't however i did apologize to them for making them feel as if i was ignoring them not that i was. My other friend offered to apologize but i didn't let her because i didn't think she did anything wrong.Still now i haven't talked to them in months however my then newly found friend is one of the best friends that i ever made or will make.

Edit: Eventually my friend took me home and then i did go to the ER, sorry should have mentioned it earlier."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	334.0	81.0	0.0	0.0

c03hb1	2019-06-13 09:04:45	tinanottiana	WIBTA if I started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?	"I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'

So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""How do you pronounce that?"" It's Tina!

I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, ""Just for the record, my name is Tina!"" to lighthearted, ""Tina, like Tina Belcher!"" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, ""Thanks Tiana!"" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:

Chuck: Thanks, Tiana

Tina: No problem, Chad!

Jessica: Hi Tiara!

Tina: Good morning, Jennifer!

Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.

EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:

A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.

EDIT #2:

No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or ""Tiara""

No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!

Yes, I correct them every time.

No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Background: My housemates and I all go to the same performing arts school. Both my housemates are in the same course and I’m in a different one. Their course is very practical and requires 14 hour working days for 2 weeks straight every few months. Housemate B has graduated from their course, but still volunteers to do the 2 weeks of 14 hour days to help the crew as well as working 30 hours per week.

Part 1: Today we had a rent inspection. I did 1/3 of the cleaning, housemate A didn’t clean at all, and housemate B cleaned 2/3 of the house and got mad she had to do it all. They’re now mad I didn’t automatically clean the whole house since they’re so busy and I’m home all day. If they has asked me to clean everything instead of assuming I would I would’ve been fine with it, but AITA for only doing 1/3?

Part 2: Before I went to bed I said I’d tidy up before the inspection & before I had an exam, which I did. By the time I got up housemate B had made the place spotless and was angry I hadn’t cleaned to her level of “clean”.  My level of clean is fine but hers is hospital grade.

c03c93	2019-06-13 08:45:47		AITA for not correcting my grandfather's ignorant behavior?	"Let me just start out by saying my grandparents are not racist at all - they make absolutely no attempts to discriminate, hate, or do anything of ill will towards any minorities, in fact, they are very close with a few couples in their retirement complex and my grandfather is even well liked in the community for teaching various skills for free. (Think small woodworking projects, card games, etc.) 

Anyways, I went to visit my grandparents a little while ago, and a few times I heard them (mainly my grandfather) make offhanded ignorant comments, such as saying that native americans they used to know spoke 'mexican' and that the South American caravan (which was a current event at the time) was full of people just looking to enter the country illegally and not contribute to society.

As I was their guest, and also not wanting to start drama for really no reason, as it doesn't really seem to be affecting their life and social relationships, I didn't say anything at the time. However, I have wondered if its worth it in the future to make an attempt to educate them on how to be respectful on the common era.

&#x200B;

I don't think this really makes much dfference, but my grandfather has been having some health issues nowadays, and it is entirely possible that I could start something and leave it unresolved until after hes gone, which I absolutely don't want to do. My grandparents are good people, I think they are just products of their time, and living in a retirement community with only other old people may have created a sort of echo chamber that didn't expose them to modern ways of thinking about race and society.

c039xx	2019-06-13 08:36:21	DropInASea	"AITA for calling strangers out on ""bad"" behaviour?"	"When I (M29) take my dog out for a walk, sometimes I see people. Sometimes I interact with them, especially other dog owners. This kind of interaction has perhaps lowered my inhibitions towards talking to strangers. 
So now, when I see things I disagree with, I speak my mind. 

I will share a few instances; 
* A couple in their late 20's early 30's were standing outside with a baby in a carriage. The man was smoking, and the wind very clearly blowing the smoke over the baby and towards the woman, myself and my dog. 
I turn to them, as I pass them, say in a light tone of voice ""there's nothing I enjoy quite as much as passive smoking"". The lady turns and looks me in the eyes, with a bit of shock and unease but also with a smile. And that's the end of the interaction, I can only hope she thinks of the baby and moves out of the smoke.. 

* I witnessed a lady in her 40's or 50's driving a service car (catering, cleaning company). She was trying to parallel park. The thing is, she had enough room for two full cars, and she was trying to park it level in the middle. So after she tried and failed 3 times, she got out and gauged the range she had, and tried two more times. 
At this point I told her, look, you have a full meter ahead of you, come closer to this other car and there will be enough room for another car behind you. I stood next to the spot where it would be safe for her to drive forward to, pointing and telling her to come closer. 
She got out of the car, angry at me, using weird justifications like ""make room for what car?? I don't see any other car?"".
I tried to explain, but she was foreign (language barrier), and possibly playing stupid or didn't want to understand. We went back and forth a little, keeping it civil, but she kept asking for the other car I was talking about. In the end I got frustrated, and instead of escalating I walked away. She ended up parking in the middle, taking up two spots. 

* A woman with a baby was inside her car on the side of the road. She was rummaging through her car, and spent good time doing it. What bothered me was how she left her baby carriage with her baby in it behind the car. Directly in the vehicles exhaust, and yes the vehicle was on. 
I asked her ""are you sure you want to leave your kid directly in the exhaust like that, you do know it's toxic right?"" 
Her response was ""there is nothing wrong with it, it's not toxic""

So, AITA for talking to adults like that? 
Should I have done more? 
Should I have minded my own business and ignored it? 
What if they were kids, and did something less offensive? At what point is it socially acceptable to jump in and parent some strange kids or adults for that matter? 

Side note: I live in a country where people usually don't talk or acknowledge each other. We are perceived as a cold people from outsiders. Talking to strangers is something you need an excuse for, like being drunk or walking your dogs."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	47.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

Anyway, about a week ago I organised a sleepover over with 3 other friends from school. There was a friend I didn’t invite, Bob who I have been best friends with since we were both 7. I didn’t invite bob because the friends I organised the sleepover with are like a small friend group, we all sit together in home room and group text. Bob isn’t really a part of the group but is friends with 2 of them. Yesterday he found out and ignored me most the day, and tried to guilt me. 

Later in the day after we went home from school, he messaged me saying
“hey sorry I was pissed at you, it wasn’t really right for me to be pissed at you.”
 To which I responded 
“Nah it’s okay, I would do the same too and I’m sorry. It’s just a different group”

Forward to this morning we were in period 1 talking a bit, then he brings up the sleepover, then before you know it he’s telling everyone 
“hey, imagine your best friend didn’t invite you t
o his party” 
Even though it wasn’t a party and there were 3 people coming. He then does this throughout the rest of the lesson, period 2 and the start of break 1. 

I eventually stood up for myself and said 
“oi fuck off cunt, you’re being a little petty bitch over nothing” 
some other not so nice words were exchanged between us, all while our friends were laughing because it was pretty funny. I started walking away, but before I told him that Lebanon is a shit country.

 Last week end, some friends and I went out bar hopping and met up with another one of my friends (I'll call her Alexis). Alexis had her friend (I'll call him Dylan) dd for her. Alexis is a lightweight. She will be drunk out of her mind on half a mixer and a shot, which is what she had that night. I've met Dylan a bunch of times before. He's a good dude, I enjoyed his company. After that night, we all parted ways with me dropping off most of my friends at their houses and Dylan taking Alexis home (which he has done a couple times before). 
      
They stopped at a fast food place which is normal for them to do. While there, Alexis said that wanted to lay down, so Dylan took her to his house. I'm not sure why they went to his house and not hers but I suspect she asked to go to his house because she still lives with her parents and didn't want to come home drunk. She also lives about 30 minutes away and he lives about 10 minutes away. 

They get to his house and she lays down and asks him to cuddle (keep in mind she is still drunk at this point, not as badly as before but still drunk) and she then initiates sex. 

They end up having sex that night. She was drunk and he was perfectly sober. She was not on birth control and he did not have any condoms but they still had sex. 

She told me this the next day and I asked her if she has taken Plan B or anything. She said no and said she didn't think she had to. 

So my question is WIBTA if I confronted Dylan about the danger they put themselves in? And tell him that he took advantage of her?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c03069	2019-06-13 07:57:44	Garjiglio	AITA for kicking my roommates and their friends out of their hang out spot??	"So I want to preface this by saying my roommates (RMs) are very nice and friendly people and also i didnt know them before we were roommates. The source of the problem here is that i have to work week days and I wake up at like 5:30/6. Meaning ideally I go to sleep at 10 at the latest. However they have no responsibilities and are night owls. So you can probably see where this is going.

Our apartment is on the second floor and the front door leads to a balcony that connects to another apartment directly across from us. There is a set of stairs that lead down to the ground halfway between both doors. About a week ago my RMs got very excited about an idea to put furniture on this patio area and have a hang out spot for us and our neighbors to convene. Sounds like a great plan? I thought so. Until the catch:

As soon as you walk out the front door the window to my bedroom is to the left. All the chairs and patio furniture are set up literally 2 feet from my window. (This isn’t an exaggeration if you’re sitting in the chair you can touch my window). So this means when I retire to the bedroom at like 10:00 I can still hear every word, whispered or yelled, of their conversation until they go to bed at around 1am at the earliest. 

The hangout place has become increasingly more popular amongst neighbors and now I normally cant fall asleep until 1/2am. I want to die. All of my pleas for them to move their shit elsewhere have fallen on def ears and according to them it is “out of their control” and “they dont want to ruin it for everyone else”

We moved into new neighborhood .My wife became BFFs with one of the neighbors. That women has a son and he clearly has some   mental problems .He barely can muster more then few words has anger issues and just screams for no reasons. He is about 5 years old. He was held back a year in kindergarten and kicked out from another due to behavior issues and inability to learn anything. We had a get together recently .The kid started breaking my daughters toys ripping books apart and other stuff. I went towards my wife and told that she should tell her friend to get her kid under  control. Next thing I know he took one of those children chairs and started charging towards the tv. I managed  to intercept before he could damage it. Later I found out before he wrecked 3 tv's this way. Once the party was over told my wife that kid is no longer welcome at my home. My daughter has even complained that he is very aggressive sometimes towards her and other people. My wife was a bit more on forgiving side, he is young, he needs some positivity .Yes, he has problems and so on. After the party my wife told be her friend broke down and started crying. I feel like shit but I know her refusal to do anything about the kid getting him diagnosed and medicated is one of the bigger problems here.So am in the wrong here ?

EDIT:Her situation is very dire apparently. Now I feel even more like an asshole. She did try to sort it but due to some legal bullshit and the medication being some sort of controlled substance .She needs an order from the court in order allow her child to be medicated. So its legal fees,lawyer and other expenses. Its to expensive to get him properly medicated.

I'm travelling in Europe with a buddy for 3 months and we've both been posting pictures on instagram to document it. At the end of each trip we pool our pictures together because usually we've both taken pictures of each other with our phones, and we want to have all of them. Fair enough.

On this latest trip to Rome, I took a picture that I thought was really nice. Framing was good, nice lighting, etc. I was planning on posting it on Instagram, but I shared it with my buddy and he posted it on his page first, making it look like he took it. We've posted pictures the other person took before, but only when they have ourselves or both of us in it. This picture had neither of us in it.

We’d known each other a few years but weren’t necessarily friends until this one summer at camp where he ended up hanging out with my friend group, and became one of us. After camp, he asked one of my friends for my number, made up an excuse about wanting some pictures from camp from me, and we started texting everyday. He went to a different school and we’d only be able to see each other about twice a week, but I think everyone knew we were into each other because they repeatedly asked if we were dating, but we weren’t. Just FLIRTING for months.

I’d had a crush on one of his friends before I liked him, and one of my “friends” asked that friend out even though she knew I’d liked him. I suppose back then I wasn’t secure enough in my feelings for this new guy since it had been two months with nothing happening, and confused out of my anger at my friend for asking old crush out that I decided to push new guy away.

New guy and I stay friends since he’s part of my group now, we just don’t text. A few months later he starts dating this girl he’s known since he was a kid. I’d already realized i really did like him before i found out, but didn’t do anything monumental enough for it to change things. 

I’m devastated, but he constantly does and says things that would confuse me. He “accidentally” told me he loved me over text. “Whoops, I’m so used to texting my babe” He would constantly bring up his girlfriend out of context to me and only me and I felt like he tried to make me jealous. He would still be touchy feely with me, and I would play right into it. We cuddled. My friends tried to push us together and they would succeed a lot but he never broke up worth his girlfriend. 

It’s been over two years. I think it’s a little ridiculous if he hasn’t realized that I am in love with him because it’s so obvious and everyone knows. Everyone still thinks he likes me as well, but he’s kind of lazy and likes when things are easy. He has a history with his current girlfriend (known each other since childhood- easy to settle for?), he doesn’t seem like he’s going to break things off bc that would be the hard thing to do.

I think this is silly as having breakfast is really what starts your day, so I’ve said “you make it by yourself then since that’s how you want to start your day”. She got annoyed with me.

I think she’s too obsessed with the bed. She washes the sheets way too much (like once in 1-2 weeks). When we moved in she replaced my pillows saying that they were dirty and outdated. I’ve had them for years but they weren’t really dirty, maybe outdated but I still think that it was a waste of money. But making the bed every morning is really what drives me crazy.

c02sfd	2019-06-13 07:27:45	DontFindMeOnline	WIBTA if I don't live with my dad?	"There will be some backstory for this, quite lengthy too. TLDR at the bottom.

Dad (65M), Mom (55F), Older sis (27f), older brother (25M), me (21f). 

Dad has been a real POS, he wouldn't really work a job, despite having 3 young children. He just hopped from job to job after losing a cushy bank job before I was born. This cycle ended when he lost his last job 7 years ago, lost his visa subsequently, lost income and had our family stuck in limbo. He tried to open his business but wouldn't show up so his partners cut him off. He started falling behind on payments, the 2 younger kids had to be pulled out of school, rent was late, sometimes we would live without electricity, food and necessities weren't bought etc. 

Through the years even before I was born, dad was verbally and almost physically abusive throughout our lives, small things would set him off. The worst of it was directed at my mother who had her hands full trying to run the household and take care of us. He could’ve afforded to give us a better life but he kept testing how much shit he could pull at a workplace before they eventually fired him. He blew whatever money he got over the years on old cars that he wanted to refurbish, all of which were repossessed at some point. He’s the kind of father who’d sleep with his belly full not caring whether anyone else had eaten.  Our mom ended up supporting us and it was tough, our dad has always treated only his immediate family (us) like trash. To the eyes of everyone else he’s a saint who has some hard luck.

Older sister starting working, saving, paying for expenditure etc as soon as she could. We are more stable now. Older brother had finished school but we didn't have money for uni, he finished his degree 8 years later just this year and is currently looking for a job. I finished high school privately, I was pulled out in the 4th grade. I ended up completing my GED and I now work. Dad works freelance for a company handling finance (lol) and recovery, they pay for some of his expenses, rent, electricity, car etc. They don’t give him the money but deposit it directly.

Now between my sister and myself we have an option to move out, my mom is tired of living with his shit and wants to leave him. We don’t think he would agree to this because he is waiting on our brother to get a job as “the man” and live off his salary as he is “owed this” as our father that “raised us” and spent money on us. The option is to keep him in a separate room and to limit contact. I want to give my mom a nice comfortable house, her own space, something my dad can't control.

If we leave him, other than him telling everyone he knows how he is a victim and his family left him I think he will be ok. 

WIBTA if I leave my dad to live on his own, essentially kicking him out of our house?

No response so at night I said that we used to talk everyday and lately it’s just me reaching out with no response. Next day she said good luck on finals, basically dodged it. I confronted her again saying I feel something’s weird between us and asked what her thoughts were.

I’ve gotten no response. My bf and others have told me to just drop it and if I keep pushing it I’d be TA. I don’t want to leave it alone. We talked every single day, live 10 minutes apart, our boyfriends work together, and I’m *bound* to see her at a gathering soon. She’s on her phone all day, even at stoplights.

She doing one year of payments, then when I graduate I am taking over. I have a bank account with a major bank, but we did the loan through a credit union that my mom has her account at.

We were at the credit union getting the loan figured out and they had a deal where if you set up a checking account, you get a reduced rate. I didn’t want to do this. The reduced rate was 0.15% less, which on the loan, which was 20,000, gave a savings of 30$. This added like under 2$ to each monthly payment.

To me, this wasn’t worth doing because I already had a checking account at a different place, and I didn’t want to have to deal with god knows what fees and other crap that will come up. When I told my mom I didn’t want to do it, she pressured me and basically said that if I wanted her help at all, I had to do it. I got really frustrated, but caved because I’m working this summer and need a car to get to work. 

Extra info: I would be fine paying the extra amount per month on the monthly loan payment for her. But she didn’t give this as an option and went straight to pressuring me to get the account instead

So I like to dress very comfy, like sweatpants are my best friend and just regular shirts are cool with me too. Now a problem arose before my 8th grade graduation. I hate jeans and dress pants with a burning passion. Like I can't understand why someone would be happy to have smaller pockets rough insides and ugly blue outsides.


My mom really wanted me to ""dress out"" I thought this was rather silly regarding this was a 8th grade graduation organized by the student government.  I told her this and she said her son would not be looking like a homeless man. 

I could be fine with wearing a nice collared shirt with a tie or something but jeans were a big no. This then resulted in 8th grade me slouching sadly around the store like a little kid trying to make them feel pity. 


After that I talked with my mom and after a while of back and forth she gave up and begrudgingly agreed for the glorious sweatpants to prevail. I felt kinda bad that I spoiled her vision of what I should look like, she only went to elementary school growing up in Mexico. But fancy is just not who I am, but still I feel like shit that I  ruined that day for her AITA?

Well things progress as things often  do and I get a crush on her. One night after drinking heavily with a buddy let's call him H.

Then I call BOOM and she was sober and willing to drive so we go to the IHOP. After the meal I get a call from another buddy of mine saying our friend  let's call R is super drunk and puked on his carpet and if we could pick him up. BOOM says ok so we pick him up and get him to his barracks room. I ask BOOM out and she declines but that's just fine shes a cool person  and someone I've come to consider  a good friend so we still hang out. Then a few weeks later we go on leave. I get back and I forget how I found out I think H let it slip but that BOOM was dating someone  in the company  (he knew I liked her along with a couple  others including  R and  the person  who's house we picked him up from. They also knew she rejected my advances) I was like oh who and H said I promise  I wouldn't  tell but she told me specifically  not to tell you. So after running errands  with H and hounding  him for the info he stuck by his convictions. So I called R and vented to him the situation  that it hurts she thinks she'd have to kept a secret  from me cause I'm already over her in a romantic  way. He was giving me some names it could possibly be  but then had to leave as he had to go lock his stuff up for deployment. Well 10 minutes  later I get a call from R and he admits hes the one whose dating  her and well talk when  he gets back. So he gets back and both BOOM and R come out and say they're dating  and I say awesome a couple  of  my favorite  people are  happily  together why would  I  not approve. They said they were worried  it would ruin our friendship and  I  said naw it's cool I'm happy yall are together (and I truly was) but then later on as I'm hanging  out  with  H I start to get pissed when I started to think wait do they think I'm that petty and pathetic  that I'd end a friendship  over a girl who didn't  like me back. Do they think so low of me that just because  something  didnt go my way I'd want nothing  to  do  with  them. Stuff like they were looking down  on me. So anger got the best of me and I cussed them  out  and  we came to an understanding and now today were all still very good friends  and they're married with a  kid on the way.

c02m81	2019-06-13 07:05:28	idunnowhateverworks	WIBTA If I stopped initiating everything without telling anyone	"In every single one of my friendships I have to be the one to initiate conversations and plan outings. Honestly I'm sick of it. It makes me feel uncared for because I have to do everything. For the past week I had plans with two friends to go see a movie today, we discussed the movie time and rides. 7 o'clock was the agreed upon time and they agreed to pick me up. Today however at 3:30 I texted the one who offered me a ride and asked what time she was going to arrive at my place. She didn't respond. I waited anout 10 minutes and then I called her, and it went straight to voicemail.

At 6:55 I decided they probably forget and tought they were supposed to meet me there. So I rush to the theater and purchase my ticket. I quickly look at the snack nd ticket queus to see neither of them. So I head to my movie and, while the lights are still on I look for them and once again I don't see either of them. I again text the one who was supposed to be my ride but to no avail. The movie starts so I turn off my phone and try to just enjoy the movie.

After the movie is finished I turn my phone back on to see no notifications. As of now it's been 6 hours and the only text I got was from one of them about an unrelated questions I had asked the day before. And honestly it's pretty tough. There were no excuses, warnings, or even apologies. For one thing it hurts but for another it got me thinking. No matter who it is I always have to start the conversation or plan things. Hell I have one friend who, when he doesn't flake out, always says that he never responds because I don't say anything that requires a response (even thought I ask him questions.) Quite frankly this is ridiculous.

So I plan on deleting all of my conversations, but not unfriending or blocking. This way all that happens is that I don't see the conversation and thus won't feel the need to try to initiate. But if someone texts me first and initiates I'll keep talking to them and initiate and not delete that conversation again. But for everyone who doesn't respond I won't try. 

On the one hand this feels like I'm trying to test my friends. But on the other hand it's not like I'm going to end my friendship but rather just not initiate. It doesn't seem like a punishment if no one tries anyways. Of course I'm not doing this with family or contacts that are work related it's strictly going to be friends. And I get everybody works differently and some people are more social in person or over the phone but they never try to hang out in person or even call.

WIBTA? And more importantly would this be considered a test?

Tl;dr: I always have to initiate conversations and plan to hang out but I've gotten sick of it and want to stop, so I plan on just stopping and not talking to anyone unless they talk to me.7"	Not the A-hole	0	0	176.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

So it's not a super deep story. My older sister and her husband are planning a trip with not only their son and our (6 person) family to a nice area we all went as kids. My father wants to propose to his girlfriend of about 3 years while we are there.

The problem is I just got a new job, and I may not be able to get the entirety of the 5-7 day trip off. Understandably so. I wanted my boyfriend of almost 6 years to come with us so if I had to leave early, my family would not have to drive 10+ hours to take my ass home. And instead my boyfriend and I could leave early if necessary.

My dad today asked ""Can (boyfriend) watch the dogs when were gone?"" Me:""I thought he was coming with us.""

Me:""I may not be able to go, if he doesn't come with, because I might not be able to get that much time off of my new job""

My dad seemed upset and didn't mention it again, I know he's still set with my boyfriend not going, but I feel like it's unfair. I've been dating my boyfriend longer than my older sister and her husband and my dad and his girlfriend  have been dating. Yet I feel no one takes us seriously, because we are younger than them.

I also know this will hurt my boyfriends feelings because he will feel like he won't be part of the big moment.

The tattoo is an ambigram: it says two different words depending on what angle you look at it from. It is both my name and my exes name. Fortunately the exes name also kind of looks like a different word.

My new boyfriend saw it and was like ""woah does that say [different word] from this angle?? That's cool!"" and I just played dumb and went ""huh, that's funny"" and he asked if itwas on purpose and I said ""nope definitely didn't tattoo [different word] on purpose"" (technically not a lie?)

Now I feel like kind of an asshole because I should have come clean, but I hate the tattoo, I had getting shit for it, I'm not keeping it, and frankly I don't want to get into it with him or anyone else. I don't want to lie to him at all, but I don't want to be made fun of for the one thing most people agree is stupid: tattooing names of lovers.

c02jke	2019-06-13 06:56:17		AITA for not saying anything?	"This has been weighing on me, I know I'm probably the asshole.

I was friends with this girl from about 7th grade to 11th. I would have considered her my best friend for the most part, however she was extremely emotionally abusive and manipulative. I still get panic attacks when I hear her name. Whenever she would text me I would panic because it was probably about something I did wrong. She always made me feel as if I was a terrible friend if I didn't give into her wills, used me for money and would toss me to the side when a better friendship opportunity arose. She told me my anxiety disorder was fake and that I should just get over it. She NEVER took responsibility for her actions and blamed every problem on everyone else. Words don't really do it justice, but she was a really bad friend. 

I thought I was the only person who had a problem with her so I stayed her friend thinking I needed to improve. For the most part I was really her only close friend. That was until she got closer to another small group of friends I had. She would always try to isolate me from them, because she didn't want me to have anyone else but her. Not too long after they saw who she was and dropped her. We all became really close after this because for the first time I didn't feel crazy. After this me and bad friend drifted apart and she tried to be friends with a few other people which never worked out. 

Well one day bad friend doesn't show up to school. Nbd, until rumors started spreading that she was driving drunk and got into an accident. I was really shocked but nothing much came of it from then on. I missed the next day of school and when I came back I heard that the class had made her a get well card. Apparently someone in our class (who I never got confirmed from them did this, and it was really shocking since they weren't even involved in this) wrote something pretty nasty on the card. I really didn't agree with what they wrote at all, but I never said anything. Part of me wants to say it was because I never got confirmation on who it was and that I wasn't there, but honestly I was so bitter about how she treated me, I just let it go. We all found out later that it wasn't a drunk driving accident, but something more serious (something I can't say on thus sub). She obviously saw what was on the card and made a lot of rightfully upset posts on social media. 

I've been thinking a lot about how I handled this situation and I'd like some outside perspective.  

So, AITA?

c02j59	2019-06-13 06:54:45	saltybeefchunk	AITA for giving my recent ex the would-have-been engagement ring?	"I dated this girl for a year and 3 months. Long enough to know that I loved her. I truly did. We had a hard relationship, but it was worth it. At least it was to me. I was getting ready to pop the question at some point soon when she surprised me with a letter where she said she’s burnt out of the relationship.

I was wondering what was going on, but the letter didn’t explain anything, just that there are reasons for her breaking up with me. What got me though, was that she said that she had been living a lie, and that she didn’t really love me. That hurt like hell. Worse than I’ve been hurt before, and I was hurt a lot.

So I went back to my place and started gathering her stuff to give her, when I pulled out the engagement ring that I had bought earlier. I couldn’t bear to look at it, and I didn’t just want to throw it away. I also didn’t want to sell it, as I either wouldn’t have found a buyer (it was a very specific custom ring), or I would have felt guilty about selling it.

So I put it in the bag with the rest of her stuff. It weirdly felt fitting I guess. Needless to say, she’s hurt. AITA?

Tl;dr: I got dumped, gave my ex the ring I was going to be proposing to her with, she’s upset and hurt.

Edit 1: I gave her the ring because I didn’t want it around, but also didn’t want to sell it. In my mind at least, it feels better to give it to her on bad terms, than just sell it and never gave it to her. It feels like closure for me at least.

Today she messages me saying that the owner of the store she manages was being a dick to her. So to surprise, her I walked to her work so I can hug and walk her home.

When I got there we hugged and it was lovely. But then she starts complaining to her staff about the owner and continues for a couple of minutes saying that she's going to quit and find a new job and going on and on about how bad he is.

I used to have a manager like this and I hated it, made me feel awkward about my future there and always saw it as extremely unprofessional. Everyone has the right to vent but you shouldn't do it in front of your subordinates.

I interjected and said she shouldn't be talking about this in front of her staff as it really unprofessional.

She said I embarrassed her and made her co-worker feel awkward.

c02en4	2019-06-13 06:38:20	TheOfficialTripnip	WIBTA If I told my cousin I didn’t want to be a part of her wedding after already saying I would?	" So this past March I visited my Grandmother in Texas while I was on spring break. While there I went out to dinner with my cousin and her fiancé since I hadn’t seen her since she graduated high school back in 2014. Now they had gotten engaged last fall and I knew she had already asked my sister and my other cousin, her sister, to be bridesmaids almost immediately after the proposal. Apparently some other family members thought I might be offended to not be involved in the wedding since I would be the only cousin left out and so while at dinner, she asked if I would be an usher at the wedding. Basically this means I’ll be walking family members to their seats at the start of the ceremony.

Now I have been the best man at one wedding and attended a few others and at none of them did they have ushers. In fact the only wedding I have seen do this was when watching the video of my parents wedding where my uncle was one. Now when I said sure since I knew saying no would make her feel bad about me being left out, she said she would send me what I needed to wear to the wedding.

Now here’s where things get messy for me. I had assumed since I wasn’t a key or even really that important role it would be like “get this tie and wear these colored dress pants and shirt”. But I was clearly wrong. They apparently are having the wedding at a very nice venue with a strict dress code and apparently even the ushers are having to wear tuxedos. 

So this last week I get the link to the rental service they want us to get them from and the rate for the weekend would cost me like $550 before tax do to them having to tailor the suit extra since I’m super skinny and tall. When I told my mom this she shrugged and said “well of course renting a tux is expensive” as though I should have know this.

The real problem for me is that I am still in college and am only able to work when out of school which is about four months a year. My job also only pays $0.50 above minimum wage which means I don’t exactly have a ton of money to be spending. In fact, I had to save for a year and a half to afford the trip to visit my grandmother because of the cost of school supplies and books.

When I talked to my mom again, she said that I shouldn’t feel to bad because everyone else involved in the wedding is having to pay for their clothes. But the problem is that everyone else has a full time job and is out of school. My sister, who is in an online masters degree program, works at a full time job during the day and gets paid 3.5 times what I make so of course she can more easily afford it. Meanwhile, I would have to spend 1/10 of what a make in year to afford something I honestly don’t care enough about to blow this kind of money on.

So I want to know if I would be an asshole for telling my cousin I would attend the wedding but won’t be in it because of the cost. I feel like it should be more then reasonable that the cost is to much of a barrier for me but clearly from what my mom has said to me, that shouldn’t matter apparently."

The drone is cheap (< $100) and we already own a DJI drone, so he probably intended on regifting this free drone he got.  

As I was carrying it out of the car for him, all the contents in the box fell out while I carried it by the handle.  The box is crappy, the cover was closed by tape and the tape had lost all adhesive so it was worthless.  I was carrying a ticking time bomb like Kevin Durant's achilles's tendon and everything came crashing out.  

When it happened, I automatically played it off as not my fault, the box was crappy and disregarded it since it was a) cheap and b) free.  My husband immediately proceeds to flip his shit because of how I responded to dropping the drone, not the fact that I dropped the drone.  He says I did not treat his property with any care, respect, and did not own up to my mistakes whether he paid for the drone, gifted the drone, or won it for free.  He says I do this all the time with his other possessions, not treating his stuff with the proper care and respect.

c02c6r	2019-06-13 06:29:58	couch12345678	WIBTA If I Told My Best Friend's Boyfriend That She Cheated on Him While We Were Studying Abroad?	"So for context, they have been in a long distance relationship because they go to different colleges for 3 years.  I do not care too much for him.  I honestly suspect she has cheated on him in the past.  From what she has said to me, I believe he could have cheated on her as well.

&#x200B;

My best friend and I studied abroad for 4 months, and in that time she had sex with 3 different guys and hooked up with many others.  The only reason I feel obligated to tell him is because she would constantly lie to me and say that they were ""on a break"" when I could see their texts.  I did not read them on purpose, but we were living in the same room, and I would see her phone and her laptop (which would have texts show up on as well).  By in his texts it was clear that he had a fear, he did specifically say ""please do not f\*ck other guys"" which is obvious to me but that's what they said.  He sent her money and flowers on Valentines Day, and she used that money to buy a dress and go on a date with another guy.  In multiple relationships with these men she met abroad, she told them she planned to have their kids, move in with them, and other various things that would have serious long term implications.  To be clear, she told me just about all of this all while claiming this guy back home was her boyfriend.

&#x200B;

To me it is pretty clear that they have an unhealthy relationship, but I don't know if I WBTA if I butted in their relationship to let him know what is going on/went on.  She is my best friend and I do not want to destroy that, and I don't know if it will/ if it's worth it.  This kid really loves her and it would break his heart but I feel guilty knowing this information, and letting the relationship continue without him knowing.

&#x200B;

She would say they were on a break yet they would still text and facetime every single day, and he would tell her how much her loved her, and she would say the same, yet she would do these things and go out and hook up with guys anyway.

She took Plan B twice.

c02c5j	2019-06-13 06:29:50	LarcSekaya	WIBTA for rehoming a rescued dog?	"Tl;dr - We adopted a dog from a rescue with a slew of undisclosed medical issues which has caused strain in our relationship and finances and have till Saturday to decide if we need the rescue to be rehomed. 

My boyfriend and I (22 and 24 respectively) have been living together for a little over a year and decided that we wanted to get a dog. Through a local rescue, we found this Great Pyrenees/retriever mix who is between the ages of 2-3. 

This rescue does a several stage interview process where they ask about your living situation, how far would you be willing to go for the animal, etc. After the initial interview, we find out that the dog has Heartworm and is going through the treatment at the shelter and would take a few weeks to heal. The BF and I talked about it, and decided that it was something we were comfortable moving forward with. 

The day before the dog is supposed to be dropped off (blind drop off, we didn’t have the opportunity to meet the dog beforehand) the rescue calls us to let us know that he has been chewing on his back paw, and they think it’s caused by shelter anxiety. Bf and I once again agree that we can work through it and we continue. On drop off day, we get told that they think it’s allergies, not anxiety and given Benadryl to give him. We pay the fee and sign off on the agreement. He also was significantly underweight. 

The first few nights were tough. We had to rotate between who would sleep on the ground with the dog because his “chewing” actually ended up being full on growling to barking to lunging to try to bite off both of his back legs and tails. We tried a cone, no effect. Hydrocortisone cream, no effect. We took him to a vet Monday who pointed out that the dog was actually missing a back toe, two paw pads on his left hind foot, and had a pretty big gash in his right hind paw. The rescue did not inform us of any of that. 

We reasoned that the biting attacks were caused by pain and separation anxiety from trauma in the past. 

Now (1.5 weeks and 3 vet visits later), he is on 8 different medications, will likely be on pain medication for the rest of his life, and his paw pads will never heal. 

His parents have been watching him this week while we are at work and have experience with injured/traumatized dogs. Even they are recommending we give him back to the shelter (with the logic that if it’s over their heads, it’s over ours.) And, we don’t disagree. 

Per the contract with the rescue, we have till Saturday to make a decision.

He has been causing a lot of strain in our lives (alternating missing work days last week, restless nights, no time for hobbies or each other.) I see the worry and stress in my bf’s eyes every day and he hasn’t really smiled while being at home. 

We don’t know if returning him to the rescue would give him his best chance. I’m not ready to give up on him, but I also don’t think either of us anticipated just how many problems we’d have to work through with him."	Not the A-hole	0	0	304.0	15.0	0.0	0.0

c02amj	2019-06-13 06:24:27		WIBTA if I ask the guy I’m dating to reduce communication with his female friend who says rude things about me?	"I’ve been going out with Clint for the past three months. There was an instant attraction when we met, we talk every day and see each other every other day. I want us to take the next step and be in a serious relationship, and I’m wondering if I would be an asshole to ask him to reduce communication with one of his friends, Mia. 

&#x200B;

Clint and Mia have been friends since high school. Mia lives in another state so I’ve never met her, but they talk almost every day. That’s fine because Clint hasn’t done anything to make me think that I have anything to worry about. But yesterday I was able to read some of their chats and found out that Mia has been saying rude things about me in her chats with Clint. 

&#x200B;

Examples:

&#x200B;

\- Clint sent Mia a screenshot of the scoreboard of a Dota 2 game he played with me. He and Mia are good at gaming, while I only know a bit from some of my exes. Mia replied something along the lines of “I don’t know why you’re bringing a noob to high level games in the first place.”

&#x200B;

\- Clint mentioned his worries about the difference in our backgrounds. My family is well-off while he is from a middle class background. Clint said I’m high maintenance and he knows he can’t afford things I’m used to. Mia was like “If you know it’s not going anywhere, then why are you sticking around?”

&#x200B;

\- Clint and I had a row over me suddenly leaving him during a date. One of my friends had a personal emergency so I hurriedly said “Something happened to Marley, I need to go to her place” and left. I didn’t know it at that time, but Clint told Mia that what I did was rude and he was having doubts about us. The next day he told me that we needed to take a break from each other and blocked me. I gave him space and waited till the next day to message him, he was calmer and thinking clearer this time and we started talking again. When Clint told Mia that we were talking again, Mia said “Why did you unblock her? Were you hoping she’d realize what a selfish twat she is and apologize to you?”

&#x200B;

\- Clint messaged Mia about a rumor he heard that I previously dated was a co-worker and we had sex in the office. For the record, we did not. We were fresh out of college, adventurous and really attracted to each other, so we made out a bit in a stock room and that was all that happened. But rumors started going around that we had sex there. Of course Mia in her high horse said “What the fuck are you doing with a girl who has no respect for other people’s property and propriety” as if someone got hurt or the company suffered losses because we made out for a few minutes in the stock room.

&#x200B;

I personally think that Mia has feelings for Clint, unfortunately for her she’s not his type. I also think that as long as she stays close to him, she will always talk badly about me to him in an attempt to sabotage our relationship. Would I be the asshole if I ask him to reduce communication with Mia for the sake of our relationship?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I’m trying to understand if I’m really the asshole here, because that’s how he made me feel and I respect myself more than to be guilt tripped.

It happened after my ex and I had a falling out because there were three instances of infidelity on my part and he found out.

I apologized profusely and then confided in him that I have a sexual addiction and offered to go to therapy. He made me move out of his place back to my apartment but was still supporting me as a friend, and it was really hard on me. 

One day he came over because I was in bad shape and when I mentioned I’d been talking to one of the guys I was unfaithful with about what happened, he got up and walked out without saying a word.

Later he texted me that he needed time away from me and that I was a “not a good person” and “not a good friend” and was “throwing a pity party” for myself and he wouldn’t be part of it.

A month and a half later he emailed me and forgave me because he found out I’d been talking to his mother to cope. He wanted to know how I was doing and offered talk in person and let it all go.

I wasn’t willing to forgive the things he said to me when he needed space and told him as much in an email reply, then stopped contact for the past 8 months or so.

Am I really the asshole for not wanting to be talked to like that?

c028jy	2019-06-13 06:16:57	throwawaydandydemon	AITA for thinking my GF is being selfish?	"We are adults dating close to a year. I have a very close (male) friend I don't get to see. We used to live in the same city but I moved 3 hours away last year. I've seen him for a few hours total since. Earlier this year he bought a home, we said there had to be a housewarming weekend. Kept being put off until about a month ago when I realized my only free weekend until mid-July was this one and decided to (at least tentatively) schedule it in.

Ive previously expressed to my GF how I ""needed to get up there"" etc. At some point she said she'd also like to go back to CityX. I suggested a separate trip but she said ""if hes your best friend, don't you think it's important for us to meet?"" Eventually I said yes because I do want them to.

Nothing happened until a few weeks ago during a fight she said, ""we've been dating for months and never gone on any trips or gone anywhere."" So I figured two birds etc. but now for her the weekend is about ""us taking a trip to meet my friend.""

Yesterday another friend, Tom and I are confirming things and I msg my GF to let her know. ""I forgot Fathers Day is this Sunday"" she says ""so we'd have to go back Saturday night."" Okay, maybe there's a solution. I look up trains and there's one leaving 90min earlier than we'd leave to drive back. So I say how about we go up together but I put you on the train Saturday night?

""No, I don't want to ride the train by myself""

""Okay, well...""

""You know what? Never mind. Just go by yourself""

""Well I'm not going to force you to take the train. I guess we go up Friday night and stay for the day""

""Yeah, okay""

The guys are not happy, say its a waste to drive that much for such a short trip. Plus Mark wanted to carpool. Tom says forget it, calls it off. I'm annoyed, call my GF to tell her plans cancelled & why, ""well thats dumb"" is all she says. Now I'm pissed about how she's handled this but it's late so I go to bed. Today it's still bugging me so I send the good morning message she expects to get but it's just ""Morning"". She messages me later on and I tell her I'm still annoyed.

She says ""I told you you can go without me if you want, and that I don't want to train back alone. Then you said no and that we would go back together. Then apparently that's not worth it for Tom who isn't the one making the Journey and yet you're upset with me?""

Says there's no difference between going back Saturday eve or Sunday. I tell her that we lose a night & I have to make sure I'm sober to drive meaning acting like the DD during the day too. Responds we could just go out Friday. But after a long week+driving I'm not going hard. Oh and she says she was ""about to"" suggest I go alone but since I said we'd just go for the day she didn't bother bringing it up.

She's now mad I was cold to her today, says it/I ruined her day, that I'm blaming her for a decision my friend made and that she did nothing wrong"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

My sister and her fiancé got home today for their wedding on Saturday. 

We were all sitting around after they got in and she says, ""So you're going to shave your mustache for the wedding, right?"" 

I quickly responded that I was not going to and the whole family kinda looked at me like I was the asshole and my sister said something about us already having talked about this (?). I play music in a band and the facial hair is a bit of a part of that persona. Plus, why is it her business what I'm wearing on my face anyway? 

So Reddit - AITA for not shaving my mustache?

PS: If this post picks up any steam, my (soon to be) Brother in law is a redditor and would probably see this. Maybe you can help solve this family quarrel?

c025kd	2019-06-13 06:06:29	dashcode	WIBTA if I charged my housemate's boyfriend utilities while he stays with us?	"For context:

&#x200B;

Six people share a house, myself included. Two of these six are away for the summer (but still paying rent, this part's important), so there's only four of us in the house now.

&#x200B;

One of the four housemates here currently has her boyfriend from out of the country staying with her. Neither I nor the two others knew about him staying until the day we moved in. He has been here the same amount of time as the rest of us, and plans to remain here for at **most** the next 60 days or so.

&#x200B;

We moved in about a month ago, and our first utility bill for gas came recently. We had previously discussed the BF paying utilities while he was here informally, but none of us have anything in writing. Being the one who's name is on the bill, I divided it by the number of current occupants (5) equally. Their (BF+GF's) portion of the gas bill is nothing expensive, less than $20.

&#x200B;

The way I see it, he should contribute a portion of the electricity, water, gas, and internet bills that is equal to the rest of what the other four of us are paying for as long as he is staying here. He is already living on the dime of the two residents who are paying rent \*in absentia\*, so the least he could do is pay for the utilities he uses while he is here. The other two housemates and I have agreed that he should be charged for these (we don't want to pay for his showers and such),  but BF and GF feel attacked that I am charging them for these.

WIBTA if we charged him utilities while he stays here?

&#x200B;

Edit: I supposed I should reiterate that this is only the gas bill - the water, power, and internet bills have not come yet, meaning that we are talking about a total cost of \~$180 over three months for one person, not just the $10 gas bill. I do not want to have a situation in which it is expected that a guest of this nature should not shoulder any part of the burden.

Edit 2: We have lived here for 30 days so far. BF has been here that whole time and could possibly stay for as long as 90 days total."	Not the A-hole	0	0	240.0	32.0	0.0	0.0

"My mother wants to have a roommate move in with us so we can make some extra money. I just graduated from high school and am 16, so while I can get a job (I am working very hard to find one!), I can't legally move out without her permission or work at many places. I also don't have a license (working on it--she would not take me to the DMV for the appt for my permit so I got it about a year late.

&#x200B;

I used to be really fit before I met my girlfriend until a knee injury put me off from lifting seriously for many months. As time went on, I just kind of lost motivation and stopped going to the gym as much and started to focus on other things. Pretty soon, I started dating my girlfriend and things have been going great for the most part. I've shown my girlfriend pictures of myself back then and she really liked them and would sometimes jokingly ask me to please head back to the gym, which I'm fine with because they're just jokes.

&#x200B;

Well, today my girlfriend and I were talking and got onto the topic of working out. As the conversation progressed, she started joking about me going back to the gym and eventually ended up lecturing me briefly on why working out is good for health. The thing is, I'm not completely sedentary. I play basketball and golf and dabble in competitive ballroom dancing. The reason I don't go back to lifting and dieting is because it's simply not as fun as the things I'm in now and it was torture bulking and cutting and I've told her this. Compared to my old self, I only lost a couple kilos and some definition on my stomach so I'm by no means fat just lost some muscle. She knows that I participate in these activities and still ended up lecturing me. I found myself getting more and more irritated because I thought it was all jokes until I got her lecture. I then asked, ""are you saying this because you're afraid of me getting fat in the future""? She got upset and said how I could say that about her and that she's not that type of girl who judges people by their looks. I then apologized to her for asking that question.

c021i7	2019-06-13 05:52:52	heartbrokensg	AITA for removing my best friend from Spotify to make space for my bf?	"Hi, throwaway account.

Everyone involved in this are students. My bff, my bf and I are university students with part time jobs and my bff and I still get allowance from our parents (it's a culture thing here) so no one's like super poor or anything but we're also not rich. 

Since early last year, I have been paying for Spotify Family for my siblings and since there was an extra spot, I asked my bff if she wanted it. She accepted and since then, that was how it was. I'm guessing that people would ask and no, she doesn't chip in or anything but neither does my siblings. It has always been me paying the $15 plus fee every month even though I wasn't even a user of Spotify in the first place (my siblings convinced me to subscribe to it and I was the eldest so I agreed) but after using Spotify, I'm still ambivalent about it. Originally, I jokingly told my siblings and my bff to just buy me a bubble tea once a month to offset the price but honestly, no one did and I wasn't expecting them to anyways. 

Then I started dating my bf and I found out that he has been paying $10 plus for Spotify Premium for himself. He's also subscribed to Netflix (the package with four accounts ??). After purging his account of strangers (somehow people got hold of his password) and changing the password, he offered me a spot so now there's four of us; my bf and I, his friend and his brother. Again, my bf is the only one paying for the service and I don't pay anything to him for Netflix. 

So right now, I don't know if I should remove my bff from my Spotify Family in order to give the last spot to my bf. Is it an asshole move? I'm having mixed feelings because on one hand, I'm the one paying for it and it's my account but on the other hand, it's my bff. Before I offered her Spotify Family, she was using Spotify Free because she didn't want to pay for Spotify Premium.

I obviously don't want to remove any of my siblings because they're family and they're all younger than me so it's kind of my duty to pay for them (I'm those elder sisters who splurge quite a bit on my siblings to be honest haha). And my bf is, well, my bf and I want to help him cut costs (and we see a future together) and not to mention, he's sharing his Netflix with me so it seems natural to share my Spotify with him too. When we go out, we both pay for our dates but he pays more because his job income is higher than my allowance and part time income combined, and he likes paying (it's a man thing). 

Just to reiterate, both my bff and my bff can afford to pay for their own Spotify and removing my siblings is not an option haha I'm leaning towards removing my bff to give her spot to my bf but I don't know if that's a mean thing to do so AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
c021ei	2019-06-13 05:52:30	migrational_coconut	WIBTA for refusing to visit my grandfather’s headstone?	"Bear with me for a bit of background. Throughout my entire childhood, my grandfather and I did not have any sort of relationship besides obligatory conversations at family dinners, birthdays, etc. As I grew older, I realized that my grandfather treated my dad (his son) terribly, despite my dad’s unwavering loyalty to him. As my mom and I found out later, there’s strong evidence that my grandfather verbally abused my grandmother as she suffered from dementia. In addition to this, a few years ago, he made some wildly inappropriate comments to one of my best friends at my high school graduation party. During the last five years of his life, the  tumultuous relationship between my grandfather and my father as well as my grandfather’s questionable antics  made me realize that I wanted nothing to do with him at all. 

Anyway, the reason I made this post is because as I mentioned, my grandfather passed away late last year and is currently buried in a very famous veterans cemetery. Because of the significance of his burial in this particular cemetery (and the value of visiting gravestones in Jewish tradition) my dad is planning on flying out to the cemetery and wants me to come with him to pay my respects. Let me add that this is a cross-country flight, not a quick jaunt across the state. I was the only grandchild not present at the unveiling of the headstone last year because I was studying overseas, and my dad claims that it is my responsibility to make a visit. The thing is, as soon as my grandfather passed away, it seems like my dad forgot the last 15 years of their chaotic relationship. My dad also claims that the reason I did not have a good relationship with my grandfather is because I never reached out to him. 

Currently, I am unwilling to forgive my grandfather for his treatment of my father, my grandmother, and my friend. However, I know that my father will be incredibly upset with my unless I make the trip out. I understand this, as he is still hurting from his father’s death. WIBTA if I refused to go?"

c01wck	2019-06-13 05:34:55	WolfxDemoness	AITA for leaving a toxic group of people who support alcohol abuse?	"Little back info. Yes, I currently struggle with an alcohol issue.  Everyday I try to stay sober (and succeed) is such a victory. 


So I love playing video games. It’s a hobby of mine that I’ve had since I was 6 or 7 (I’m 28 now). So I’m what some what call a true gamer lol. So I met a group of people on the PS4. I joined their group and everything was going well (a couple road bumps but nothing I didn’t forgive over). Except for these two events. 
The first one: Discord (for those who don’t know it, it’s a chatting program that you can join servers on and text and such) glitches and said I kicked someone when I didn’t. The whole group attacked me and kicked me from the group. Next day they apologize, say they acted out of line and wound up believing me.
Then there’s this issue. A person in this group turned 21. He was already drinking before he turned 21 mind you. So when he turned 21 he drank straight for a whole week. Fine, he’s 21 it’s what kids do I thought. A week became a month and he’d drink every day he’s off (drunk all day and night) and half the time he’d drink after work. Me, with my alcohol issue, made comments to him about how it’s bad what he’s doing . Every time I’d do other people would say it’s okay for him to do because it’s his days off and he’s using it to control his emotions and other enabling BS I’d hear at rehab (recovering addict too). And what made this whole this worse is he’d say thing like “it’s his American dream to wake up and drink and be an alcoholic “. And every time I’d say something I’d also get
Told “who cares you also have a problem “. 
So one night we are in Voice chat and another argument breaks out over this guy (other people are having issues with him drinking all the time and becoming an asshole too). I’m telling them what he’s doing is destructive and can harm him. They are full enabling mode. So
He gets told by the main enabler that this is being discussed (yes main enabled. The main one who says it’s okay to use alcohol if you’re depressed, you don’t know what he’s going through, you are an alcoholic who cares, etc.). So he comes in and starts screaming at me that I’m an idiot, projecting, etc.. Tired of this BS , I tell them they’re toxic and leave the chat and the group. 
I truly was trying to look out for the guy because I know what it can do to you yet I’m made out to be the bad guy because I’m telling him it’s bad for you if abused."	Not the A-hole	0	0	29.0	10.0	0.0	0.0

Here's what happened. I'm at work outside of my office on the floor. My job announces over the Pa system that there is a manager meeting.

I tell him yes.... They announced it over the PA system. Now Bob is pissed off. He asks me why I didn't tell him there was a meeting, and demands that I inform him next time.


This makes no sense to me. My boss and I weren't together when they announced the meeting. He is supposed to be in the building, and should have heard it like every other person did.

Shes sweet and does her best, i just think the things she finds as productive are actually harmful, but i aknowledge she is doing what she thinks is right and thats better than intentionally doing harmful things. Ive gone through phone trackers, forced break-ups, all text messages being read, not allowed to have social media until 16 (though my siblings were allowed to when they were 13), and much more.

I recently went to a college near by because my mother said i was only allowed to go to a college in a 2 hour circle despite being given chances and scholarships and places all around the country. I went to a college close by but had to take out loans and take grants (the whole nine yards). Recently at college in my freshman year i was diagnosed with clinical depression which my mother claimed isnt real and was only an excuse to sell pills. The whole college experience was ruined for me just with multiple aspects and i was till forced to drive back and forth to and from college and was told i was cheap for not being able to afford gas.
Its the summer and um back from the college and just dont want to go back. My family sat me down and told me that since i dint want to work in a factory for the rest of my life that i have no life direction and that im playing victim when i bring up that i dont know the line between what i can and what i want to do with my life. 
I was recently invited to an amazing college across the country un a field of study i enjoy alot and can afford as well as it pays good.
When i brought it up to my girlfriend we came up with a possible plan to save up and when stable move across the country so we can both pursue possibilities. When i told my friends they said ""hell yeah go for it"". When i told my parents they said they cant help me financially qnd until i can support myself i am subject to the rules of the house.(which is fine and good. Its only fair, it just sucks that it involves me not being qble to watch the shows i like, i live in a bedroom connected to a bathroom they use frequently so i have no privacy and it always smells like, well, feces, and they make me go to sports practices and whatnot for my siblings and make me do lawn work/inside chores on top of these restrictions). And my brother basically told me that im an asshole and im deserting the family if i go. Along with other names like selfish, worthless, and an awful brother (hes 15 btw).

So am quite shy and have difficulty adjusting to life here & making friends, I've made friend with just a few girls and I've hung out with them and some of their other friends who I don't really talk to, one of their friends has boyfriend who I find cute. I haven't had boyfriend or even date since coming here and am quite shy, especially talking to boys. So it is difficult for me to go out of my comfort zone and to meet them. I am not really friends with this girl but just mutual friend through those few girls am friends with, a couple of them went on vacation with that girl who has the boyfriend a couple weeks ago and while they was away I didn't have many people to hang out with, and I asked that girls boyfriend if he would like to hang out with me and he did. When we were hanging out I had made comment that I found him cute and stuff, and asked if he wanted to like do stuff, he said no and I apologized for asking, and later on we were texting, in the conversation I asked if he wasn't dating her if he would date me, and he stopped replying. I called him and texted a few times since that but he was ignoring me. Now they are back and this girl confronted me about it, she was confronting me in way like that I tried pushing her boyfriend into doing sexual stuff which isn't case at all so I denied it and she asked if I had been texting her boyfriend, I said no and she asked if she could look through my phone, I said no and she grabbed my wrist and started twisting it around until I started crying and let her to read through my phone.

If I were the wife, I’d want to know. I have her contact info and feel like I have a duty to warn her. But they have adorable children and I also don’t want to ruin her life so I feel like maybe it’s better if I just scare him and tell him it’s a matter of when, not if, she finds out and to just stop his bullshit before he ruins his family. 

WIBTA if I told her? I have screenshots of his dating profile and dick pics. We obviously didn’t do anything, but I’m 100% sure we would have if I didn’t pry.

Edit: thank you for all the advice. I’m a regular on this sub and often think “oh this is a validation post”. I have learned my lesson.

c01o1l	2019-06-13 05:07:24		"AITA for not wanting my parents to ""sell"" my sister ""my"" car"	"So when I was 19 I got my license. Almost half a year and my parents decide to ""get me a car"" to use to go to church and church activities without having to get a ride since they were using the other car at the time. The day we went to get the car was the same day I had already made plans to go do something else. I didn't really want the car in the first place and wanted to go to the mall with my friend (I would have driven the car we already had.) We end up going to the place to get the car anyway and I pick out a car ""for myself"" turns out that they said it was for me and my 17yr old sister (who had her permit at the time) and it was supposed to be motivation for me to get a job (since I have anxiety of taking public transport and or walking/biking places due to the fact that when growing up anytime I wanted to go anywhere I couldn't because ""it was dangerous"" and ""who knows what will happen"" seriously my mom even told us stories of bad things that happened to people all the time which makes it so I'm scared to leave the house alone which I would have to do if I got a job) they also said that we would have to pay them back for it. I never agreed to this, yet, they ""got it for us anyway"" knowing (I thought) that it wouldn't help me get a job. 

Fast forward a few years I am now 22. I now also have developed some form of social anxiety which makes it even harder for me to want to leave the house and or get a job. The sister I mentioned (who is now 20) has moved to California making it basically useless for her to have the car and now our 15yr old sister wants the car. She has plans to get a job and pay our dad for the car so she can have it. Problem is now I've grown sentimental to that car. It was technically my first car. I was able to drive it to my friend's house and to church and other places etc and I really like that car. The other problem is (like I've said from the beginning) I haven't gotten a job or payed dad for the car like my dad wanted me to in the first place. I am not (nor have ever been) opposed to getting a job and paying it off...I'm too scared to because of my anxiety. I would pay for the car if I could get over my anxiety and get a job (therapy hasn't really helped and is way too expensive) AITA for not wanting my parents to sell my younger sister ""my"" car because I've grown attached to it since it was ""my first car"" 

P.S. Everything I put in quotation marks is how I've seen this situation happening but I'm now learning that it technically wasn't my car even though they told me that they were getting it for me even though I wanted to go to the mall with my friend was just kind of dragged into this."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I am 22F. I work in a restaurant as a waitress. I get along really well with all of the people I work with. This is one of the only jobs I’ve been able to keep for a long period of time (2 years) because I get along with everyone pretty well. 

Having said all of that, I have Borderline Personality Disorder which can make forming relationships/friendships......difficult to say the least. To the majority of my coworkers I feel almost complete apathy towards them. Total indifference. So when I say I get along well with them I know it sounds like an oxymoron. 

They all tell me how much they love me and enjoy being around me at work and are constantly asking me to hang out with them. I’ve reluctantly hung out maybe twice. Truth be told I have absolutely zero desire to spend time with the majority of these people and couldn’t care less about most of them. 

At times I go through such intense depression that it’s hard for me to make it to work everyday. And I absolutely hate crowds and they always want to go to bars and stuff. Being around so many people gives me extreme anxiety. 

Some of these people tell me they love me everyday and they consider me a close friend and I say it back but don’t actually feel it. 

AITA because I lie to them pretty much everyday about my mental illness and they all think that we are great friends because of the “face” I put on?

c01lwx	2019-06-13 05:00:42	jesseisacutiepie	WIBTA if I begin to refuse to clean the house every week?	"16 female here and a while back my mom's varicose veins got really bad and she got diagnosed with diabetes. My mom and I don't have the best relationships (based on her neglecting my mental health for four years due to her reputation and responding with ""i don't care"" with a lot of my anxiety attacks and refusing to send me to a mental health specialist even with doctor's orders). 

 I worked a part-time job and went to school while my mom was a part-time student taking online courses (that she basically didn't take, she'd pay my brother and her friends to do it all) and other than that a house-spouse. Even though we have a bit of a shit relationship but that doesn't mean I'm *that* much of a jerk. When I heard the news I quit my job and began doing a lot of the chores at home. The main deal is every Friday night I thoroughly clean the *majority* of the house. (i didn't organize everyone's rooms but i would vacuum and scrub them down) so that was 5 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, gameroom, dad's office, living room, 2 dining rooms, kitchen plus the hallways, windows etc etc and 6 people's laundry. I don't really mind cause I enjoy cleaning I guess. 

But i got *zero* appreciation. Anytime my dad sees me cleaning he'll mutter ""may God give you rewards"" but that's pretty much it. My brothers will say disgusting misogynistic things in ""humor"" and always shout ""woman!"" at me when they want something. Or say things like ""*yeahh that's right WOMAN. get back in the kitchen""* (it's really creepy first of all and second of all it's really infuriating) my parents laugh and joke with it and sometimes i will but other times it just really ticks me off. 

anyway, i feel literally no appreciation. i'm not treated like an adult or with any respect. i have no access to my bank account, my parents won't let me learn to drive and i *rarely* am allowed to leave the house. my main issue though is that my mom shows no appreciation. i don't think that it's my responsibility to do *all* of this. of course i should help, but really?

c01ldy	2019-06-13 04:59:00	Itseinho	AITA for getting frustrated at a friend for not replying if they can do me a favor or not?	"The title probably sounds pretty bad, but let me explain the situation first:

My friend knows about my anxiety issues and I told him how insanely anxious I am for going to get an inflamed wisdom tooth pulled out. Based on previous experiences I've had with wisdom tooth removal, I asked if he could come and pick me up after the appointment because I feel really anxious about walking home afterwards.

I told him it's fine if he can't, I completely get it but I asked him to let me know whether he'll come or not by the previous day (I already tried to arrange for another ride but that didn't work out). We had already talked about this the previous weekend, and he had told me that he'll totally come pick me up. 

Here's what's making me frustrated: 

I did him a favor; I let him crash at my place the day before yesterday even though I knew I had a really early morning at work the next day, and I knew having him over would mean I wouldn't get a whole lot of sleep. He helped himself to the food I had in my fridge for breakfast (which he always does and I don't really mind because he's a friend and it's not like he is wolfing down everything I have).

I feel like pointing that out is making me sound petty, but right now that's one of the issues that's making me frustrated with this whole thing..

Anyway, so, as he's leaving my place after I come back from work, I again ask him to please let me know if he can come pick me up or not. He promises he will, but surprise surprise he never does. I text him in the evening about something unrelated and hope that he would notice that he hadn't answered me yet (I get that I probably should have just asked him again, but I feel bad for asking him to answer if he's going to do me a favor or not). He doesn't respond at all.

I have the appointment in a few hours and my anxiety is killing me. 

I am completely okay with him telling me he can't come. I just want to have an answer. I'm also completely willing to compensate him for coming to pick me up. But am I an asshole for getting frustrated that he won't reply to me?

c01l73	2019-06-13 04:58:18	sadegirl-	AITA for not telling my best friend her boyfriend confessed his feelings for me?	"My best friend and I have known each other since second grade. I have stuck by her through every relationship. She has a bad habit of getting extremely attached very quickly in relationships. She reacts very poorly to break ups and it’s very stressful for me since I am the one she turns to. For example, she has never once been through a break up where she did not threaten herself in some way. Basically she places all of her happiness in temporary relationships and once it’s over she doesn’t know how to cope.

We will call her boyfriend Max.

I went to Max’s house to help him with a project for one of his classes, my friend was also invited, but was busy. (I have never hung out with him one on one before this.) She knew we were together and had no issue with it. After some time we went to get some lunch and on our way back he told me he needed to tell me something but didn’t want to “ruin” things. I didn’t pry, but once we got back to his house he said “sometimes I wish (my friend) was more like you.” I asked him what he meant by that, but he kind of awkwardly changed the subject. Later that night as I was getting ready to leave he asked me, “if I broke up with _____, would I have a chance with you?” This took my by surprise because Max and I are not that close to begin with. I told him no, and continued to gather my stuff. He proceeded to confess his feelings for me and talk about all of the things my friend does that he does not like. I told him if he really felt that way he should break up with her, leave me out of it, then left.

My initial reaction was to tell her, but then I thought of everything she has done regarding relationships ending in the past. I was worried about how she would react. I also didn’t want her to blame me for his actions. Part of me felt as if she would excuse his behavior, stay with him, and cut me out of her life. So instead of reacting immediately, I drove home and slept on it. 

In the morning I woke up to multiple missed calls from her and unread texts. Max had broken up with her that night. He also texted me, and asked if I would reconsider now that he ended their relationship. I again told him no, and asked him to leave me alone. 

After rejecting him and cutting him off, they are now back together and I’m living with this guilt. They keep asking me to hangout with our friends but I can’t bring myself to be around them.

When he would be “coming over to work on his motorcycle”, which I was letting him store in my garage for free, he was just basically fucking her when I wasn’t home.

I’m pissed, never wanna see either of them again. He knew how heartbroken I was over the fresh break up, didn’t even have the balls to ask me how I would feel about it before. Known him for 14 years.

She was moving out soon, and hasn’t paid rent in the past month because I told her she should save her money to help get a down payment on a new apartment. I feel like she really took advantage of my generosity by using this time to fuck my ex best friend.

"Ok so I don’t want people to judge me or my F buddy for our kink/sex. I feel nervous about writing it here because this sub is all about judgment, and I don’t want our sexuality to be something people laugh at. I’m just evaluating whether I reacted poorly in this situation because it’s late at night.

My FB and I live in the same apartment building. He has keys to my place because I need someone to check in on my place once in a while (get mail, deliveries, water plants, etc) when I’m away, and vice versa. He has this fetish or kink where he likes to leave his semen in something I wear, like underwear or socks or pants. He’d come in when I’m out, do what he needs to get off, and leave the stain on a piece of clothing to dry. Sometimes it’s really obvious like a pair of clean underwear and sometimes less obvious like the inside of a shirt collar. He would text me asking me what I’m wearing and if it’s something he left a “surprise” stain on, he’d tell me to smell it and say something like “gotcha!”. I find it cute and endearing so I go along with it. 

So I was away for a week and just returned. We had a lunch quickie earlier today. Tonight while sleeping, he woke me up with a text asking me if I smell anything. I said just a very faint smell of sex (his semen). So I rummaged through a stack of clean black briefs on my night stand and asked him if he left me a surprise there. Turns out, while I was away, he left a surprise on the handmade quilt throw my grandmother made me. It is super delicate with intricate appliqués. I never ever use it. I just leave it by my bed as décor because I’m too afraid to wash it. 

I was really angry that he would do that and I basically told him he can’t come over for sex for a month. He got mad because he had no way of knowing it was off limits and I never said anything about it. I guess I’m still really upset about my quilt but maybe I’m punishing him for my own lack of communication? Sorry for rambling, it’s late and I got woken up.

Update: Hi everyone. Thanks for the thoughts. I really appreciate them. I definitely overreacted in retrospect and I think being woken up in the middle of the night didn’t help! I already apologized to my F buddy for the irate text I sent yesterday and will make it up to him. hehe. :-) I’ve called around some dry cleaning shops to see what their recommendations are (I just said stain, I was too embarrassed to say what kind of stain).

c01i8a	2019-06-13 04:48:37		AITA for shutting out my siblings?	"Throwaway for obvious reason that my brother is on reddit. 

He recently had been trying get in touch with me

Little backstory, I have 5 siblings. I’m the youngest. I moved out when I was 18. I grew up with two of them, Jerry (26) and Naomi (28) while rest of my brothers were all grown up and moved out when I was a baby. 

Two years ago we had a reunion recently after I moved to a different state, I was in my old hometown where my other two siblings, who lived out of state too, were in town with their family too. So Jerry hits me up and tells me that we’re getting together for dinner and hang out at my brother’s house with Naomi and her family. I agreed and was pretty excited since it had been over 5 years at that time since we’ve been all together like that. 

Fast forward later to the evening, my brothers, sister and their families all drank as we chatted at the dinner table. 

Here’s the part where an important detail comes in. I’m deaf and the only one in the family. However, all of my siblings knows sign language due to growing up with me. 

I missed major of the conversation and I was feeling quite frustrated that I had to ask them over and over again like I’m some pestering 5 year old, “what are you guys talking about? What’s funny?” And every time I try to initiate conversation with them, I get ignored or interrupted and ignored in mid sentence and they continue talking to each other, excluding me. 

I got all of sudden super depressed and my body kind of gave away and I passed out on the couch in a deep depression slumber. 

I woke up four hours later to all of my siblings crowding over me, taking goofy pictures and I told them to fuck off and just made up some excuse that I was tired from work. 

I went back to home later that week and hadn’t thought about it again until a year later in my therapy. I realized what my siblings had done that brought a lot of hurt and unresolved feelings and being left out like that which I had thought would stop once we moved out of the toxic home we grew up in. 

Jerry was my roommate for a year when I first moved out, so we generally have a brotherly bond and get along. We were usually drama free. He however like my other siblings has the worst awareness (internal and external). He (#4) and bro #1 are the only two of my siblings that ever reach out to me to keep in touch.  

Recently he texted me again and asked if this was my number still, and I never replied. I don’t think I’m going to. 

So he had no idea how I felt. Nor does my other siblings (who never talk to me). 

I had decided to abruptly cut off all my communication with my siblings since I had been the one who always reached out except for Jerry and brother #1. I hated being the doormat of communication. 

The incident had left me feeling like they didn’t care of me in the ways I had expected of them as siblings, especially the ones I grew up with.

He kept asking me to come out late at night when I didn't want to. I said I wasn't interested, didn't want to go out but he kept asking me. I turned him down. He stopped that later, but then kept asking me to call him. He seemed to get annoyed when I said no, and said his friends pressure him to come out all the time but he does it cause ""that's what friends do"" and that I should do it to ""make friends happy."" I felt so bad.

&#x200B;

A day later, we spoke. Convo turned about me dying my hair back when I was 17. I sent a pic of myself blonde and 17 to show him. It was a simple, normal convo. Then he suddenly said, verbatim (I have the texts. I can PM pics) ""It looks like I can sell your 17 year old blond pic to a Japanese guy for like a few hundred dollars lol."" I wasn't sure if he was joking or what, and I admit, I did freak out. He then admitted he was joking and that he just found me cute at 17. The texts go as followed:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Him: You know how Japan has a thing for younger girls

Me: Why would you do that? Are you joking?

Him: Since you are younger in the picture. Yea I don't know any Japanese guys But I feel like-

Me: If you do that, I'll fucking kill you. I'm serious.

Him: Japan loves when young girls take pics

Me: I've been sexually harassed for pics before. Don't. Joke.

Him: I don't sell pictures.

Me: I don't like the way you joke man. Do you seriously talk and joke like this to others? Cause to me, it's not funny.

Him: Just saying You look like a model in your pic

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Well, that's just a part of it. He said he didn't know how to compliment my underage pic and that he found me cute at 17. I'm not sure why he had to say it like that and make this joke instead of just saying: ""You look nice"" or something along those lines. Another thing is that he sent me pics of him hanging out at a spot, with full bags of weed (We’re in NY). I'm talking BAGS. I have nothing against pot smokers but I felt very off. The joke, the pics of weed, him asking me to hang out so late and to call him, using his example of his own friend pressuring him to do things to convince me to do things made me worried. Today, he texted me and told me, ""Hey just wanted to say. even though you couldn't take a joke, you don't have the right to tell me something is off with me.""

I blocked him after I said I don't want to be his friend anymore. I'm honestly scared of him now. Maybe I did overreact. I'm worried he will come after me now, spread rumors or find me at college.

My daughter is 23 and I am 41, I am her father. Yes I had her young with my wife but that's not the point. My wife and I now live in a decent place and live on our own with our own stable jobs.

Recently(in the last couple of years) my daughter has been acting, for lack of a better term, completely shitty towards men that she dates. She will date a guy for a few weeks, wait til he can provide something major for her and then just break up with them. I'm all for her exploring herself and dating around and bringing guys over; honestly I could not care less.

One night about last week I was sitting with my wife on the couch at about midnight and we assumed our daughter had gone to bed at this point because she had 2 exams the next day. In confidence I voiced my concerns to my wife about my daughter's attitude towards the guys she dates and I wasn't very nice about it. I never called her names or anything but I said her behavior was deplorable and shitty and that I feel bad for any guy that wants to date her right now because of the things she does. My wife agreed with what I was saying and we left it at that but I guess my daughter was awake and heard what I said and now she won't talk to me. My wife is now backpedaling and saying I was an asshole for voicing these concerns because she's ""exploring her life"", which would be fair I suppose but it's the things she does that honestly set me off. I have a few examples.

1. She dated a guy for 3 weeks until she convinced him to co-sign a car for her then promptly dumped him within the week
2. She was having trouble with her computer so she ""dated a guy who knows that shit"" and then dumped him right after
3. She had a fight with us about something unrelated one night so she needed a place to stay. She proceeded to find some guy friend she knew and stayed at his place for about three weeks while claiming she wanted something serious with him and then dumped him when we hashed out our stuff and told her she could come home

This is only from the last 8 months.

I will agree the guys she dates are suckers for falling for that shit but she seeks these men out and takes advantage of their kindness in order to fuck them over and I'm just flabbergasted that the daughter I raised turned out to be such a horrible human being. My daughter hasn't talked to me in a week and is planning her next ""getaway"" I assume at this point but now that my wife and daughter had a talk my wife is starting to take her side in this.

I'm not saying she's skanky or *anything* like that, I just want her to be a decent human being and not mess with people's emotions like this. Am I the asshole for voicing my concerns to my wife and having my daughter accidentally overhear? I was planning on having an actual sit-down talk with my daughter the next day after getting my wife on board but at this point I'm not sure what to do."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

Sorry for the format (first post and mobile so rip)

I was watching game 5  of the NBA finals with some friends (It was discord with a bunch of friends) and after the game I jokingly said 
""I rather break up with my gf than watching that game ever again""

My friends started messaging her about it to mess with me

I thought it wasn't a big deal (I was immensely wrong)

Since she was sleeping the messages piled up so the appeared all at once and the joke (MAY) have taken it out context

I understand completely where she is coming from

I apologized because I regretted what I said

She 2 days later is still mad at me (Which is ok)

But since whe are a bit long distance we only see eachohter once or twice during summer if lucky

She told me she wasn't gonna see me through summer to teach me a lesson

We don't have a lot of free time  so that means o wont see her for a long time

AITA for this joke
 Like is it really that bad

P.S.

We've been together for almost 2 years and every thing has gone really amazing other than few bumps here and there

"So, because I'm a minor, and my parents haven't gone grocery shopping yet, the most I can make out of an empty pantry and fridge is plain pasta.  That lasts me about two days. My dad doesn't really cook, and my mum gets home too late most nights to make a family dinner, so everyone kind of just eats what's around. It's Wednesday night, I've eaten pasta for two days, and I fell like literal shit because I have had nothing of nutritional value. So I call my mum. Since it's Wednesday, the grocery store near my mum's work has a 50% off deal on sushi, and it's pretty good, I ask if she can get some for me, she says yes and that she'll be home in two hours. I get pretty excited because, you know, food, and two hours later she comes home with a leftover's box. Inside is seafood fettuccine alfredo. AKA more pasta. She says that she thought I might like this better, because she know I like fettuccine alfredo, and she had some leftover from her lunch. I though, ok, no big deal, I'll just eat the seafood part, but there is no seafood part, it's all gone, now it's just pasta. I thank her and just put it in the fridge before trying to get back to my room.

She asks why I'm not eating it.

I told her that, since it's summer, and I've eaten pasta for my last three meals, I asked for sushi so I could have some semblance of nutrients (and something that's not steaming hot). She says, oh, I didn't think our leftover pasta from yesterday would go that far. She says sorry, and I just go back to my room, where I'm now writing this post. Am I the asshole for not eating what she brought me?

Edit: For those asking, I do in fact know how to cook, I'm actually quite good at it (I also enjoy baking), it's just the lack of ingredients that play a key, and my parents constant working which means we don't go shopping often :(

I decided to play some video games before going to sleep for about 20 minutes. My brother came home from hanging out with his friend, and starts asking me too come outside. I said no, because I wanted to play for 20 minutes and sleep, but he wasn’t having any of it. He started cussing me out in front of my parents, (who did nothing), and calling me a lazy slob.

Ok no big deal because I’ve done it before, but I usually let everyone know when I’m going to do it just as a warning. He didn’t. I try to log back in but it’s saying wrong passcode, so I went into the living room to type in the password from the box. I noticed the box was put in a weird place on the floor but left it there cause he must’ve had a reason for leaving it there. My stepdad came in and said “what are you doing?” And I told him I was putting in the password. I went to walk in my room and he says “You’re just gonna leave it there?” I answer “what? I just thought you left it there for a reason.” He responds with (in an attitude) “Are you really that lazy you can’t even move the box?!” I say it again “No, I just figured YOU left it there for a reason” He raises his voice and says “ That’s not what I’m saying, Is that where the box usually goes?” At this point I repeat what I had been saying and he cuts me off “no no just shut up is that where it usually is?” I reply with a bigger attitude (accidentally) “No.” He starts yelling at me for getting an attitude with him about not moving the box he left and was too lazy to put up.

About half the people didn't show up with art supplies, despite being given almost a week notice that, hey buy your art supplies and be ready.

Nobody asked me for a piece at first so it got me thinking and I decided to say no if someone did. When we started our second drawing a girl tried to ask me for a piece. I'm technically legally deaf so at first I didn't realize she was talking to me, she was also kinda behind me and spoke in a soft voice. 

At the same time she asked and I realized she meant me, I was getting up to do something. My hair is sorta long so I also didn't see her and was sprinting away. It wasn't until I was walking back to grab something it finally clicked so I just pretended not to hear her.

Another girl, sitting in front of me, asked to borrow my pencil and I gave it to her. Pretty sure paper girl saw.

I know I should've just said no and not pretended but I was high key hoping she'd ask someone else after I left the first time. 

It got me thinking more, WIBTA if I said no outloud to the paper? Its 18x24 and a pad is about 25ish dollars. I barely have enough money as is. The professor jokinglyish suggested that the borrowers pay money to the lenders, and someone did joke wanting .50cents. But in all honesty I would want the money.

I know it's a stupid thing to get upset over but he does this all the time. Talking shit about things that I like even though they are stupid and childish sometimes. Another example is when I was playing a video game from my childhood and he wouldn't shut up about how bad it was. Objectively, yes it's bad but I feel like something that is so special to me is off limits to his harsh critiques and judgements. There are many more examples of this and it's probably small and petty but I get very annoyed when he does it and then he gets mad at me for being petty. Am I the asshole? Should I just accept that he is speaking objectively and not trying to hurt my feelings, I have told him that it does but he shrugs it off tells me that it is just me being childish.

c016tm	2019-06-13 04:13:27		AITA for letting my friend fail our semester final?	"This happened 6 years ago when I was still at university, but I can’t stop wondering.

I (21M at the time) had a friend (21M)  at university and we would spend almost all of our time together. We had the same classes and same friend group, and we would do homework and study together. He was my best friend.

We ended up failing our major together (we would end up playing CoD together for hours instead of studying) and had to change our majors in order to graduate on time. This bad studying habit had to change, and I really did not want to graduate late to the eternal disappointment of my parents. Over the course of a few months, I got increasingly and increasingly irritated at my friend, because he would continue to play games at my place while I actually studied. There were multiple times when I pulled an all nighter as I watched him play games until he fell asleep at like 4am, and then bomb the quiz or whatever the next day. 

It wasn’t really clear before, but he wasn’t my roommate. We had separate apartments but he would often stay over at mine when we studied. 

Eventually I straight up told him that I think we should study separately, and he agreed. To his credit, he never got upset with me and completely understood the situation and why I was bothered. Which just made me feel more guilty, honestly.

Because I knew he always woke up late from his sleep schedule, I told him that I would call him every morning before our 8am class to make sure he was awake, and that I would wait until 7:40 at our designated meeting spot. If he did not show up, I would continue on to class by myself. This was how it was for a couple of weeks, but a few days before our final I told him I wasn’t going to call anymore, because more and more often he would sleep in and not show up. However, I decided I would still wait until the designated time. Again, he completely understood and apologized, and I could tell he felt ashamed, which just made me feel worse.

So the day of the final arrives, and as usual I wait for him at our spot. He doesn’t show up. I knew he had slept through his alarm, and I thought to call him. But I stuck with what we agreed on and continued to class alone. My friend never showed up.

He failed the class, which meant he would graduate a semester late. I remember feeling guilty for causing his parents more financial burden. It would have taken me no time at all to just call him. I know I have the moral protection for choosing not to, because he’s an adult and can make his own choices. But it really would have been just as easy to give him a call, because he’s my best friend. Wouldn’t a friend do that?

We stopped being friends the following semester because I felt too ashamed of what I had done. And once again, he never was upset with me for what I did, he completely understood. Anyway, maybe what I did was “right”, but AITA for not being his friend and calling him before our final?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I met a guy on bumble he's from NJ im from NY, somehow we matched, cause i guess we crossed paths at some point.  The relationship between us was kind of crazy from the start, crazy in the fact that I saw his profile when I was at the casino with my family joking around with my cousins.. like LOL look at this guy he says hes a demisexual... I knew what the term meant I just thought it was stupid he put it in his bio and its probably a way to lure in girls. He also put in his political views  So I was in the mood to be a bumble troll and basically stir the pot with this guy. surprisingly im not asking if im the asshole with him but for my mom..  I straight up knew I was being a asshole to him in the beginning, I had no intention for genuinely liking him, thought he was a tool lol.

anyway the conversation took a bizarre turn and he was into me disagreeing with him, and questioning him and I was into the fact that he wasn't a ""soy boy."" as i called him multiple times... haha anyway fast forward a couple months we went months without really being sexual with eachother we developed care throughout these months of talking online (phone, facetime, Text) For a brief amount of time maybe a month, i stopped talking to him as much said I had liked another guy closer to me and because of the distance, it just wasn't  going to work out but I'd love to be friends. So after me and the guy broke up me and bumble boy start talking frequently again, still keeping the friend mentality. After awhile (Not even just saying this.)  I said something along the lines of thinking about him sexually. he is taken back but ultimately reciprocates. We go back and forth exploring this concept bc its new for us to be on this level.  (photos, sexting) basically I forgot to log out of my damn messenger and my mom sees bumble boys dick my mom is very religious believes you cant even really think about a guy in this way until marriage.. she goes on about how she knew he was a pervert and its annoying because thats literally her backing up her claim that ""Brazilians are all about sex."" then i literally just flat out say, I started this so its not just him. she then calls me a pervert starts saying i'll never be happy with him to ask God about it bc its wrong whatever.. im fucking sick of her i mean if i was a mom and i saw my consenting daughters sexts by ""accident."" id log out at this point, my belief is that this is really none of her business as its not affecting her really, i understand where shes coming from i do, ive done stupid shit with men, beyond shagging them on the first date stuff involving drugs.. i really dont agree with my drug use in the past, she is right about this.

He is being very unforgiving about the TV and at this point I'm lucky to get it and hour a day before he says ""I want on"" and rips the remote from me. We do not have our own rooms or a good space for another TV so it's his TV or I have to share TV with my dad upstairs and his cop shows and fox news (which I do not enjoy) I feel as if he bought a new TV and replaced the old one to hold it over my head as I do not have a good alternative speaking it's the TV or my phone. I want to start telling him no to the remote of I have only been on it am hour or so as once he gets the remote he rarely gives it up.

c013ov	2019-06-13 04:03:34	faded_alive	AITA Being angry when I found out that my father paid for my cousin's university+housing	"This happened years ago, but I only found out recently when I had a conversation with my cousin. She's the same age as me, and the daughter of my father's younger brother. Apparently my father paid her rent+tuition for all four years of university, plus random expenses she accrued, like her holidays abroad and clothing, etc, because she went to the same university as he did. She didn't have to pay him back anything. 

I chose a different school, one farther away from my parents. I worked two part-time jobs on campus + worked for a professor to support myself the whole time. I didn't get a single penny from my parents. I lived in a mouse-infested house with no AC and weird black mold. I kept getting sick with awful coughs that wouldn't go away and having to go see the school doctors. There were some weeks where I could only afford to eat ""pasta"" -- boiled noodles and the cheap pasta sauce that comes in those huge containers. So, not a great time overall. 

I didn't know my cousin was getting everything paid for. She didn't know I had to pay for everything myself. She still doesn't. So she made this offhand remark and I had her clarify. I called my dad and he told me that I don't have any right to be angry, because if I'd done what he wanted me to do and gone to the right school, he'd have paid for me as well.

Edit to add: I should also mention that my father paid for my brother's schooling as well, even though my brother didn't go to the right school. They actually 'borrowed' money from me to pay off some of his tuition. (But he lived very frugally and had a low allowance.) The money was never returned (I don't mind because he's my brother and I love him). Also, that cousin's family made fun of my brother for years for having Asperger's. They would call him crazy, etc. My mother hates them. I hate them for what they said about my brother and making him avoid family reunions. He taught us to be frugal and never waste money. Our family never travelled abroad. My cousin did every year she was in school, paid for by my dad. My parents had two old Hondas. My cousin got a new Lexus for her 21st birthday. My mother bought us clothes from Goodwill because new clothes were just too expensive. My cousin went on shopping trips for brand name items. My parents taught us to not spend lavishly, but then my dad goes and spends all this money on a girl whose parents regularly mocked my brother's Asperger's so that my brother avoided family reunions. He was bullied in school, then to get bullied by relatives, and then to have my dad just throw money at one of these relatives?

Update after I called my mom and woke her up (sorry mom I'll make up for it! ): It was a really short phone call, I guess because there wasn't much to say and she wanted to go back to bed. She told me the whole thing had NOTHING to do with my choice of school. None. Or me. It was because my dad didn't think it was fair for her to cut off my cousin's family for how they treated my brother. (Remember, my brother has Asperger's, and they called him crazy right in front of my mom's face, right in front of me, on social media, etc. just because he was socially awkward and shy around people. My cousin's family thinks issues like autism or depression, etc. are signs of low willpower, and picking on someone mentally different will encourage them to act 'normal'. My father also believes this, and when I went away to uni, he used to berate my brother for hours to correct his behaviour, and it used to make my brother self-harm. No one told me, even when I went home for holidays, or I would have taken my brother and left and let him live in my mouse and mold-infested shithole of an apartment with me. At least there he would have been protected and loved. Anyways, my dad, to spite my mom, decided to do something that would really upset her, which was to pay 100% for my cousin's school years.

Mystery solved, I can sleep in peace now without worrying about grinding my teeth out. I'm going to give my brother a call too just to tell him how much I love him. But tomorrow. Waking my mom up in the middle of the night was enough assholery on my end for one day.

**Morning update:** I can't reply anymore since I'll be at work. Thank you all for the responses. I've been given a lot to think about.

**In response to some questions and responses that keep coming up:**  
1. I need to clarify that I was 17 when I went to university. My birthday's very late in the year, and schooling in my province is/was birth year dependent, at least when I was enrolled.  
2. I do want to look into getting 23 and me done on myself and my cousin, because it would be nice to be certain she isn't my half-sister, but I'm not quite sure how I'd get her to do it with me. We aren't friends. We just happened to bump into each other and then there was uncomfortable chitchat.  
3. The money was from my parents' joint account. My mom made significantly more than my dad. So it wasn't 'his' money, it was 'their' money he was spending on someone she disliked.  
4. I've spoken with my husband and we won't be allowing my dad to be part of our family or circle of acquaintances anymore."	Not enough info	0	0	95.0	15.0	0.0	0.0
c013k7	2019-06-13 04:03:13	aitafat	AITA for admitting to watching porn after telling my SO to hit the gym?	"Hi. 
My SO and I got into a fight because I tried to encourage him to join me for a workout (we do this on and off). He gained some weight, has commented on it himself and had wanted to go today after a (two?) week long break. So in the morning, [he got upset](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aiawtz/aita_for_telling_my_so_shes_making_excuses_to/) about my pushing (after some ""just say what you actually mean!"", I confirmed I did notice a difference in his body). Afterwards, he said he gets wanting a fit boyfriend but he felt I [wouldn’t love him if he got fat](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bed9ao/aita_for_saying_no_when_my_gf_asked_if_id_find/). I said I would definitely still love him, but due to my lower libido and his high sex drive, the gap between our libidos could potentially grow wider.

In turn, he told me our sex life was already unsatisfying because I had been rejecting him and should initiate more. Indeed. I can have sex every day, but BJs every night and every morning (when I’m groggy) have been difficult for me. I said I would work on it and that I’d forbid myself from watching porn, which I had been doing on _some_ of the 3 nights a week we spend separately. 

Edit: the frequency of non-BJ sex has been lower lately. I had an infection which was preventing it to an extent + we haven’t been seeing each other as much. So that’s mostly on me and it’s why I said I would try to improve.

He flipped out:

> Making comments about my weight and then saying you have a low libido and then going home to watch porn with hot buff dudes on it and then saying your libido will be lower if I gain weight is fucked up all while you’re watching porn and complaining about having sex with me, then gooing and watching porn.

I don’t even watch it much and I only mentioned ceasing it as a proposed solution.

Side note: I had previously suggested I would not come most of the time during sex. Perfectly happy with this, I get joy from him coming and always enjoy bottoming for him. I mostly let him have his way with me whenever he wants unless there are technical issues with bottoming. He said he’d stop delaying coming during BJs, which I appreciated, and he’d be glad to give me oral instead. Overall I'm pleased, but he feels like he's bothering me.

c012rz	2019-06-13 04:01:12		WIBTA if I say I don’t want anything to do with my girlfriend’s friend?	"We’re both girls, this is a gay relationship.

My girlfriend is in the military. Apparently she met this guy, “Brett”, very early in her career and he was much nicer to her than anyone else there. They have been friends ever since, about 2 years. Brett is an outgoing guy who has a house (rare in military) so his house is a hangout spot.

My girlfriend and I rarely fight, but we have had quite a few fights regarding Brett. He’s her closest friend in the circle. I was asking her why she would want to be friends with someone like that and worried that she was like him when I wasn’t around. She would deny this and state that he’s moving to Florida soon, and that she doubts they’ll stay in touch, so she doesn’t want to fight about him. I said I was fine with that. The topic was dropped for a long time. 

I want to emphasize that I like literally every other friend she has. Her ex, the guy who has a crush on her, everybody. No issues with her going out. She jokes that I have nerves of steel, yet I can’t stand Brett. Some reasons: 

1. Brett and his wife are extremely misogynistic and very loud about it. He’s constantly making “jokes” about women and mocking both of us. One of his favorites is that I’m not really in medical school because women can’t be doctors. His wife doesn’t believe women should vote, and he thinks men should control all finances. My girlfriend routinely says he’s very misogynistic when he isn’t around. 

2. He is extremely obnoxious and almost always offensive. Not two minutes goes by (not an exaggeration) without another “joke” about women, gay people, muslims, “libtards”, etc. Many of their friends say he’s an asshole, including my girlfriend. He has been like this since the second he met me. 

3. He has cheated on his wife and got caught. 

4. My girlfriend is bi but has lied and told him that she’s a lesbian. He has hit on her anyway. She continues to hide her sexuality from him.

5. My girlfriend got sexually harassed in front of him while I was out of town, and he defended the harasser instead of her. The harasser was very gross and making comments about how he’d love to fuck her, etc. My girlfriend was also very upset about this, but defended “Brett” by saying that she once offered him sex when she was wasted and he said she was too drunk and refused. I just felt more disgusted knowing she considered sleeping with Brett. 

There are more reasons but these are the main ones. Since he’s in Florida, I was hoping they really would lose touch. However, he seems to be very persistently trying to reach out. 

My girlfriend and I are planning a trip to Disney World, my happy place. I’ve long said that I would love to take her there for the first time. She told Brett that we could meet up in Florida and go to Disney as a group. I’m really upset and considering telling her that I want nothing to do with Brett.
