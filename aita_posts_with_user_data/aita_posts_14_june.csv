c0t5cm	2019-06-15 03:55:43		AITA for kicking kids off my lawn?	"I live in a corner house in your typical middle class subdivision. People are always walking across my lawn, mostly kids cutting through walking home from school. People also let their dogs pee and crap in my lawn near the curb. It's super annoying, but that's not the issue here.

I work from home and I go to check my mail in the middle of the day. There's a group of 8-10 kids just sitting in the middle of my lawn. I recognize most of the kids, a few who live 2 houses down. I assume the rest also live in the neighborhood or are friends of the kids I recognize. They're all sitting there hanging out, not even near the curb/street but smack dab in the middle of my front yard.  There's also 2 bicycles parked next to our single tree in the front. I gave them all an annoyed look and said something like ""can y'all move to the street....this is my lawn. Also, please move your bicycles."" They moved (they weren't super quick or apologetic about it, but they did move to the street. Unfortunately our neighborhood does not have sidewalks)

They weren't being destructive or doing anything annoying other than sitting in my front yard...but I don't want them there. I feel it should be up to me who hangs out on my property. Also they could go to one of their own houses? I get that it's summer and they're kids and there's not much to do. But at the same time, that's not my problem. Maybe I'm just old, but if my parents had caught me and my friends sitting in the middle of someone else's lawn in the neighborhood, they would have chewed me out and told me not to go on other people's property without being invited.

Also, I really don't think this should matter... but in case it does- the kids in the scenario were all black and I'm white. The racial makeup of the neighborhood is about 50/50 white/black. I honestly think I would be annoyed by any large group of kids congregating on my lawn (not just passing through, that's fine) regardless of race. So...am I the asshole for kicking kids off my lawn?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I have played probably around 7 games with them in total, and, each game, either this one friend has won or he’s gotten to the point where we couldn’t possibly beat him so we just say that he’s won and end the game. We just started a new game and one of the other players and myself decided to team up against him because we can not beat him alone. He knows a lot of the ins and outs of the games and we know barely anything. Despite this, he’s still clearly ahead of us. 

The problem is that he’s pissed at us for teaming up and is trying to compare it to him teaming up with another player. I tried explaining that we’re only teaming up because it gives us a more even playing field and that him teaming up would just make his lead on us even stronger. He thinks I’m being stupid.

Suzy loves to hang out with us and party. She likes to drink and will have way too many.  In Oct., she fell out here at our place (her knee actually gave out...she didn't even have one beer). That resulted in us having to call 911 because it was a serious injury.

The last time she came to hang out with us, it was the anniversary of her husband's death and also her son was being a jerk to her and not letting her see her grandchildren. Suzy was upset the entire day. She didn't drink much (like, two beers). And she went home early. Her daughter (who lives in Suzy's house with her own family) emailed me and told me she HATED how her mother came home in an upset mood that day.

Now, Suzy is not ""allowed"" to come and visit us anymore at all unless she can spend the night.  Like I said, my fiance and I live with his parents. We have an apartment in the basement with a spare bedroom. With Suzy's history of her knee going and and being prone to falling, we don't want her to spend the night and try to get down the steps. Fiance and I feel it would be an invasion of his parents' privacy letting her spend every Friday night here. So, we've been making excused up to Suzy about my fiance's niece spending the weekends here and using our spare room in our apartment. 

Now, Suzy thinks we're assholes for not letting her stay. We think that with the age difference (despite us all being close friends), her being prone to accidents, etc. that it would be best for her to find a retirement community to live in to socialize with other people. And also, if Suzy was permitted to stay the night, she would want to get drunk...worsening the chances of her falling. We don't want her hurt and we don't want to upset my fiance's parents.

We recently purchased a house together, got a dog, essentially ""checked the boxes off"" etc. (We wanted to wait until we both graduated from college before getting married, she already graduated with a bachelor's degree and has a great job, I'm nearly finished with my masters degree).
My father is retiring after 40 years from a ""big 3"" car company and is having a rather large retirement party (70+ people easily) at a relatives lake house. 

This past winter I had mentioned to my parents that I decided I wanted to propose this summer. They both thought it was a great idea as they adore my girlfriend just as much as I do, she is amazing. I figured a weekend getaway to where i first asked her out 7 years ago would be my proposal opportunity, until I just spoke to my father a few days ago.

He suggested I propose at his retirement party, where all of our friends and family will be joining us. Now in my eyes, that's his day, he has worked his ass off his entire life for our family and he deserves to be recognized for it. I don't want the parties excitement to switch from him to us.

But the more I think about it, it really would be the absolute perfect time to propose, as everyone we care about will be there. I'm having the hardest time with this decision. He deserves this day and recognition, but I know he wants me to propose so we can all celebrate together as my father and I are very close. 

So, WIBTA??

Edit: Thank you all for your opinions, I have alot of thinking to do, but have decided not to do it during his retirement party. As many of you commented, I do not want to put my girlfriend on the spot in front of so many people, it's unfair to her, I believe she would like a more personal proposal. Perhaps with a photographer hiding to get images of the moment, I'm sure she would like that."	No A-holes here	0	0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0sygx	2019-06-15 03:33:19	heccinscaryshit	AITA for cutting my losses with my best friend?	"I have a friend (E) who has been very close to me for about a year now. I care about her a lot, and I always thought she did too. Up until a couple of months ago, we were inseparable, but then she got to know some of my friends, and started spending time with them. For reasons that are too long and complicated to explain here, I felt like my friends were trying to pull her away from me. The last thing I wanted to do was to be a controlling friend, so I forced myself to (for lack of a better word) let her spend time with them. She knew it bugged me, and assured me that I was her closest friend and that she wasn't going to ""replace me."" 
Fast forward to a few weeks ago, and I come to find that she and my friends have a group chat without me. In the next couple of days I was riding a bus home with my friend, and he has his phone out and he's texting her and the other guys. I ask him what's up, and he shows me their conversation in which E is setting something up for all if them to come over and bake cookies. ""She's begging us to come over tonight so I guess I'm doing that,"" says my friend. The next week, the same thing happens. At this point, I start thinking, ""damn, shes really enthusiastic about having everyone come over. I wonder when the last time she was so excited to hang out with me was."" So I go looking back through our conversations, and I discover that not only had she never been the one to suggest plans, she was also scarcely the first to initiate conversation. It was right about 10:1. 
At this point I was feeling really shitty, because I felt like I never actually mattered that much to her, so I decided to try something. Now, I'm generally not the kind of person to ""test"" a friend, and I definitely didn't want to be the kind of person who expects others to read their minds, but I decided I was going to stop making an effort to talk or hang out with her. I wasn't going to cut her out, ignore her, be rude to her, or avoid her, I just wasn't going to be the one to suggest plans or start up a conversation. Now, lo and behold, it has been over six days since I last spoke to her. Not a single word over text or in person. And upon spending time with my other friends, I see her constantly striking up conversation, suggesting plans, or sending memes.
In general, I feel like there's no way I'm in the wrong here, but every once in a while I get a nagging, painful feeling that I'm the one ending our friendship by not making an effort, and that I'm losing my best friend over a petty test.
Are those feelings justified, or should I accept that we aren't close anymore?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Dogs aren't allowed in the apartment complex besides mine (I have mine written into my lease).

Basically there are 3 units in my house. I have the bottom unit and there are two up above. One of the upstairs neighbors is letting her brother and his gf ""watch"" the apartment until it's up for lease in August. I like them fine but they've brought their puppy. He screams when they aren't around. I have plenty of audio of the dog being a nuisance. It's constant. And when they are around they play loud music that I can hear... but that's just a complaint, not the point of my post.

This dog screams incessantly until they come back. I used to think he'd tire but he doesn't. 

I'm not even mad at the dog, I just want the owners to treat him/train him better.

Recently one of my friends has been sending me memes and asking for my reaction to them. They always have an anti LGBT slant to them, even if some of them are funny (personally I think most are low effort shit post memes).

Every time he asks for my reaction he asks if he can screenshot my response to them and send them to other friends. This has made me feel like Ive become a spectacle to them. It feels like they send these to me to get a rise out of me. Usually I just say I don't like them or that they are low effort and move on. 

However I finally got sick of this and snapped at my friend. I told him it feels like they are just trying to upset me to laugh at my reactions. He said that in reading into it too much and he wants to see people's reaction to things. He used an example of our other friend that is into politics and how he sends him political memes to see that friends reaction. 

(The most recent one was the clip from MW2 where you shoot up an airport and it was titled ""me and my homies rolling up to the pride parade"") 

I told him that being gay isn't an interest of mine that it's something I can't change about myself. I also asked why he only sends negative gay memes and he claims that he never finds good memes that involve gay people. 

This has made me really upset and it makes me really not wanna talk to him anymore and he says that I just can't take a joke and that I've changed since coming out.

"So, today a friend of mine from work was presenting his graduation project at his university. It being a big project, the only people allowed to watch the presentation were the ones invited by him and his group. I helped them with some parts of the project, got paid for that (it's not forbidden to hire people for some parts related to design and stuff, their teachers knew I was doing it for them), so I was one of the people invited.

Turns out, another person from work also got paid to do another part for them, and it happens to be the girl I have a HUGE crush on. She has a boyfriend, and I used to get along really well with her, but eventually I decided it was best for me to just stay out of reach. Anyway: I'm really good friends with my friend that was presenting the project, so he told me I didn't have to watch the thing if I didn't want to, given that I had already helped a lot. I said to him I was only going because there were few people invited and thus the girl's bf wouldn't be there.

So I'm in the room, along with some more people from work that were invited as well, and said girl shows up with her boyfriend, and they also sit just behind me. I immediately start having an anxiety attack. Normally, I would just stay there being miserable, but the same friend told me once that I was much of a people-pleaser, and had to be more selfish in my decisions in order to prevent unnecessary suffering. Then I thought I had already done my part in helping him, and that it wasn't crucial for me to be there today, in a situation that wasn't comfortable at all. So I just got up as soon as the girl and the bf sat behind me, I approached my friend and said to him something like ""Listen, I gotta go, we'll talk later but I'm cheering for you"", and just left.

I kinda feel bad about leaving like that, but I also know that I would be feeling way worse if I stayed. So, am I the asshole?"	No A-holes here	0	0	31.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

WHY I don't want to give $100: I don't want my Dad to be **reliant**  on me. For the past 3 months he would ask me ""Hey did you get your tip  money yet?"" I say yes. He asks if I can give him $40 because of blah  blah blah. I would give him my tip money. This is happened consistently.  He would always say ""I promise this is the last time"" or his voice  would get all soft and shit. It's not genuine at all and it annoys the  fuck out of me. This time it's $100 and what's next? You see what I  mean?

I  don't mind spending money on others at all. I help my mom pay for  bills, I buy food for friends, etc. But on my Dad it just feels wrong **every time.**

WHY  he wants me to give him $100: Because his shifts are shorter now so his  income is definitely a lot less. He says he'll pay me back the $100  once he gets his next payroll.

I  just don't want to give my Dad anymore money. He's ALWAYS been stingy  about money and puts his financial health above all else. Do I love my  Dad? Yes. But do I hate his personality and who he is? Oh hell yes. My  Mom doesn't even like him. He's not abusive or anything, he's just a  coward and a pussy.

Anyways  he literally asked me 30 minutes ago and I'm just a little pissed.  Maybe my though process will be different tomorrow and I just want the  opinion of some random internet strangers. Also I'm 19 years old so I'm  still immature as fuck. I don't know maybe this post was a mistake and  I'm just over reacting.

My friend Cal (18m) was/is the driver and we were on the way to pick up our two friends Kay and Niyah (both 17f). Kay, Niyah, and I (17m) have been friends for about 5 years and Cal has been our friend for 3. We were on the way to pick them up and go to Dutch Bros to hang out while drinking rebels and catch up. Cal and I just recently graduated high school while Kay and Niyah are going into their senior years. They both have boyfriends (hint: not us) but we're all close and the boyfriends are chill. We walk in and their father says ""Here comes the side niggas"" before even a greeting from anyone. That comment was the latest in a string of snide barbs and quips he'd made over the last few weeks and we had it with that. 
             We walked out, went to the car, and left. Kay and Niyah both started laughing hella hard along with the rest of the room (15+ people) as we were walking out and that made us more mad because we thought our friends would've had our backs when their dad said something that disrespectful. Where we probably turned to the AHs was the fact we didn't explicitly say we were leaving. We just walked out without saying anything. 
              As Cal and I pulled into the parking lot of the diner we decided to go to instead, they call us asking where we went. We said where we went and they got mad. We then get into an argument in the group chat we're all in about why we did what we did and the two arguments were basically them saying that what he said shouldn't have led to them being left and us abruptly cancelling our plans with Cal and I arguing that their dads comment was extremely disrespectful and that due to all the previous comments he made, it was just the straw that broke the camel's back.

c0suoe	2019-06-15 03:20:49		AITA for hiding my 2nd pregnancy from my parents?	"So  I'm currently incubating my 2nd child and halfway done at 20 weeks. I'm very visibly pregnant.

Important backstory: I have a very bad relationship with my controlling parents. I ran away from home at 19 to get my drivers license, get my first job, and become a REAL adult, not just locked in my room all day.  They shunned me for this and still refuse to acknowledge that I am grown up and doing my own thing. 

I shortly met my husband and almost a year later got engaged to him, right after the engagement we found out we were expecting despite me having confirmation from multiple doctors that I couldnt. We told my parents quickly because I was hoping I could draw some support for them but they were very angry and would always call my child ""it"" or ""the fetus"" up until she was born but loved on her once they met her. They wouldn't allow me to announce having her though to family and the whole thing was a very shameful experience. It hurt me deeply that they didnt want me to be happy about our baby. 

During my pregnancy they would always get ahold of my bills before me and pay them. So there was a financial manipulation aspect as well. Everytime something would happen with either the baby or our wedding they would just magically take care of it and make it go away. I NEVER asked them for ANYTHING though. I still paid many expenses myself for my wedding and child, and we could have taken care of it on our own as well. 

Fast forward to the beginning of this year: I was on birth control and happened to get pregnant again. We were definitely a little less happy this time. But I want them nonetheless. I havent told my parents yet, and have been avoiding family events and limiting seeing them because I dont want to tell them or deal with the bullcrap they will have to say. A friend was recently asking about this and despite knowing my backstory she said I was being a selfish asshole. 

Fathers day is coming up and I wasnt planning on going to that family event either. I dont really have a plan on when to tell them but I figured I'd eventually just let them draw the conclusion. However my friend really believes that I'm going to ruin my relationship with my parents even more and even my husband is starting to say the same. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So when I get home at 5:10 PM, she screams “Oh shit! Motherf***er!” And runs out the door and drives to some appointment she has. She then blames me for her almost being late to some appointment and that she hadn’t eaten all day. Then she said that she spoke to family and set a dinner for tomorrow, when I already had plans during that were set months ago, and she’s tryin to guilt trip me for all this stuff. My question is, am I the asshole? I can give some more details if needed in the comments, I just want some advice; I am tired from work and don’t know how to feel. Please help.

I came home after a long day of work, super excited for the weekends. I noticed that my mum had cleaned out my room (mopped,sweeped etc) , which obviously i’m ever so grateful for. But, i noticed this particular pink bottle, which is always on my desk was missing. Now, i don’t know if this is considered over exaggerating, but i’ve had that bottle with me for the past 7 years & it has a lot of sentimental value to me which i won’t discuss here. 

I went to my mum and asked her if she had seen it and she said she threw it away because there was nothing in the bottle. She kept saying “ so what are you gonna do now, it’s gone alrd”. My mum has seen it a million times and even seen it while cleaning my room before as well, but has NEVER touched it. I was so pissed off?? I know this makes me sound like a complete brat but there was a finished can of chips (with nothing inside as well), so out of spite i told her why didn’t she throw away that instead,

Wrong move m because she completely exploded. She started calling me very...bad names and said that i will never live peacefully after she dies and how she wished i was never her daughter and a whole lot of stuff that honestly is making me cry right now. 

At this point, i’m trying to calm her down but...my head started to spin and i suddenly could not breath nor stand still. I tried to grab the door handle but failed and eventually collapsed. I kept screaming for my mum and all she said was “ can u stop screaming the neighbours are looking at us, they are gonna think something is wrong”. I literally wish i had just died st that point because her words rly cut though my soul.


A little bit of bg: i’m currently 20. i’ve always been a “parent pleaser”. i have never done anything without seeking my parent’s permission ever in my life. From the clothes i wear, to choosing my major to even choosing the company i work in HECK EVEN THE FOOD I EAT, i always always consult my parents first. every single day i only have one wish and that is to make my parents proud. 


What my mum said rly felt like someone had plunged a knife through me. I thought about this whole ordeal this morning (the incident happened last night) and i just keep crying repeatedly over and over again. And i can’t seem to function normally. So reddit ATIA here?"

Back in my sophomore year of high school a group of friends and I made a rap diss track to another rapper from our high school. So this guy, we will call him F,  he is totally crazy, he threatened to shoot up our high school and he stalks he ex girlfriend. On top of this F makes rap music, his beats are alright I have to admit, but his rapping is awful. Additionally, F liked to challenge everyone at our school into trying to make a diss against him cause he will just come back with an even harder one.  

My friends and I accepted this challenge and we made a really shitty diss track if I have to say. It was recorded on like an Xbox headset on logic super shit stuff. Anyway, in our diss we said stuff like “fuck You fa**et” “your cancer” and a reference to autism was also in there”hope you die of aut-“ (AT THE TIME WE DID NOT KNOW HE WAS mentally challenged). 

Anyhow, we release the song on YouTube and it goes viral at our school. Instead of sending back a diss track like he said he would F decided to tell his mom instead. His mom complains to the school saying that this is “bullying” because F apparently has a slight autism. Honestly, we did not know he was autistic before we just said those dumb things because we were stupid sophomores. The whole situation blew up at the school, the principal was calling in suspects for two weeks straight and the mother claimed to have contacted the police into searching for who uploaded the rap song. 

In the end, our football team got blamed for the whole thing because of another rap diss track THEY made a couple months before the whole ordeal. 

Am I the asshole?

All of them were bought during my previous relationship, and all were used at one point or another with my former girlfriend.  

&#x200B;

After the 3rd or 4th time I had sex with my current girlfriend, I busted out my ""fuck box"" which contained my sex toys.  We've been having fun with them for a couple of weeks now.  We were browsing an online sex store earlier, and she noticed one of my toys had a newer model.  I said yeah, that makes sense.  The one I have was purchased a couple of years ago.  She asked, ""So its been just sitting around ever since?""  Of course I'm like no...I was in a relationship so we used it?  Who buys sex toys just to sit around?  

&#x200B;

Her face soured immediately.  I used a fucking sex toy on her that I also used with another girl?  Do I know how disgusting that is?  Do I know how disrespectful that is?  My honest answer, to both questions, was No?  I mean, I bought them.  Of course I'm going to use them.  I have also went above and beyond the cleaning recommendations by the factory.  If they have been sitting for awhile, they are completely re-cleaned again.  They're completely safe.  

&#x200B;

She disagrees.  How dare I use something on her that I used on another woman.  Sorry for being graphic, but my response was, ""I've used my dick on 20 other women, half of which I don't even remember their names.

I told him it was fine and that I didn’t need that and I believed him. 

We were talking dirty and we planned to meet up tomorrow night and hook up. And then I saw he posted on his Snapchat story a picture he took of his laptop of some sports game and I saw the other tabs he had open. One of the tabs said a name of a medicine and I’m nosy so I googled it and it was a medication for genital herpes. I really liked him but I felt deceived since he was so insistent on being clean. I texted him and said something came up and I couldn’t see him tomorrow and I haven’t been replying to his messages. I don’t really even know what to say.

This might sound bad but there’s more to the story

So this guy (lets call him Luke) and I went to elementary school together. During this time he DESPISED each other. (I don’t know why we just did) 

Anyways after elementary school he went to a different middle school then I did and I didn’t see him again for a few years.

Then about a year or so later we both joined the same cadet corps. We had talked pretty much everyday and I felt like I could trust him. We also discovered we both had dead beat dads and one of our moms ex’s where abusive.  So we had a lot in common. Slowly over the course of a few years I started to develop crush on him. 

Here’s where the badness starts. 

I showed him pictures of our old class mates and he pointed to one of my best friends and said “she got HAWT” I was sad but thought nothing of it, later on on the year they met up with a group of friends and on this outing she kissed him. (I should mention that I didn’t tell them I liked him but from they way I spoke about him I thought it was obvious) they began to talk and now they both like each other and want to date. Luke even asked me to be his wingman in trying to get this girl to like him. Apparently I did my hone to well and how she does and they hang out and slow dance and stuffs now

I really don’t want her to date him because I really like him. Am I the antagonist for not wanting this?

My daughter has a couple of nicknames that derive from her full name. But recently my husband has started calling her “baby” as well, which he hadn’t done in the past. Not sure where it came from. But that’s the term of endearment he uses for me (and, up until now, only me). 

I tried to bring this up casually with my husband the last time he said it. It was last night and it was time for her to go to bed but she was preoccupied playing. He said “baby come here” to get her attention. After she settled down to sleep, I just asked if he could try not to call her “baby” anymore. He asked why and I explained my reasoning as best I could (that I felt like it was a special term for me as his wife, etc). He then said I was being ridiculous. I got upset because I was trying to express my feelings maturely only to get shut down. I feel like he’s annoyed with me now for even bringing it up. 

Looking for honest opinions obviously. Am I in the wrong for asking him to just pick a different pet name or use one of her old ones??"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

i have grown up not having grandparents around in my life — on my mom’s side, both of her parents died before i was born; on my dad’s side, his mother and stepfather were always quite distant with us until about a few years ago (irrelevant but i’m happy we’ve been in contact).

i had always known that my dad didn’t have the best relationship with his biological father, who had divorced my grandmother when my dad was around his twenties, i believe. it was to such an extent that i am certain my biological grandfather doesn’t know that i (or my older siblings) exist.

it’s a very touchy subject in my house, in the sense that it is something NEVER mentioned. the only time it would be brought up in passing was if my dad got a haircut or argued with my mom, who would say that he looked or acted like “his father.”
my dad’s sister has also become closer with us. their father has reached out to both of them (my aunt more so than my dad) multiple times, but they clearly want no relationship with him. this fact made me a little upset — i mean, their father is trying to reach out to them for a reason.

i’d always wondered what it was exactly that made my biological grandfather so undesirable. so, i did what anybody would do, and googled his name. not too many hits, except for some pickleball club where he lives.

i took a risk and added “criminal” to his name. i clicked on a link that gave a short synopsis of something he’d done before i was born involving a patient and coercion (this is as much detail as i am willing to reveal for privacy, but it’s awful). assuming i’ve got the right guy, he spent a very short time in prison, but is free today. 

so, case closed, right? unfortunately, i don’t know what to do with this info. nobody ever told me about it for a reason, and it’s clear that the lack of relationship between him and his children/grandchildren/ex-wife is justified. i still don’t feel like i have answers, and my dad would be unwilling to tell me otherwise. WIBTA if i confronted him with my knowledge and asked about the truth for closure?

EDIT: i apologize for my word choice of “demand” — it is coming up a lot in these responses. i would never truly FORCE my dad to speak about this subject. this is my first time ever expressing my feelings about this whole thing, and it’s clear that i came off a bit strong and pushy"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0sm7n	2019-06-15 02:53:32	megamoodoesart	"AITA For telling my ""friend"" off for being a pedofile and stealing my art?"	"I've had a friend , let's call her Jane. I've known her since freshman year of highschool, all the way til now as we are both now 19.

Jane and I have had our disagreements during highschool and things have been a little tense ever since,  but nothing like this ever happened before.

Jane was known to steal, and not in the way you think. She didnt steal stuff from stores or malls, no no no. Jane stole art. She was an avid tracer and claimed that every piece was her own,  which would be fine if she was just starting to draw and wanted to learn more about anatomy, but shes been doing this for 5 years! She was also known to trash talk people behind their backs, yet always stated ""If you have a problem with me, come to me personally and I'll try and fix it"". This will be important later.

I didnt give too much attention, though I was a tad irritated, since it was only ever anime bases and not anyone's true original piece. 

Then she started asking me for free art. Okay, sure. I like to think I'm a decent artist. Not too good, but not God awful, so I drew her stuff. Some couple based, some just of her characters. I even bought her things that she wanted under the promise that she would pay me back.

Let me put in here that she never offered me anything in return, which is fine, but she didnt even give me a thanks or pay me back when she said she would. Nothing. Zero. Zip. 

 It didnt take me long to find out that she was posting my art online and giving no credit to me, while taking all the praise for herself. 

I started getting a bit angry, but I didnt let it show. At least, not yet. I kindly asked her to at the very least, credit me. 

She said she would. FANTASTIC, RIGHT? No. Not only did she not give me credit, she started tracing my art as well, and it's not like you couldn't tell. Every artist has a specific style. Compare picasso and davinci.  Two totally different art styles. Well, Jane's style, or lack there of, followed a more anime route, where mine took slight cartoon with realistic qualities. (Its a bit hard to explain, I hope I made the idea clear). 

I had planned on asking her once more to stop, but I ended up finding out that my ""friend "" Jane, was dating a Minor. Now, if she was still in highschool and underage, this would make a bit more sense.

But shes a graduated 19 year old dating a 16 year old sophomore. (I later found out they did the nasty nasty, which is gross on sooooo many levels.)

I confronted her about all of it. 

She didnt take it lightly and started accusing me of harassing her. She threatened to go to court over COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.  She didnt even address the stuff about her and her 16 year old boyfriend.  The only thing she blew up at me about was the art. She told me I was the monster for even considering talking to her like that. 

I blocked her online after that, but it still kinda hurts.
Am I the asshole?


Edit: after reading through the comments, I see how the term pedofile was misused. I would like to address that normally, a three year age gap would be fine, but in my state, to give consent, you can be sixteen, but only if it's with another person who is 16 and under 18. Jane is 19 and has done it with him, which could be a federal offense in my state. 
I also see how it seems irrelevant to mention it, but it was the straw that broke the camel's back because I thought she was smarter than that. I dont think I would have cared as much about it if she had not done the deed with him.

Edit two: Jane and I were close at one point, but after a few events in the last few months, not counting this, things got really strained really quick. I'm sorry I did not make that clear enough."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

My friend who i’ve been close friends with for six years  - i’m taking about playing games for hours every day or hanging out a couple times a week friend for six years -  does not really socialize or get along with many people. I however have an easy time socializing and get along with most people. My friend literally does not have any other friends while I have 4 or 5 good friends. I always invite him to things and try my best to introduce him to new people and new situations, i’ve brought him to parties, i’ve helped make his resumé as well as apply for jobs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My friend recently got into DnD and I know that my brother is an avid DnD player as well as, so I thought it would be great if we played a one-shot campaign together and he got to meet someone new.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months later and my brother and friend are now good enough friends that we can all play games(PC) together. However a few issues began to arise:They both started a new Dnd campaign together and I was not invited at all. They also began playing games without me occasionally without even lending an invite. On top of that, when we did play games together online, they would talk about things that I was excluded out of right in front of my face. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This frustrated me to the point of confrontation, I talked to my friend about how they were excluding me out of things and he apologized and said he’d be more mindful of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A few weeks later a new game was coming out and it came up in conversation between all of us and that was it. Fast forward to release day of the game and I ask my friend if he wants to get on and get it, he replies and tells me that he’s on with my brother for the past few hours playing and that’s it, no invitation beforehand or even after I asked him whats up. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At this point I was upset, I blocked my friend on all platforms. And I texted him about how I was over it and how my own best friend would exclude me from things with my own brother. He apologized again but I was not having it. He said if I ever still wanted to be friends he would be there. A week later I saw that my brother and his friends had gone on a trip somewhere far by airplane and my friend had gone, another thing I was not invited to and im sure was planned while we were still friends.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It’s been about 3 months now and I haven’t seen my brother since then but he is coming down (he lives about an hour or so away) for fathers day and I plan on ignoring him or not participating on whatever we do with him for fathers day. I know my brother has as much blame in this as my friend but since I can’t really sever ties with him I just avoided talking to him about it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It’s heartbreaking to lose such a close and valuable friend to me but I felt helpless and didn’t know what else to do. AITA?"	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

That's not the biggest problem. We have bunk beds. I have needs. I try to take care of them earlier but my mom has us renovating the backyard so I barely have time. It's hard to take care of it when your sibling is right above you. And also it moves the bed a lot. I never told her about that part because it weirds me out but when I ask her to go downstairs for a little bit longer she tells me ""I don't know what you want me to do."" Understandable. But also the same goes for her! You want me to not move the bed, turn the light on, or make any sounds when I'm still wide awake in our shared room. AITA? Edit: I said loud in the title but shouldn't have. I'm medium volume I guess.

Edit 2: I should've given more info on this but I don't draw downstairs because there are no reliable surfaces for me to draw on (dining room table has ridges, portable tables wobble) and also because I listen to my music while my phone is on the charger, not accessible outlets downstairs."

Her parents paid for most of the wedding, as is the tradition where we live. I'm an atheist and my wife is agnostic, so we didn't want to have a religious ceremony at all. Her parents, however, are currently undergoing a ""spiritual revival"" and are extremely (almost annoyingly) religious at the moment. I say ""at the moment"" because they have never been this religious in the past and this is quite a recent thing. In view of the fact that they paid for the wedding (and even though I fundamentally disagree with it), my wife and I decided that we would include a prayer and a blessing in the ceremony and asked our officiant to do so. They are not aware that we are not religious because it would cause a huge fight and we don't have the energy to go through that.

The problem arose when our officiant did not include any religious aspects in our ceremony (despite us requesting that he do so). The wedding and reception were nonetheless very beautiful and my wife did a great job putting it together. My wife's parents seemed fine the whole night. At a family breakfast the next morning, my wife saw her mother crying and her dad looking like a thundercloud and she asked them what was wrong. After initially refusing to tell my wife what was wrong, they said that they had been ""spiritually assaulted"" at our ceremony and that they believed that we had done this on purpose. They wanted to wait until December to discuss it with us!! 

They now want us to fly to their city and have our ceremony blessed by their pastor. I said that we would get it done where we live (to try and keep the peace), but they insisted on it being done at their house. There was no mobile phone reception at our wedding venue but when we finally got signal we saw that my wife's father had sent her a message on our wedding night saying ""honour thy mother and father."" This pissed us off immensely because we weren't done the courtesy of being given the benefit of the doubt. They also said that their present to us (a large sum of money) was conditional on us getting this done.

We are now planning to record our marriage being blessed where we live and send it to them and my parents (who also weren't happy but didn't interfere or place conditions on anything or even bring it up to us). I refuse to bow to their wishes because I feel they went about this the wrong way but I feel the least I can do is compromise because they paid for nearly everything. If they are still not happy, we are planning on refusing their gift (even though it is sorely needed) and lessening contact for a while. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	529.0	125.0	0.0	0.0

Alright so my wife and I have discussed with this before, basically I've told her when I am at work nudes, while fun and great, aren't always practical. Even if I'm by myself I find it awkward to send back a picture of the office or just a black screen with a generic ""wow that's hot"" etc etc.

Little background, we had a kid 11 months ago and her body hasn't been the same ( weight and stretch marks) but I honestly don't care, I love her and think she is beautiful. She however has been really self conscious about it and I've tried to be supportive and have been commenting and complimenting her a lot on her looks. 

Fast forward to today and I'm at work by myself and we are texting and she sends me a NSFW lingerie pic, I reply saying how much I like the lingerie and stuff and she sends another to which I reply again. This whole time we are snapchatting we are also just texting talking about random stuff. So she sends a third picture, I look at and can't think of a reply so I go back to texting her, I'm trying to think of a reply and can't. Eventually I forget to respond to the snap.

So we continue texting and she seems fine (I've forgotten to respond) and then i have to get back to work and the conversation ends. A while later she sends me a passive aggressive meme about how men should always praise women whenever they get sent nudes, I send back a funny gif (substitute teacher saying ""insubordinate and churlish"") as a response not realizing she is as actually upset at this point.

She responded ""well at least that got a reply"" 

Well then I texted her sorry and that I was trying to think of a response but was also texting and forgot.

So now she is upset saying she's disappointed and annoyed at me for not responding.

So, I know I should've responded, I don't think it's a huge deal but she's still upset. I think she's overreacting and isn't thinking about my side.

Reddit decide - Am I the asshole.

Edit-- heading home to talk now, will keep you updated

So we talked on my way home, she's aggravated and disappointed and says I should of responded. I kept apologizing and telling her that I honestly forgot and then she said she doesn't understand how I can forget to respond to a picture of her ass in lingerie.

c0sg3w	2019-06-15 02:33:47	nonoticegoodbye	WIBTA if I quit without giving notice?	"So I work for a small company that regularly has about 4/5 people. I’ve not even worked there for a year but I’ve loved the job. I sell liquor so it’s always interesting. 

People come and go so fast. Since I started I’ve seen seven people come and go because management just sucks. 

Well we had a girl (let’s call her Mariah) come in about four months ago, a transfer from another store. She left the last store due to “drama”. Ever since she’s been at my store, she’s made it clear that she will take down everyone if it means she gets a shot at being on top. Her latest trick was to tell the 3 of us left, individually, that we were talking shit about each other. None of this was true, we all get along so well that we go out clubbing and drinking together. Then she went and told management that we were all fighting and immature. Which led to management yelling at us and the three of us standing there, very confused. 

*Because of this, the manager-in-training position that I had been offered, was removed because I’m clearly too immature. I’m now just back to a regular employee.*

Our latest hire lasted only a month. She was a very bad employee. Did a lot of no call, no shows, came without clothes on more than once (as in, her pants would be halfway up when she walked in, undies out and all), she was constantly late, money would go missing... just a bad employee. I was upfront with how I thought she wasn’t a good fit. Mariah knew she was bad, but instead of saying it, she pretended to be the girls friend and then tricked her into quitting for the “benefit of her kids”. 

I was blamed for the girl leaving, because I’d always been upfront with how I thought she wasn’t a great worker.  The issue is I knew, because Mariah had told me, why the girl had really quit. 

I tried to talk to my manager about the situation and she responded with 

“I don’t want to hear it. It’s negativity coming out of your mouth and I don’t want to hear it.”

So now I’m stuck being blamed for this girl quitting when it wasn’t me at all, and my manager won’t even hear me out because it’s “negativity”. In response to my not getting along with Mariah, that manager promptly scheduled me to work with her every single time I work. 

I can’t take this. I can’t even defend myself. I can’t tell my manager what’s really going on, because she won’t even listen. I can’t be around Mariah anymore because she calls me names and swears at me and tells management that I’m lazy. I’ve hit my limit. I don’t want to go back at all. I tried to put a notice in a couple weeks ago and it was thrown out and I was told “you’ll get over this”.

c0sfkn	2019-06-15 02:31:54	EPrimeTV	AITA Because I Broke A Condition Trying To Help A Friend Get Off Drugs. Am I Making It A Bigger Deal Than It is?	"I'm kind of nervous to ask this

So, I have/had a good friend who I always cared about. We always related to each other in terms of mental illness, and grown to like her a lot as a person. She admitted to me a couple of days ago that 6 months ago she had started smoking meth. She lives in a bad part of Tucson and a lot of meth heads and she's always around it. That she did it ""Because she was bored"". 

She had tasked me with helping her quit; This meant limiting where she can go and when she can go. Grounding her if she breaks rules, etc. She had one rule; To not bring her personal life into it. That was her one condition.

Let's call this girl Nancy. Nancy had been okay for about 5 days, she had asked me if a girl can come over (Let's call her Karen). Nancy told me that Karen was a user but doesn't want her falling back and wouldn't put meth in Nancy's hands.

I find out today that she lied. Not only\_ had they used, but she lied about what she said about Karen.

I told her to stop hanging out with Karen as I did with 2 other people who she smoked meth with. 

The thing with Meth/amphetamines is that you can't chance it and go easy. It's the most addictive and dangerous drug out there. The cravings and urges are worse with meth than any other drug. As her friend, I felt I had to go beyond  the call of duty to help her get off drugs.

After losing my brother to an overdose in February, I refused to let someone else succumb to it. 

I had messaged Karen on Facebook telling her to stay away from Nancy. Apparently she was sitting beside her and Nancy could clearly see me messaging her. She went off at me about the condition to keep personal stuff out of it and I broke it.

Like I said, meth hits hard so I had to help her by hitting back harder. You can't help a drug addict by letting them hang out with the people who give it to her. People are the biggest influence, and if you're around those people you are NEVER going to quit. IF you're in the same area you do it in - you will always associate with it and normalize the drug use. I saw this first hand with my brother.

She tells me ""It's not that bad"" and ""I'm not that addicted to it."" but clearly she is. 

&#x200B;

Am I seeing something bigger than it is? Is she not that deep into it? Or am I right here? Should I have done what I had done? Or should I have kept to her condition and maybe she would have kept making excuses and kept doing it because ""It's not that bad"" when it clearly is.

c0sc15	2019-06-15 02:20:49	Ernalinewriter	WIBTA if I told my sister her house is shit?	"So, this is a bit to unpack.

My sister (Technically sister in law, but I see her as a true sister) and her husband (my biological brother) Are going through a divorce, and recently she has just moved down to where me and my parents live.

She and my brother had three kids, a set of twins girls and a single boy, whom they believe are all on some range of the autism spectrum like she is and my brothers side (me and our parents) and all under the age of 4

When she was given the divorce notice by my brother (who is in the military and was at Afghanistan) she was in sudden tears and distraught.

They had agreed on several things that I had gathered

1. If either one is unfit to raise the kids, the other takes it (after that I am unaware of) Currently my sister has the three kids

2. My brother gets his dog (a giant yellow lab)

3. My sister gets the GI Bill and possibly other payments by my brother for the kids and her bills.

The rest is unknown because I wasn't listening because my mind was just smacked by this sudden news, which I wasn't told until the next NIGHT by my mom.

And as of today, while watching the house, (my brother comes to visit for the last time for a while)

Quick note: My sister is getting back from a Friday to Friday long trip via plane, no clue where she went (she also hid her alcoholic tendency from us until she asked my mom to take her to a AA meeting and has secretly been smoking cigarettes or vaping without us knowing, her friends do it and my mom doesn't like them)

I go upstairs because I need to grab something for my brother, and looking into my sister's bathroom, I find her large bathtub filled with (probably) dirty clothes and boxes, her second closet (inside the bathroom) completely ruined by dumped clothes and random objects, and her house filled with ants, several which I have killed and see crawling up the walls. 

Her garage has spiders all over the ceiling, food is all over the floor, her children are unruled and have no way of knowing good or bad, only see it as attention grabbing, and her toilets look like shit inside after only half a month of living in the new house they got.

I'm honestly disgusting and horrified, I don't even want to use the bathroom, let alone sleep here because I have to watch them again tomorrow while she works 5-4

I don't know if I should leave for the night when she gets here to go and sanitize myself, or straight up tell her that her house is shit and then book it home across muddy ground.

Would I be the asshole for telling her and telling as I see it?

Edit: Quick edit, as I forgot to mention. My brother (the kid's father) has been living in my sister's house for half the time he has been here and said he has been CLEANING pretty much most of the mess. My mom often watches them and says she too has been cleaning and comes back not two weeks ago, she is no longer going to clean while watching the kids because it's not her job.

I, like my mom, have a uncontrollable clean freak habit, and just being in a dirty space while stressed or left alone causes us to clean, and I don't want to be the one to clean and feel like a nanny unless absolutely needed.

I also often see the kids, right after bath time, covered in some unknown dirty muck on their faces all over again, I have no clue what it is, but it's not the water I know that.

Edit 2: My sister has multiple mental problems, one of which I will mention as my mother has the same, Bipolar disorder. My sister was offered a book to figure some things out herself while going to therapy, and even told my mom, TO HER FACE, there is no cure.

My mom read the book while my sister didn't notice it gone, and was FUMING to me on how that (while true) was not completely the truth. There are multiple meds that help with certain things, like mood swings, sudden chemical imbalances, ect. It's all different meds and my mother takes most of them for hers while others she never needed."	Not the A-hole	0	0	30.0	8.0	0.0	0.0

My sister has a lot of extra income since she still lives with our grandparents. Everything she wants she usually goes out and buys. Instead of buying her a present, (since I'm not sure what she would want) I decide to cook her a nice birthday dinner.

I chat on the phone with her and find out that she wants a steak dinner. No problem, I'm a chef for a living and I enjoy cooking food that makes people happy. So I go and buy some expensive cuts and make a marinate out of fresh garlic, herbs, and wine. Today is her birthday, I bring the marinated steak over to my grandparents house and prepare to cut up sweet potatoes as she wants homemade fries with asparagus. The entire meal cost me about 60$. 

I wish her a happy birthday and told her I got some nice steaks for her birthday. She goes silent for a bit then aks. ""But this isnt my present right""? 

Surprised I look at her and says yes it is her gift from me. I spent good money on it and I thought it was a thoughtful gift as I really had no idea what she would have wanted. 

She got angry. She told me food is not a gift and she could have pulled steaks out of my parents freezer if she wanted them. My gift was ""last minute"" and not thoughtful at all. 

At this point I'm getting angry and I told her that she never made a point of telling me what she wanted. Her response was that ""I never asked"". She told me I should have just bought her a movie or something. I thought the meal would have meant more to her but apparently not, since  people cook for her all the time. 

She said the gift wasint thoughtful at all. Then she stormed into her bedroom and closed the door. I'm standing in the kitchen with uncooked prepared food and wondering what the heck to do next. Apologize for buying her the wrong gift? Screw that I'm her sister not her mother. 

I left the house and went back to my apartment her uncooked bday dinner still on my grandparents counter. 

Just to clarify my grandparents are away for a few weeks on a trip. This was the first year my sister would be celebrating her bday alone so I told my grandparents I would cook for her and make sure she wasint alone. 

Should I have stayed and finished cooking? I'm leaving my sister to be alone on her bday but I was just so mad. I'm afraid she will spin a story about how I didnt get her anything and was rude to her on her bday.
I feel like she ows me an apology but my sister never sees when shes in the wrong. If I want to smooth things over with her I'll probably have to admit that I was the one who fucked up."	Not the A-hole	0	0	221.0	50.0	0.0	0.0
c0sayu	2019-06-15 02:17:20		AITA for pretty much snapping at a coworker for not doing their job?	"Sorry for the long post but there is alot of background I have to explain in order for you guys to understand my frustration.
Short Version: Snapped at a coworker after asking her 3 times to switch with me but instead just ignored me until I snapped. 

I feel like I am doing basically all the work at my job. My coworker who has a managers position doesn't do much of anything. (I got offered this position but due to having family issues at home and I do not have time to study for the certification that is required to obtain this position which I am fine with and do plan to get the certification in the future when things at home calm down). 
For some background: I work in a pharmacy and have alot of responsibilities outside of the standard dealing with customers who pick up medications, counting the medications, and typing scripts.


Today I was typing scripts and helping customers we are normally supposed to rotate when more people come in so not everyone is stuck doing the same thing all day. Well today my coworker decided that they did not feel like doing anything but count medication. So I just shrugged it off and said that we can always switch after break.  I took my break and when I came back my coworker is still there counting. Doing absolutely nothing else. 


We have an order of medication we get daily that wasn't in stock the previous day that no one else can be bothered to do. So I do it and we have a set time to do it. Again instead of switching so I can do this order I had to both type scripts, prepare the order and answer phones. While again my lovely coworker decides to just keep counting nothing else. But she was able to answer her own phone. We also have an order of brand name medication that comes once a week which came today. 


Now for my responsibilities outside of the standard things that were mentioned: Filing scripts, doing all of the orders(which I already said), doing returns of medications that are not needed, making sure those medications get out to our vendor, filing the invoices that our vendor gives us that approves the return, checking in the medications that is sent to us to make sure we received the correct ones, checking expired medication and making sure they get out on time monthly, putting the brand name medication order away, make sure we received credit for returns and filing them, doctor calls, cycle counts(keeps track of medication that we have in the pharmacy), making sure my other coworkers do their job and help when they need assistance, ordering uniforms, etc etc you guys get the picture. 


Anyway it was getting close to the end of my shift and it was Friday so I am typing still helping customers and I just see the stack of work that is still needed to be done which won't get done unless I do it. So I snapped and said CAN YOU TAKE OVER NOW SO I CAN DO MY OTHER WORK AND MAYBE BE ABLE TO LEAVE ON TIME?

c0satw	2019-06-15 02:16:53	throwawayrshiphelpp	AITA for getting someone else to fix my car when my dad said he would take a look at it?	"Throwaway account. 

I was parked at a shopping complex for an interview. When I came back out, my car wouldn’t start up. I didn’t know what to do in the situation so I rang my dad and told him my problem (context: there is a shop in the complex that sells supplies my dad needs for his job). He said he has to go to said complex today anyway to get supplies, so he will stop and take a look at my car while he’s there.

I was suppose to go to my mums at at this point so I rang her and explained my car won’t start and that I will be late. She told me there is a shop in the complex that deals with cars which I forgot about, and to ask them do they know what the problem was. A man came out and fixed my car (dead battery) within 15 minutes. Sorted. I could then see my dad driving past but he looked at me and drove on. I ring to tell him it is sorted and he starts going mad saying ‘he only came in just to help me’ and ‘it is disrespectful to ask him for help and then not have the patience to wait’. I don’t agree as he didn’t state he was only coming in just to help me but that he was already going in and would stop to take a look at my car. Furthermore, I don’t know what he could have done to fix it in the moment anyway, so I don’t see why he could not have been happy that I got the problem fixed. However, he still maintains what I did is disrespectful and now he is being moody with me.

I thought this was a random playlist and not a specific song she actually enjoyed by Of Montreal, so I said ""Hey google, next song"" and she let me know as I was saying it she liked it so I tried saying ""cancel, cancel, cancel!"" but it didn't work. It seemed like things were ok cause I misunderstood.

After arguing with me for other things like having not taken recycling out, she seemed to be ok and joked about me cancelling the song, so I joked back that it was only because I thought it was a bunch of noise at the moment.

This made her very offended and she kept telling me it couldn't be a joke because it wasn't funny, and I was just attacking something she enjoyed. I kept reiterating it's only because I didn't know it was something she personally liked, because of how one moment sounded.

So from my side of the story Reddit, AITA? Is this worth lashing out at your partner and basically insisting they should feel bad for it?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My roommate is very ocd and a little on the controlling side when it comes to the apartment. My friends and I play D&D weekly, and since I’m injured we moved the game to my place. They even brought over a decent sized table to play on. My dining room has been empty all year. There is nothing it but a trash and recycling bin. My roommate has stated numerous times that she wishes we had a table. Apparently she doesn’t like the table and decides that it needs to go. Through a sequence of words I called her an asshole. I feel that this text I sent her afterward recaps the events sufficiently.

The text:
“I really wish you could be more considerate of what I’m going through right now. You’re being really critical of me in a time where I can barely fucking function okay? I haven’t left the house except to go to my doctors appointments or the bank in like a month. I can’t fucking drive anywhere, I’m just barely at the point where I can stand for more than a minute without my leg feeling like it’s going to explode out of my skin. Waking across the parking lot in and of itself is tough, alright? Let alone trying to carry a bunch of shit down the stairs and then to the dumpster. I can’t stay balanced, I fucking fall over when I try. I hopped around on one leg for a half hour yesterday just sweeping the kitchen and dining room. Everything is hard for me. I haven’t seen anyone in person in like a week. I get fucking lonely, and obviously nobody gives a shit because it’s not their problem. I’m fucking broke and stressed and locked in the apartment every fucking day. I have next to no independence aside from getting myself from one end of the apartment to the other and cooking for myself. It’s been a fucking hard month. You haven’t been here, so you haven’t seen what I’ve been going through, and then you come home and I ask you to help me with one single thing that I haven’t done because I physically CAN’T do it, you clearly have no interest in helping me out. All you wanted to talk about was the table, which has been beneficial to me, making my life just slightly easier, but you say it’s gotta go. I’ve got a million things on my mind right now Marisa, and the table is really just not something I see as a huge deal, but you see it as more important than helping me out with the trash. I’m sorry I said it, but that’s why I called you an asshole.”

When I called her an asshole she turned it on me as if namecalling was the worst offense one could commit and refused to speak with me on the matter further. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	318.0	29.0	0.0	0.0

I'm the kind of person willing to do literally anything for those who she cares about. When I love, I also tend to get naive. Because of this, I got into several abusive friendships in the past - my ex friends essentially destroyed my self-esteem and used to put me down all the time. This thing (experience?) shaped me as a person and still affects my daily life, to the point I'm generally unable to talk about my problems with someone who is not my mom.

In the past few months I met this amazing girl whose fake name will be Jennie. We got really close after a full night session of Let's Talk About Our Traumas. For the first time in years, I'm able to share a little cup of my most intimate thoughts with someone else. Whatever I do, Jennie supports and uplifts me. She makes me feel loved. Still, Jennie herself is an extremely insecure person and tends to get way too much jealous. I never thought of her as toxic or worse, since everytime she vented to me about her jealousy-related issues I could see she wasn't really in the wrong.

Some days ago I started talking more with another girl, Angela. We joke in public a lot and simply insult each other for fun, nothing special. Jennie began saying things like ""I'm watching you, careful"" whenever me and Angela would play around, but it always seemed she wasn't serious. Yesterday Jennie explicitly told me she's jealous of Angela. (""When I start getting annoyed I can't control myself"")
She's scared I'm going to replace her, but I'm literally doing nothing. I reasurred her, told Jennie our relationship is important to me and that I have no reasons at all to even think about leaving her behind just to hang out with someone else. Tonight she got jealous again, she threw some shade on twitter and acted as cold as possible through texts. I asked her if we could talk about it, but in the end she just made me give up with an ""I'm not in the mood, I don't want to think about it.""

I asked another friend, who I've known longer than Jennie, for an advice or something. She got mad at ME after hearing the story, because she can't stand Jennie at all. My friend simply told me to ask google what to do and went to bed. Nothing else. For context, she's been jealous of Jennie for some time now, because she feels I care more about her.

Now, reddit, am I a shitty person who doesn't know how to treat others? Did I actually do something wrong? 
I listen to everyone, I joke with everyone. I give my 100% support to all of my friends. I seriously don't understand if everything I'm doing is wrong. Am I a toxic asshole or something? 


tl;dr: I made two of my friends angry and insecure and I'm trying to understand if I'm actually an abusive asshole. One got jealous because I started joking with someone else, the other one is mad at me because she thinks I care more about my jealous friend than her"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0s7db	2019-06-15 02:05:30	garrisonlazereye	AITA for confronting my MIL for starting repairs on my home without my permission while away on vacation?	"Okay, a little backstory: My fiancé (28M) and I (28F) live directly next door to his parents, in their guest house. His Mom is a stay at home, father works long hours. We are very fortunate to live here, have low rent and work from home. For the most part, we all get along great and all enjoy being around family. We help his family with maintenance around the property, cook for them, etc. Life is good. 

My finance and I had a vacation planned for a friend’s wedding, and a day before we left for vacation, a leak began to form seemingly out of nowhere in our home. We spent time sourcing it, and ultimately decided it was a slab leak. We cut off the water in our home to prevent further damage, pulled up the carpet and begin running and rotating fans immediately. We phoned insurance and were informed they were backed up anyway with recent flooding in our area, so they wouldn’t be able to come evaluate the situation for at least a week. 

We stressed on whether we should cancel our vacation, but Mom insisted it wasn’t necessary and we could deal with repairs when we return. With the water off, there was no further damage occurring. So we indeed went on vacation, for 5 days. We inquired about any updates while we were gone, but heard nothing back from his family on the subject. In hindsight, we should have prodded more but were busy with festivities.

When we returned home from vacation, it looked like we were robbed, but instead of the robber taking our possessions, they just moved everything to bizarre locations and cut into the walls. Our kitchen drawers and whatnot haphazardly stacked in the living area, closets rifled through and rearranged, drawers open, private accessories exposed, decorations and books slung about the house, etc. The only thing that appears to be in the same place is the bed.

Turns out within hours of leaving for vacation, Mom decided to proceed with repairs without insurance and without informing us. For context, she had to move everything because she elected to pull all the plumbing up from the slab so it’s all going to be above ground moving forward. So anything near plumbing had to be removed. 

We confronted her and asked why she didn’t contact us when the plan for repairs had changed. She simply stated “I didn’t want to ruin your vacation.” We told her we would have very much liked to know what was going on in our home and with our belongings. I’m a very private person, and the last thing I wanted was my future mother in law putting her fingers in all my pies. Now she is pissed at us, saying we’re ungrateful assholes for not appreciating all the hard work she did while we were gone to get the ball rolling on repairs. We understand she performed a lot of work, but we still feel deceived and violated, and ultimately never asked or wanted her to do so.

So Reddit, we need you to weigh in, are we the assholes for being upset that Mom went through and ransacked all of our possessions while we were on vacation?"	Asshole	0	0	47.0	29.0	0.0	0.0

c0s6fr	2019-06-15 02:02:25	ehhhthrowawayx	AITA for asking my boyfriend if he did something sexual with our dog after finding some weird stuff in his browsing history?	"Obviously this is an odd situation so I need to provide a little context. 

My boyfriend and I are both grad students. We have shared an apartment for the past two years and we adopted a beagle mix about a year ago. 

My laptop has been unusable for the past few weeks since I spilled water on it, so we have been sharing my boyfriend’s temporarily. I often review my browsing history when writing papers because I need to track my sources and I usually forget to save the links. It became obvious to me that my boyfriend clears his browsing history after he uses the laptop. I didn’t really care because I figured he was just watching porn and felt a little awkward about the possibility that his girlfriend might see that. 

But the other day, I guess he forgot to clear it. When I went to track down an article I had read, I noticed several links to some very strange erotica sites. It’s basically stories and realistic illustrations involving animal/human sex. There were probably thousands of them. It was extremely graphic and, obviously, I was shocked and mortified. I always considered myself to be pretty open minded but it was too much even for me. 

I also started to wonder if my boyfriend had ever acted out any of the stuff I was seeing. I have noticed that my boyfriend is more affectionate with my dog than I’m used to. For example, he always thinks it’s funny to “make out” with him (like having our dog lick inside his mouth basically). I don’t really like it but I never thought anything dark until now. 

Anyway when he finally got home I asked him about the websites. Surprisingly, after getting a little defensive, he admitted he visited those sites and said he didn’t see why I cared so much about it. I don’t know what came over me but for some reason his calmness just angered me. I snapped that I cared because I was afraid he’d done something to dog when I wasn’t around. That’s when he finally got angry too and we argued for a while. Long story short he is now staying in a motel. 

I don’t know. I feel like maybe I crossed a line with my comment about our dog. But I also feel like I have a right to ask if I’m concerned?

c0s5vz	2019-06-15 02:00:47	dextbgen	AITA for telling my cousin to quit bitchin’ about calories at a restaurant?	"I (27M) live with my uncle’s family in his house. My work is near his place, so I am renting a room from him. The other people living in the house are my uncle, his wife, their daughter (25F), and their twin sons (18M). The twins just graduated from high school last week. So, the six of us decided that we would go to a Cheesecake Factory to celebrate early this week.

I want to give a little bit of background about the daughter. She graduated from a 4-year nursing program a few months ago. After starting the program and doing a few courses, she always likes to lecture people on how to be healthy. I am not sure if her intention is to inform people, or if she wants to feel superior, a lot of the time these lectures sound snobbish. Sometimes she practices what she preaches but takes it a little too far. For example, she will say how drinking more water is good (with which most people agree), but she will lug a 32-ounce water flask to a restaurant that will serve water. Or like when we are binge-watching a show, we have to pause after every episode or two because she has to pee. Many times, we have to pause in the middle of a two-hour movie because she has to pee. When I or the twins ask her to not do this, she will lecture us on how we should drink more water and that she is being healthier than us. At other times she will lecture us on how being vegetarian is better than eating meat, but later will happily chow down a steak at a Cheesecake Factory.

Now back to what happened. The six of us went to the Cheesecake factory earlier this week. We ate our entrees and are now choosing which cheesecake to get for dessert. She notices that each entree and a slice of cheesecake add to well over 2000 calories for each of us. So now she starts lecturing us how an average person requires 2000 calories every day, but since we are smaller people, consuming 1200-1500 calories would have been enough for us, etc. We keep looking at the menu while she finishes her spiel. Suddenly, I spot “Low Carb Cheesecake” on the menu. This is the conversation that follows between she and I:

Me: You know what, you should go for this low carb cheesecake.

Cousin: Why?

Me: So that you can quit BITCHIN’ about calories (emphasis on the bitchin’).

Twin cousins: Haha, he right, he right.

My uncle and aunt just kept looking down at their menus acting like they didn’t hear anything. Normally she would be sarcastic and try to say how she’s right, but this time it was different. She says slowly, “I am not bitching, I am just saying.” After that, she just doesn’t say anything for the rest of the night. She hasn’t talked to me since then. Now I am not proud of turning a girl’s family against her (regardless of whether she is being annoying), but am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c0s2m9	2019-06-15 01:50:49		AITA for not going to my classmates’ fifteenth birthday parties?	"Hello everyone. Before anything, I must say that in my country (Argentina) fifteenth birthday parties are a really big deal. They last ten hours, (from 8:00 pm to 6:00 pm) and most of the time we’re dancing. They invite all the class to them, and we have to dress really formal. 

Anyway, since last year, I’ve been invited by my classmates to numerous parties of this kind. And, I’ve never been a great fan of them. I’m not really into partying: I’d much rather spend my night at home doing nothing. 

However, at first, I went to the parties I was invited out of politeness. While I did not enjoy them, I didn’t have any other problem with them, so I felt it wrong if I didn’t go. 

Half a year went by and I continued going to this parties, even though I started feeling really bad in them. I had lots of anxiety and most of the time ended up crying when getting ready because I didn’t like the way I looked. I still went to them. 

You see, I had plenty of panic attacks during these parties during that time, and I started feeling worse and worse when in them. 

That’s when I started leaving them earlier: around 2:00 or 3:00 am. I felt really bad for the birthday girl, but if I left early, I didn’t feel quite as bad. So, I continued this way some months. 

That’s when one of the birthday girls confronted me and asked me why I’d left early her party. I didn’t want her to know I’d anxiety problems, so I only told her I had something to do the morning after that, and couldn’t stay up so late. She understood, but told me that if that was the case, I shouldn’t have gone to the party because the food that they’d have given me was wasted. 

I felt tremendously guilty when I realized what I was doing, and regretted leaving sooner the parties. That was when I started not going to them: that way they wouldn’t waste my money, right? If I told them in advance that I wouldn’t be able to go to the party, they wouldn’t pay for my food and so they wouldn’t waste the money. It was a win-win. 

Even though I still felt guilty for the birthday girl, I thought that was the best. However, now most of my classmates ask me that why I don’t go to the parties, and that I’m just lazy. This is really uncomfortable for me because I can’t explain them why I really don’t go, so I just have to bear with it. 

Every now and then, they tell me that I’m being unfair to the one celebrating her birthday and that I should show more respect. And I’m begging to consider if they are right. I still feel guilty for the girl, but I think that it’s best if I prioritize my health over someone else’s emotions.

You should also know that I struggle with diagnosed social anxiety among with other mental health-related problems, which makes it even more difficult for me to be in those places. And, besides, most of the parties I don’t go are from people that I don’t really get along with.

However, my way of acting can be seen as selfish (which in reality it still is) and really rude. So, am I the asshole?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0s2e5	2019-06-15 01:50:07	soyboy815	AITA for passing some classic cars	"My commute is 30 minutes on a long country road that connects two bigger cities and the small towns along the way. I live in city A, i work in city B. LOTS of people travel this country road for work in city B or A. So if you wanna pass anybody, you gotta wait till it's legal to do so (can't pass in a ""no passing zone""). Typical country roads. (lots of blind turns and hills)

&#x200B;

So. I'm heading to work. Unfortunatly I end up behind a HUGE line of classic cars and of course i JUST missed the begining of the line and had to get behind them. So whatever, i hop in line and just assume my commute.

Not. Speed limit for this road is 60 mph. Every car is doing 40. I swear to GOD, they never even touch 45.

Within 5 minutes there's a whole line of MODERN vehicles right on my bumper cuz we all have jobs to get to. (Btw im not trying to hate on classic cars/owners. I own a 73 vette, but i would just NEVER do what these a-holes did today. Part of owning a classic car is being aware of how you're going to be affecting other drivers. These cars go slow and can be touchy with no power steering or brakes)

Now, the road to city B has about 2 or 3 spots along the way where you can pass if no one's coming the other way, none of these spots are more than a mile long. The line of american muscle was at least a quarter of a mile long. So i can't pass in one go even if i wanted to.

Everybody behind me seems to be fuming, but I start to have a change of heart as we approach the first small town along the way. I assume ""hey, the boys just wanna get the gang together and hit the road. It's a free country. But SURELY they've looked in the rear views and see this line of cars behind THEIR line of slow ass cars and realized the HUMAN thing to do is to pull over at one of these towns every few miles, and let traffic get to where it needs to go. ESPECIALLY if you've all agreed to go 40 freakin mph on a 60mph road that is very busy due to people making their commutes between these two cities everday. SURELY???""

Neope. They kept it going. So what do i do? i see the clock ticking, i think of my job, and start passing them. Whenever i get a chance i jump up a couple cars and move back in to their line, getting a little closer to the front each time.

Apparently that's where i messed up. The little squads of dudes in each of these cars (cuz they never seem to just drive their car alone) start honking and yelling at me as i pass.  Mind you, i NEVER cut anyone off. I moved back into the right lane with plenty of room to spare between cars everytime. Was i blowing their doors off? Absoultely. Why? Well because i'm going 70 mph to pass you, and you're going 40. 

By the time i get to the front cars, i'm pretty sure they've all marked my car or something. Tons of flipping off and yelling of insults to my lovely closed windows. Brake checks. Pretty much any type of aggressive driving behavior you can think of.

AITA???

c0s22z	2019-06-15 01:48:57	chawizawd43	WIBTA if I tell my roommate I won't take care of his gf's dog anymore?	"A bit of background: my roommate (let's call him James) and I have been best friends since the 4th grade. His girlfriend (let's call her Jesse) is someone I consider to be a close friend. Right now, we have a total of three dogs: James', Jesse's and a third that is a stray James and I adopted. This post is about Jesse's dog. 

&#x200B;

Whenever James and I take care of Jesse's dog, he always asks me first if it's okay (it feels more like a courtesy, but sill), and I always reply yes. She lives in another city and we are taking care of her dog while she is visiting family over the summer. For the most part, she isn't a problematic dog. She has a lot of energy, but is very small so it's easily manageable. James went away for a few days to spend time with his family, leaving me to take care of all three dogs while he's gone (which he asked about before hand and I agreed to). Every time I am left alone with Jesse's dog (which I have been a few times before this), she always wakes me up in the early hours of the morning by barking at nothing in particular (as far as I can tell). This annoys me a lot, as I get home late from work, so I like to sleep in. Last night, she woke me up five times, six including the early morning barks. The first time I went down stairs and told her to stop barking since is was 2 am. The next time, I brought her into my room with me, since perhaps she was lonely or anxious (she usually sleeps in James' room with him). The next time, I thought she might need to go to the bathroom. It's unlikely, but hey, it's possible. I let her out and she didn't go. The next time, I ""yelled"" at her (I did so quietly bec neighbors) and she quieted down for a few minutes, then started barking at me. At that point, I put her back down stairs, was super tired, and honestly super pissed. The next couple times, I ignored her as best I could, but she kept at it for like 10 minutes. When she woke me up again (around 6 am), I just finally said ""fuck it"" and woke the other dogs up, fed them, let them out, etc etc. It was such an awful night sleep. She already wakes me up early by barking in the mornings (and only when it's just me due to James being gone, on night shift, what have you), and I've tolerated it so far bec James and Jesse are my friends, but it feels like last night was the last straw. When I was telling it to my other friend at work today, I got pissed off all over again.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I tell James I won't take care of Jesse's dog anymore? Or is this some lack-of-sleep induced anger that I just need to get over?

Last bit of context: it has only ever been Jesse's dog that does this in the morning. James' dog and our stray have never given me any issues during the night or in the morning."	Not the A-hole	0	0	58.0	11.0	0.0	0.0

I did so and suggested that she (more than me) will have to control our spending on unessential things She has essentially unlimited overtime available but stated she wanted to enjoy the time off for at least the first quarter and wouldn’t work any of it . I pointed out that she has made rather large purchases this year and we doubled our mortgage by buying a house worth 2x as much as our old one.  I believe whole heartedly that we are a team so I pick up almost all of the housework and cook every day so she can relax in addition to being the main “bread winner”. I pointed out that she wants to do all these things which were available when she was killing herself at work.

Also I'm pretty fat and tall so it's feel pretty stupid just to go multiple times wearing the same sizes and looking for her every single  time I had to change while she was looking at other stuff. I could've looked for other shirts or other brands but we just had to try on every single shirt we got. what's worse is, that's not the last time I try them on, they'd also make me try them on AGAIN at home.

I was gone for about 1 minute. When I came back, an old man of about 70 was standing there. The meat man finally finished the customer he had originally been serving and then he looked at me and asked how he could help

The old man yelled and said I was here first. He just got here. The meat man tried to explain that I had just stepped away but the man wasn’t having it. The man began yelling at me for being a line cutter etc. I just decided I didn’t want a confrontation and I ignored him and started ordering my meat. The man got in my face but I only see him in my peripheral vision, I am still not looking. Finally I had enough and I stepped directly in front of him and kind of bumped him back so he wouldn’t bother the meat man. He kept yelling and I bumped him again while my order was being processed.

He then handed me a poster for it and asked if I would put any up. I looked at the lineup and told him I wouldn't because I had heard of last band before the headliner and knew they were Christian.

He got a little upset and said that yes they were ""spirit filled hardcore"" and he's not Christian either, but he had seen them before and met them, they were a good group of guys (and girl), they weren't particularly preachy or conservative, their lyrics aren't very blatantly Christian (most bands of this type don't have lyrics like in church or Christian contemporary like ""Jesus Jesus we love you Jesus"" over and over, they're contemplative and personal but from a very Christian perspective and that still makes me uncomfortable) and musically they're actually pretty good. And that this was a 21+ show in a bar I like and not some cheesy church owned youth venue. I told him that I was opposed to using the scene and hardcore/punk to promote religion at all and could not in good conscience financially support this show.

The year I was born my dad had an affair with a woman named Catalina. It was an affair that lasted arround 3 months and almost broke up my parents marriage.
I wasn't aware of the fact till very recently.

I am pregnant and am expecting a girl. Last night when I was talking to my mom she asked me if we had thought of any names. I tell her that I have always wanted to name my daughter Catalina as I think the name is beautiful. My mom is very serious and insists that we can not name her that and to please think of something new.

I said no I love that name and so does bf. My mom breaks down and tells me the story.

Now I am conflicted. Because I love that name and I dont want to resign... But I would inflicting emotional damage on my mom.

Bf tells me mom has to get over it. Because it is our daughter but my aunt tells me that I should think about her and her feelings.

I am leaning towards naming my daughter Catalina.

AITA???

Edit : some people are saying I am not consistent because I called a person Character. It's just the Translation that popped up when I searched it.

The name is so important to us because Catalina was the woman that took me in overseas and Introduced me to bf and died a couple of moths ago.

Edit2:I think I am ta here. I will talk to both my mom and bf and see if we can settle for Catalina as a middle name

Edit3: a commet pointed out that my Catalina would not want this. I think they are completely right. I will talk to bf and rather than the middle name we can find like a short name like cat to give her the essence of the name but not the name that would hurt my mom. Thanks for your help even if some comments were mean spirited.

Update : I had lunch with my mom and showed her this post and your responses. She was horrified by some things you guys said (some of the meaner things like I don't care about my mom and that I am a horrible human being and even one saying my mom will tell my daughter someday the meaning behind her name because she is vindictive.)
It was a nice conclusion to the topic. My mom herself liked the idea of the middle name very much and insisted we keep it as she doenst want to deprive my boyfriend from that choice. And yesterday evening we decided we are going to use my mom's second name as the first name for my daughter (a thing wich brought her to tears). All in all she doenst want my father's ex affair to have a grip on her life any longer and did indeed decide to take up therapy after her breakdown. So our life's are better than ever. She got the big secret off her shoulders, I will not be attempting to make amends with my father and my mom is giving her happiness a shot.

I looked for new career paths, but with my experience and my business degree, apparently I dont qualify for much.

It's been really nice and I've gotten out of a funk/depression I was in over the winter. 

After this last trip, I said I would start looking again. I'm thinking now I'm going to work at a buddys bar and take some classes in the fall to try to get into another career path.  My gf isn't as well off as I am. She doesnt have a degree, but has a good job and makes a decent amount of money, but definitely couldn't do what I am doing.  I am able to not work for about 3 more years before I'm flat broke. Now, I have no intention of doing that. I will say my last job sucked a lot and I also went to school full time while working full time + overtime, so this break has been super fucking awesome and I think it's well deserved, although not necessary. 

My gf said to me earlier she thinks it's really unfair that she has to work while I get to sit around all day and do whatever it is that I do, and basically called me an asshole for deciding not to look for a job.

Edit: in the UK

I am 27, GF is 25. We’ve been officially together for about 2 months and at the 2-3 week mark she moved 3 ish hours drive away temporarily for work - it sucked as its a new relationship but it was only temporary so we tried the long distance thing. It was unfortunate timing. She hated it there and had awful accommodation. We would video chat every day - multiple times a day - but the connection wasn’t great so it still sucked. 

She had 3 days off in a row so we decided it would be a good time for her to come visit and get away from the terrible accommodation and get some good food (as she wasn’t really able to prepare proper food where she was at). The options were bus two hours to then connect to another bus 2 hours to my town where I’d pick her up, or I drive 3 hours to hers and then immediately 3 hours back (guests were not allowed in her accommodation due to it being work accommodation). I knew she was incredibly upset with the situation so I decided to try to be the hero and drive up and get her. 7 hours later we arrive back at mine and I am exhausted from the drive. 3 days later, I take her back to work with another 7 hour round trip. 

We discuss that it’s a bit crazy to do all that driving when it’s not that much more expensive to get a bus which she can sleep on/watch movies etc. Instead of me getting exhausted from 7 hours continuous concentration. I’m not even sure what the legal time is that truckers are allowed to drive for in one go but I’m pretty sure it’s less than 7 hours. edit: I’m wrong about this time, damn truckers are solid and do long hours. 

Some time passes and obviously we’re missing each other. She manages to get 6 days in a row off. Score! So I thought. She asked me to come pick her up again, which I said I couldn’t because it was so draining last time that it made me unwell for the week (on-going health issues in the background) and it would be better if she got public transport so we could enjoy the time together more. I said I would help with the money and go halves with her (considering I paid for all of the petrol for the last visit I think halves the second time is fair).  She refused and then said she would come for only 4 days as a friend would go and get her instead on the later day. Then that friend suddenly can’t do it either so she says she won’t come at all. 

This all happened over the course of 2 days. I was incredibly excited that I get to spend 6 whole days, and then 4 whole days with my lady. And then she just doesn’t want to come at all because she has to take a bus. She couldn’t be bothered to sleep/watch movies for 4 hours while it’s perfectly acceptable for me to drive for 6-7 hours straight. I called her out on it saying it was selfish and she didn’t think of me. 

She ended the relationship there and then. 

I asked if she only liked me when I was doing things for her, obviously she got super offended and now I’m the asshole in her opinion.

I started working right after college and would say that I am financially stable. 

My girlfriend hasn’t been working and will be attending graduate school in the fall. She doesn’t plan on getting a job anytime soon until she graduates in 3-4 years due to her school’s work load and not having any time.

Her parents are responsible for all her finances and help pay for her tuition, rent, etc. 

She has a debit card for a joint bank account with her parents to spend on food, but it’s heavily monitored. She rarely uses it and it’s mainly seen as an emergency thing. If a purchase is too big on the debit card, her parents would usually question her about it. 

Right now, she’s been living with me this summer and whenever we go out to eat, I end up paying for all the food related expenses. She usually never offers to pay or help split the bill. The last time she’s paid for our meal was probably early on in the relationship when it was my birthday.

It’s not necessary taking a major toll on me financially but it would be nice to have some help in terms of food expenses.

c0rnl8	2019-06-15 01:03:32		AITA for being a software pirate?	"I use pirated versions of virtual instrument software (plus a few other types) because I'm very anticlass and anti-capitalism and anti-corporate. I believe companies are out there to press every penny out of your pockets.

My philosophy is that:

It's okay to use pirated software because the producers aren't going to get after you for it, due to jursidiction limits, evidence restrictions, and a lack of interest in spending the time and money going after small fry copyright violations.

If buying the software supports the company financially, then apparently, as far as supporting the original software developers goes, buying the software legally actually hurts them by strengthening the status quo of exploitative employment practices and intellectual property ownership, and it's better to actually just send the individual developers money if your intention is to support them, and circumvent the exploitative business they're employed by altogether.

If you pay for the software, it's just saying ""yeah keep being a greedy corporation and abuse your workers and your customers' wallets"". If you pirate it, you say ""Yeah you ain't getting money out of me. I'm taking your program because your business and price are unfair."" Being arrested for taking a piece of software for free is stupid.

And as far as money goes, most of their money comes from licensing their product en masse to other companies, not selling licenses to individual users.

Software companies like Microsoft, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, and others are very greedy and only speak money.

Plus the companies already have tons of money from them licensing their products in bulk to other companies that use them, a few pirates aren't going to shut the whole company down.

Fuck work. Capitalists just want to force us to subvert our identities to line their pockets. They don't give half a shit about ""rewarding hard work"", or they'd pay more than the bare minimum they're legally allowed to.

Now for the ""interpersonal conflict""?

c0rnab	2019-06-15 01:02:37	DeadSince2012	AITA for refusing to be friends with someone?	"(first time on the sub, mobile user, non native English speaker)

For context: I'm a girl, almost finishing high school.

This year I moved into a new school. I'm not a very social person and have difficulties making friends, so when this girl in my class started talking to me I was very excited.

She's very sweet and we have the same interests. When I started spending more time with her she introduced me to her small group of friends, that consisted of another girl and a boy. I get along well with the boy but I just can't seem to make myself like the other girl.

She's not a jerk or anything, our personalities just don't go well together. She has very conservative views, almost faints everytime I say ""fuck"" and has a very childlike mind still. Unfortunately, she seems to have taken a liking for me. I don't understand why, since I only interact with her when needed.

Last month she was diagnosed with severe anxiety and took a break from school. With her leaving we have acquired a new member for our group of friends, and only the girl who initially talked to me keeps in touch with her. 

I like the way our friend group is now and I don't want it to change. I would like for her to get the necessary treatment and only come back next year, when we'll no longer be in the same class. I'm afraid that if/when she comes back to school my uninterested attitude may worsen her anxiety, but at the same time I don't wanna pretend to like her. Mostly because I don't wanna have to go through that work but also because it would be dishonest of my part.

I'm also afraid that if I express my dislike towards her the rest of my new friends will stop talking to me.

I think it's important to notice that I am not rude towards her neither do I ignore her when she's talking to me. I just don't start any type of interaction and will not try to keep a conversation going. I'm always polite but it's clear that I am not interested in her.

I would go out at least three times a week, always finding something to do. I enjoy live music, I enjoy breweries, I just enjoy treating myself.

Since then, we’ve gotten married, we’ve had a son who is one years old now, and I’ve kind of settled down. It’s rare for me to go out, especially because my husband likes to stay home all the time. He works hard and is it older than me and just isn’t interested in going out on a Friday night. 

Tonight, is my girlfriends birthday and she along with my sister and some other friends asked if I would come out since I never do. I knew my husband would have a problem with it so I kindly asked if he’d be OK with it and if he would stay home with our son. He reluctantly said yes but when he got home from work and I was ready to leave, he was upset and started telling me that I need to settle down and stop going out. He said he didn’t think I would actually want to go out and that I was just seeing what he would say. 

I’m so confused because my husband is usually very level headed and always looks at situations from all perspectives. My gut is telling me that it might be a jealousy issue but I give him no reason to be jealous. I’m going out with my sister and some of our girlfriends, I purposely dressed very modestly and I told him I would keep him updated with everywhere that we go.

Recently I had to have two of them extracted again because of a bad infection. So right now, I don't have any nails on my great toes, but the wounds are cleared up and there's basically just smooth skin. Nothing special.

My friends (a group of 17-18F/M) are being way too dramatic about this. They think my nail problems are extremely gross and play up their disgust for laughs. It was funny at first but it's annoying at this point.

When I told them I was going to get my bandages taken off for good, they asked me how I would mask the lack of nails. So I said I wouldn't and probably shouldn't at the moment because they have to grow back on.

They said I shouldn't be a jerk and make other people uncomfortable by wearing open toe shoes. It's really not that gross at all, I think they're being too dramatic. Besides it's summer and suffocatingly hot in here, no sane person's wearing sneakers and socks anymore.

c0rhq0	2019-06-15 00:45:20	whosbeesaremywhatnow	AITA for calling out my friends wedding invitation?	"So my two longtime friends, one for 20 years, sent out their wedding invites which I got yesterday. Simple invites, addressed envelope with a simple single card inside. I happen to have a gf of almost two years. Both of my friends know her, have hung out with her, been to parties, dinners, ski trips, etc. My gf does not live with me. So I get the invite and its addressed to ""My Full Name and Guest"". The inside card was not addressed. This seemed odd to me, so I checked a bunch of wedding sites and they all said that couples invites should have both names, whether they live together or not. Or you send and invite to each person if you know both of them well.

So I text my two soon to be married friends, I thank them for the invite, tell them how excited I am, and then say that I was disheartened that they didn't include my gf's name on the invite. They are not apologetic. At all. They say that they meant no disrespect but that was the way they were told to do it by their wedding planner, that it makes perfect sense to them, and they see nothing wrong with it.

Fair enough, I respond that based on what I read I still think it should have both our names. The whole time I'm just picturing what would have happened had my gf come over the day I got the invite and seen that she was ""and guest"". I mean would anyone NOT be a bit bothered by that?

So my one friend responds again that it was so rude for me to even bring this up, and shes so upset that she's shaking. They also say a couple times that I was the only person that even got a +1 (we don't have any other single friends even dating anyone) and seem to imply that  I'm being ungrateful for the +1 by even bringing this up. Again, I just think of how my gf would feel being referred to as ""and guest"". I apologized to them again and say I meant to offense, and left it at that.

AITA for thinking my gf should be addressed by her name on a wedding invite?

&#x200B;

Update: After reading that I was universally determined to be the asshole, I sent my friends a long email and apologized fully. That being said I still don't agree with most of the comments (the spirit of the comments, not that I wasn't an asshole). I don't think this is friendship ruining, and I feel bad for you and your friends if you do. I think many people didn't read my entire post, or didn't read it well, based on many of the reactions and assumptions made. I don't see how this made me self centered or think that i'm the center of the universe. I also don't think that just because people are getting married they are exempt from ever doing anything wrong. At the end of the day I saw this as one friend trying to address being a little hurt, intentionally or not, by two other friends, and I don't agree with many of the characterizations suggesting otherwise.

But I appreciate all the feed back and it's given me a lot to think about, even over something that at the end of the day is fairly minor.

Also this was my first reddit post, so it was one to remember!

Update #2: Won't be replying anymore. I only meant to clarify and explain various aspects of what happened. Thanks for all the advice.

**Final Update: Well reddit may have been correct in calling me an asshole, but not much else. After writing my apologetic email, my friend wrote back and said they actually thought it was initially romantic that I stuck up for my gf, but then they got offended when it seemed like I didn't buy their reasoning, which is 100% valid. They then said that everything is totally fine, of course they still want us at the wedding (I had joked that I hope we were still invited), and that we should plan a double date soon.**

**So for those of you that jumped right to this being a friendship ruiner...y'all are some oversensitive, petty peeps. Talk to your friends. If you think this is the kind of thing that ends friendships, you've got some pretty weak friendships. PEACE!**"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0rhlj	2019-06-15 00:45:01	lowserotoninlevels	WIBTA if I decided to back out of being a bridesmaid at my best friend’s wedding?	"So my best friend (19) is getting married in two months. I’ve been her friend for 8 years. However, there has always been a slight disconnect between us because of our religion differences. I never thought I would be invited to her wedding because of this. However even though I’m a bridesmaid, there is no formal ceremony and I have to wait outside until they’re married (she’s LDS) and I’m basically only there for pictures. 
She’s also moving the week after her wedding, so I may never see her again because she doesn’t seem to have interest in keeping up after she moves. 

In the last year, she has distanced herself from me. We only see each other maybe every few months even though we only live 10min away.  She spends all of her time with her fiancé, which I guess is understandable. I always try to talk to her but she hardly responds nowadays. The only time we talk is her complaining about her wedding details to me. 

I’m kind of tired of her distancing herself when I’m still willing to communicate with her and be her friend and I am debating saying that I don’t want to be in her wedding because she has distanced herself from me.

c0rhju	2019-06-15 00:44:52	throwaway3984502	AITA for taking “me” time instead of helping my mom with her business?	"My mom started her own business and works from home. She’s constantly putting herself under a lot of pressure but refuses to hire someone to help because she doesn’t want to pay them. She doesn’t want to rent an office because she likes the convenience of being at home. Her business has taken over our house and she doesn’t know how to separate work from home. There’s piles of stuff in every room, including my bedroom now (I can send pics via PM), and she has her husband lift heavy packages and make deliveries every day for her even though he also has a job to deal with. 

I’m currently a med student about to start my 3rd year rotations. I just took my board exam (Step 1) and went on vacation with friends for a week. I cut my vacation short to fit in 3 days to spend in my hometown, mainly to hang out with parents, high school friends, and unwind/do nothing. 

Ever since waking through the front door on the night my plane landed (I had to uber home from the airport cause she was too busy to pick me up), my mom has been nagging me to help her with her business. She has woken me up at 8am every morning, yelled and complained whenever I left the house to get food with friends, and told me to stop napping/reading/drawing whenever I tried. I’ve already helped her the past 2 days instead of relaxing and helped her 4 hours this morning. I fly back to school tomorrow and I l told her I’ve had enough of this, I’m going to take a nap. I slept for 2 hours (I was so tired) and when I woke up I found her crying and refusing to talk to me. She finally broke the silence and said that she treats me very well since she pays for my housing and tuition, so the least I could do for her is help her with the business when I’m home. I told her I really appreciate that she’s financially supporting me, but I’m also incredibly stressed in school and needed time to unwind and clear my mind before I start my surgery rotation. I also told her I’m her daughter, not her employee, and it’s not fair to expect me to come home and work for her from 8-5 every day. And I’ve already done that the past two days + this morning, I’ve literally had no time to myself and coming here ended up adding more stress than going back to school early. I’m exhausted from studying for boards, traveling was great but also tiring, I got sick from the plane, I’m jet lagged 9 hours, and I just wanted to take a nap.

Reddit, am I being a spoiled brat? I love my mom but I think she’s expecting too much of me when I’m home. I’m also worried she’s going to have a stroke cause she’s so high strung. She doesn’t eat healthy, skips lunch most days, doesn’t exercise, doesn’t do anything fun for herself...I’ve already told her her health and well-being is more important than money but of course she says she doesn’t have time for any of that."

c0rh6o	2019-06-15 00:43:52	Cranksta	AITA For wanting my BF to pay his portion of rent while he's deployed?	"So my BF and I have been together nearly three years at this point and he's planning on getting into the military at the end of the year.

Us and two other roommates are about to move into a larger rental home to accommodate all of our needs and give us more privacy from each other.

The BF and I usually take the master as our roommates are single, but we split everything evenly which roughly equates to the BF and I paying half of the bills with our combined portions.

The BF and I have been discussing practicalities and trying to plan for him to be away from home (and thus be unable to control most of his accounts while abroad) and we've got most everything ironed out except for this: I want him to continue paying his portion of rent while he's away.

His portion is just shy of $500 while he's expecting to make just shy of 2k per month to start with while away. I'm not asking him to pay utilities (he won't be using them obvs) or anything, but I feel that it's only fair he continue paying his portion of rent.

Why?

We're about to get a more expensive place and putting a double portion on me is incredibly unfair as my income could not reasonably support that. If he's going to stop paying when he's away then I don't want to move.

His stuff will be here. Safe and cared for. Including his car.

He'll be living here when back from deployment- to a home completely put together with all of his stuff just waiting for him.

To him- if he's not living here then he shouldn't have to pay anything. We discuss it often and I see his point but I really can't budge on this not only because it doesn't make sense financially but it also makes me feel taken advantage of.

If he wants to be totally removed from his responsibilities at home that's cool- but he can take his stuff to his parents house then and let me and the roommates find a place that suit our needs only. I can't help but feel he wants everything to be as easy as possible without contributing to it.

I am female as is my wife.

In 2016 my then 16yo stepdaughter (SD) reported physical abuse from her father (she lived with)regarding her & what he was going to do to punish her. The school called us bc the resource officer got a judge to sign off on her coming here & we drove 17 hours straight (& back) to get this kid.   
  
For months she stole from me, she lied. She ran off repeatedly. She even had my wife arrested on false DV charges. I threw her out after that.
    
We didn't hear from her other than the occasional request for $ until Nov (the arrest was in April) & she was PREGNANT. I flew her here. For the first month, SD threatened BabyDaddy with staying here and threatening us with leaving. She worked for McDonald's for a couple of months when she got here but quit because she felt she shouldn't have to work.  
   
She spent about $400 on baby stuff before she quit working. She paid no rent, nothing for food even though that was the agreement. .She refused to get any assistance. I paid for the rest of the baby stuff- from Nov until Apr25 I paid for EVERYTHING for her and the baby. INCLUDING HER CIGARETTES AND JUUL PODS! She was stealing cigarettes from us & when I refused to buy them, she would have a MELTDOWN. BD pd 0.  
   
The baby was 8 pounds 8 ounces and 100% healthy somehow. 
  
2 wks to the day the baby was born BD got her a flight & she took the baby BACK to stay with him & his family in the basement of his mom's house.   We were told it was a visit. 
    
I got a text begging me to buy her ""a ticket so we can come home"". Next day she changed her mind. BD had been drinking & acted like an ass (his favorite name for her is ""stupid bitch"" ).
   

**BD does not have a job nor does SD. This week is the 1st mention of moving medicaid to there - after 7 weeks!!!**    
    

Yesterday SD asked me to pay for the baby's birth certificate so she could sign up for that state's version of Medicaid - a total of $43.50 (fees & she HAD to have overnight shipping). I texted my wife & asked her & she said don't do it - it's their baby, that is such a basic thing & she should do it herself.   
My stepdaughter texted me the following:   

1. I should pay for it because BD ""couldn't be in"" our state for the birth & he's ""not even on the birth certificate"" and ""she doesn't even have his last name"" & I was ""so mean to him he was afraid to come here"" yet I had told him it was OK.

2. Because my wife doesn't work (by our own agreement), BD ""shouldn't be judged for not working"". Neither should SD since she ""hasn't been cleared by a doctor to go back to work"".   
    
3. If I don't send SD  the $ she won't send any more pics of the baby to either myself or my wife. No videos, no news, nothing.    

SD sent me a text after I said no that she would get BD's mom or sister to get it. If it was that urgent why even ask me if she can go to them & why didn't she do this sooner?

c0rc0h	2019-06-15 00:27:54	kcharlto	AITA for not taking down a social media post about my ex husband?	"My (28F) ex husband (31M) has been an addict for almost half of his life. When we first met, he was upfront about his past usage, but at that point, he was clean. We dated for two years before we had our daughter, got married shortly after that, and then ten months later, I was filing for divorce. 

During our relationship, he slipped into alcoholism. Around the time we got married, when our daughter was an infant, he relapsed on drugs. He hid his drug usage from me, though we would argue a lot about his drinking. After a night where I found myself wrestling his shotgun away from him, I fled with my daughter. It was a week before her first birthday. 

My intent when I left was to reconcile after he was clean and safe to be around. When he threatened both my and my daughter’s life, I filed for divorce and obtained a temporary protective order. Our divorce took 13 months, largely so that he could remain on my insurance to go to rehab, which I was more than happy to do. The divorce ended after two rounds of mediation, where it was agreed that I would have full custody, and he would have visitation at my discretion, provided he had clean drug tests. 

The divorce was finalized over two years ago. In that time, his drug addiction got much, much worse. The verbal and emotional abuse escalated as well. This past February, I received hundreds of angry, threatening texts and had dozens of incoherent voicemails. I attempted to obtain a no contact order of some sort from the court, but was denied. 

Throughout the entire divorce process and in the years following, only my parents knew what was happening. It changed in February. I posted screenshots of some of the texts I had received. Opening up about what was happening in my life was, admittedly, cathartic. It was nice to not feel alone and to receive support. 

In March, he went to rehab again. For the first time, he actually stayed the full 90 days and completed the program. I was able to unblock him from my phone, and we’ve had some good conversations since then. He asked me a few days ago if I had posted anything about his past behavior, and I told him that I had. 

Today, he called me and asked me to remove the post. He explained it was causing him extreme anxiety, and even asked if I actually wanted him to be sober. I told him that of course I want him to be clean and be able to actually be a father to our daughter (now almost 4), but I wasn’t going to take it down. 

It feels to me that he is trying to place the responsibility of his sobriety and success on me. It also feels like taking it down would be covering up for him, yet again. I spent years struggling with his abuse alone, and I just don’t want to do that again.

Dave has always been a dick to me since day 1. He would always ask for other people to help him instead of me. Always give me snarky attitude. Talk about me behind my back to co-workers. I always just hated this guy. 

I quit this job and years later found myself working here again. I took the job and told my boss that I will do anything for him except help Dave. He laughs and says sure. As luck would have it I've been pretty good to avoid this guy. But today I got him on the phone. The regular guy Dave wants to talk to his on holidays. My boss is in a call with his boss. And my other coworker is helping a customer. 

""Hi, is Brandon there?""

""No, he's off""

""Ok, how about your boss?""

""He's on a call""

""Ok. Well I need this looked up""

""Ok, you can call back later if you want""

""How about you just do your fucking job or get me someone who will""

""Yeah. No problem""

So I put him on hold. My co worker was with a customer already. I ended up helping somebody too. Finally my coworker is done and I transfer Dave over. He helps Dave out and gets his shit done. Easy. 

""He said he's coming over to kick your ass""

""Oh. Cool. And he wonders why I refused to help him""

Dave then talked to my boss about it, and now wants bring it up to a higher up. I think it's whatever honestly. I want nothing to do with this guy. I do however feel like an asshole because my boss now has to deal with this shit. My boss said next time I should probably just help him. I keep thinking I probably should have just sucked it up and just helped the guy too.

c0r851	2019-06-15 00:15:59	omerkha	AITA for confronting a guy for taking pictures of kids at a park?	"## Took my niece and nephew to the park today. There are only few people in the swing enclosure, me and the kids and another young couple with two kids playing in the sand pit area and a man by himself on one of the swings.

At first I didn't think any thing of the man on the swing. As im pushing my niece on the swing I start to take note of the man next to us on the swing by him self. He looked liked he was in his late 30's, white male, he is wearing black jeans, dark blue jacket, tinted glasses and a black hat, and he has his phone out. I start to notice, he is kind of pointing his phone in the direction of the sand pit area which is about 40 feet away, where there is couple facing away from us and their two kids. At this point im not sure but I think he was taking pictures of the kids in the sand pit area. I get closer and im standing few feet away from him with my body turned towards my niece's swing but my head directly at his phone. Suspicion confirmed, he is taking pictures of the kids in the sand pit. He wasn't taking pictures like you would normally, with the phone in front of your face so you can see the picture on the screen, it was at a weird angle, he had his phone down my his knees and taking pictures from there.

Thoughts are running through my head, should I tell the parents of the couple, should I call the police, should I confront him? By this time me and kids are moving to different part of the swing area and my thought is, if he points that phone at my kids direction, then im going to lay into him.

Anyway I couldn't help my self, to me this guy was a low life, scum of the earth, loner type, probably part of some online ring. It is out of character for me but just went up to the guy and im standing too close to him for comfort, right in his face and said ''what are you doing, your taking pictures of those kids''. I felt so ready to unleash all my wrath on this guy and he just said '' yeah, that is my kid''.

Tuned out one of the kids was his and his kid decided to go play in sand pit with another random kid. I apologised and kind of explained myself, he and I both had an awkward laugh and moved on. I felt bad because after I did that, he started calling out to his kid, just to prove that in fact was his kid some loner in a park taking picture of random kids . AITA?

After reading comments so far -

&#x200B;

Firstly I am happy I wrote this. I believe criticism to be a good thing and its proofed to be correct because in all honesty I didn't see my faults in this situation until reading some of your lots comments. I didn't think I was the AH before posting this but now I think I probably was. Controlling your emotions is not easy and I guess I let them get the better of me at that time. There was a better way to handle this. Now I regret what I said and could have approached it in a better manner.

&#x200B;

After reading some of the comments, I think some people assumed I am a women and have a issue with dads taking kids to park, but im a uncle taking my kids to the park.

&#x200B;

I am shocked at people thinking AITA for saying anything or approaching anyone (clear from the downvotes, this is one time I could not give a dame about downvotes. ). If i live that moment again and picture what I saw, I would do it again a million times. but in a better manner of course. 

&#x200B;

Lastly do I regret approaching said person, dame no, I am happy I was wrong but everyone should have the guts to stand up and say something if shit  don't look right, how would I have felt if I didn't say anything, would this title have read, AITA for not saying anything, when I saw a guy taking picture of kids at a park?"

c0r6qx	2019-06-15 00:12:11	Deldris	AITA for defending my 7th grade teacher's actions?	"I've had this conversation with my wife a few times and we always end up disagreeing and she thinks the teacher was an asshole and, as such, I'm an asshole by extension of defending him.

So my 7th grade teacher (Mr.B) had a system of discipline that went like this : if he asked for quite and you were heard talking after he asked for quite you got your name put on the board. If it happened again, you got a tally next to your name. If you got a 2nd tally, you were sent outside for 20 minutes or so, regardless of weather conditions. There was no cover to stand under. The board was wiped at the end of the week.

So pretty much everyone got their name on the board at one point or another except one kid. We'll call him Vlad. Vlad was a friend of mine, real quite and reserved type. He barely talked at all, so it was unsurprising that he never ended up on the board.

One day near the end of the year Mr. B asks for quite and everyone stops talking, except Vlad who finished saying a couple words to me. Well the room was dead silent so everyone heard him. Everyone hard stares at Mr. B as it was like an unspoken anticipation of Vlad's name finally getting on the board. But it doesn't. Mr. B shrugs and goes on with the lesson.

The class is immediately outraged. Several students demand his name be put on the board. Realizing he wasn't going to be able to just move on, Mr. B says something along the lines of ""Well this is a lesson for all of you. Sometimes if you make someone's life easier, they'll make yours easier. Especially if they have authority over you.""

Now, my wife thinks it's unfair, and while I agree that it's unfair I think it's a good life lesson. Not everything is always going to be fair and people are going to play favorites. My wife thinks that it sends the wrong message, that you can get away with bad behavior if you're good most of the time and we shouldn't think like that.

tl;dr teacher didn't discipline a kid because he was good 99% of the time and tried to make it a life lesson. I agree, the wife doesnt.

c0r6jt	2019-06-15 00:11:40	TechnicallyCrazy	AITA For holding a grudge against my mom?	"Okay so basically I hold a lot of... ill feelings towards my own mother. My dad died when I was 7 so I was ""raised"" by a single mother my whole life. Me and my two siblings lived at our grandparents house, but in reality I was raised by my older sister. She made sure me and my brother had clothes and taught us a lot about how to act, stuff that I feel my mom should have done. I'm 19 years old right now, by the way, if that makes a difference. Anyways my mom didn't live at the house with us, she always lived with whatever boyfriend she had at the time. With this in mind, she was pretty much absent throughout the most important years of our lives. The thing about my grandma's house was that we were raised around a lot of anger. My uncle was a vile deadbeat who never had a job and slept on the couch. He was a nasty man who would scream at us for no reason. I never felt safe and neither did my siblings. In fact, he almost killed my older sister when I was young because he got mad and started strangling her. I never felt at home at my own home. I longed for my mom until i realized she was never going to get us out of that mess. I hated it there and it had a huge impact on the mental health of all my siblings. A few years ago, I found out that she wasn't only just absent, but she was on meth my whole childhood. The months and months at a time I wouldn't see her, she would be on drugs. She admitted this to me when she was getting clean. It's been about 4 years since then and as far as I know she's trying to clean up her act. She has a job now, shes clean, and everything. The thing is she always tells us how sorry she is. I know she feels guilty and is trying to change but I just can't listen to her. If she really felt guilty she wouldn't have left us on our own with our abusive piece of shit uncle living with us. If she really felt bad, she wouldn't have left her kids to go do meth. She's a better person now, and is trying but I just can't. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense. Just like don't have kids if you're not going to actually raise them you know? Deep down inside I feel like the asshole because she's making an effort at least. but to me it feels too late you know. The damage has been done and yeah. I want to forgive my mom for everything but I just can't seem to do it. I don't think I ever will, no matter how much change she shows me."	Not the A-hole	0	0	478.0	10.0	0.0	0.0

My husband and I got married at the justice of the peace in mid May. It was a quick, simple ceremony that took about 20 mins. with only our parents and my friend who is a professional photographer present. I asked my friend to be our photographer, and he offered to do it for free. We said no way, we're paying him, and managed to get him to accept $75. The amount is low because it was literally just 6 people at a 20 min ceremony and my husband and I only wanted like 10 pics. Wedding goes great and my friend said the photos would be done in 2 weeks.

Anyways, 2 weeks go by, we ask how the photos are, and he says hes still working on them and that life is hectic. Another week goes by, we ask, he says he fell and cut his stomach at his day job and that life is hectic, but he'll send the pics that night. I say I'm sorry he's hurt, etc. Another week goes by, we didnt get anything, we ask how he is, he says life is hectic and sends us a few photos, but he says hes still working on the group photos of the family.. it's been a month. I just want the pictures of our family at our wedding. I know he got injured, but it was minor and it's literally just like 10 pictures. 

I'm sympathetic that he got injured, but I'm also getting impatient. I also do photoshop and can edit photos myself. Would I be the asshole if I just ask for the photos so I can edit them myself?

Tldr: friend is a photographer and photographs our short civil ceremony that only has 6 people at it. A month later, we only got a few photos of my husband and I, but are waiting on photos of the family. WIBTA if I ask for the photos so I can edit them myself."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

Me and my grandpa went a Popeyes around 2 months ago, and here is some important details 

\-There is a classic dining table with a guy sitting on one side, so the other side is empty

\-Every other table is full

\-IDK if this is important, but there is a total of 3 people going to that side of the table, which is me, my younger brother (5), and my grandpa

Anyways here is the story.

I ordered some food while my brother and grandfather looked for a seat, which is across from where the guy sits. They sit across the guy and waits for me with the food. 3 minutes in and the guy goes: ""You could just ask me to sit here you know?"" in a manner that is like he owns the damn place. Me being an introvert goes: ""Ohh sorry he (my grandpa) doesn't English, sorry about that."" But later in my head I go- Wait a second, I've never heard of someone asking to sit across someone in a restaurant, tf? So now I'm here awaiting my judgement.

I got a new puppy a few weeks ago and not fully potty trained but never had this type of accident before. While visiting my best friend she had an accident on something. I told her I would pay for it to be cleaned and I tried to set up the account right then. Problem is I already had an order for cleaning at my house so they wouldn't let me add another or change the active. I gave her the link and my CC number to set up an account. This was a few days ago (after I told her they have same day service) and I asked her if she was able to get it cleaned yet. She said no, that she hasn't had time to set up the account and just going to throw it away now. It is easily still cleanable and takes 5 minutes for the account setup while a trip to the store will take over an hour and be significantly more expensive ($30 vs $300+). Hell, even the round trip uber costs more than the cleaning. Not to mention she probably has never cleaned said item. This with past activities makes it seem like she is trying to get a new item better one out of me, hers was towards the $300 range that she didn't even buy. I gave her the link again and mentioned the time difference but not the cost difference. WIBTA is I told her if she wants a new one I will only give her the value of the cleaning?

c0r0o1	2019-06-14 23:54:27		AITA for breaking my college friend group	"4 friends, J, D, N & me. 

J was the type of guy that would frequently make insulting jokes about our friends. We always enabled, “A’s just messing around” 

D & N would usually just follow what the majority wanted or whoever had an opinion. We would hang out weekly either grabbing dinner together or playing board games. 

Fast forward 5 years & we’ve all graduated. 

J was having some difficulty looking for a job. I recommended him to my boss & get him hired. When I would ask him to work on a task he would look me straight in the face & say, “You’re just want to give me your work,” followed by some laughter. We work on the same project, & I was to train him

Its Friday night & we had a deadline on Monday. We would still need to come in & do some major work over the weekend. Js girlfriend’s birthday was the next day & they had made plans to go to an amusement park. J asked me if it was ok for him to leave a little early & get some sleep, assuring he would be in the office on Sunday. 

I told him, “Go have fun” & stayed there until 4am. Both weekend days working excess of 12 hours, J never showed up. To get some rest, I started coming into work about half an hour later than my usual that week. (We supposedly had a flexible schedule.)

Then, our boss reprim&s us for being late to work. J then speaks up that he sees me taking breaks during the work day on top of being tardy. At the time, I was in the process of finding a place to live, the breaks being calls to utility companies, & J knew, my boss didn’t. 

I talked to “A” afterwards & asked him about throwing me under the bus, to which he replied with “You need to have more discipline.” I thought it was messed up. I brought this incident up to our group of friends, & they essentially laughed & said, “A’s just messing around, it’ll be okay.” I decided to just shrug it off as “J being J.”

Maybe I was hyper-sensitive after the recent events but whenever J would make an insulting joke about me & the others would join in I would tell them to stop, but would always get countered with “joking.” I was the only one with an iPhone & J then says something along the lines of “trashy phone, trashy owner” I get pissed & I vocalize that to everyone, which J claims is me lashing out for being “hangry” & D & N accept the excuse. 

I changed jobs, used “getting used to my new company” as an excuse to stop seeing my friends. 

An entire year went by without starting conversation, but I would reply when they contact me. On D’s birthday, I figured that it was time to move on & start things over with them at dinner. It went well.

The next day, J texts my girlfriend calling me out for “not being a good friend” & being a “horrible communicator” that never expressed how I felt & shares the entire conversation in our group chat. I leave the group chat & block J on all forms of communication. Found out from D & N that the group has stopped hanging out together"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I work in a small IT office on my campus and have a shared work space with a couple of other people who also have the same position as me. One of my coworkers is Paul and he is relatively new (\~2 weeks). The other co-worker in my space is Cindy. I will be honest/straight forward and say that I have never really liked Cindy since the moment I started my job a year ago. She is inconsiderate more often than not (i.e. always made me answer the front door because I was ""the new guy"", chews with her mouth open whether its her gum/lunch, eats in the conference room where we have weekly meetings and never cleans up after herself, coughs without covering her mouth, sips any drink she has down to the very last sip, never says please or thank you when asking to use things on my desk or for whenever people take out her personal trash can.) She is a fairly nice person, however, she just has a lot of mannerisms that are odd and rude IMO. 

The one that primarily annoys me (aside from chewing with her mouth open, because c'mon now) is her inability to stay out of conversations that aren't specific to her. I've been trying to help our new guy/get him set up/train him and there are times where she will turn her chair towards me, pull out her headphones, watch the conversation I have with my boss/the new guy, and listen. She'll just sit there watching and listening. And then whenever a conversation turns personal for a sec or a joke is made in the conversation, something, she will interrupt by trying to add to the conversation/joke. Or if it's work related - we work in completely different aspects of our primary database btw - she will interrupt and try to give her two cents about what me and another co-worker/my boss are trying to talk about. She will also carry all of these mannerisms over to non-work events like happy hours and team lunches. And yet, after a year of being here, I seem to be the only one who notices these things as other coworkers I talked to about it said they never noticed.

I am going off to a conference with her next week and am not looking forward to spending the amount of time with her that I have to. We are going to all of the same conference sessions and are doing staff meals and I just can't see myself holding it together. I get the sense from her that she knows I don't care much for her because of these mannerisms, and I even reached out to one of my supervisors about it only for him to suggest that I talk to her about the loud chewing, interrupting conversations, and basically everything else she does that is annoying (which in itself has no roundabout/easy approach IMO w/o coming off as rude & awkward)

&#x200B;

TL;DR I work with someone who essentially is a slob and does not quite get social cues or mannerisms for that matter and I want to tell her what I think about it/maybe put an end to a couple of them"	Asshole	0	0	495.0	65.0	0.0	0.0

She's planning a party for 2 months from now and asked me to do some craft things. She called me today and questioned my progress: odd questions like how many coats of paint I used, then asked when I'll be done. I said well we have two months. She then proceeded to tell me she needs things done soon so she can put them in a box in the basement. At which point I hung up. She has now decided to write me off of the next few get togethers planned, call me selfish and told me my bff is more help than me. Mind you she never asked me to help with anything but this. I'm lending her things for this event as well and basically whatever she's asked for I said sure np.

I hung up because the whole convo felt like an interrogation with the need for a 'soon' deadline rude imo. I'm doing this on my spare time.

Anyway, she sent a number of insulting messages after and I told her I'm done with the convo for the night since it is not productive. She then said she will no longer reply to any messages from me and that she'll answer her phone if she feels like it. So I said 'you made you bed'.

So, I have a childhood friend who I’ve known for 15 years. We haven’t kept in touch often since college, but I still consider him a good friend. He attends a top med school now not too far from where I live, but we haven’t seen each other in some time. Growing up, we had a really close relationship because he had gone through some tough times, like I have, as teenage immigrants in America. And we’ve both overcome many obstacles and we’re both very successful and fortunate. Recently, I learned via social media that his wife was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. I know he must be going through so much now so when I saw the gofundme link that was sent around, I donated a significant amount of money and sent a nice message. I wanted to make sure he received the message and I also wanted to reconnect, as I said, we were very close and had a lot in common. So I tagged him in my post and also shared the gofundme page to encourage my friends to donate as well. On Monday, I saw that he untagged me in the post, and didn’t respond to my message. I know he’s going through a lot, but not only was it a significant amount of money, I was surprised to not hear back from him at all. I also saw that he was liking and loving other posts and posting thank you messages to other people. I find it strange that he could make the effort to untag himself to my post without responding or even acknowledging me or my contribution. WIBTA if I requested a refund of my donation? I’m not expecting fireworks or a huge reply, but just some type of acknowledgement or acceptance of my gift and my concern that his wife gets the treatment that she needs. AMITA here?

Before she moved in she asked if she could pay a bill so she didn't feel like she was freeloading so I told her I'd see what my cheapest bill was because she had been complaining about finances and I didn't want her to pay too much. 
She moved in mid March and I began babysitting for her April 1st. March, April and May she didn't spend many nights at my house because she was spending almost every night with her parents. She didn't buy any diapers in April in exchange for watching her child and only began to in May because I kept asking her to get them. She hasn't once paid the electric bill and I haven't forced the issue because she was basically using her room as a storage and not actually staying here.
Now her husband is here with her (day 3) and I told her that we needed to discuss groceries because they weren't included in the dinner count for the month. She's mad that I didn't buy them groceries because I knew that her husband would be here at my house but she never actually made it clear that he would be staying here. They're going through a divorce and according to the husband he's supposed to be living at my house while she lives with her parents but that was never discussed with me. She's purchased my kids 2-5 outfits each and a couple toys and has given me rides to the grocery store and doctor appointments which I appreciate but I'm still feeling kind of taken advantage of and I'm hurt that she's mad at me for not including them in the dinner count. She knows that I'm not working and that I'm behind on bills but still feels that she needed to be included in the dinner count even though no finances have been discussed since March.

I'm graduating from college in a year. On my dad's side he has a few sisters, but I only get along with 2/4. For reasons I won't get into (mainly because it'll be flagged, I tried already), there was an incident years ago with a cousin and I which resulted in my aunt (his step mom) defending his side and placing the blame on me. A sister of hers convinced my entire non-immediate family that I was lying etc. She made a really cruel remark at the time and I have never forgiven her or forgotten it, and do not want her at my graduation. The other one I don't want because of her contribution into the shit storm.

&#x200B;

I'll be early twenties when I graduate. My dad suggested to invite them because realistically they won't go because distance (he doesn't like them either), just so they can make the decision themselves. I get his point, that I should be an adult and invite them anyway. But on the flip side I really do not want them there. WIBTA if I don't invite them?

I just started seeing a guy I really like a couple weeks ago and last night he stayed over. I had recently talked to my sister about the possibility of bringing him home and she was uncomfortable with the idea but said ""just don't do it on the couch and not when I'm there."" 

The thing is that she's always home. She's pretty anti-social so she's not out with friends ever, she doesn't date, and only works late maybe once a week, and she never tells me when that will be so I can't really schedule around it. I would go to his place, but he lives with family too and has a toddler in the house so it's not like it's any better. 

So last night I said fuck it, and brought him back to the apartment. I shot her an text to let her know he was coming over and when I got home I was careful to be as quiet as possible and play music just in case the sound travelled (the walls aren't paper thin or anything and there's a hallway between our bedrooms).

"So a little clarification is needed; my grandfather died about 1.5 years ago now, and he left behind some things, mostly money and random stuff (he was in a psychiatric ward, for down schizophrenia and delirium, so he didn't pay anything except tax, but still got his welfare, so he was quite good off, for someone on welfare)... Among this was a gold chain, which my dad and his brother split, and he was quite disappointed when his brother sold his half of the gold, since he could've just traded it with dad for a little more of the money, and my dad id a sentimental guy, so that gold meant a lot....
Anyway, we found a solution where I got a gold bracelet made, and he got s ring, and there's was just enough gold left to get my grandmothers ring fixed and sized (a ring she got form my dead Granddad) so everyone would be happy... But then a bit later, when I asked about the money to get it done, he became annoyed that I was trying to claim a large portion of the gold, even tho we agreed that was the split, and he then told me that he considered selling it and spending the money on some finished gold jewelry instead... I, of course, was dissatisfied with this, and got angry and cut the convo there... But im really doubting weather it's okay for me to be mad/disappointed over his choice to sell what is essentially his gold, even tho we made an agreement... Keep in mind that this bracelet would mean the world to me, not because of the gold, but because of the personal value it holds to me....

I (22F) live with a cousin (22F) who doesn’t drive (we live in my parents home). She moved here from another country a few years ago where she drove, but never bothered to get her license here. She relies on friends and family to get her to places and will uber to get to work/school sometimes. For the last two years I’ve been encouraging her to at least take the written exam and she hasn’t done it yet. She tried to take the written exam once and left because there was a *long line* at the DMV. IT’S THE FUCKING DMV. THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A LONG LINE. There is no reason for her to not have her license. We have an extra car that isn’t really being driven which she’s more than welcome to use. She very recently has been asking me more and more (about twice a week) to take her to places, “can you take me to walgreens” “can we get chipotle” “can you take me to the mall” etc. It’s super frustrating because she typically asks when I’m comfortably laying in bed, clearly not running any errands at that time. When I have things to do and need to drive around, I offer her to come along (it’s typically things like grocery shopping, going to target, etc.) and she’ll always turn them down because she’s relaxing. I am literally so over it. The last time she asked me to take her somewhere I told her in a really bitch way “Learn how to fucking drive already. This is the last time I’m doing this for you. Your problems aren’t mine.” I was clearly annoyed during the drive and didn’t speak to her for the rest of the day. Some family members think I’m being an asshole for refusing to help her out but I really don’t think so?

c0qpw2	2019-06-14 23:23:35		AITA for not wanting to visit my brother?	"So the title sounds bad, I know, but here’s some background. 

I (25F) met my half brother (27) Oct 2018 for the first time. We are related via my father, who hasn’t been any part of my life since I was like 3. I don’t consort with my father or his relatives, so dealing with my brother has been difficult for me. He has actively been trying to develop a relationship with me, kind of pushy with it too. Initially when we first met, he said that we should FaceTime every week so that we can develop a relationship. I agreed to it, but inside, wasn’t really feeling it. 

I have made an effort to talk to him weekly and spend time with him. I spent my birthday, thanksgiving, and New Years with him and his wife. We’ve hung out other times too. When I’m not able to hangout with him, he playfully guilts me and says “Oh you can’t hangout with your brother” or “ I’m not worth your time?” Stuff like that. I don’t think it’s funny. For the last 4 months, I was studying for the MCAT, and we would text a few times but I didn’t really have time to hangout with him. Now that the test is over, I have more time, but I don’t really want to hang with him. He always wants me to come to his house which is over an hour away. I wouldn’t mind meeting him somewhere and hanging out, but he doesn’t have a car, and has to Uber everywhere so he is constantly trying to convince me to come to him. 

I believe I hold some resentment towards him considering the dynamic between me and my father. I know my brother has nothing to do with this, but that’s just me. We met for the first time, I was trying my hardest to get out of it, but couldn’t and when we got to the restaurant, I unknowingly found myself drinking a lot. So I definitely feel like I hold some deep emotions towards anyone that has anything to do with my father. Anyway, my brother wants me to drive to his house but I don’t want to.

Reason being is I'm an incredibly light sleeper. I find it difficult to sleep in a new place, let alone sleep in the same bed as someone else.

Many times as a kid I would let my cat sleep in my bed. But it never worked out. We would continually wake each other up.

So in order for me to spend the night I'm probably going to have to ask gf to have the dogs sleep elsewhere. They probably won't stay on the floor because they've been used to sleeping on her bed for a year or two and arent particularly well trained.

I feel like I would be the asshole because the dogs were there first and it is her house.

We went to different colleges so naturally we grew a part but we still kept in touch and I still considered her one of my extremely good friends. She's had a history of horrible relationships. Basically her type is cheaters, douchebags, and straight up f\*\*kers.

&#x200B;

All throughout High School I have always been her support system when it comes to boys. She's the type of friend who would constantly ask for advice and just ignore it and fall into old habits. It got to the point where it was so exhausting being there for her that I was actually excited to go to college and get away from all of her drama.

&#x200B;

She has a new bf now who has cheated on her and abused her. She's also the type to be very public about her relationship so she would always post on her snap, insta, and fb stories (seriously facebook??? like your dad sees that) about all of the horrible things he's done. She's literally exposed his nudes on her insta story because she was so mad at him. But despite all of this she would be back together in 5 days saying how much she loves him all over her social media.

&#x200B;

Over the summer she hits me up to hang out with her and her bf but I literally can't stand their relationship. I've met the guy before once and within 20 min I could tell how much of an asshole he was. I'm tired of making excuses for why I'm so ""busy"". Part of me wants to tell her to leave this guy but I reallllly don't want to get involved in all of her sh\*t and be her support system again. I don't even want to hang out with her alone because I can't stand the fact that she's still with him even after HITTING her. I also feel like I have just outgrown the friendship.

&#x200B;

I hate seeing her stupid social media posts and have just considered unfollowing her all together. I feel embarrassed that I was her best friend and she's posting all of her crap for the world to see. Like I don't want to be associated with that.

This is all happening while our dog whose 60 pounds is on his leash. 

The other day my husband had his briefcase and suit jacket around his arm  and she started riling him up once again and my husband ended up dropping everything on the muddy ground and she didn’t even acknowledge that she just kept playing with him. 

So today I decided I’m going to take the longer inside route to my car so I can avoid walking by her. Well, when I exited the parkade in my car she saw him and started riling him up from outside my car! She was getting really close to the car and he started barking and just going nuts.

About two years ago, we were looking for our first house which turned out to be almost 2 hours away from where we were staying before. At the time of the move, I was in the middle of an important project for my job and didn’t feel like I could abandon it until it was completed, then from which I would move out to a branch of the company closer to our new house. I continued living in our apartment until the lease was up and the project was completed, which occurred roughly around the same time. During that time, I always came up and visited, and have been living together for 10 months. 

However, it’s taken a bit longer for me to get used to living there—think going from a large city to a rural/suburbanish area and I’ve been having a hard time making friends of my own. In the meantime, my extroverted husband met this great group of friends with equally amazing partners. We’ve hung out a few times but a few of the times in the beginning of the friendship have been a little uncomfortable for me. One of the first times I met one of the couples we climbed to the top of this very large structure to have a picnic, and I have a slight phobia of heights. Therefore I didn’t really talk to them much and felt bad about it for awhile. Another time, on New Years, someone had a giant party which we went to, but I literally only knew maybe two people there and my husband kept leaving to go smoke. Luckily I had some of his friends look out for me, but right around this time he started really pointing out how socially awkward I am. 

There’s been a few more incidents like those where I’ve acted a little awkward just to come home and ask me why I did this and why I did that. What’s starting to hurt me which I’m trying not to let get to me is that he has outright said that I ruin everything and that I’m no fun. He has said this in person to me and in writing. I’m trying hard not to let it get to me and writing it off as a clash of personality but those words have been niggling at me a little bit. I’ve noticed that I apologize more (to the point where his friends have noticed and jokingly make fun of me for it) and I noticed I’ve become even more quiet and anxious towards these people which I should know pretty well by now. 

Recently they’ve been starting to invite me personally to events, and not necessarily as a plus one to my partner. I want to say yes and go, but I feel very anxious about being around these people and I’ve expressed that I’m afraid they don’t really like me. My husband writes this off as ridiculous and tries to reassure me, but his words have started to echo.  AITA for being uncomfortable?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	4.0	6.0	0.0	0.0
c0qfv8	2019-06-14 22:56:00		AITA for insulting a couple of kids that weren’t mine?	So I’m having dinner outside with a few friends of mine in a public area. Some loud kids (like age 11-12) are playing outside aswell but mostly keep to themselves. These are the kind of kids that would scream on an airplane or throw a tantrum in the store for not getting their way. As we’re having dinner they’re starting to push their boundaries and actively trying to annoy us. An occasional insult comes our way but we ignore it. They notice the fact that we don’t react and start “playing” closer to us and screaming more. Basicly being more obnoxious. Eventually they’re sitting at a table right behind us laughing with the fact that two of my friends were wearing glasses. Shouting stuff like “Harry Potter’s having dinner” etc. Eventually I snap and yell what the little cunt’s problem is. Saying I’d come over there if they continued. (Obviously I wouldnt but I needed them to realise I was serious). They back off and keep to themselves. As we’re walking back about an hour later we pass a pub. Hear in the background: “Which one was it?”. Low and behold there is the mom sitting outside with her feral children. To give you an idea, trailerpark mom with ginger “Karen” hair, half of her teeth rotten and smoking a sigaret whilst having a beer. Ask our group which one of us called her children “cunts”. I come forward and said I was the one. She starts throwing a tantrum how I am supposed to be an adult and set a good example. Saying her kids aren’t to blame because “they’re only kids”. I laugh away the hypocricy of how I a trailertrash mom is telling me how I should be an example for HER kids. I ignore the rest she says and go about my day.

Anything from a nice leafblower or power washer all the way down to a gift card to a home improvement store. My father will say each year ""I dont need this. Do you want to keep it?"" Or will put my gifts in a special gift closet. Let me explain.

A year ago, he asked me to go to this closet to get something out of it and in this closet, I found the past 6 years worth of fathers day gifts unopened, stuck in the back. This struck a cord with me because money is tight due to have two young children. Day care is expensive! but I never told him what I found as i didnt want to have an argument.

There has been a lot of more pressing issues that have arisen this year (serious health issues and job change) that made charging my roommates on venmo during the beginning of each month lower on my priority list. As such, 4 months of bills have gone uncharged. I, however, made the payments on time. I charged them this past month for the 4 months. I'm getting a lot of backlash, criticism, and am being called careless and not empathetic to think people can just hand over $350 all at once. I gave them the option to pay in installments over the month. But the tensions in the house are still high. One roommate insists she pay over the course of 4 months. I'm not comfortable with that because I don't feel comfortable with not getting my money, I can literally put that money anywhere else and I'll get more from it, and emotionally I don't feel obligated to do this. In fact, it makes me feel like a bank of convenience. I know money is hard. I'm usually more lenient but I made it clear to them I have medical bills and am on disability so I don't have my old income and this is now stressful for me.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: I've brought up through the years that I don't like taking care of the bills because I have a few jobs, am managing some admin things long distance for family, and have recently gotten sick. Nobody was willing to take on the 'head of house' role or split up  the ownership of the bills because they 'don't want to be fronting money' and bc I made more than all of them. Also, I'm not asking for the money all at once. I said they could pay through 2 pay cycles (1 month). If they needed more time they could notify me so we can sort something out. I told them the bills were an anomaly 2 weeks before charging them (giving them a total of 6 weeks to prepare). All of them expressed criticism but nobody asked for any extensions. I'm organizing my affairs more and told them this will never happen again. Now, that May is over and I had given my roommate a last minute 2 week extension, she is avoiding me.

Anyway, their parents are usually just talking to my parents and tell them to come to my room and play games on my PS4 (side note, I paid for it myself and I work).

The thing is, these guys are crazy over games and get angry and overheated quickly. Whenever they play Call of Duty and get killed in a way they deem unfair they yell and throw my controllers at the floor. 

Last time they were over, didn’t let them play because they had broken an expensive controller I own and didn’t bother to repay me or even apologize.

They were furious, they stormed the living room and cried to their parents about me being mean and unfair. My parents gave me dirty looks before telling me to let them play. I refused and was sent to my room.

The only change is that I’m recently pregnant. I have been very sick and especially this week with a cold and other complications on top of the normal “morning” sickness. My boyfriend has a dog bailey that he absolutely loves and i don’t blame him, she’s very cute but also a shit head. (She pees and poops where she pleases) even on our very expensive brand new couch. He cleans it all so i don’t worry about it. But come night time.. she snores. Incredibly loud. It’s so hard for me to fall asleep. Especially when my boyfriend falls asleep and starts snoring as well. The other night i insisted he have her sleep in the living room rather then with us. He got very mad and after some back and forth he said “your such a little fucking princess” and put bailey in the other room. One of the excuses was that she will just cry at the door but i could hear her snoring and happily asleep in the living room as soon as she was put out. (That’s how loud it is) and i would have no problem sleeping on the couch if that meant getting quiet but he wakes up at 3am for work and takes his dog out so i would wake up from that anyways. Another thing though is she peed and pooped the night she slept in the living room. I am just so fatigued. This happened a couple nights ago and last night i slept in my sons room because he completely refused to move her because she had the accident and then made me feel bad for not sleeping with him.. but I literally just want quiet sleep! so AITA for asking my boyfriend to have his dog sleep in the living room?

My brother (B),a friend and I went on vacations and on the last days we stayed in Ottawa. We decided to explore the city and later that night went to get dinner at an Asian restaurant.
Throughout the whole time we were there the waiter ignored us (there weren't a lot of costumers, maybe just two more tables, and if we asked for napkins/sauce/fork he would go check his phone and then go look for whatever we asked for), and made us feel as if we were making tip many questions about the food (B doesn't speak a lot of English, so he didn't know what the things in the menu meant).

We ate our food and each paid with card. B was first, and since the service was mediocre at best he ""rounded up"" and the tip was about 8%. The guy was behind him and went berserk, shouting about how he DESERVED at least 20%, that he had means of charging us, and how were just the worst of the worst. 

I took everyone's cards, paid everything with mine and denied entering an amount for the tip. He followed us until we left the establishment, still shouting.

And that's it, some girls from our country agreed with us, but other tourist said we should have just tipped and that were indeed awful.

So AITA?

For a bit of context, we had never been to Canada and the tour guy told us it had pretty similar tip policies of USA. And that usually they had this sort of ""it's common knowledge you SHOULD tip just for the service"""	Not the A-hole	0	0	211.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

We bother were looking forward to this movie and had promised not to 1:) watch it without the other present. 

We made a bet prior to watching infinity war about the outcome of the movie [End Game] that gave us permission to change our idea of the outcome up until the release of the movie. 

Fast forward to End Game’s release — I payed for our midnight tickets and snacks, the movie ended and ALL HER OUTCOMES WERE SPOT ON. [With minute changes and errors so it wasn’t a “full run.”] 

She won the bet and needless to say, I made a complete fool of myself. The type that was damaging. 

I was recently on her computer [we were working on a media project] I went on the videos folder and their in Chinese/English was the End Game movie downloaded... I didn’t watch it or click it but I had a hunch and backloaded when she’d downloaded it, it was a day before End Game’s official release here...

I was heartbroken and rushed to confess her, accusing her of being a terrible friend and more... She ran in tears, and now I feel really bad... 

EDIT: This was the bet. 


I had to let my teacher touch me inappropriately little did I know that this teacher had offended my friend’s boyfriend so, she used my bet with her to get even more into his good graces by sending him a video of him doing it. [He didn’t touch me — he was leaning his hand over to look at my work, I didn’t know about this because I left the school that following year and that’s when my friend and her boyfriend did it, he ended up getting fired and not allowed to work as a teacher again, the angle they took the video of and what my friend said, “that I wanted to remain anonymous.” Therefore, no one contacted me about the case...

My problem is who I invite to my graduation ceremony. Due to the nature of my school, it's very small (my grad class is 30 people and that's the biggest it's been so far) and things are quite intimate. The evening involves the ceremony, and dinner and praise & worship. (Christian school, I'm not really into that.) It's from 3 pm until 8 pm. It's also 50$ dollars a person for dinner. I've already opted not to invite my father because of things that happened in the past, and his lack of willingness to accept the seriousness.

His mother, however, is making me feel all kinds of weird guilt. She's getting on in years and has had some medical troubles recently, but not inviting him (she doesn't know anything about this yet) would bring in a lot of problems. I don't really want her there, and the people I've already talked to about this have told me that the day is all about my accomplishments, not about pleasing family members. I feel as though if she were to find out that I didn't invite her she'd be super passive aggressive towards me for a long time. She's not a terrible person, but she can be very difficult to be around sometimes. I feel selfish for not inviting her, but at the same time, I shouldn't have to be uncomfortable on my graduation day.

Got an A- overall for a hard course? “Why didn’t you get an A+ huh?”

Working out to get stronger and feel healthier? “Why don’t you play study more and play basketball to “grow taller?””  Which this makes 0 sense.

I remember in 6th grade he beat my butt so hard that it turned purple for a WEEK because I was using too much “soap” while showering.

If it was up to my dad, I’d be studying all day doing whatever he wants. 3 days ago, we had an altercation at a family dinner where we were talking. I told him I wasn’t going to plan on having kids and he literally said “why are you alive then? Why be alive if you can’t even be useful?” This just made me lose a shit ton of nonexistent respect I had for him.

Another incident was when we were talking about trips. He was telling me to go to China with him to see my relatives. I said that I didn’t want to just because. He responds with “how dare you forget your upbringings, who are your family huh? Think about who will have you when no one else does”

Thats fucking funny.

He sents them money every so often and they blow it on the dumbest shit and even when we were living there, they stole from us. The people we consider “family.” 

Today however, I went out with my friends to celebrate the ending of the school year and happen to be near the place he works.

We hoped he would find his way home, but he stayed in the area outside our house, slept on our garden furniture etc. As the days went by we started feeding it, and eventually took him in. We put up ads in the paper and on Facebook, with no luck. So we took him to the vet to see if he was chipped, which he was.

&#x200B;

We contacted the owners, who missed him and came to pick him up. They (couple, early 30s?) didn't have a cage or a car, and just wanted to put the cat in their backpack. The cat obviously resisted, so I offered them to borrow our cage. They declined, and tried harder to stuff the cat in their backpack. Eventually they agreed to borrow the cage, but the cat did not seem happy at all to go with them.

&#x200B;

They said they'd return the cage and pay us back for what we had spent on cat food. I told them if their cat ever ran away again they could come here and look for him, since it's a chance he'd want to come back here. We never heard from them, they never returned the cage or gave us any money. We didn't bother to contact them again. 

&#x200B;

Two months later, the cat came back. We assumed the owners would contact us if they missed him. We let him back in and fed him, and waited for them to contact us. They never did. We have fed him, taken him to the vet, given him vaccines etc, and grown really fond of him. After 8 months the owners suddenly call us. They demand to get the cat back, claiming they have looked everywhere, tried to call, come to our door and do ""everything"" to get their cat back during these 8 months. But we have not heard a single word from them.

&#x200B;

We told them that the cat had become a part of our family, and we wanted to keep it. I decided to add up all the money we had spent on the cat the last 8 months and told the previous owners they have to pay us in full in order for us to give the cat back. They claimed is was an insane amount of money, to which I replied that it costs money to have a cat and give it proper care. They refuse to pay us ($1000), claim they can't afford it, but keep insisting they are the cat's rightful owner and they should get it back.

Husband (H) thinks my (38F) childhood friend’s (38M) behaviour makes him an AH:
- Never having a fulltime/perm job. He says he owns consulting business but unsure of the details & haven’t seen much evidence. He may get gov’t $ which may have work restrictions
- He proudly works the system in legal ways. Eg 1 restaurant says credit machine’s down & if we cld pay cash. Friend makes a big fuss but then says they can imprint his card to charge him later when machine‘s working. Turns out he knows if he doesn’t sign it he can claim fraud & got away with a $150+ dinner. Eg 2 I lost my luggage & waited for airline to deliver it nxt day. Friend lied he had a funeral & rcvd $$ from airline.
- He holidays twice a year but tacks on “consulting work” to claim entire trip as a business expense on tax.
- He often pretends to have certain conditions (liposuction, past addictions etc that he has never had) to do paid market research
- He coasts on free samples/offers so he never has to pay full subscription for few years
- At weddings he says he forgot his card & if he could sign and put cash in someone else’s card. Turns out he only put $10-20 in when others were pooling $250+
- He invites himself to events. Eg “I’m really looking forward to going to your holiday house/wedding /dinner party. Ill being this special game to play w you” where that person has no choice to say no as off guard & avoiding being rude
- He sued an institution for large payout & in active litigation with another while considering another with a specific $ value in mind. Husband thinks he‘s forcing situations to give rise to lawsuits ie people who do “slip and falls” in buildings & sue for injury
- H doesn’t judge my friend for HIV but thinks he was irresponsible (unprotected sex in a dark park with a stranger)
- My friend frequently involves unrelated/inappropriate comments. Eg 1 walk in guests’ hotel room and say I had great sex in this very room. Eg 2 pregnant friend describing the position of her unborn baby & friend says that was exact sex position he did with his partner last night.
- H thinks friend is inconsiderate Eg friend takes up two seats on couch when people are sitting on the floor

My friend‘s good points: 
- good listener, always makes time
- he buys me a birthday cake each year or he takes me out to the movies as a birthday treat. H points out that these things are experiences he can share and not just solely for me. 
-  loyal to me but at the expense of others when saying he is a good friend Eg at our wedding friend‘s speech made him look like a good friend while making fun of another friend in a v embarrassing way.
- I’ve never felt taken advantage of by my friend

We have children & that’s when H became vocal on his views of my friend’s behaviour because he doesn’t think it’s a great example for our children to be around or look up to.

c0q6z0	2019-06-14 22:30:58	CheapSuspect8	AITA for cutting half my friends out of my life	"So my group of friends is really close. There are about 6-7 of us who hang out consistently. I just have an issue with 3 of them. Let's call them Mary, Kate, and Ashley. 

Some background first: Mary and Kate both broke up with their long term boyfriends about 1-2 years ago, and just went absolutely crazy with going out, getting way too drunk, and hooking up with random guys. Ashley kinda went along the same lines as them.

Recently, they have been putting that lifestyle ahead of their friends. The best example of this is that they drag the whole group out to nightclubs when only they 3 enjoy them over more relaxed bars, invite random guys from tinder to the bars, and then ditch us to dance and then go home with them.

Going off that, I'm mad at Kate for not taking any consideration into what her friends want to do when we go out. Best example of this is that on her roommate's last night in town (we all go to college together and she was moving back home), we went to a club to make these three happy, and when the roommate wasn't feeling it (she likes chill bars) we all left to go to a more relaxed bar together. On the way there, Kate got FURIOUS that we left. She then decided to stop the group, say ""fuck this, I'm going to a frat party,"" stormed off and ruined the night. This wasn't the first time she's done that and she's done other times as well since then.

I'm mad at Ashley, because I've been trying to invite her to my home town (which is a larger city) three hours away from where we go to school for years. She has been telling me how much she wants to go, but keeps telling me she doesn't have money or time to go, even though I know that's not 100% true. Recently, we all took a trip to Vegas together for my roommate's birthday. We went to another nightclub (which only those three wanted to do) and Ashley was dancing with some guy. She didn't want anything that night, so we all left, but the guy followed us to another casino, so she had me help her ditch him. Months later, I find out that she is still talking to this guy, and he is now living in my home town. Me and our other friend (who lives in the same town) were headed back home for a bit when last second, she tells us she's gonna be in town too and that we should hang out. I found out from a mutual friend that she was also planning on hanging out with the guy from Vegas.

Lastly, I'm mad at Mary because she constantly tries to sleep with our friends, even when they don't want to, and uses her depression issues as a weapon to make them feel bad for not sleeping with her. She's cheated on her boyfriends with multiple guys including my roommate, and all around is not a good person in my eyes.

I'd go more into specifics, as there is more, but I'm running out of characters. I told them that I don't want to be around them anymore and they keep asking for second chances, but I don't think I should have to give them one. Am I the asshole here?

She's been addicted to drugs for years, been to jail multiple times, and has a boyfriend that was hunted by Dog the Bounty Hunter! :D

As you can already tell, she's perfect mom material!

Sometime last year, she became pregnant and then decided that she wanted to become a mom! So, she kept the kid. The kid came on Christmas day and was soon taken away from her because the baby tested positive to drugs. My partner's mom has been taking care of the kid ever since, mainly because the sister landed herself back in jail.

Because my partner's mom works all the time, the task of taking care of the kid falls to my partner and inadvertently, me.

We didn't sign up for parenting duties! Why do we have to become part time parents because the sister decided that she wanted to be a mom then dump the kid on her family?? I  just got out of high school and I wanted to enjoy my summer break before I go to college. Instead we're dealing with a screaming baby who's never happy.

I feel selfish because I'm complaining about something that isn't happening in my own family and like an asshole because sometimes I just wish the sister just would've gotten an abortion. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	15.0	15.0	0.0	0.0

c0q4v0	2019-06-14 22:25:17	GerdaJensen	AITA for not letting my best friend take her girlfriend to birthday party?	"Okay so first off I just wanna say that English is not my first language. But you're welcome to correct any mistakes I make.

&#x200B;

So here is a bit of background to the situation. Last year my best friend, let us call her Tina, and I were friends with benefits, and I ended up falling in love with her (I already had feelings for her before we were FWB). To make a long story short she ended without telling me and I was obviously crushed by this. 2 or 3 months after it ended she got with her current girlfriend, and I thought I was over her. So the three of us went to a bar (before we went out I promised not to talk about certain things to Tina's new girlfriend) and I got very drunk thus breaking the promise I made to Tina. That night I was just an asshole, I know that. I also felt like the worst friend for breaking the trust between us.

&#x200B;

So fast forward to now. I just turned 18 and I'm planning my 18th birthday party. I've invited basically all of my friends and Tina. Now Tina and I don't have the same group of friends, so I'm basically the only one she knows at my party. So she asked me if she could bring her girlfriend to my party so she would have one to talk other than me. Now I completely understand this. Only knowing one person at a party is very awkward and not so fun, but from the looks of it, there aren't gonna be that many at my party and all of my friends a very open and friendly. The problem I have with Tina bringing her GF to the party is that I'm afraid I'm gonna do something stupid again thus breaking our trust again. Where I live, when you turn 18 and you host a party EVERYONE just purs alcohol in you and around midnight you take 18 shots. So you can imagine I'm prob gonna be wasted, which just increases my fear of doing something stupid. And Tina is like:

''No you aren't gonna do something stupid.''

''You had feelings for me back then and were probably jealous.''

''The relationship was new back then.''

This doesn't reduce my fear. This is a big deal to me and I feel like she just thinks this is nothing or are just some nerves from last time. When in reality I'm so anxious about it. When I asked if she would still come to my party if her GF couldn't come, she said yes but probably not drink and leave. I kinda feel like she guilting me into letting her GF come.

I just don't know what to do because I know how much it sucks to only know one person at a party but I also know this is a great way for her to make more friends and get to know my other friends.

So Reddit AITA if I say ''No, you can't bring your GF to my party''?

NOTE: Being drunk isn’t an excuse for me being an ass and it never was. I acknowledge I was an ass that night and me being drunk isn’t an excuse for my behavior. Just to make it clear.

Edit: It seems people are judging me on the context where I was TA. I wanna know if I'm an ass for saying ''No, you can't bring your GF to my party'' when you look at the last time I was with Tina and her GF."	Asshole	0	0	9.0	6.0	0.0	0.0
c0q4qi	2019-06-14 22:25:01	FrostyTheSunbro	WIBTA if I didn’t get my father anything for Father’s Day?	"Let me explain.

Father’s Day is coming up soon and my friends and family keep encouraging me to get something for me father. The reason I haven’t gotten anything for my father is because he basically left when I was nine and has only visited if it’s a “must do” in the contract him and my mom signed. 

He pretty much only visited when he needed to and never bought anything for me, even on birthdays, celebrations, or holidays. Usually I would be fine with that, except for how he treated my brother. For my brother he would spend 40-100 dollars for each celebration/birthday/holiday (he spent more on the holidays). It sounds selfish, but I hate the fact that he showers my brothers in toys and whatever he wants while I sit there with nothing.

I’ve decided that I don’t want anything to do with my father anymore. That includes Father’s Day. Usually I would go out with my mom or brother and just look around, pick a Father’s Day card and a gift card with something else he would like. But now I’m just done. I don’t want to buy him anything this year and I don’t want to sign anything for him.

Like I said before, my friends and family are encouraging me to get him something, or to at least sign a card for him, but deep down I don’t think he’s deserved it. He really hasn’t been a father for me (really my older brother raised me more than him) so I don’t think he deserves anything for Father’s Day from me.

Also during our relationship when he and I were on a break she would flirt with him all the time on facebook and then would brag to me about it. He brushed it off even though I told him it upsets me. I know it's immature of me but it just is uncomfortable for me because this girl talks badly of me whenever given the chance and I don't see the need for him to have any form of connection with her.

c0q2na	2019-06-14 22:19:19	fauxfoucault	WIBTA For Cutting Contact with Anti-LGBT+ Family Members This Way?	"Earlier this year, I (F, late-20s) went to a wedding for a friend of my family. During the reception, one of my aunts (B) and uncles (D) started talking to a couple at our table. B, D, and the couple started to say disgusting things about diverse groups of people. They referred to transgender individuals as “he-shes” who are “a shame to their own gender,” choosing to “disfigure themselves.” They said that gay people were “just wrong” and that they were “grateful” that they did not touch a gay person’s water glass, because they would have contracted a disease. They also said that black people “can’t be trusted.” 

Their comments made my stomach turn. I interjected a few times, saying things along the lines of “that’s not right,” “this is not appropriate conversation for a wedding” and “you all are making me uncomfortable.” Not wanting to cause a fight at the wedding, these were attempts to de-escalate the situation, even though my blood was boiling. About 20 minutes in, my dad—who was sitting next to me—ended up yelling at B, D, and the couple, saying they disgust him and should never be talking so hatefully about others. B and D immediately got up and left the reception.

Most of my family doesn’t know this, but I am bisexual—meaning attracted to two or more genders—and one of my best friends was a male-to-female trans woman who was murdered a few years ago. Needless to say, these are HUGELY sensitive topics to me. Even though they don’t know about my sexuality, I’ve talked with B and D about controversial subjects like this in the past in a calm, collected way. Their receptiveness varies, but they’ve never been this openly hateful. I used to be very close to B and D since they helped raise me, but the hate they’ve displayed towards me and my people is intolerable. So, I am going low/no contact. **I feel confident that I am not the asshole for choosing this path. However, I am worried I might be an asshole for how I plan to go about it.**

I have not talked to B and D after this incident. They live several hours away, and I am not investing money in travel to travel for this. I would talk to them on the phone, but I doubt I would stay composed enough to articulate myself. So, I plan to write B and D a letter that shares how I feel about the incident, why it bothers me, who I am (super not straight), and what boundaries I am enforcing now. I want to convey that I will not put up with toxicity and hate aimed at me and those I love, but that I hope one day they will have the love and compassion in their hearts to reevaluate what they stand for. I feel like some type of communication is needed, because my extended family gets together about 15 times per year.

My brother told me I am a coward for writing a letter instead of talking face-to-face, and I've already gotten some flack from extended family for not just ignoring B & D. So, Reddit, would I be the asshole for going about things this way?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1075.0	37.0	0.0	0.0

Since I've been back, I have been staying in searching for jobs so that I can support myself and move out of their house. I don't have the best history with my stepmum due to some issues we had a few years ago, but on the whole I get along with her a lot better most of the time now.

I had made plans with a friend, who I haven't seen in about a year, to catch up over some lunch today. I told my parents that I was going to be out and they told me it was fine with them.

About 10 minutes before my friend was due to pick me up, my stepmum came into my room and asked if I could help my dad install a new oven into a rental house of theirs. Usually I wouldn't have minded, but I told her that I couldn't as I was going out soon. She turns around slams my door and stomps down the stairs.
Next thing I hear is her talking angrily to my dad, then he comes up to my room and asks the same question.

I asked him how long he thinks it will take, as I could've asked my friend to push it back an hour if needed. He thinks about 3 hours as he needs to drive to pick it up from a different city, then drive to the other side of our city to put it in. I told him that  I am meant to be meeting my friend soon and that I can't really call it off at this short notice. He seemed fine with that, but my stepmum definitely wasn't. She must've been listening in as she was in the room a couple of seconds later shouting about how all I've done all week is sit around the house and that I'm lazy and I have to help my dad. 

At this point I kind of rose to the bait and an argument with my stepmum began escalating pretty quickly until my friend called me to say he was on his way, so I used this as an excuse to leave the house. 

Once back from lunch my dad was still out, but my stepmum was not. When I entered the house she shouted down the stairs something along the lines of ""back already?"" in a snarky tone implying I only went out to avoid helping, she uses this tone fairly frequently. This has made me feel pretty shitty and I don't know if I'm in the wrong here."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"My uncle is a lovely guy and he has a good and kind heart, but he is struggeling with an alcohol addiction since approx. 40+ years. He is in and out of rehab and struggeling with getting his life together in general (unemployed, no money, minor offenses etc.).  

I don't know the exact reasons, but he is kind of an outcast in the family. He has 5 siblings, but only my mum keeps in touch with him on a regular basis. My grandparents barely spoke to him, before they both passed away. From what I heared, he stole from them to fuel his addiction or to pay back money that he owed to someone. 

In the past, my mother send my uncle ""care packages"" with stuff like coffee, cigarettes, pudding, sweets, soup, crips etc., because he is very poor and gets only a bit of money from wellfare. He is barely making ends meet. She also gave him money from time to time. 

As my mum is very sick, I am taking care of her and I am in the process of taking over her responsibilities. That's why he turned to me now and asked me for money, because his washing machine broke. That the washer is actually broken was confirmed by his ""probation officer"". (To clarify, the person is not an actual probation officer, but something similar. Don't know the exact term.) 

My uncle asked for circa 300 bucks to buy a washer and to get to the end of the month. On the one hand, I would like to help him and I think, that he hasn't got lots of people that would or could help him. Plus, my mum supported him and I would like to take that into account too. On the other hand: a) it's a lot of money, b) I am concerned, that I would set an example and he will ask for more cash in the future and c) it's not really MY problem, is it?!

They pay lower rent than anywhere else in the city, especially given the location and size of the flat. (About €200 less.) 

It's not even ten feet to the supermarket, 50 more to the main subway line, two stations out of the city center station. 

They don't pay extra for heat, water, Internet or my friend that comes by twice a month to clean. The flat is furnished, new kitchen, dishwasher, washing machine and drier. They have a kitchen, huge hallway, none of the rooms are connected to each other. Two bathrooms, two toilets. The street is so quiet, in summer you can hear the beeping of the supermarket computers. 

Now, my cousin asked me if it would be okay if he and his two friends didn't pay rent for the three months they wouldn't be staying there. One month they'd pay, the rest they wouldn't. Since they'd be on holidays, or back home.

They wanted precise contracts before moving in, which we all set up, but which also state that they pay a monthly rent. 

They think, since they won't be staying over the next three months, that they shouldn't pay. 

Of course this is a delicate issue, seeing as one of them is my cousin which I'm rather close too. And I also need the money for my boyfriends student visa. 

If maybe they would've told me sooner, I could have arranged for at least two rooms to be cleared to allow for Airbnb or other tenants. But it's now two weeks until then, I'm living in another city and just don't have the time to do that. Also, that's not a solution I want to have to prepare for every summer, nor want to. 

I do understand that they're young students, but university here costs about a 200 euros per semester. I feel like the rent is more than fair, more of a friendship price, and less than I'd ask from people I don't know. 

So, since they asked me. Would I be the asshole, if I still made them pay for every month they're basically living at my flat, but aren't actually there?

Tldr: friends of a close family member who rent out my flat with full contracts signed up, don't want to pay for the time they aren't actually there, which would be three months of summer vacation, but they'd pay for one month in general."	Not the A-hole	0	0	32.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

c0pwno	2019-06-14 22:03:34		WIBTA if I Made A Big Deal Over My Best Friend Not Being In My Wedding?	"I feel like an entitled asshole. I feel very hurt that this would even be an issue, but it is. 

My best friend of 26 years told me today that she probably couldn't be in my wedding. We had planned this years ago. I was already in her wedding as her ""honorary"" maid of honor. Her sister took the title, but I took the responsibilities.

I love her deeply--we grew up together. Her family is friend's with mine and vice versa. She knows all my shit and I know all her shit. I got engaged 2 months ago. We finally picked out a date for the wedding on Tuesday. I announced on Facebook. I haven't asked everyone to be in my wedding party that I want yet because we JUST picked out the date on Tuesday.

Of all the people that I expected to be in my wedding party, I expected my best friend. We had discussed it years ago and it was understood at this point.

We were supposed to meet for lunch today. I was excited--she's recently had two kids and I haven't seen much of her lately.

But today...she came with the news that she couldn't be in my wedding. She told me that her husband had surprised her with a ""honeymoon""--they couldn't go on one after the wedding because it was essentially a shotgun wedding. She was three months pregnant during the wedding and a honeymoon wasn't in the cards after.

Well, after the birth of her two children now, he's surprised her with one. But the last day of their vacation is smack dab on the day I get married. He put in the deposit yesterday. 

I tend to hide how upset I am when some bomb like this hits...but...

I told her that I would pay their deposit back if they came, but I told her point blank that if she didn't come to my wedding, I would take it personally and that I would be offended. 

She said he's very stubborn and that she would talk to him to see if they could move the date, but she made no promises. I told her that he needs to ""fucking get over it."" I feel like a complete asshole, and while I understand about the whole honeymoon thing, I'm already personally offended. I feel devastated.

c0puyi	2019-06-14 21:59:15		AITA for wanting to report evidence to DCFS against my sister in law who’s already under investigation and has an ongoing trial against her?	"So as mentioned in the title my sister in law is under investigation and has a trial going against her. She has a 6 month old daughter who was discovered to have 37 broken bones in her body at one month old. She was tested for any and all reasoning behind the injuries and all tests point to it not being an accident. The parents claim to have no idea what happened, and court has been continued for the past 5 months.

This past Sunday during her visitation with her daughter, under supervision by a legal guardian (great grandma), we had a family barbecue. All was going well until mom decided to put the baby in the pool. It was a 70 degree day with a breeze and they had freshly filled up a baby pool with hose water. The water was cold, even for an adult. When she put the baby in the pool the baby immediately cries out and continues to cry with tears and snot running down her face. The mother LAUGHED at her baby crying and made fun out of her not liking the freezing cold water. When she takes the baby out of the pool she doesn’t dry the baby off or wrap her in a towel, so the baby is still crying and in distress because she must be freezing at this point. I had enough and walked over and put a towel over the baby and said she’s way too cold. I had to fight back tears during all of this because I just don’t understand why someone thinks is okay to laugh at their child in distress? And no one else stopped her, not even her legal guardian who I confronted and she told me it’s not my business. 

Fast forward a few days later and I can’t stop thinking about what happened and how wrong it was. I tell my bf I wanted to call DCFS and report the evidence. He got very upset and defensive, telling me I was sick in the head and that he was going to break up with me if I called along with many more choice words. He also told his mom and her response was that I just wanted attention. I feel like they aren’t seeing the severity of the situation. This is a child who cannot speak up for or defend herself, she’s already gone through so much in her little life and it’s devastating to me that they are upset over me wanting to advocate for her. I understand that this is a traumatic and difficult situation for the family to be going through, but all they see is me bashing their family member, and they aren’t recognizing that she is unfit to be a mother in so many ways.

c0pus0	2019-06-14 21:58:45	The_Danish_Potato	AITA for not letting my sister touch my dog?	"Tl:Dr at the end.

Btw my sister is 15 yo.

So basically we got this dog about three to four months back, at first it absolutely loved my sister. It would sleep in her room and stay with her most of the time during the first few days it had been here. The dog is five years old so it was pretty confused and nervous the first few days.

My sister then decides on a wim to just leave home for an entire week, during which I take care of the dog and it slowly starts to favor me.

During the first week it had severe abandonment issues, it would whine, bark and get anxious if left alone, which is understandable for a dog that's just gotten removed from its previous home.

When my sister returned home she immediately went to pick up the dog, being overall loud and looming over the tiny dachshund.

She cowered in fear with her tail tucked, but my sister still picked her up despite this.

My dog started to become more and more frightened of my sister, as she would be loud and too wild with handling the tiny dog.

My sister has started to run towards my dog threatenignly whenever it barks and even yells at it, because she finds its barking to be annoying.

I've tried to explain to her why she shouldn't behave like this, but both her and my mom think that the dog is just overreacting. Common phrases they would say is ""Well she's never physically harmed it, so it shouldn't be scared"", I've now started to prohibit my sister from even touching the dog, before it shows signs of relaxing.

AITA for not letting my sister touch my dog because of this (in my dogs mind) frightening behaviour?

Tl:Dr, My dog is visibly frightened of my sister and I've tried to explain to her why, but both her and my mom are ignorant about the issues. AITA for not letting my sister touch my dog?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	33.0	10.0	0.0	0.0

Yesterday afternoon, he finally asked me if 'i was gonna show any interest in him' or should he just stop trying. he quickly followed it up by saying that summer break is boring and he offered to be 'friends with benefits'  that part really creeped me out because it felt odd that he was thinking of me in that way and it made me wonder if i kinda gave off that vibe y'know?

I let him know that he made me super uncomfortable and he began to apologize profusely. at that point i said i forgave him, but i knew that i really hadn't.  he said that he just wanted to be friends and i decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and talk to him.  that convo started out pretty innocent as he started to get to know me, but then after two questions he asked me about what kind of guy i like and it became pretty clear that he wasn't truly sorry.  at that point i decided to block him because i felt he wasn't being respectful and i just felt uncomfortable al around

I had the need to go to a specific medical appointment which I'm very scared to do (haven't been for years) fairly urgently. I told my friend I was trying to find a place to go because I needed to ASAP. She wanted to go too just for a general checkup. She also wanted to go to a cheaper one as she has more of a budget. It's not a very regular thing and I want to go to a higher quality one as I'm very scared and I'm okay paying more so it's a better process for me. I have a habit of cancelling plans and I'm trying to improve but I knew chances were high of me making an appointment and cancelling and I didn't want anyone to be mad at me. 

So I made an appointment with a higher quality one and I actually went. I didn't tell her until after I had accomplished attending the appointment. It is actually a pretty big accomplishment for me to get there myself. 

I think she's upset with me for going myself. I went to a nice one. It was more expensive but I'm okay with it  I'll go with her if she wants to go. I'll get my stuff fixed more quickly since it's urgent for me. Whenever she wants, I'll go with her, either the one I went to or another one. 
It's pretty small and we'll get through it, we're pretty mature. But I'm still not sure because she is kinda upset with me. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1028.0	21.0	0.0	0.0

But her son is wild - he doesnt listen, argues with her and frequently breaks things by rough handling them. Then the daughter acts out and both kids get worse behavior wise.

This leads me to my issue. I've recently done some work to my house and want to have a small party (5 people max) and I dont want the kids there. My GF and I don't have kids and our house isnt kid friendly - lots of breakable stuff and my GF collects snowglobes that we leave on shelves.  I also dont want the kids running around and getting into drawers, closets, etc..

Problem is my friend doesnt have any one to watch her kids (no family in the area) and I'm not sure her financial situation and hiring babysitters. Anytime we hang out, the kids are there. So I expect this would be no different. 

I want to ask her to hire a babysitter for the afternoon/evening, or just not invite her over.

c0pt4r	2019-06-14 21:54:28		AITA for trying to be friends with my ex-FWB?	"I actually posted here about a month ago, asking if AITA for telling my ex-fwb (Jess) I didn't want a relationship when she said she had feelings. The conclusion was pretty much NTA/NAH...

Right around the time we agreed to stop sleeping together I had finals. I was pretty stressed, studying a lot, and didn't have much time for anything else. But I did try and chat every couple of days. We agreed we'd still be friends. I still messaged her most days just asking how she is, or sending her a snapchat of all my notes to show I'm busy.

Anyway, she didn't respond much. We had a few chats but nothing substantial. She then realised she'd left a few things at my place (nothing important) and asked if she could pick them up the next time she was around. I said sure once I'd finished my finals.

Anyway, exams finish - I go on a bit of a mad one with my friends; out every night drinking. I don't chat much to Jess in the week-10 days or so after I finish. I send a few snaps again (that was our primary form of messaging before) but I'm a bit preoccupied enjoying the end of my studies.

Fast forward, I'm moving home, she wants to pick up her stuff. I said sure or I can drop it off to her but I'm leaving fairly soon. She didn't reply until I was 2 hours gone. So I apologise and said she could get it when I'm back for graduation in a month or so. I got a snarky ""Oh now you want to see me when you graduate""; I ignore it.

Few days after I sent a random snap of me cooking to a load of friends, including her. I have a group of 8-10 or so close friends I just kinda send random snaps to, share my life with people I care about. Jess has been one of those 10 or so people for a good 4-5 months. 

She then pops up and says ""stop fucking snapping me, we're not friends anymore"". I'm pretty thrown off by this. I ask what she means. ""Stop sending me snapchats of your life, I know you want me to stroke your ego but I don't have the emotional energy for you."" 

I probe a bit into what she means and her reply was ""since we stopped fucking you've done nothing to show you care about me, you obviously don't have any interest in me or how my life is going and just want me to comment on how great your life is. I've always been here for you if you needed me but I don't have the time or energy for you. You're too confusing and I'm not dealing with you anymore."" 

After attempting to defend myself - reminding her I had my finals, then was celebrating, but all the while I *did* keep in contact, and also apologised if she felt like my semi-regular snaps were some kind of brag (although I was just cooking some chicken in the one she kicked off at so???). She finally said ""look, if you don't understand what you've done wrong that's fine but please just leave me alone.""

So I'm sitting there staring at my phone in a complete daze. A month prior this girl had admitted she had feelings for me and wanted to be my girlfriend, and now she's told me never to speak to her again.

A former coworker of ours (who became one of my best friends) is getting married in two weeks. Since we were such a good team back then I asked everyone if they would like to write a card that I could take with me to the wedding. Everyone was excited and said yes. Shortly after this one coworker asked me: “Just out of curiosity, is she pregnant?”

I was highly confused by this question and a bit annoyed tbh but I simply answered “no, but I just for future reference, I really don’t like it when people ask these kind of personal questions”

She then went on how she would never ask the bride to be directly, but since she was asking a third person she didn’t see the harm and that she wasn’t prying or anything (in my opinion she was prying and just asked for gossip).

I then said that I just think that these kind of questions can cause way more harm and discomfort than necessary and if she would have been pregnant and if I would be allowed to tell I would have told them already. I have to admit here, that I said this a bit “meaner” than I wanted it to be. 

The really awkward part here: I know that our former coworker (my best friend) cannot have kids (or it will be really difficult at least) and that she and her fiancé are really struggling with it. She actually got so stressed out that she lost half of her hair because of it. Since I am a really bad liar, questions like this call me completely off guard. 

My coworker then said that she finds me highly sensitive and my reaction way over the top. She then went further and saying that I am just angry that I am single and not getting married and that I am overly sensitive because of that.

1. The principle reason: my kids have called her new husband ""dad"" before they even got engaged. She refused to discourage it and let them get attached to him to the point where they seem to like him more than they like me. Which leads to my next reason.
2. Her new husband makes much more than I do and can spoil the kids more. This trip will probably be entirely on his dime, making him out to be the better ""dad"" than me.
3. This trip will conflict with my parenting time. I only get my kids one day a week, and this would take that day away from me and would ruin our schedule. My ex offered to give me a different day, but I only have time that one day per week to do a fun day. She and her new husband already get so much time with them that I think it's ridiculous to both ask for more time and to take them to do something I can never afford for them.

Am I an asshole for putting my foot down and refusing to let her take them?

Edit: I cannot make the day up because I already see my kids during my one day off per week and during al my vacation days. I don't get any other time off, so this is one less day I get to see them no matter which way you cut it. And the kids do not know about the trip.

Edit 2: for those of you saying to just schedule a day off, you are missing that I already spend ALL my days off and vacation days with my kids. There is no additional time off to schedule that I wouldn't be spending with my kids. If she takes them during one of my days off, there is no other time for me to make that up, because all my days off and vacation days are already being spent with my kids."

c0pdpf	2019-06-14 21:13:52	NotQuiteMe	AITA for getting a guy kicked out of the Notre Dame square?	"2 years ago, I was an American traveling around Europe with my husband, 2 daughters, mother, and father.  I had planned a 3-week tour visiting 5 different countries. We didn't know the languages, but I planned to visit large cities and hope they just spoke english, google translate was good enough, and that the cultural rules weren't too different - we'd just be cautious.  For the most part, this worked fine, except for one thing that has bothered me.

On this tour around Europe, we stopped in Paris at the Notre Dame Cathedral.  We were walking  in the square in front of the front entrance, looking at all the pigeons and statues and trying to find the bathroom when a man came up to us,  and handed one of my daughters something.  She opened her hand to show me that he had given her bird seed - at which point 4 or 5 birds landed on her.  We all got excited, and the man continued to pull bird seed by the handfuls out of his pockets to give to my other daughter.  He put some on our shoulders, and soon we were laughing and excited, COVERED in birds - an experience I hadn't had since I was 5 in Venice.

I was so excited that this man had given this wonderful experience to my girls, that I actually, honestly, wanted to give something back, so I took 20 (Euro? Probably Euro) out of my pocket, went to him and said ""Thank You"" while handing him the money.

As I turned back around I saw two men in uniform that had been walking around the square suddenly turn and make a bee-line toward me,  walk past me, and take the man off the square.

&#x200B;

So - that's my question - Did I get him kicked off the square for giving him money?  Is this something I was supposed to know?  Was I the asshole for handing him money? Did I fail in researching what the rules were for Notre Dame?  I chalked it up to ""well, he took the money, and he had the birdseed, and probably knew the rules better than me, so he could have just not accepted the money if it was wrong"" but is there some unspoken rules?

Thank you."	Not the A-hole	0	0	140.0	6.0	0.0	0.0
c0pcec	2019-06-14 21:10:35		WIBTA if I revoked my best friend’s birthday gift?	"Background: I (21F) recently went through a breakup that is made a bit more complicated by our history. He (21M) asked me to still remain friends because we were best friends for seven years before we started dating, and we both care for each other deeply but he doesn’t feel romantic attraction to me. It’s a complicated and unideal situation all around. I was blindsided by the breakup and still have all of those romantic feelings coupled with anger and other stuff, and I asked for space and no contact while I processed things. I still feel like he’s my best friend even if we are no contact, because we’ve paused and restarted our friendship multiple times before.

In short, it’s a complicated relationship. Now onto the potential a-holery.

For his birthday (shortly before he ended things) I gave him tickets for the two of us to see Hamilton in Chicago at the end of July. Now that we are no longer together romantically, I don’t know what to do with these tickets. The first time I saw the show was with him, and going as friends he reimbursed me the cost of his ticket.

One way that I could handle it that my sister (26F if it matters) is encouraging is to keep the tickets for myself and take her with me instead. However, if I start talking to him again as a friend before July, I would feel terrible revoking his birthday present. I know he would never be able to financially swallow the cost of his ticket, while my sister has already offered to pay for it if I take her. I don’t think I would’ve gotten the tickets this time around if we had not been dating, but I was comfortable with paying for both of them as my boyfriend’s birthday present.

 I just feel extremely confused and really dirty either way (taking my sister and purposely ignoring him or taking him as just a friend) and am on the verge of just reselling both the tickets to get the whole situation away from me.

Would I be the a-hole if I specifically and purposely didn’t restore contact with my ex until after the show and take my sister instead?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0paow	2019-06-14 21:06:14		AITA for not wanting to change my job interview date?	"I'm a last year Social Work student who is working on his thesis (with 7 other students). 4 weeks ago our mentor told us we'd have our end evaluation on june 20th at 10 am. He also said we should do an activity together (mentor included), as a nice way to end everything.

A few days ago I received an email back from an organisation I sent an email to to apply there. They asked me for my resume and they would give me a call. So, I did. Yesterday morning my stepmother tagged me in a post of another organisation looking for employees. I sent them an email. A few hours later I received an email back asking if I could come in for an interview. I replied: I'm nearing the end of my thesis and on tuesday the 18th I finish, and after that I have an open schedule.

An hour later the other organisation called me asking if I could come in the 19th for a job interview at 2 pm. I agreed. 15 minutes later the other organisation asked if I could come in on the 19th at 2 pm. To save some face, I replied saying I just now received an email of my mentor saying I'll have an end evaluation 19th at 2pm. But I'd be able to come in on thursday or friday. They emailed me back saying thursday at 10am would be okay.

I told my fellow students this, and they reminded me of the end evaluation that same day/ time. I completely forgot about that. I asked them if it would be okay if I emailed our mentor asking if we could do it later that day? They said it was okay, but two other students were on the upper floor (open space), I went up there and asked if they heard what I said, they said yes. I asked if it would be okay if I emailed our mentor to have our end evaluation a bit later that day. They both agreed.

We then agreed that I could go at 10 am to the organisation for a job interview and I would meet them back at 11.30 for our activity so we could be ready at 1pm for the end evaluation.

I emailed our mentor and he agreed to have our end evaluation at 1 pm that same day.

Now, today, we sat together to find an activity to do with everyone as a way to wrap everything up. Since I would only be back at 11.30am we'd have one hour and a half to do an activity. To which most said that's not long enough to do something. Then someone suggested we'd do our end evaluation first (11.30am) and then after that we could do an activity. Then, one of the 2 students who were on the upper floor said I didn't check in on her before emailing our mentor and that she has to leave at 2.30 pm to leave for a festival (which starts on friday, but she wants to go on thursday, because that way she can leave with her friends, also, she did plan this before me) .

I reminded her that I explicitly asked her if she was okay with it, but now she says I didn't ask her that. She urged me, and my other fellow students were agreeing with her, that I should skip the job interview.

Then she started crying saying how she wants to be with all of us during the activity."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

They have visitations and we are still in the process of going to court to figure out a parenting plan and custody. We left early to go get something from the store and while we were a ways from home my younger brother called her saying he locked his keys in his car and needed the spare. My mother decided we would go home to get him the spare and bring it to him, she said we would have time. I argued saying that’s ridiculous we don’t have time to go back to the house, drop the key to him, and then pick my daughter up before the visitation is over. I said he can Uber home and get it we shouldn’t even take the chance because we are still going through court stuff and shouldn’t risk being late.

She blew up calling me controlling and that I ruined the day. She said we would have had plenty of time and everyone tells her what she can and can’t do and she’s sick of it. I tried to let her vent but now I’m feeling really guilty.

c0p8tn	2019-06-14 21:01:36	alexds1	AITA for not going out of my way to connect with my brother's friends?	"I(34) recently had a fight with one of my brothers (Justin, 30) in which he called me an asshole. I should note I have diagnosed social anxiety, possibly ASD, and though I do research to stay in the avg behavior range it's difficult for me calibrate my interactions. 

There's a lot of backstory, but the gist is that I moved out of my family home 6 years ago because I felt unsafe, and my once strong relationship with Justin has withered. He blames me for abandoning him w/ my (prob narcissistic) mom, and for leaving our other autistic brother. In his opinion, my moving out left him to deal with mom constantly complaining about me, and recently I moved 400mi away from the area so there's no chance of me returning or easily visiting.

Since last fall I've been actively trying to rebuild my relationship with Justin and can tell he's still pissed at me. He told me that he's replaced me with other friends since I moved out, which hurts, but that's his choice. Most of the convo-initiation between us is on me. Also it's frustrating hanging out with Justin since he is often passively resentful, although he also says he misses me. In Jan I noted to him that I've invited him to every hangout I've had with my friends (he often comes), but that he's never invited me to meet any of his. Additionally, I used to drive to the house to spend the whole day w/ the fam every weekend when not disowned, but he had visited me maybe 2x in 6 years of his own volition. I also call him every week at a time he requested, but he never calls me himself. He acknowledged that he doesn't try, but he has bigger priorities at work/ home and I'm not part of his daily life anymore. He said he'd work on it.  

During the recent fight though, he yelled that in addition to not helping at ""the house,"" I make no effort to meet his friends. That confused me because I'd clearly communicated the above not too long ago. Additionally, he has invited my mom to many of his hangouts, to the point that she knows them well and has even attended some of their weddings. His usual response is that I make the excuse that I'm busy every time ""the family"" asks me to do things, but in my defense I own my own business, work long hours (often weekends), and can't drop things w/o advance notice (they think I should put them first). I do use ""I'm busy"" as an excuse to avoid my mom, but that's because she stresses me out and asks for inappropriate amounts of time/ labor because I WFH and ""can get up and leave anytime"" (no), and because she always tells me I'm distant and selfish for moving out and abandoning them. So it's no bueno for me. I have never used the ""I'm busy"" response on Justin because a) I have no reason to avoid him and b) he's never asked me to hang.

I'm confused if he's just piling random shit on me because he's mad for the other reasons, or if I failed to understand how to connect w him. I'm no longer going to try anymore at this point, but it would good to know for future reference."	Not the A-hole	0	0	901.0	45.0	0.0	0.0
c0p8su	2019-06-14 21:01:33	CityofTrees77	AITA for calling to report a truck driver who honked at me on the freeway?	"I was coming home on the freeway, and for most of the trip had stuck in the leftward lanes (though not the far left one) as I was going at a pretty decent pace. There was a portion of the drive (3 or so miles) that delved into a twisty, steep downhill descent. I have pretty bad vertigo, so I slowed to a slower pace than most vehicles around me were going (not insanely slow, maybe like 5-7 miles slower than most).

I should have changed lanes and moved further to the right; I admit this. But I was preoccupied with getting down this twisty hill, and I kind of blanked on this part and stayed in the same leftward lane. There was a gigantic neon orange rig behind me that started honking its horn at me. Since this was a big vehicle, this honk was really loud and jarring. I didn’t feel comfortable speeding my vehicle up, and there was too much traffic in the lane to my right for me to safely merge out of the lane.

The truck kept honking at me; about every 20 or so seconds I’d receive a big honk, but had to ignore it. I received about 8 or so loud honks from this vehicle. When I am nervous and trying safely to go down a steep twisty hill, the **last** thing I need is some giant neon orange bully behind me blaring its horn. Eventually, I found a safe opening in the lane next to me and exited the lane, letting the rig pass me. As he passed by me, I saw one of those “How’s my driving?” bumper stickers on the back of his truck, along with his truck ID number for any calls.

The first rest stop that I found, I pulled over and made a call to his company number. I told them how he honked his horn at me multiple times and how his behavior greatly intimidated me on my drive downhill. The boss/supervisor who I spoke to sounded very concerned and was very apologetic; he promised that they would deal with him very firmly. Was I the asshole for reporting this guy?"

"There's this girl at work that I've liked for a while and my friend has done me a favor by talking me up to her since I'm too nervous to talk to her myself. My friend has told her that I'm really nice, I'm financially stable, and I have my own car and apartment. This has worked in that my crush has began to flirt with me at work and I've been trying to ask her out, but today that changed.

I found out on Facebook last night that she had entered a relationship with another man, a man of her race. They're Native American and my crush contacted me today and apologized for flirting with me and giving me false hope in thinking that a relationship could work out between us. She explained that her mom doesn't want her dating outside of their race and that she was wrong to flirt with me. She then says to me about her new boyfriend ""He's not my ideal choice for a boyfriend. You're honestly a great guy and a better man than he is, but he's Native and that's all that matters if I'm to keep the peace in my family and make my mom happy."" She then explains to me that her Native boyfriend has a whole bunch of issues with DUI's, he doesn't have a driver's license anymore, he still lives with his mom, and he's a major drug addict, but she says that she's going to ""fix him"".

At that point, I just accused her of being mentally unwell and I said to her ""No normal person would go through all of this just to please their mom. Your mom has screwed with your head."" She got pissed, called me ""awful"" and she said that she's as sane as everyone else in the world. AITA for what I said to her?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I was in the last boarding group, so I unfortunately ended up being one of the very last people to get corralled into the last open seat. Window seat, great, but packed flight with more than usual crying and screaming kids - with one directly in front of me and an uncharacteristically enthusiastic seat kicker behind me. Early on in the flight I got a few kidney rattling kicks to the back of my seat - in response, I kind of turned my head to see what was going on. This happened a couple times, and each time I looked behind me like what is the deal here?  After we got in the air the Benadryl kicked in and I just put my music on and went to sleep. I have a LOT of anxiety over flying so I try to just get through it.  I slept like a baby through almost the entire flight.

I woke up shortly after landing as we were taxiing to the gate, to wet hands on my head. The kid was climbing over my seat, I guess having just washed his hands in the bathroom (good god at least I hope so). So I kind of recoiled and gave a look like “what in the fuck are you doing here?”

This lady, I’m assuming his mother, instantly calls me out and loudly yells “what’s the matter with you, never seen a person with disabilities before?”  And EVERYONE on the plane turned around and looked at me.  I’m not good at confrontations like this so I was just like “excuse me?” She quips back “you’ve been staring at him this whole flight.”  So at this point I probably strayed into asshole territory because I lost my cool and I just said “lady are you off your fucking meds or something? I’ve been asleep for the past 3 hours and I don’t give a shit about your kids.”  She didn’t say anything after that, and I didn’t bother to look. I got off the plane and went on my way.  Some people seemed to kind of look back at her and give her weird looks.

So maybe I was wrong for yelling at her but am I the asshole for looking around and did I possibly do something inappropriate to instigate this? I had no idea the kid had disabilities and quite frankly I’m not 100% sure he did. He just seemed to be acting like a poorly supervised hyperactive brat."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1362.0	11.0	0.0	0.0

"My sister (25) recently came back home to where my mom and dad live (divorced), after completing rehab for a variety of drug addictions. She got a job at one of those ""escape room"" things as the game coordinator or something like that, and my Dad (53) called me today and said that he booked us for a session or whatever it's called at the escape room where she works. Now, I have to work on Saturday (father's day), so this was going to be on Sunday, 2 days from now.

Without skipping a beat I told him ""Oh... I would not be interested in doing that at all."" And he audibly sounded like his feelings were hurt, and pretty much gave me the sad ""Okay..."" thing. Now of course, I felt like a giant asshole. I was about to call him back and tell him I'd do it, but then I remembered something.

My father always does this. He'll arrange for us to do things together without checking to see if it's something I would be interested in in the first place. And he's been doing this probably for the last 10 years, and almost every time I tell him that I wish he would have just *asked* about what something *I* would want to do, rather than just assume I would find whatever random thing he wants to do fun. I would love to go fishing with him. I would love to go see a new movie or something with him. I would love to go to a nearby sporting event with him. I would absolutely *not love* to do an escape room with him. I don't want to offend any people that genuinely enjoy escape rooms, but dear god does it sound not like any fun at all to me.

I would definitely not describe myself as shy or introverted, in fact my career and my hobbies involve extensively talking to people. So it's not like the public setting of the escape room is what bothers me. It's that my Dad didn't give any sort of thought into whether or not it's something I would have wanted to do. The other thing as well is that I'm confident that *he* wouldn't even enjoy it. He's not the type of person to go out and do things like escape rooms *at all.* If my sister wasn't working there, the thought would not even cross his mind. For the record, I do not have a good relationship with my sister. And he knows this.

My current plan is to find something else to do with him instead. I'm going to ask him if he wants to go fishing, something he and I both love and enjoy greatly. Would I be an asshole for making him cancel his already-made plans, even though I'm going to replace it with something we'd have even more fun doing?"	Asshole	0	0	1.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

Well...


My husband and I had a shotgun wedding at a courthouse in 2017.

We didn’t tell his family at first because they had been so hateful to me and him about our relationship. When they found out, his mom literally cried on the phone. No one from his family got us a gift. Not even a card. We didn’t have any celebration or dinner. Basically we were just married and that was that. 
When we made it Facebook official his brother laugh reacted to the post.

I’ve always remembered that. 
It was extremely hurtful to me. 

Fast forward to now. The family is so excited for this wedding and all the over the top, cringe worthy shit that comes with it.  

I’m going to be attending out of respect for my husband, because he’s in the wedding, but I straight up told my husband that I am intentionally not getting them shit. I’m not spending my money on them. They won’t get as much as a card from me. And I hope they notice it to.

"My brother and I had an argument last night because I thought something he was doing was annoying so I called it out with unsolicited advice which made him mad (side note: never said I’m right for unsolicited advice). Anyway we got over it already this morning and everything was back to normal. 

He leaves the home then my mom proceeds to lecture me for half an hour about the things I have to change about myself in order to avoid conflict with my brother (he has anger problems and my entire family including himself is aware of it). She also nitpicked me saying I’m too obsessed with this Korean girl band and that she noticed it but never said anything, implying for the 100th time she thinks I’m lesbian. 

She proceeded to say that I treat the family so badly because I’m too focused on how I’m feeling during an argument as opposed to how she’s feeling when she sees me and my brother in conflict. I defended myself saying that I already do a lot of things for the whole family, including being the only one who helps with chores, sacrificing my studying time to help the family business, doing homework for my brother, letting the family get things their way, etc. But her reasoning is once again, because I won’t back down from an argument in a heartbeat simply because she’s telling me to stop (even though an argument takes two to tango and she isn’t lecturing my brother). 

Lastly she said that I’m a terrible person. I never claimed I’m such a good person but I’m far from actually being such a horrible person. I told her I’m not but she continued to say that I’m a really bad person with no reasoning behind it.

I had enough so I yelled at her because I got pissed after 30 minutes of verbal abuse and nitpicking. Then she played victim saying that all I do is start drama just like I’m doing now. 

Do I not have the right to get mad and finally say something after defending myself for half an hour? She’s acting like I’m the problem here and my dad is defending her when he doesn’t know anything about the situation.

c0p0yj	2019-06-14 20:41:58	UsedTone	AITA for refusing to come home?	"So currently, I'm living about an hour and a half away from my parents house, attending college and working. I'm taking one class 4 days a week and I work remotely on my computer. My parents would like me to come home more often, however, they don't really push the issue too much when I tell them I'm busy. 

&#x200B;

My older brother, who is currently living at home, however, gets quite angry when I tell him the same. He asks me to come home almost every weekend. He's taking a few classes online, is not working, and doesn't really have much of a social life. Whenever I tell him that I don't want to come home, it feels like he tries to manipulate me into doing so i.e.) making me feel bad by telling me how shitty it is of me to not come home, cutting the phone when I say I don't want to. 

&#x200B;

I understand that he feels lonely, but I have no desire to come home so often. Right now, I go home for one weekend out of the month which I feel like should be enough. The reason I don't is to avoid the drama that comes with just living with family. Not that my family is super dysfunctional, but I feel a lot of the fighting and arguing seems unnecessary and leads to an very unproductive environment. I could make an effort to go home more often, but I feel like my time is just wasted there.

    We talked almost every day for a month and during that time she told me she was worried she wouldn't be able to pay the bills etc. I told her not to worry about my graduation money and just to focus on paying the bills and staying afloat. 
    My birthday is tommorow and I told her we don't need to do anything because I know how tight money is. Well, two days ago I arrive back home and she picks me up. Before we go home, she stops to buy a $1300 iphone X. I didn't think much of it until today when I realized that she promised me $100, convinced me she was super poor, so I figured I would not ask for really anything for graduation or my birthday. Now I honestly feel somewhat lied to. You don't have enough money to give me the promised $100 but you go and buy an iphone? I feel hurt and lied to. It's not about the money, it's about the lying.

Also, this is happening while we are 14, so please consider that. And one more thing, I will have 3 other main people in the story: ""S"", ""A"", and ""B""

So to start, about a year before the main events, S and I met B, who was, for the sake of the story, a massive druggie. So he pulled us in, and since S and I were curious, we decided to buy a vape from him. We almost got caught, so we disposed of it. Nothing drug-related happend until January. S and I stayed friends, but not as much with B.

So later, I decided to buy a weed and vape pen. Me, S, and A would go to someones house to use them while our parents (heavy family friends) were out partying with each other very late. We also sometimes went with B, and got high with him. At this point, however, I was more of a supplier to them than B was. I did not notice this. This continued. One night, B came to my house during a party my parents hosted, and him and I smoked my balcony. He looked very high. Later that week, my mom found my vape juice. She went into an extreme rage, and revealed that one of her friends saw B smoking out, and she noticed that he was high. This is when things got dicey.

B was extremely spoiled, so his parents always believed him. He had blamed his friends when he possessed drugs before, so he did it again. He played the victim and claimed all of the stuff was mine. I immediately went into a rage, and revealed to my parents everything about him, while keeping S and A safe. S and A, did not know this was happening, however. I decided that I was too young to be doing drugs, so I decided to take my weed pen (which is the only thing my mom had not found), and used it one last night with them. We had all decided that this was going to be the last time we did anything. They still did not know that everything had come crashing down. Later, my mom went through all my texts in my phone, and found everything. She contacted S, B, and A's moms, and soon we were all pretty fucked.

A couple weeks after this, S called me yelling at me that I didn't give him a heads up on what happened, and that I ratted out B. I tried to explain to him that he threw me under the bus, and while I was fine taking my own blame, I wasn't going to take someone else's. S and B blocked me, and all 3 of them cut ties. A few weeks after THIS, A (who didn't and still hasn't blocked me) texted me that all 3 of them wanted to hurt me, and he started talking about how I got them all in trouble because of the texts, even though they failed to delete their texts themselves.

Now, my family and his family are going on a vacation in 2 weeks, so I decided to text him to try one last time. I told him that I was sorry and that I would take my blame, but that some of it was their fault too. He told me not to text him, and I stopped. That was today. AITA?"

c0oulv	2019-06-14 20:25:22	Userblankaccount	AITA – For letting my 12 year old nephew watch the Sopranos?	"This situation happened last weekend and I’m at an impasse here. My older brother and my SIL live in the burbs outside my city and once a month like to book a fancy hotel room for a weekend and have some alone time. When they do this, I look after my nephew at my apartment and they pick him up on Sunday when they check out. 

&#x200B;

Typically me and nephew order some pizzas, watch movies, play video games and hang out. I really enjoy these weekends since I don’t usually get to see him and he’s a great kid. My brother’s family doesn’t really come into the city so I get to show nephew around and take him to restaurants he doesn’t have back home etc. 

&#x200B;

So this past weekend, we were hanging out and he asked if we could watch some of The Sopranos. I have the whole set on bluray. I figured that was okay, I realize there’s violence and nudity on the show but I know he’s seen Game of Thrones and John Wick and stuff so I figured the Sopranos would be fairly tame compared to them. Over the course of the weekend we watched the first 6 episodes. 

&#x200B;

Monday I get a call from my SIL. She’s furious I let him watch that. She says it’s completely inappropriate and it’s like letting him watch porn. I honestly didn’t think she’d have this reaction but I do apologize and let her know that it didn’t disturb him or anything and I’m sure he’s seen worse stuff anyway. She calls that irresponsible and that she’s not letting him stay over anymore. At this, I say that she’s making a mountain out of a molehill and overreacting a little bit. She hung up on me at that point. She hasn’t spoken to me since. 

&#x200B;

I’ll fully admit to screwing up and letting him watch it, but I tried to apologize and I really think she is blowing this way out of proportion."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0otc3	2019-06-14 20:22:00	SulkyVirus	AITA for asking my parents to take down the pictures of our newborn daughter they posted on Facebook?	"My wife (27F) and I (27M) just had our first child and something that was important to us was that we didn't have pictures and videos of our daughter posted on social media. It's not because we are anti-social media (my wife has a FB but I don't), but we aren't overly open with sharing every part of our lives with the public like some choose to be (nothing wrong with that). 

At the hospital I made it clear to both of my parents that we didn't want them posting pictures on their Facebook profiles of our daughter. We explained our reasoning and they both agreed without any questions asked. We told them to text family and friends with pictures and to share the news with other posts, just no pictures of her. 

The day after she was born my dad replied to his own post of the good news with a whole bunch of pictures. My wife and I were not happy but didn't get into it and confront him because we were focusing on our daughter and my wife's recovery. Stress was not what we wanted at the time. When my mother brought it up to us I shrugged it off and said ""it's whatever"". Fast forward 3 more days and my mom has now posted an album of pictures of us and our daughter. 

My wife's parents also understood and haven't made any posts. We also haven't made any type of official post or announcement of the birth in my wife's Facebook and we likely won't for a while. Again, she doesn't share much like that. The people that we want to share our happy moments with all know and received phone calls and texts.

I just sent a group text to both of them (they have been divorced for almost my whole life) about it explaining that we know that they are excited and we love that, but that we asked not to post pictures and they both did. I asked that they don't post any more pictures and remove the ones they already did. 

AITA here for not letting my parents share pictures of their granddaughter (not their first) on social media? I know that they want to share their joy with their social media friends and I'm starting to feel guilty about it even though I'm still upset with them.

INFO: the ""it's whatever"" I said was in the tone of ""I don't want to get into it but I'm not happy"", not ""eh, it's not a big deal"". I wanted to clarify since that could have been confusing without the tone of the way I said it. She knew I was NOT happy about it and my wife was visibly upset which is why I didn't want to get into it at the time. She was recovering from a major surgery and all sorts of emotional."

I work as a graphic designer on a small communications team for a company of about 125 employees. When I was recruited to this job in 2017, I was the 8th person on our team, making us fully staffed. Due to a variety of personal and professional reasons, in the past few months, much of my team (including my team leader and direct supervisor) have moved on to other positions. My co-worker's last day is on Wednesday, and once she leaves, there will only be 4 of us left, with 3 open positions. This makes my team's capacity half of what is was less than a year ago, and with the growth of the company taken into account, our responsibilities have only grown, but with half of the people to do the work. Now, I don't want to contribute to the problem by finding another job and then quitting, but I also don't know if I can fix it by staying. I recognise that the hiring process takes time and we might only be understaffed for a while, but the fact that our expectations have grown while my team's capacity has been halved is  concerning to me.

I work as a kids entertainer and chief in a hotel in Italy, and spend most of my time with the 3-6 year olds, as the girls working there are quite new. Everyday we do games, pool, workshop, etc with them in a certain theme. In the evening we also eat with them, watch a movie and dance. 

Right now we have a group of about 20 kids, which is totally fine. However, I’m considering throwing one boy out. He’s 6. He doesn’t hit anyone, or scream or does anything agressive (what has been the only reason to remove a child from the group in the past.) But, he is just too affectionate. (And spoilt rotten.) 

He tries to kiss, forcably hug, etc. not only us but also the others kids, and they actually really don’t like it. (And neither do we.) We’ve asked him to stop, told him, talked to his parents etc, and to no avail. He also nags alot and is relentless in this, but this we can deal with, and it doesn’t bother the other kids. The other stuff does though. Especially the younger ones get really upset about it. 

His parents also really don’t see it as a problem and say he just doesn’t know how to be nice to other kids, but he means well. (Which he does, most of the time.) 

WIBTA if I remove a child from the group for being too affectionate to the other kids and us, even after being warned about it multiple times?

I matched with a guy on Tinder. The second line of his bio reads ""Let's produce music?""

I messaged him first and said ""Hey! Ever need a versatile flute player for your recordings?""

Right from the start, mostly all we did was talk music since we're both musicians. We talked a tiny bit about his upcoming hiking trip, and what we did outside of music. But there was no flirting or anything. Soon after we started talking he showed me a piano track he made and asked me what I thought it needed. I mentioned that I could add flute to it. He asked me what key and mode it was in since he's not classically-trained and I am (he knew that my bachelor's degree is in music performance). I provided him the information. He asked for my advice multiple times, which I happily gave him. We talked about collaborating on a project. He even told me he'd pay me royalties later on if this got off the ground once he produced it and released it. I said I was fine with that.

Eventually I say, ""Hey, I'm free tomorrow night - want to meet up and record some stuff?"" Again, basically no flirting. He says yes, and eventually I tell him that I matched with another guy on Tinder at about the same time I matched with him. The other guy and I went out on a date that weekend (while this guy was out hiking/camping) and we really hit it off. So I would only want to make the recording session about the music, and not try to turn it into a date if he's okay with that. (Remember that the second line of his bio says ""Let's produce music?"")

The guy then says that no, he was only okay doing this ""for free"" because he was interested in me. And if I don't want to date him, then he's not down. Basically implies that it's a waste of his time. I mention that I was interested in collaborating on a cool project, and that \*I\* was offering to provide \*him\* with free flute tracks to use and not charging for \*my\* time and expertise, since \*he\* was the one asking for suggestions and asking things like, ""What key and mode is this in?"" ""What note do you think I should play at the beginning in the bass line?""

He told me he wouldn't record music just to record music, that he wanted to meet me.

I mean...he WOULD be meeting me, just not DATING me.

So, reddit, I get that I could have been more explicit about ONLY wanting to collaborate and not date, but I feel like his response was rude and asshole-y. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Long time reader, first time poster. We all laugh about the situation now, and folks seem to be split down the middle when I share the story; half are horrified, half think it’s hilarious. I’m interested to see the consensus!



This happened about 5 years ago in college. I was hanging out in my dorm room playing games, when my phone pinged with a Facebook notification. I had been tagged in two separate comments by two of my other roommates, who were just in the other room. **(We are all guys - important point here)**


When I opened my phone, I was shocked by what they’d done. My school had a “Buying/Selling” page for students to sell supplies, room decor, clothing, etc. . This girl (who none of us remotely knew) had posted a bunch of clothes for sale. My friends had tagged me in comments on her post. They read “Oh **OP** (me tagged) would you like these?” and “Hey **OP**, you interested???”  


This girl was clearly just trying to sell some old clothes and I thought my friends had absolutely crossed the line. It was a smaller school, so it was very likely we had friends in common. I ran over to their room, barged in, and demanded they delete their posts. They were chuckling and didn’t understand why I was so upset, but agreed to take down their comments. When they went to do so though, the post HAD BEEN DELETED. 



I spent the rest of the day furious that my friends had pulled this nonsense and might’ve possibly scared this poor person off the page. We eventually moved on from it and it wasn’t really brought up again until recently. So reddit, AITA for flipping out? Did I overreact? Let me know!

A young woman (I don’t know her) in a very fast sports car pulls up behind me and starts tailgating me and swerving around. I was going the speed limit (25MPH) - there’s tons of kids around this area. I ended up pulling over so she could pass me, and she flew down the road. She pulled into her driveway and I pulled over and asked her to slow down. I think I said ‘hey could you slow down, kids live in this neighborhood.’ She started yelling at me and told me she was going to call the cops on me. Her husband came out and started screaming at me too. I left. It probably was about a 30 second confrontation. Now I’m wondering if I should have just ignored her? I have a very small child and live just down the road, and people speed on our street all the time. I also had a friend whose daughter was hit and killed in her neighborhood by a guy that was speeding last year. So maybe I’m extra sensitive. Thanks for reading.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Currently I am house sitting for a couple that has three small dogs (a Yorkie, Maltese, and a Morkie). I have watched their dogs and house for them a few times a year since 2016. They met me through the Rover app and now just contact me directly. For payment we usually just use apple pay at some point during the stay so money is not collected up front.

The Maltese was 11 years old and they mentioned before leaving on their trip that he had been acting sleepy and ""old age"", so to just keep a close eye on him. Everything went as usual the first night, he was relatively active and happy. The second night I was there he became very lethargic and I facetimed/ called the owner as soon as the behavior started and they said he had been behaving that way every few days and to just keep watch of him and let them know if it gets worse. I decided to just let him rest on the couch although I was still a bit worried. He ended up passing during the night and I called the owners as soon as I discovered it. They were understandably very upset and concerned about me and the fact that I had to deal with their dog passing. Since he passed due to old age and his heart condition, they are not placing any blame on me, just an unfortunate situation. It has been a few days now and they are still grieving while on their trip and they are coming back tomorrow evening. In the meantime I have still taken care of the other two dogs and stayed in their home, sending several photo and text updates assuring them everything is going okay. I have even left work early most days this week to spend time with the other two dogs so they don't get lonely.

They haven't brought up paying me since before the dog passed away, and I wanted to know if I would be the asshole if I asked for payment tomorrow before they return home?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c0op5n	2019-06-14 20:11:19	gruppyluppy	AITA for the way I handle rude guests?	"I used to work at Disney World, and this was on my mind the whole time.

I worked with the characters, basically as their body guard. I made sure that no little kids were going to beat up Mickey Mouse, that kind of thing. It was also my job to help take pictures of guests with their phones.

Usually, I gave people the benefit of the doubt. People always get flustered meeting their favorite characters. Sometimes, the rudeness went to far.

A lot of the time, people would shove their phones in my face before they’d go up to Mickey Mouse without so much as one second of eye contact, much less a “please”. I’ve had people toss their phones to me, or wave their phones in the air, expecting me to come grab them instead of handing them to me. Sometimes, if a guest was especially rude like that, I’d take the phone but wouldn’t take any photos unless they’d explicitly ask. They’d come back a few minutes later, angry that there were no photos of them and Mickey Mouse. Of course, I’d allow them to retake the photos after saying, “Oh! Sorry! I just thought you expected me to hold your phone for you! You didn’t ask for a picture!”

c0oogo	2019-06-14 20:09:41		AITA for not wanting to be around someone due to their depression?	"I am fully aware of how serious mental health is, that’s why I want to be there for this person. But I feel like they are starting to be co-dependent. I just started hanging out with them a couple of months ago and almost every time I hang out with them, they tell me that I make them so happy and that they forget about their depression. And once I leave, they go back to feeling depressed. They tell me that the only reason they clean their house is when I go over, the only reason that they take care of their hygiene is for me, the only reason they requested certain days off is to be convenient around MY schedule. Everything they do is because of ME. They tell me that before we started talking, they were very depressed and now they’re aiming to get better. But it feels like they only want better because they want ME, and not for THEMSELVES.
I’ve told them to go to counseling, and all they says is “yeah one day I will” but I don’t see them  trying to find a counselor. 
I don’t think this is healthy behavior. I want to help them but at the same time I feel very drained and almost responsible for their emotions and I just want to be away from them. I care about them but... I don’t know what to do.

c0omym	2019-06-14 20:05:59	MissPugLover24	AITA for jokingly teasing my friend?	"So my friend (let’s call her Ella) and I were looking through our yearbook (we’re in high school) and we saw one of our friends (let’s call him Matt) on one of the swim pages and he was in a group picture. We found it really funny, and thought he looked like the one kid in the ‘I smell like Beef’ vine. So, we thought he would think it was funny too, and we took a picture of the yearbook picture and sent it to him, also sending the vine and saying ‘Spot the Difference.’ 

We didn’t think anything of it, because Matt will constantly make fun of us, sometimes borderline really mean. Like in a class he had with Ella he would constantly tell her when she talked about her friends (including me) that she didn’t really like them and she actually hated them.

 And even though I’ve explained to him that I have a disorder that makes me grow much slower, and I have to go through a lot so I can grow, he’ll constantly point out that I’m short. Now, I don’t particularly mind this, he’s hardly the only person to do it, and at this point I kind of tune it out. What he often does that really bothers me is say “You look like a third grader” or “When I first saw you I thought you were like six” or “Oh my god how do you get through the hallways knowing everyone thinks you’re a middle schooler or something”. I brush it off, because friends make fun of friends, and like it doesn’t really get to me too too much. 

So he receives the text, and texts back “STOP” “LITERALLY STOP” “I STG” “I KNOW” “I KNOWWWWWWWW”.  Matt’s always been a little flamboyant.

I texted back saying “it’s just Ella’s dying over it-she thinks you look like a penguin from the movie Madagascar in the picture”. 

We send some pictures of us looking like shit in the yearbook, and you know everyone knows that nobody looks good in the yearbook, and we were thinking it was all over. We made a couple of comments how we look like potatoes in the pictures etc etc. 

He sends back “Making fun of the way someone looks is so low” “like actually” “fuck You”. 

We were COMPLETELY taken aback.

Especially since Matt makes fun of us all the time. 

We each texted him an apology an hour later, saying we didn’t mean it in a harmful way. He’s active on Instagram and is ignoring the both of us completely. 

In the morning Matt texts back “All is forgiven” to the both of us.

We feel like the ‘all is forgiven’ was a little high and mighty, but what we’re the most confused about is how he reacted that way, and that strongly. If he makes fun of us, can we not poke fun at him? We apologized more because of how upset he was than the comments, and honestly we kind of didn’t think they were anywhere near as mean spirited as his are to us. 

Obviously this is our side of the story, and I’m telling it as honestly and as factually as I can.

We feel bad for upsetting Matt, but we think that as far as teasing among friends go, our comments were on the very light end of the spectrum.

I asked her if she would mind not sharing the details and she blew up. Saying that she had to live through the past year too and it's not just me that had to deal with it.

c0olf4	2019-06-14 20:02:09	ABBAsuperfan94	AITA reporting the Airbnb host who made a pass at me	"I bought a room through Airbnb abroad for a long weekend in Nice, France. The room was hosted by an 'Andrea' with a picture of a couple and I genuinely thought it was a woman. The reviews left on the host were great and all positive - from men and women.

On that first night there, after a nap in the evening I got up and found the host with a friend, we spoke briefly and discussed about all of us going out for wine. I said that would be great, but then I stayed in my room and fell asleep again. When I woke up it was 10pm and the host was by himself.

He said no restaurants or bar would be open at this time. Then asked me if I wanted to watch French Netflix with him. It happened to be in his bedroom. I thought he was just being friendly since all the reviews were positive. He spent half an hour making a Netflix account and we started to watch a cartoon.

At some point he asked me to lie down next to him which I said no to but he insisted. I did. Then he made me put my head on his chest, put his arms around me and kissed my head. He stroked my hair and my back. I kind of froze. I let the episode finish and then said I was tired and went to my bedroom. He texted me to say sorry straight after.

I didn't sleep the entire night because I was scared. In the morning I called airbnb and they supported me in leaving and finding another room. Although he didn't force me to do anything more, he made me uncomfortable and I don't think I could have stayed there for the rest of the time, sharing a shower etc. 

It turns out his account is now suspended and he has lost a source of income.
AITA and did I overreact? He was a man trying his luck but he didn't push me and he apologised.

UPDATE: thank you everyone for your responses. The overwhelming feedback seems that he was wrong to try it and it was right to report him. There were some comments that I was TA for leading him on. I'm 24, and I should have known better. I wish I was able to shut down situations like this quicker, I wish I was more assertive or aggressive in saying no.

c0ocm5	2019-06-14 19:40:33	Daveydave06	AITA for telling an 8 year old he is going to get his ass kicked when he gets older	"Let me give you a little background. A friend of my SO has an 8 year old son who has been going through a phase where he thinks he is grown and thinks it's funny to act out and disrespect his mom and other adults. For most of his life his father had been and out of jail and is one of those white guys that thinks he is ""hood"" (for lack of a better term, we all know the type) and the kid is starting to pick up the same mentality and attitude from his dad who now comes around him more. 

A couple of instances in which he acts:

Openly back talks and disrespectful of his mother, even after she physically and materially disciplines him, he tries to act like a badass and I've caught him flipping her off when she isn't looking etc.
(This issue I'm neutral on, its shitty behavior but I feel like most kids go through some kind of phase like this)

The actions that prompted me, a grown man, to say this to him is:

When he is just around my 5 year old step son, he plays normally and he and my SS are great friends, however if some of his same age friends are around he tries to be cool in front of them and tries to punk the younger kids, i.e. make fun of them or various assholery. 

I've also watched him be a dick to his own friends in which he repeatedly kept calling the other boy a different name after the boy repeatedly asked him to stop.

That is when in front of his friends and my SS and SO and the kids mom at the pool, I called him out and told him that if he keeps acting like an asshole to everyone he isn't going to have any friends and there will be kids that won't take that and will likely kick his ass as he gets older

He is just progressively becoming little A hole, and his mother had no problem with my comment to her son nor did my SO. Not looking for validation, just to you good people of Reddit for analysis

Edit for typos
*********************************************
Since you guys seem pretty split here on the issue let me add a follow up

Now I wasn't going to mention this occasion that happened at my house while they were over to play a week later but oh well.

Anyways, my SS, the 8 year old, and his 3 year old sister are all playing and he is trying to show out and back talk his mom and all the usual ""stunting"" 

My SO, his mom and myself are all pretty close and have a mutual agreement that we have permission to discipline each others kids if necessary for clarification.

Anyways, I didn't appreciate the way he was trying to act so I told him straight up that if he didn't stop that I would whoop his ass instead of his momma, to which he tried to buck up and say that he would just tell his dad. I laughed and told him that was fine, his dad can get some too. Not the response he expected,  and haven't had an issue with him since.

I'm no role model of the year but effective nonetheless

I've never laid a hand on the kid for anyone wanting to freak out about me saying that, I also don't think whipping your kids is very effective in terms of behavior correction but I certainly am not above it. Getting my ass spanked sure corrected some poor behavior as a kid.

I care about the kid and don't want him to grow up to be a punk.

c0objj	2019-06-14 19:37:56	gruppyluppy	AITA for my bus etiquette?	"I’m currently a part of a program that has a bus system to ferry around the participants. We all work for the same company, and a lot of people use the bus to get to and from work. A lot of people also use the bus for leisure. We all pay the same amount for these buses.

It’s generally accepted that the bus is first come first serve- if you want a seat, get there early. However, there’s one bus that picks up at a leisure stop before it goes to the stop that picks up people who worked. During peak times, the seats on this bus are often already filled by the time it gets to the next stop, and the people who work that day have to stand.

Every now and then, someone makes a passive aggressive Facebook post in our program group trying to shame people who sit on the bus and don’t give up their seats to the working people. There’s usually a lot of debate on these sort of posts.

On one hand, it’s courteous to give up your seat to a worker if you were having a leisure day and didn’t work. On the other hand, we all pay the same for these buses and you wouldn’t go up to someone on the NYC metro and ask them to move because you’re tired and they look “less tired.” Also, some workers change into plain clothes before they board the bus, so you can never be certain of who worked and who didn’t that day.

c0oal8	2019-06-14 19:35:37	bwnorman	WIBTA If I spoke up about being overlooked for Father’s Day at work?	"Preface: ultimately I don’t care, my feelings aren’t extremely hurt and I don’t feel this was done on purpose. I just think it is overlooked and may potentially cause a problem in the future.

I work in a large 70+ person department that has a ‘Fun Committee’. Last month on the Friday before Mother’s Day, they went around and gave a nice little flower thing for the moms of the department to take home. I thought it was really sweet and thought nothing of it.

Fast forward to today, and Father’s Day is this weekend. Nobody brought anything around, and after I discussed it with my coworkers I sat with, I realize that I’m literally the only man with children in the department. This isn’t a secret as I have pictures on my desk of my kids, and most people who know me know I have kids.

Like I said, it’s no skin off my back but I don’t want to be an asshole and point something out like that when I ultimately don’t care too much about it (only a little). I can just see next year if we potentially hire a new guy with kids or one of our current male employees has kids and this continues, it could be seen at the worst discriminatory, at the least it could be hurtful."

"Backstory: last year my spouse applied to several med schools that are relatively close (2-3 hours)to where we are now but they also applied to an additional school that’s roughly 8 hours away. I am currently under contract to stay in our current area for a minimum of 3 years from now. 

Current situation: As it turns out, the one 8 hours away is the only one they got accepted too. In my mind I though no big deal, just apply again next year. Apparently, based on their research, if they didn’t take this acceptance it would blacklist them from other schools and they would likely never receive another acceptance. After that, we argued about wether or not they should go or not. 

In my mind, I honestly do not see how this would work. We previously started talking about how we wanted kids but obviously that wouldn’t be possible in this situation.

So once I was back everything was happy for the first few days but then I started noticing that my mom was not allowing me, a 19 year old guy who has been living on his own for 1 year, to do anything. First she told me that I couldn't use my car because the engine was broken, something that I quickly figured out to be false. So when I asked her for the keys she got extremely upset at me and told me not to ask for the keys or attempt to use the cars, I was very surprised to receive this reaction but I didn't got that upset because my dad agreed to lend me his car whenever I wanted to use it (as long as my mom didn't figure out).
Flash forward to 7 days ago, my dad had to take his car on a business trip (a month long trip to another country) and I was left alone with my mom, the first thing she did was telling me that I had to stay at home taking care of the house and asking me to open the door to my little sister everyday she came back from school, she would then proceed to stay more time at work doing who knows what (she usually has a 4 hour shift, and suddenly she started coming home 2 hours later than average). So me being really respectful of her did just that. However I was getting tired of staying at home all day (at this point I did just that for 6 days in a row) and not getting the chance to go out with my friends, do some tourism,  having any fun at all really. So today when she came back from work I asked her to please take me out somewhere or at least allow me to go on my own. At first she told me she was tired and she was not going to, I told her that I was tired of staying at home all day, and that if she wouldn't go with me I would go on my own. At this point she was extremely upset at me and told me to not even think about doing that, I lost it at this point, I told her that I didn't care about anything she said, and that she was the laziest and most boring human being I ever met. She stared at me in silence and went to her room, I promptly followed her to tell her even more thing but then I saw she was crying. I left her alone and went for a walk around the city. Now I came back and she refuses to talk with me. 
Am I the asshole? I feel like maybe I got too mad at her, specially because I don't feel she really did anything specially bad at me. I just don't know what to think of the situation."	Everyone Sucks	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0o8y8	2019-06-14 19:31:40	Veauxdeeohdoh	WIBTA? - I paid for my daughters trip to visit relatives, and now she's changed the whole trip to not see any relatives.	"I paid for a ticket for my daughter (age 43) to visit our relatives in the UK. She's never been, I was born there. She was super happy and said it was, ""the trip of a lifetime"".

Since we booked the tickets, she asked if my granddaughter (age 16) could go if she paid for the ticket. I siad she could and I would pay for half of my granddaughters ticket. 

Since then, my daughter has booked hotels, restaurants, river trips and palace visits in the UK and a week in Paris. I discussed this on Mothers Day and she said she wasn't going to see any relatives, ""we don't know if they're serial killers"" (this is my Aunt and cousins). She said ""forget it just cancel the whole thing"" and left (and hasn't talked to me since then). Now she says we dont have time to visit any relatives. She has told me I can visit the relatives and she and my granddaughter will be going to the Cotswolds and Paris. 

She owes me money (about $700 USD) for Hamilton tickets and other tickets. I feel like getting that money paid back and then cancelling her ticket, and I would if my granddaughter wasn't involved.

Right now, I plan on getting the money she owes me back, and just doing my own thing in the UK and Paris. My granddaughter wants me to go to everything my daughter has planned."	Not the A-hole	0	0	218.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

c0o82y	2019-06-14 19:29:35	ab235	WIBTA if I gradually stopped giving advice to a friend who only reaches out when they need something and doesn't message much otherwise?	"M25 here, went to uni with a F23 who I got along with pretty well. We were in a few classes together and often worked on projects/homework together for said classes. In general, she was known as the flaky/disorganized type -- late to appointments, always in rush, always overbooked. Sometimes, we'd make plans to hang out but she would end up not showing up if she was with another group of people she was more interested in hanging out with. 

&#x200B;

She'd ask me for a lot of advice during college -- on her big projects, relationships with teachers, etc., sometime taking hours in person or over the phone to go over every single possibility, every possible outcome, etc. I'd try my best to help in these cases but it became so often that my roommates began telling me that this girl seemed really needy to them. It never bothered me too much, because I was just helping out a friend, right? On occasion she would tell me sometimes about the guys who liked her and how she realized how they could really do a lot of things for her (especially listen when she had problems), and that sometimes she felt bad asking them for advice but would do it anyway knowing that they would drop anything they were doing and see what she needed.

&#x200B;

So uni ended and we did our best to keep in touch, each moving across the country. She'd occasionally Skype me about her new job as a research assistant and i'd tell her how my 1st year in grad school was going. Starting this year (Jan), I noticed that every time she reached out, it would just be a way to get to a question she had about grad school and applications. More recently, she rarely messages about anything else, just question after question -- who should my recommender be? Would you recommend that I put this experience on my resume?, sometimes following up with even more questions even before I've responded to her previous questions. I feel that I don't even know what's going on in her life anymore (and she doesn't care what's going on in mine), and that I've just turned into someone she just automatically reaches out to for advice and expects an answer for any (even miniscule) questions that she has on anything grad-school related.

&#x200B;

Bear in mind that I do have several other friends also going through a similar process, who also occasionally ask me things about the process, but for some reason I don't feel that I'm getting used when I talk to them. I also don't know the best way to go about explaining how I feel -- is it too upfront to tell someone that you feel that they only message you when they need something?"

c0o2ty	2019-06-14 19:16:51	ImogenCrusader	AITA for asking my dad not to see his sister anymore?	"So my aunt is invited to come with us to a local convention  because her cousin runs it and she can see him in return for paying half of the room cost at the hotel. She agrees and off we go.

The morning of the second day  i wake up, get dressed/the usual morning stuff and she starts nagging me to clean the room. I say no and attempt to leave then and there but she blocks my exit.

I do the sane thing and start raising my voice, i scream at her to let me go as i'm late and will do it later. She doesn't and calls my mom who tells her to just disengage and leave me alone, she doesn't.

The day goes pretty smoothly and at that night i'm enjoying a larp (vampire the masquerade) it was my second time there in two years and this group knew i drove 3+ hours just for this event so they were really flattered.

So thats why dad conspired with the organizers to suprise me with a big sheet cake as a happy birthday. I was thrilled, everyone was happy they'd be getting cake, dads a superstar, win win win. Except my aunt is the one tasked with giving it to me and she makes sure to glare at me and practically slam it down on the table.

i don't remember how it happened but Aunt and i finally got in a fight and i escaped into the convention for the day, but unlike before we still had a 3 hour trip home. I tried to call mom, get dad to rent me a room for the night, anything not to get in that car but all was fruitless and i was forced to go.

Soon as i got in the car she took my phone away because 'she didn't want me telling lies'. Being bored i soon complained of being hungry. She told me i could eat when i got home, in three hours, after i skipped breakfast to escape her.

She did the typical parent thing, yelled back, i yelled more, so i say something mean and she FLIPS. 

She pulls the car over, yanks open the door, shoves me into the seat and tells me to say i'm sorry. I refuse and yell for dad who is telling her to get off, sternly, but takes no action. So she does the only sane thing and STARTS FORCING MY FINGERS BACK IN AN ATTEMPT TO BREAK THEM.

Dad tries to yank her off but she keeps bending them till i say i'm sorry under duress. She lets go, and i sob myself to sleep and am teleported home.

Once home i tell mom, she helps me file a police report and i post on fb to warn our family what a crazy b*tch she is. So her son comes in and threatens me because she has bruises on her const, from where i kicked her.

It takes all of a minute for my mom to see my then 26 year old, former drug addict cousin has threatened me so its back to the police station with a printed out screenshot to report more shit.

He reaponds by keying our car.

So i tell my dad that its either his sister or me, and its at least a year before he finally chooses me. He drops off the face of the planet for awhile.

so....am i the asshole? I know its his sister, and his nephew, but i'm his daughter and the one time i truly needed him to defend me he didn't.

CLARIFICATION: i just saw the rule about 'boring posts' and wanted to clarify. I know my aunt is an asshole, but am i also one for asking dad to cut contact with her?"	Not enough info	0	0	2.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

When we first started, I ordered a pretty cool shirt. But it then got stuck in shipping and wouldn’t arrive until after the last day school. I realized this and bought a new shirt for my friend. So fast forward to after the last day of school and the shirt now arrives. I tell my friend about it and he’s down for me to give it to him. But now I feel a little weird, I basically bought him two shirts that are both cool and spent money on. I asked around my friend group if I should give it to him since it’s essentially not even apart of the gift exchange anymore. Some of the people agree that i shouldn’t have to give it to him and others are neutral to it saying I probably should just give it. But since I told him it arrived and he know it exists since I mentioned how I needed to buy a replacement shirt originally, I don’t know what to do. I feel like I don’t have to give it to him since I bought him an already good shirt, but it’s technically the shirt I bought for him that he knows about.	Not the A-hole	0	0	171.0	47.0	0.0	0.0

c0o09x	2019-06-14 19:10:50	softsapphic	AITA for blocking this guy?	"So, as a little background, I’m a 17 year old girl and I’m in a college prep program. During the summer I spend five days a week living on campus at my local community college taking free college classes. There’s one person over the entire program (I’ll call her Katie), but there are also several different counselors that are mostly just there to make sure we go to class and don’t kill each other. 

I did this program last year too, and there was a counselor that I’ll call Michael for the sake of anonymity. He worked in the program for five years total, and there were a lot of rumors that he was predatory to the boys in the program. He didn’t come back this year, and some of the boys are saying it’s because he used their files that Katie keeps to get their phone numbers to try to hit them up. I don’t know how true that is, though. 

So anyway, about three days ago Michael started snapchatting me. I’m not even sure where he got my snapchat from, but I answered anyway. He asked how the program was, who my dorm counselor was, etc. Then, he asked me when I came out because I have a rainbow flag in my bio. He started talking about when he came out, and later on sent me this link about homosexuality and the Bible. All the messages were innocent, but all in all he ended up messaging me enough that he was on my best friends list on snapchat. It made me uncomfortable to be talking to him since he’s so much older than me (either 28 or 29, I’m not exactly sure) and I don’t know him well at all. I’m pretty close to one of the other counselors in the program, and he told me just to ignore Michael, so I did. Then Michael called me shady for opening his messages and not responding. I ended up blocking him on snapchat today.

Not even ten minutes after I blocked him there, he messaged me on instagram asking what he did wrong, so I blocked him on my regular instagram and my spam account as well as facebook just in case. 

The other counselor said that I did the right thing, but I still feel like I’m being a bitch since he didn’t really do anything wrong. He was polite and just wanted to talk, but I blocked him. AITA?

c0nzj8	2019-06-14 19:09:04	daughterthief	AITA for letting my daughter get away with stealing from me?	"My daughter Anna is 18. She is just finishing off her A Level exams and has a bright future ahead of her. Her mock exam marks, predicted grades and coursework grades were excellent and she is top of the class in all three of her subjects. She has been offered a place to study economics at one of the best ranked universities in the country should she maintain her predicted grades (which she certainly will given her mock exam performance). 

Anna spends most of her time with my ex wife but spends some evenings and weekends with me. Last week she was saying that once her exams are done, she and her friends are planning to go on a ''girls holiday'' to Ibiza once they have all finished their exams. 

The problem is that Anna's mum Michelle has pretty firmly stated that if Anna wants things like holidays, she will have to pay for them herself. Michelle was willing to let Anna get away with not having a part time job because her studies came first, but when exams finish Michelle expects her to start looking for work and work full time until uni starts. 

Anna was upset about this and asked me for the money. I said no for the simple reason that I don't want to undermine her mother's decisions. I did have a phone call with Michelle about it but she still decided against it and it was only fair to respect that decision. 

Anna spent yesterday evening at my place, and since I have a room for her she spent it in there while I was cooking. It wasn't until this morning that my bank statement showed an unusual transaction. I knew straight away what it was and called Anna for an explanation. She admitted to using my debit card to pay for her place on the holiday. 

Anna came to my place today and I told her that she needed to tell her mum what she had done. She phoned her and did so, but Michelle said that since it was my money that was stolen, it was my responsibility to punish her. Anna broke down in tears, saying that all her friends parents were willing to pay for them, and that it wasn't fair that Michelle was stopping her from going. 

In the end I decided I wasn't going to punish her. Firstly because adding even more stress won't be wise during her exam period, but also because I do understand her reasoning. While I wouldn't have dared to steal from my parents when I was a kid, she was desperate and by the sounds of it did so in the heat of the moment. 

However, I have had Michelle on the phone biting my ear off claiming I am setting a bad example for letting her get away with it. I think after letting her off, changing my mind last minute would make things even worse. It's a difficult decision to make but I think it's the right one.

c0nyyi	2019-06-14 19:07:42	noachoolforhusband	AITA for not wanting my husband to go back to school.	"Throwaway, husband uses reddit.  
  
Backstory first. I (27f) work full time as does my husband (26m). I do make more than my husband and the dicotomy is only going to increase as time goes due to my line of work. We have two kids, a 2 and a half year old  and a 10 month old. We both love our kids endlessly and share equally in all parental duties.  
   
All that said, I do work earlier than my husband and pick both of our children up from their respective daycares and am home with them for a couple hours before my husband gets home. When he gets home, he is more often than not in a, for lack of a better word, shitty mood. He does not like his job, and that stress follows him home.  
   
We are not financially well off at the moment but in the future due to my job, we have spoken of the possibility of him being a stay at home dad. This is the future that I thought we were working towards.  
  
About a month ago, my husband informed me that he was in the process of applying for college. I was a little taken aback due to us both talking about our future with him at home. I am trying to be supportive of the idea, but, did mention that i had thought that he was looking forward to being a stay at home dad.  
  
That is where I left the conversation. I did not tell him of my other concerns which are more responsible for my disagreement with him going back to school. I mentioned that he is in a shitty mood sometimes when he gets back home, and that attitude can sometimes be taken out on our kids.  
   
Now, I do want to stress that he is a great and loving father, but, on some days, seeing the way he interacts with our children can be heartbreaking. He can be short with them and often will shout at our oldest. Every interruption the kids can cause is likely to upset him and cause him to be angry. Most nights I will take over caring for the kids to give him a break as I can see that he is in a bad mood.  
  
The financial aspect of college is also an issue I have. As I mentioned, we are not too financially well off and I do not know how well we could manage the prospect of student loans.   
     
   
**Edit:** Im adding info to maybe help clarify some things.  
   
My husband had decided himself he wanted to be a stay at home dad. He still hasnt said that isnt what he wants to do. If he were to have a change of heart I would not even mind, this is not an issue of me trying to stop hik from achieving his dreams or halt his happiness. This whole school thing was just dumped on me.  
   
About the school. Its a film school in our state that he will be attending through online classes while at home. He will be trying to get a degree in some form of entertainment management (i think). The reason this concerns me is how short he is with the children already. **this is my main concern**. I do not want his behavior at home to get worse due to the added stress of schoolwork and deadlines.  
    
Our financial situation currently demands us both to be working. In maybe 4 years or less it would be feesible for him to no longer work. At that time if he still wanted i would have no issue with him returning to school. Once he no longer has to work at a job he hates.  
  
In the meantime i more than encourage him to find other work that he might enjoy more. But i think adding to his plate while life as it stands seems to be too much for him to bear without snapping out our children at every turn is not wise for the family.

c0nyqd	2019-06-14 19:07:12		WIBTA if I bought my step daughter a horse against her father's wishes?	"My wife, Jane (29F), was raised in a very conservative and religious family and married Richard (34M) at a young age. They had a daughter, Sarah (12F), less than a year later but were divorced 2 years into the marriage after Jane came out. She was immediately disowned by her entire family and has struggled for years to coparent with Richard who has somehow become even more conservative than he was before.

Jane and I (28F) met about 5 years ago and Sarah and I were introduced a year later. Sarah and I immediately bonded over a love of horses and I got to be the one to take her on her first trail ride which she loved. After talking with her father, her mom and I signed her up for lessons and has recently started to work at the barn a few hours a week in exchange for additional time. 

However, she's at the point where if she wants to continue improving she needs to dedicate more time to riding. She's been saving every penny so she can afford to lease a horse and has about $500 saved up. Originally my wife and I told her we would pay for half of the year and Richard offered $300/year (leasing in our area is usually about $350/month or half the cost of boarding).

Jane and I have been thinking about buying a property large enough to move my horse on to for a while now and we recently found one that we love. However, since horses are herd animals and shouldn't be kept alone we decided it made the most sense logically and financially to buy Sarah her own horse for her birthday in August. Horses trained in her discipline and suitable for her riding ability are usually around $4-6k to buy or $800-1200 to adopt. I'm personally not a fan of using rescues for horses (they maintain ownership of the horse and are free to take it back whenever they see fit) but it would be Sarah's choice. 

We emailed Richard to let him know our plans and ask if he wanted to be involved in the process. He then called and left a voice mail screaming at us for ""throwing money at [his] daughter to convert her to a homosexual lifestyle"" and ""a blatant attempt for [me] to groom her.""

This isn't the first time he's accused us of this and he was reprimanded by the judge for it the last time they went to court. I know things are difficult on his end right now; money is tight, and Sarah started living primarily with us last fall but that has nothing to do with us and everything to do with his attitude and the choices he's made. 

If there were any other reasons for not wanting Sarah to have a horse he didn't express them. My opinion is that the issues he's raised are bullshit and that I need to make the decisions that are best for my family. 

TLDR: Step daughter's father thinks that buying her a horse will make her gay or make it easier for me to sexually abuse her. I think his reasoning is stupid and we should just do what's right for our family."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0nwlh	2019-06-14 19:02:02	anaknyte	AITA For not wanting to pay a friend for a car she sold?	"I had just moved back to my home state and my friend lent me her car while I was saving up. The car was a piece of crap and everyone was just waiting for it to bust. It finally did on my way to work one day, and I agreed to pay for the repairs once we got someone to look at it.

Friend kept me waiting for weeks and just had her bf look at it and tell me what he thought was wrong. Eventually I ended up going to her place and finding out from her mom that she'd sold the car for super cheap. When I asked friend about it she said she had no choice and I still owed her 200 for what her bf said was wrong.

It's caused a huge strain on our friendship because I just don't think I owe her money for a car she decided to sell, especially not when she refused to get it looked at by an actual mechanic. AITA?

Edit: Bf claims to be a mechanic, but we had both agreed to have her uncle look at it since he actually is once/works as one.

I used the car for a few months and made it clear that I didn't want to just throw money at it hoping one of the repairs would work, which is why we agreed on having her uncle look at it. There were already issues with the clutch, engine, and ac. If she had had it looked at I would've paid whatever the cost is, but she just sold it.

Edit 2: I did give her 100 since I thought that was fair with neither of us agreeing about it.

Edit 3: Just to clear up some confusion on a couple things:
1. We had discussed payment but she insisted I didn't need to pay her anything. I even offered to pay the insurance while I used it, but was also turned down on that.
2. I helped her out in other ways since I was thankful. I'd get her baby stuff she needed, buy her and her family (whom she lived with) food every week, take her out whenever she requested, and just spent whatever money on her she asked. I can understand being frustrated about the money aspect if I'd never given her a cent, but over the months I spent hundreds on her. 
3. For anyone asking if it had been repaired or looked at, no. Her bf looked at it for a little bit and just said it was the clutch. Once he did she treated it as law and never even attempted to contact her uncle. She just sold the car having only had her bf look at it."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

"Okay, so basically I (26) have a super close friend (26) of mine who has moved to another country. She is a lovely person and caring, but has a tendency to straight up lie her ass off. Not little things, but sprawling lies, usually involving invented people. Other friends have pointed this out, but I have usually dismissed this. 

Today she uploaded a series of pictures on her Instagram Story about a friend of hers who had passed. Now, she's in a different country and we are adults with lives, so I presumed she has made friends. 
Anyhoo, something seemed fishy about this picture of this 'friend' she uploaded (black and white, blurry, a bit.... professional) so I did a reverse Google search and lo and behold, I found multiple versions of that exact picture (clearly not by her). 

Now, this friend's partner is in another country (currently applying for a visa to be able to live with my friend). Do I tell her partner? Should I call her out?  

And if I did so, WIBTA? 

I feel like I can potentially lose a friend here but I don't want to hurt someone who is clearly concocting fantasies in her head, which again, I strongly feel aren't real.

Edit: I, and her partner, have been VERY worried about her, as you would be if you found out that someone's relation had passed away. 
I reached out to her, and as she was not very responsive in her texts (which would be understandable) and since she has a history of self-harm I reached out to her partner as well. 

It was only around half an hour later that I did the image search. 

Her partner does NOT know that my friend is lying. She is clearly very upset (as one would be) because they're in different countries, and she can't be there for her in a time of comfort. 

I should also point out that I, while not friends with her partner, do know her, and semi-regularly interact with her through social media. 

I should also specify that I WILL have a talk with my friend."	Not the A-hole	0	0	2.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Context: I’m graduating college on Monday and I am being treated do dinner as my present from my parents. I decided to go make a reservation at a very expensive restaurant and invite only 3 people (2 life long friends A&B and my other best friend from college who will I call C) so we could really celebrate as opposed to catering from a cheaper restaurant, hosting and  having lots of people over which was an option at one point. 

I basically invited B who was so happy and excited but could only make dinner because of work. A took the day off o f work month in advance to come to both events.  I’m so appreciative for their efforts. Next I invite C to graduation and dinner. After I asked her about coming to graduation C first lied to me saying she was busy driving home from her parents that morning (2 hrs away) even though graduation was at 4 in the afternoon and claimed she only will be in town for  dinner (she would have over 8 hours of time to be ready if she left in morning as she planned). Later I mentioned she would have enough time to attend both events, as she got caught in her lie admitted she had no plans would be home (2 minutes walking distance from where graduation is being held I’m not lying) and made another excuse saying she didn’t want to sit in the heat. She furthermore said I wanted being unreasonable wanting her to come to my boring graduation and she would never ask such a thing of me and that she only wants to come to the expensive dinner that my parents are paying for. 

I know graduation sucks and Is boring but it is important to me and she know this. She’s not having to sit with family or alone or with stranger just with A who though is my best friend, is friends with us both. I am beyond hurt as I have wasted hours on hours hanging out with her while she run pointless errands. Throughout our friendship I’ve spend probably 300 hours in total if not more spending time doing activities things I didn’t enjoy but did so because she wanted me there (class presentations, nails, hair appointments, pharmacy runs, walking her dogs). I wanted to be a good friend and show my support 

I want to uninvite her from dinner. AITA if I do that? I told my parent the situation and they are willing to pay for her dinner place even with her not coming to graduation.  They are also willing to let me invite D another person in addition to C that is willing to come to both events and I a really good friend from college also just not quite as close. This is costing them a lot of money but they say it’s not worth potentially losing a friend to be an asshole and make a point. I feel conflicted because her excuses were lies or really shitty. This is not the first time she has lied or done shady things and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or this should be the last straw. I already told her it was important to me and she doesn’t care.

"My friends and I have been planning to find a 2 bed for around 1500 a month and just split the rent 3 ways, but I guess they recently changed their minds and now want me to pay 700 while they pay 400 each. I would understand this if they weren’t going to share a bedroom anyway whether or not I was there, but this seems quite unfair especially considering I’d be getting the non-master bedroom, bedrooms are not the whole apartment and we’d still be sharing the living room, bathroom etc. 

I don’t want this to hurt our friendship but I also am willing to do just about anything to move the fuck out already. I don’t have the best home life currently and they both know how much I need to leave in order to be a mentally healthy and sane person so it seems kinda dickish that they would do this but hey, maybe there’s something I don’t know about how apartments work.

I am still amazed at the lunches and overall benefits that tech companies give you. I get a free catered lunch every day, and it’s a huge variation of AMAZING FOOD. Not just cafeteria stuff I mean like Moroccan, or Italian or french. It’s crazy. 

What’s even more crazy is how so many fools here take it for granted and even complain about it. I heard one guy say once “ew this is SO salty” of course you’re allowed to say that but I just find it crazy when it’s all totally free and a high grade of food.

I bite my tongue normally but on Wednesday I was in line, and we had Korean street food (honestly it was so good) and this group of younger people in the company and opposite me in line all turning their nose down at it being like “this isn’t real Korean street food” and “like if these people had been to Korea they’d know it isn’t like this” and my favourite “this place killls me sometimes.” 

I honestly couldn’t believe it and I just felt the urge to call them out and said “hey guys you know what really sucks about this? It’s free! Can you believe that?” (I’m English forgive my sarcasm) and one of them went “excuse me? That’s rude” and I said “what’s rude is you spoiled children complaining about this amazing free food we get every day? What’s wrong with you?” To which the guy said “you’re just trying to start something that isn’t here so maybe grow up a bit” and I finally responded “I’m grown up enough to appreciate a good situation when I see it. I think you guys need a reality check.” 

Well, of course HR spoke to me and said that I was reported as aggressive (I am many things but I know I wasn’t aggressive) and told me I can’t ever instigate confrontation at work. I respect that but god it felt so good. My wife said something to the affect that I was an asshole and shouldn’t put people on the spot like that and embarrass them. I’m not sorry but I’m curious as to whether I’m write in thinking I am not the asshole or whether they, HR and my wife are right?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0nsct	2019-06-14 18:51:43	k8iepot8ie	WIBTA if I Involved the Media?	"My ex and I coparent very well, and he pays a modest amount in child support that I use to do 'fun*' things with my kids. Child support (CS from now on) is automatically withdrawn from his paychecks, and he's been with the same company since the divorce. 


Everything had been going smoothly till about a year or two ago when I noticed CS was a few days later than it regularly had been. It has since progressed to being almost a week and a half after the funds have been taken from my ex that they appear on the county clerk website, then a few days after that to appear in my account. This all came to a head in December, literally days before Christmas when CS stopped all together. I spent hours on hold trying to figure out what happened, and kept getting the same answer of either it's was on the way, or it was a problem with my ex's company. I let him know, and the head of his HR ended up involved. It turned out that of course nothing had changed on their end, the funds were still being sent at the same time every month by the company, and in all the other states that had CS withdrawal, no problems, but she found multiple instances of delayed CS to my state, and that it was unequivocally a problem with the Clearinghouse.


Finally in February I received double CS payments, and was caught up. Since then CS is getting more and more delayed. It's almost mid June and no payment that historically, or based on ex's paycheck should have been done the first week. I've been screenshotting my payments, and have the copies of the HR emails. Would I be the AH if I went to some journalists I know to get some exposure and hopefully resolution? 

I've payed over 600$ in fees for the Clearinghouse to handle CS, if this was a free service I would be more inclined to let it go, but it's been ludicrous dealing with the county clerk and just getting the constant runaround.

c0nqwl	2019-06-14 18:48:16		WIBTA if I [23/F] don’t wish my dad [50/M] a happy Father’s Day?	"On mobile, sorry for formatting. My dad has been battling alcoholism since I was 15. He goes through month long benders that have a extremely emotionally taxing effect on my family. On the surface I have a good job, a loving boyfriend, and great friends, but my dads alcoholism has left me emotionally void in many ways. I currently see a therapist and am going to start up Al-Anon meetings soon. 

About 6 months ago my dad got an implant put in that made him have a bad physical reaction when he drinks. It kept him “dry sober” for a long time, and things at home were getting a lot better. I finally felt comfortable enough to start looking for my own place (I have a younger brother who I love very much, so I stay living at home so that I can always be nearby in case dad is acting belligerent/can’t drive.) A month ago my mom and dad got into a fight, and he elected to have the device turned off so he can continue drinking. It’s been a month filled with anxiety once I realized that he was drinking again, and that he had no plans to get himself help. While he is not physically abusive, his drinking causes him to act in such bizarre ways that I worry he will show up at my work. I frequently block his number so that his flood of texts don’t derail my day. 

My dad is a good person in his heart, but he is at the beck and call of this disease, which causes me to feel an entire spectrum of emotions toward him. He is in the middle of a bender right now, and he doesn’t work because my mom and I make all the money. My mom left for the weekend (can’t blame her), so it’s just my brother and I with him...

c0nptd	2019-06-14 18:45:34	throwaway_baddate	AITA for getting turned off with my date?	"Throwaway because I have friends who know my main one.

I matched with this girl (let's call her Jen) on Tinder a few weeks ago. We had been chatting for a while and I thought she was really charming. I decided to invite her for dinner and chose a good restaurant. We met up, exchanged pleasantries and started talking. When we got to ordering though, I noticed she got one of the more expensive seafood dishes and cocktail. I kind of wondered then if she might just be trying to get a free meal out of me. I was the one who did the inviting so I was intending to pay. But I was disappointed because she didn't strike me as that type.

After a while, she orders some dessert and later another cocktail. It set up some red flags again and at some point in the conversation, I brought up what we both do for a living. She told me she was an influencer. Said her page was about travel and wellness. At this point, I got a bit turned off because influencers don't make all that much and they have a reputation of begging for discounts and all that for a shoutout. Seems like I was just there to pay for the food she will post on her page. I kind of checked out of the date and didn't really enjoy.

Finally the bill came and she said she'll pay for her share. I was kind of surprised and offered to pay but she insisted. I started feeling bad about my attitude. I don't think I acted rude towards her, just not too interested. We part and she later texts me that it was a great date but perhaps we weren't compatible. I'm gutted because from our chats we really got along well and shared many interests. I later looked up her profile and she had a solid following. Like 500k+.

I told my sister about it and she thinks I was a major asshole for this. I feel bad but at the same time, I kind of think my reaction was normal given what I knew at the time. There's been too many instances that turned out to be what I imagined and this one is really an exception. I asked Jen if we could do a re-do but she hasn't responded yet."

c0np6k	2019-06-14 18:43:58	BitlifeBitizen	AITA-For being sexist in BitLife? (Please read before automatically voting “YTA”.)	"A few days ago I was with my friends, and we were talking about bad things we do that we don’t feel guilty for because it was in a game. I mentioned that I did some things in BitLife that I would never do in real life. One of them asked what I did, and I explained. After that, one of the girls said I was being sexist, and it didn’t matter that it was just a game. This started an argument between her and another friend. The other friend’s argument was “She’s doing what’s strategic. She’s not being sexist because she actually thinks that boys are superior to girls in real life.”

In BitLife there’s a generation feature that lets people play as one of their character’s kid. It’s advantageous to play as your kid as young as possible, at least for me. Mainly so that they don’t screw up their life while being controlled by the ai.

However, in order to achieve this, you have to “surrender” at a somewhat young age. The solution to this is to keep on having babies, and to have the youngest inherit everything (via your will). But in the game, it’s extremely hard for women to have children after 45 or younger. It’s possible, but not likely. 

My solution to this was to always play male, since there isn’t an age limit for men. However, this means that the youngest male inherits, which is well...obviously sexist.

Another thing is that my BitLife character tends to:
1. At around 40, look for a girl in her 20s.
2. After a few years, marry her.
3. When said girl is in her 40s, divorce. Because of the pre-nup she signed, I don’t have to pay anything in the game.
4. Repeat the cycle, except start at a different age.

Why I might be an ass:
I’m being sexist and having my character be a douche. It doesn’t matter that it’s just a game.

Why I might not be an ass:
I’m doing what’s best strategically. If it weren’t for the fact that women can’t have kids after around 45, I wouldn’t be acting this way.

Just a little backstory: 

My former friend and I had been friends since high school (now in mid 20’s) and things got pretty shitty recently. Former friend has basically decided (thru their actions) that it’s only worthwhile to be friends with me or to have my back when it directly benefits them. Moreover, I’ve always had this kids back through thick and thin. Always been there when they’ve been in a jam to help them out of it, etc etc. 

I’ve been planning a trip with a large group of friends and everyone is staying at my house in a nice vacation town that I’ve used since I was a kid. Former friend, who I’ve had conversations with about watching their behavior especially when it comes to them acting like they just own everything and not respecting anyone’s wishes, decided to invite a few random people to my house without even telling or asking me first. The more irritating part was that I found all this out through a mutual friend who told me DAYS later. 

I finally got fed up with former friend acting like they can just do whatever they want and not even having enough respect for me to ask if a few more people could come, which I would have been fine with had former friend had just asked. I sent them a message saying that I thought it would be best if we parted ways for good and that I wished them the best, but at this point in my life I just don’t need people who are going to be shitty friends.

c0nmu8	2019-06-14 18:38:11	MagentaGiant	AITA for excluding my blind friend from my wedding?	"I have a friend, Bobby (not his real name), who struggles with his eyesight. He’s quite quiet and solemn most of the time, but he’s a solid guy and he’s good to spend time with. We met at college a couple of years ago and have taken tons of classes together. First year we lived together, and have stayed friends since I moved out. After the first couple of weeks of knowing him, it emerged that he was registered blind. He’s not completely without his sight so it’s not like we didn’t notice this guy with a cane and a dog, it’s just that he needs mega sized text to read, and he’s not allowed to drive or get his license. He’s completely independent though, and has a free public transport card to get the bus and train since he can’t drive. He’s always been a bit of a home bird as well, so every weekend he’d travel  about 2 hours back up home, and 2 hours back, so that he could visit his mum and dad.


Now my fiancé and I have been dating for over 4 years and have been engaged for 18 months. As is the way with weddings, we sent out save the dates and invites along the way, and Bobby received both. Because I’m not a very organised human, the wedding invites went out a little later than they traditionally might, but since everyone who was coming knew about the wedding in advance, and received a save the date, it was fine. We had a few people who missed the RSVP date by a couple of days but no harm no foul in my eyes. The RSVP date was set for exactly one month before the wedding. 


Background backgrounded. Now for the potential assholery.


Bobby also missed the RSVP date. He wasn’t the only one I had to chase up a week later, but he was the only one who read the message and then took two further days to reply with a yes. Today, less than two weeks before the wedding, he’s messaged saying he can only come to the wedding if he can have a plus one. The reason for his plus one is his eyesight. Because he doesn’t drive and he’s not local he needs someone, his mum, to be present to drive him there and back. I flat out told him no, he’s not inviting his mum as a plus one because we’ve already told the hotel the number for the meal, but she’s welcome at the rest of the day. 
The hotel in reality doesn’t need the numbers up till 48 hours before, but the table plans are set, there’s no easy space to slot her in, and I don’t want a friends mum that nobody knows enjoying the wedding meal and speeches, and us paying for the privilege. I now doubt whether he’ll come, because I don’t know if she’s happy coming all the way, to not even be fed.


Am I the asshole?




*Edit:* A few things to update here. I’ve been chatting to the friend more. Despite what you all think, I do actually care and the nuances of how much a person can see can’t be put across in a AITA post. The mother is welcome at the full day, except the meal. And by the tone of Bobbys message, it wasn’t Bobby asking for his mum to be there, but Bobbys overprotective mum asking that she attend. Ceremony and evening do is fine, and I told Bobby as much when he first messaged yesterday. I’ve since reached out and offered to pay for the mum at the second restaurant that’s on site.

Additionally, something of note is that my family are all not local. It’s either a flight or a ferry for them to get to the wedding, and to cater for both my family and other guests who can’t/won’t drive, we hired a bus for a city centre pick-up. The bus takes people down to the church, then back to the reception venue. It’s only getting home again that people need to manage themselves, but various people are staying in the same hotel that the reception is at. Travel arrangements have been a big part of the wedding, and Bobby has been invited to use them from the start.

To those saying he needs eyes for the evening. I’m not disagreeing with you to be flippant of his needs, or to be callous, even if I am still an asshole. I’m saying having known him for 2 years, he doesn’t need his mother there. There are plenty of college friends there, who he’s seated with, who can help him find his seat or point out the loos. It’s a group of friends and we’ve all been there to support him when necessary (which is genuinely rare, because as I said, he is *fully* independent, even in new environments).

c0njzm	2019-06-14 18:31:29	InfiniteIniesta	WIBTA if I don't go to my friend's wedding even though we have known each other our whole lives?	"Hello,

I've had this friend basically since I was born. We grew up together, although not as neighbours. We would visit each other and have sleep overs. As we grew older the visits would be less but we'd meet outside and play some pool or just talk and such. We always kept contact in text, always called each other on birthdays and occasionally visited each other.
He lived in another city for few years and I'd travel and stay with him for a weekend few times.

Since the last couple years the contact has been less but we did occasionally text. He was finally going to marry his girl and I was obviously invited.

Since January we haven't been in touch at all. I had just purchased my first house and moved, and he texted me asking if he can visit next week. He was obviously welcomed by me. A week went and he didn't say anything and never visited. And since then we haven't had any contact. I figured he was busy with his life, plus his wedding coming up at the end of this month.

Time passed and no contact. I sent him a message on his birthday and he said thanks and went quiet. 

I sent him a longer message couple months ago asking why he hasn't been in touch with me, what's wrong and such and please tell me what's up.
No response. Not even a message or call on my birthday. For the first time in my life, I believe.

My parents attended some gathering where he also was. He never asked why I didn't come or where I was.

Obviously I have been confused, upset and sad and wondered why I've been ignored. I know he is doing fine and nothing has happened to him, because we have several family friends in common, so we'd know fast if something had happened.

We are in June now and his wedding is coming up. I have been thinking for a while that I will not go. I see no point. I don't even think he will care.

My wife doesn’t come because it’s not her thing and for the past couple trips my daughter has tagged along but both times all she did was take selfies, complain we were going too fast, and take extended rest stops.

She also snap chatted the whole thing which is ok I guess but I’ve really come to enjoy these trails with my kids as a contemplative silent bonding and it’s a little ruined by her playing lil pump from her iPhone speakers and squealing everytime she thinks she sees a rabbit. 

I told my daughter recently that this upcoming trip was a boys one , and she honestly didn’t appear at all bothered and said she didn’t wanna go anyway because it’s not her thing. When I told my wife she wasn’t coming, she got upset and said I preferred my sons to my daughter and that I was excluding her on purpose. I can’t really refute that because... well... I AM, but I didn’t mean bad by it. My wife is a very beautifully loving woman and I know her heart is always in the right place so I’m not sure if she’s looking into this too much or if I’m being a dick.

I don’t want my daughters feelings to be hurt and I’m not sure if she was blowing me off. I thought I’d ask y’all what you think."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So our dog, Lager, was just laying down with his muzzle on and the owner of the place came outside and asked us to move our dog because he was too close to the entrance. At first I was like “wtf? He has a muzzle on and he isn’t harming anyone” But with further examination I saw that he was laying within 4 feet of the DIRECT entrance which was the only way to enter the establishment. So I was like “okay okay I understand we will move our dog” but then my dad was all like “no fuck you he isn’t doing anything wrong he was muzzled and just minding his business” and then he went on to say (to the owner) “you’re fucking retarded like you actually have something mentally wrong with you” and I was flabbergasted and I called him out right there and then and said “don’t fucking say that wtf? Stop saying that” and I apologized to the owner and he looked at me like I just fucking slapped in the face.

So after we moved away from the doorway he said “I can’t believe you dishonored the family name” and I was just kind of in disbelief because he kept saying I was being disloyal and I was a disappointment to him because I didn’t back him up.

This person would kick me out in the rain, yell at me and berate me, cheat, lie, sexually assault me, and finally they did hit me towards the end. I ended it because we were having a kid, and I have full custody because they wanted $6000 in child support forgiven, so I basically paid $6000 for custody.

This person is SO terrible that we went to the same therapist for a while, and when I told this therapist who I was seeing, they got really serious and said, “You need to get out of that relationship. I’m telling you that’s not a good idea, but I can’t tell you why.”

I feel bad because I told their last two partners about this, but they didn’t believe me til it happened to them and their lives were effectively ruined. They have custody of their other kids and recently got married, and idk if I should tell their new spouse.

I feel responsible when something happens to their partners, like I should do something, but maybe it doesn’t matter since the other two didn’t believe me & it happened anyway.

My sister bought tickets for our whole family (grandparents, other siblings, aunts, etc.) but she didn’t get a ticket for my girlfriend. My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years, my family knows her pretty well. She’s at every family event, and if I am invited to anything, it’s usually assumed that my girlfriend will be with me. 

It could be my sister just forgot, but considering how long my girlfriend and I have been together, it’s hard for me to believe she just accidentally left her out. My girlfriend has also expressed to me several times that she feels like my sister doesn’t like her. 

To show solidarity, I’m planning on skipping the recital. I probably won’t tell my family that I’m not coming. My nephew is young enough, that I don’t think he’ll really notice my absence too much, especially with everyone else there. Part of me feels bad, because my sister would have wasted money on my ticket, but the other part of me is annoyed that she didn’t even think of my girlfriend. What do you guys think?

Edit: I think this might be an important detail, but I am actually a lesbian and my family is very conservative and religious. It’s not unusual for me to be excluded from family events or not invited to events until the VERY last minute. My family doesn’t even really acknowledge that me and my girlfriend are in a serious relationship. They never refer to her as my girlfriend, just friend. So part of me believes that if this was a straight relationship, maybe they would view it as more legitimate, and my girlfriend would have been invited."	Asshole	0	0	51.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

fast forward. im less than 10 y/o and mom and dad divorce. the only phrase i remember my mom explaining the whole thing was “we love each other still. we just love the idea of each other” idk i could be remembering it wrong. they stayed good friends and co-parented pretty well. that pretty much is the end of that. 

fast forward again to earlier this week. BD send me a podcast he was a guest on bc he was talking about me on it. on this podcast BD mentioned that my dad cheated on my mom and that THAT was the reason they divorced.

this has been taking up a lot of my thoughts this week because my mom never seemed to hold any resentment towards my dad. but i dont see why BD would lie? my mom and i have a very comfortable relationship where we tell each other almost everything. i get why she wouldn’t tell me when i was 10 but i don’t know.

I asked him if he could try not to do that or wash his hands maybe because my skin is sensitive but he just gets pouty about it. I sometimes end up having to wash my face again because I feel gross. It doesn’t exactly help that he has good genes and only rinses his face with water everyday, so he just says my acne is caused by all the products I use on my face (not makeup). He says it’s not fair that I’m trying to “police” when/how he touch’s me but I just don’t want to break out.

A little background...

As kids me, my sister, and our siblings endured abuse and neglect and are still dealing with the fallout.

My sisters first marriage was so bad that dcfs told her to leave or they’d take her kid (Ex gave kid a forehead laceration). She left and took her kid with her.

Fast forward to yesterday and I see some pictures she and my niece are tagged in on fb and I’m flabbergasted.

Right in the background of the picture is our sisters ex (father of her first three kids) who was recently released from prison after serving a couple of years for felony child abuse and neglect.

My sister excused his behavior by saying his 4th child had failed to thrive and it was the moms fault for not taking the baby to the doctor.

I said since the parents lived together and we’re equally responsible for the child they were both guilty which is why they were both charged.

She maintains that he’s never hurt them (her or her child) and I say that if someone has an anger problem and went to prison over how they treated their own kid they can’t be trusted.

I also pointed out that our sister has called cps on her in the past for petty reasons when she gets mad and when she gets wind that they’re hanging out she’ll probably do it again. I also pointed out that if dcfs realizes she’s hangin out with him they won’t like it.

She says I’m wrong and she pissed at me.

c0n71s	2019-06-14 18:00:37		AITA for asking my mom not to visit after she bought a plane ticket?	"Backstory: My mom and I have a non existent relationship. Same with my whole family. My siblings don't talk to each other except for once a year 10min phone calls at Xmas. I don't talk to my dad because I hate him. My dad was abusive when I was a kid. I begged my mom to split from him when I was a kid and teenager, and she didn't. She has admitted that one of the reasons I ended up in an abusive relationship was probably because of my dad and how I was raised. There has been other stuff- like lack of medical care as a kid, being raised in an isolated and religious home, alcoholism, no privacy and no friends allowed... I left when I was 17. A lot of other stuff I won't go into details about, but are just messed up and controlling. 

Now: I had a moment of weakness and told my mom I was being screened for a type of cancer that my brother has and that one of our grandparents died from. This was a  ad move, and I was just looking for support... which I do not get from her. 

This screening for cancer is a long time coming, and I actually had signs of the disease that causes it since I was a teenager. As a teenager my parents told me I was faking symptoms for attention and never brought me to the Dr. This lead into adulthood where I Ignored my symptoms as well, thinking that they weren't so bad. They were very bad. 

 My mom tells tme she was coming to see me and that she booked a plane ticket. I told her it wasn't a good time, and she said she was hurt and upset. I said that maybe in the future it would be better, and she changed her ticket to a month from now. 

This is causing me a ton of anxiety. I feel angry at her, because now I am in therapy (at 30 years old) dealing with the emotional and physical abuse I lived with as a kid. Stuff she could have prevented. She could have at least brought me to a Dr as a teenager (I live in Canada, free health care). I just feel angry at her. And I don't want my kids around her. I also think she plans to stay in our house during her week long visit.

I haven't seen her in 4+ years. My kids like attention and will get attached to her, but I don't want them around her.  She will basically not see them again after her one trip. I don't ever plan to visit her. (Side note; my kids have two sets of grandparents on my husband's side who go out of their way to see them, even when we lived further away. They have great grandparents, they don't need my parents in their lives at all). 

I want to tell her not to come. But I feel incredibly guilty for saying no and protecting myself and my own family (btw I raise my kids the complete opposite of how I grew up). I feel guilty she put out the money. I don't know how refunds for airlines work.

(Throwaway because my friends know my reddit account) 

So this is a bit complex and I’m not sure how to explain it best. Essentially while on vacation in Vegas with my GF and two other couples (let’s call them Mary and Mike and Sally and Sam) I ended up spending time with Sam while everyone else was busy because I felt sorry for Sam being on his own. Despite the fact that Sam is kind of a jerk to everyone and makes snide comments and acts like an edgy comedian all the time.  He’s made a lot of rude comments that he’s defended as jokes. Made fun of our hobbies, made fun of my GF’s sports team and talked over her a lot. 

On the night in question, Mary and Mike and Sally and GF wanted to go see a show that I wasn’t interested in. GF said she would go for a round or two and then meet me at the casino. Sam also wasn’t going but we just assumed he’d go off and do his own thing. Once the group split up, me and Sam were left standing there awkwardly in the casino and Sam just seemed to deflate once his “audience” was gone. He asked me what I was going to do and I said something like “I donno, I guess try some of the tables.” It felt weird to just walk away from him so I asked him what his plans were. 

He said he didn’t really gamble and didn’t know any of the rules of the games. I decided to show him how some of the slots worked. He actually seemed to like it and his attitude perked up and a bit. I just felt really bad for the guy, he just seemed sad and lonely. I ended up hanging out with him the rest of the time till my GF showed up and she was quite shocked to see me hanging out with him. 

I tried to explain why (after we departed his company) but she wasn’t having any of it. She said that I shouldn’t encourage his behavior by hanging out with him because now he’ll think we like him and he’ll be even worse. She seemed hurt and offended that I didn’t just walk away and leave him alone given that he’s been a dick to us before. Should I have just left this guy alone?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0n69y	2019-06-14 17:58:46		WIBTA for not coming out to my brother before coming out publicly on social media?	"So, I’m transgender. I’ve identified as a trans woman for about a year now, but the feelings have long been there and all. When I started to come out, my friends were all wonderful about it. Everyone I told was very accepting and lovely, except for my parents (though that seems to have gotten better). In fact, I’ve finally hit a point where everyone I’m friends with or see frequently in person knows I’m trans and calls me by the right name and pronouns, so I’m now effectively out to everyone in my own world. The only exception here being my older brother.

My older brother and I have had very key differences in opinions and views for a while now. In years past, he was incredibly conservative/very very right leaning in general, the kind of person you would see screaming about how “SJWs are ruining _______” kind of thing (thanksgiving of 2016 had a lot of yelling). I wouldn’t call him and I very close, outside of the occasional text he sends me about a video game every so often. We live separately and far enough apart as well. I think he’s cooled down from how militant he was about his views, but I still can’t be sure and he’s always been a stubborn person about what he believes, and I don’t exactly trust my mom when she says he’s come around a bit. When I came out to my parents (disaster that it was) one of the main questions hurled at me was “how are you going to tell your brother”, a question that hasn’t stopped being asked by my mom a year later. 

Now that I’m out to all my friends, I want to change my social media and everything over to the correct name and photos and such, but my brother would obviously know then. I feel like I owe it to him, even if we’re not close, to contact him first and tell him I’m that he has a sister now. But, I also don’t know if he’ll take it well. I could just come out publicly and whatever without telling him first, but it makes me feel like I would be an asshole if I didn’t tell him.

I was working late past 8 PM and so was this colleague of mine who sat about 2 working spaces to my right. Far be it  from me to judge a woman on her looks but that colleague of mine is hot and I mean 'when she drops down we see her thong' hot. I made small chat with her after all our colleagues had left for home. We made a few mutual remarks about how unlucky we are today and maybe a little laughter was shared. So at about nineish I had a hunger pang and I got up from my desk to grab a bite and I asked her.
""i am gonna grab a sandwich, do you want me to get you one""
She said ""sure, I would love to eat""
I almost turned when she continued
""You know people are a bit afraid to ask me out, I am glad you did this all so casually""
I know I should have been over the moon since a hot girl just implicitly consented to a below average date with me but since it wasn't my intention, it was a fact my brain was glad to point out to my mouth and so the words flowed.
""I didn't ask you out Jane (not her real name), just want to know if you wish to eat something.""
And that was when shit hit the fan.
""I am gonna take a rain check on that bite"" she said
""Sure"" I replied
""You know what, I get asked out a lot of times by men far better than you.""
I really didn't want to get into an argument here but maybe it was the late friday night work or the insecurity I felt about the comment she made that made me snap.
""Glad to know they came to their senses before they got to know you, their lives were redeemed "" I replied in rather a disrespectful manner.
Thats when she started acting like crazy and going on a rant about how popular she is in the office and how everybody likes her. I rolled my eyes for a minute and when I look at her again she is crying, I took a step forward to console her but she yelled
GET AWAY FROM ME !!!
Then she ran away from me and towards the door. At that moment I felt bad, really bad and stupid. For the past few weeks it has been bugging me and also in the office her girlfriends are giving me the stink eye. But all I could think of is other scenarios where I could have handled it better.

This has been going on too long and I just want it to end. My parents are ready to move on. My wife wont budge. 
When this all first started(back in January), i lied about going to see them to talk and we got into a huge fight where she tried to kick me out. Her issue wasn't that I went there to talk but that I lied about going. I apologized and eventually won back her trust and things were fine until this past week.

The other day I was heading to go to the mall with my son and recieved a call my from parents asking if I wanted to come over, so I changed my plans. My wife was at work at this time and I tried calling her to let her know and i also texted her. Later on when she finally saw my text she flipped out on me saying that not telling her was lying. But i did try to tell her as best as i could. She has since stopped talking to me.


AITA? And any advice would be appreciated.I


Edit: The reason my wife doesn't think they deserve to be hos grandparents.... My mom called her hormonal both during and after having my son. She thibks that they are manipulative. We have been told a few times about them talking about our fights but they have told me that it's just a misscomuntication. In May we had a baptism for my son and my parents came but looked misserable the whole time. The refused to take pictures with him on the alter and completely ignored him at dinner after. They explained it to me that they knew they were not wanted there and they had a hard time acting happy when they weren't. They also have a strained relationship with my brother and his girlfriend (because of stuff my wife has told her that my parents told us) throught the dinner for my son my mom would not take her eyes off of my brother's daughter. I know it was becuase they have not seen her in a long time becuase they are not talking to them. I'm the only one that talks to my parents. My mom is bi-polar and refuses to admit it. My wife has told me that unless she gets help she will never be okay with my son being around her."	Asshole	0	0	50.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

Long story short, a few days ago there was some flooding in my area, and being the weather buff that I am, I decided to go exploring. One park by the river that I knew would be flooded required me to cut through a residential neighborhood. (Think upper middle class, older housing stock, big trees, etc.) The neighborhood had a speed limit of 15-20 mph, can't remember exactly, but I certainly wasn't doing more than 20.

Not being too familiar with the area, I missed my turn, so instead of backing up I went down to the end of the street to turn around. Along this route were two women, and two children. Their relation is irrelevant to the story. I drive a hybrid so they did not hear me \*slowly\* approach, I was no longer going even 15, I didn't want to honk so I went wide to the right and my tire crunching on some gravel alerted them to my presence. One of the women ushered a little boy on a bike over so I could safely pass, but not without shooting me a nasty look. I went to the end of the road and turned around, returning back to where they were, she one again users the boy aside, and shouts ""slow down!"" to me as I drive past, I'm only doing 12 mph, I looked. I've dealt with people like this before, mostly when I was a delivery driver in college, or in my old neighborhood, IE, places where it was best to shut up and take it, but here, I had freedom. I lifted my middle finger high out my window, and drove on to the park.

I didn't spend much time there, and when I left, I came to the realization that they had turned around a walked to where I would have to pass to leave. Sure enough I came upon them at a stop sign. I avoided eye contact and planned to just continue at a safe speed, but one of them remarked ""why would you flip off a little kid??"" I wasn't going to take that lying down. I remarked politely, but firmly, ""ma'am, that one was for you!"" the other woman chimed in ""but there are little kids around!"" to which I retorted, ""lady, fuck your kids, I'm out"" and drove away.

I admit I regret saying that last part, but the kids were young enough I doubt they'd even remember past the time I left the neighborhood, however, was I the asshole here? I swear that all I said above was true, I was NOT speeding, and I did NOT say anything directly to the children.

EDIT 1: So I'm not defending myself here, however I think it needs to be reiterated that I'm not asking if I'm an asshole for speeding, it seems that some people in the comments are under the impression that I was being reckless. I am not arguing the fact that I was being unsafe because I wasn't, that's not the question here, the question is in regards to how I reacted to being told to slow down while going 12mph."

(I apologize in advance for formatting because im using mobile)

To keep this short and sweet, I was pranked/the victim of my group of friends who decided to tell me there was a large verbal fight between some members of the group and maybe some other people that we interact with and I wasn't there to see it. They also said our group may get disbanded and that some religious leaders were threatening to get heavily involved and it sounded 100% plausible. I questioned them asking if they were joking multiple times and they obviously didn't admit it. They seemed extremely serious and I spent the better half of a night worrying and praying for our group (it's a religious friend group/activity we were involved in). I was told to keep my mouth shut and during our prayer meeting that I would be filled in on what happened and during the meeting the leader of our group looked as if she was going to cry and I was worried sick and the mood was generally somber. Later during the meeting, the group decided to tell me it was all a joke in an admittedly funny way. However, through all the laughing and jeering I felt used. There was phone at my face and recorded the whole reaction. They laughed and said sorry but I felt that it was disingenuous.

The problem comes in my feelings when after being unable to deal with the laughing, I walked out quietly and reflected on why I felt this way. I felt used and that they used my feelings for a prank, but honestly I feel like that prank is something I would do. I feel like maybe I should just feel relieved it was a joke and laugh along with the rest of them but I can't. After I took a little time to reflect, I decided to tell them how I felt, telling them I'd probably find it funny a week or two from now but right now it wasn't funny at all to me and they seemed to somewhat understand.

I am a law student and am currently studying for the bar exam. 
My family tend to come for me for legal advice and I try my best to help them. I do my research, I spend hours writing and rewriting letters and then they .. don’t give a shit and do the opposite I told them to do.
My dad did this now he is loosing a law suit because he missed a deadline, although I told him a billion times the letter I wrote has to be delivered by a certain time.
My sister had problems with her landlord, her best friend (who’s the landlords son) is a law student too and when she asked for advice I told her, her friend was giving her false information but she trusted him and shit hit the fan.
Today my dad got a letter in his law suit that basically told him you missed the deadline too bad. He send it for me to inform me and I was fucking angry because I told him a gazillion times and he missed the deadline only because he was lazy and didn’t give a shit and thought it’s not that bad, I don’t know.
So I messaged in the family group chat that this angers me because I spend my limited time helping them doing research and then they plainly ignore what I told them and do the opposite and when shit hits the fan they’re like surprise pikatchu.
My sister got super mad and left the group chat. My mother got super mad and told me I am the asshole of the family (lol) and basically that I have to stop projecting the things with my dad to my sister. I told her that I think it’s a family thing and this is why I talked about both incidents and my sister was a dramaqueen for leaving the group chat. My mother then told me that i shouldn’t call my sister drama queen because last year she looked after my cats (what does that have to do with anything lol). She told me she didn’t expect anything from me.
Now just today my sister asked me if I could look after her cat when she goes on vacation. The cat lives with my parents because my sister lives in student housing, and they wanted to go on vacation at the same time. I got super mad that my mom told me she didn’t expect anything from me that I said well if that’s the case I won’t look after the damn cat, and my sister can either stay home or my mother can stay home. Now my mother told me I ruin everything left the group chat and blocked me from WhatsApp.
So reddit am I the asshole here? I genially just wanted them to be a bit more considerate with my time and not ask me for advice and do the opposite and then be like wtf happened."	Not the A-hole	0	0	609.0	123.0	0.0	0.0

"I study abroad but I have family who live like 3 hours away from uni so I decided to just get my own place nearby. I try to visit when I can but Im usually busy with my studies so I don't visit as often as they'd like.

Anyway, since my grandmother is sick I've been going over there to take care of her on the weekends. My aunt, despite living with them would only visit my grandmother at the hospital for like 5 minutes at a time then make excuses like ""my son (2) will miss me if I stay any longer."" Her excuses and her attitude in general pisses me off because I know she can do more to be there for her mother. 

So here's some background info. My aunt got knocked up by this a-hole who can't afford to get an annulment so they can't get married. A-hole is also living at my grandparents house. He lost his job cuz he's a crooked cop and does nothing around the house, he doesn't even take care of his son. 

Last weekend, after48 hours of staying at the hospital my grandpa relieved me so I could go home and shower and get some proper sleep. I get to the house around 8 and A-hole isn't there. I wake up at 11 and him and his friends are out in the front drinking and singing and laughing so without missing a beat I yell out the window ""SHUT UP!!!"" Within minutes his friends scramble home and a-hole quietly goes to bed as well. My aunt and her kid were home at the time but she didn't say anything. The next day both of them were too ashamed to even look at me.

Since then my aunt has been cold towards me and has made it clear that I don't live there. That may be true but I'm pretty sure I have more of a right to be there than her loser BF. Now my grandpa is asking why I don't visit the house anymore. I just told him I was too busy and that I see him at the hospital anyway. AITA for yelling and refusing to make amends?"

I have been using the phraseology ""coming out"" for years when describing my disclosure of my mental illnesses with people. I use it not to belittle the experience of LGBTQ people sharing their sexual orientation with others, but because I feel it's the closest analogy to what I do too. I am always trepidatious when sharing my mental status with others (bipolar, GAD) because I know it puts a lens over all my actions from then on to that person, especially bipolar because it's seen as scary and makes me ""the crazy bipolar chick"". It genuinely feels like I'm coming out to these people and there's always the risk that the person/people will completely change their mindset about me and I've lost potential friends/romantic partners because of it. 

But again, I don't mean nor want to belittle the experience of LGBTQ people coming out by using the phrase so AITA?

Ok, so one of my best friends invited me to a baseball game that was pride themed. I’ve loved baseball all my life and was so excited to go, the only problem was my dad is pretty homophobic and already has some bias towards this friend because she’s pan, even though he’s known her since we were in preschool. So, because I’m technically not an adult yet I still had to ask my parents if it was ok to go. My mom was cool and said I could go, but I was scared my dad would say no because it was pride day. When I asked him he said it was ok. He didn’t know they did a pride day and I didn’t want him to change his mind because of it. So I asked my friend if she could wait to wear her pride stuff until she picked me up.

Throughout the whole year i saw a completely new side of him, it actually seems like he cares finally. He has been consistent with seeing me and my siblings.

Back to the blow up. I’m a pretty quiet person, i don’t know why i just always have been. He hates it, he wants me to be outgoing and loud like him. Personally i think people who are like that are kinda annoying and overbearing including him. He has called me awkward and even asked why i’m like that but only over text. He recently got me a really expensive bike and this morning he texts me “are you the way you are because of me?” and i kinda just went off on him. I called him an asshole and told him to come pick up the bike he gave me because i don’t need shit from him and i never have.

Currently me and my sister use it for homework and I use it for games.  My sister did help to pay the cost (30 bucks) so I let her use it. My mom wanted the password so she could watch Netflix on my PS4. I told her no as she didn't pay a cent for it. She called me a asshole and demanded I give her the password or she would sell my PC ($1800) and my phone (s8+) so I gave her it, I can't loose my PC or phone over that.

So, bit of a backstory. I do not come from a wealthy family, and we could not afford much at all. however I do have an uncle who is very rich, and who also offered to pay for any education related expenses for me and my siblings. And it was because of that I was fortunate enough to attend an elite private high school.  

Now, my school had an account system, where if you bought anything at the cafeteria/uniform store then you just scanned your card and it would be put in your account and that would be billed at the end of the month. Both my mom and my uncle received these bills, however they were always paid off on time.   

As of now, I graduated over a year ago, and I found out a while back through my mom that my school account was $1000 in credit, and that money was just sitting there until somebody contacted the school and asked for it back.  At the time, she mentioned that she was trying to withdraw it, and possibly return it to my uncle, or give it to me, however she was also talking about how useful she would find having that much spare. I didn’t really think anything of it at the time.  

It’s been about 7-8 months since that conversation, and recently I remembered it and asked my mom about that money in my school account. She couldn’t really give me a clear answer as to where it went, a lot of ‘I don’t know, where did that money go?’ and the like. She does not have any contact with my uncle at all, so I am really suspecting she has just kept the money for herself.

This is where I get really conflicted.  That money does not belong to my mom, and she knows that. If anybody, it belongs to my uncle, but chances are he would of let me keep it. My mom is not an alcoholic, she is not addicted to anything at all, and if she did take that money then I am 100% sure she spent it on overdue bills and groceries for us. I know that she probably really needed it, and she spent it in a well meaning and useful way (much more than I would have), but I can’t help but be really really angry at her.

Being the person responsible for who gets approved or disapproved means I had to always look into the finances of the party applying and see what they wanted the money for while sat down trying to have a normal conversation with them knowing your decision could ultimately impact their life and generally negatively in terms of loans. 
A couple came in and they had a bad credit rating, late payments and other financial problems, almost a dead certain whatever they needed this rather large amount of money for was going to be rejected......
Until they told me it was for their child who needed to go abroad for a treatment for an illness, I’m not going to disclose what it was but it was pretty serious and they were stressed. It’s the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make, the company points to a  rejection but my morals say different. 
I accepted their request, and knowing that I should of rejected it, I left my position a few weeks later with being stressed all the time and they were stuck in my head and effecting my work and home life.

Me (28F) and one of my best friends (32M) used to sleep together in college. We were each other's go-to dates for formals, and were ""hooking up"" for a while as one does during your youth. Over the following years, we continued to occasionally hook up when we were drunk and both single, every couple of years. He never pursued a relationship, and neither did I. We stayed friends and have always been respectful and appropriate during times when we were respectively in relationships. We don't have romantic feelings for each other, and neither of us are interested in that.

Recently, he started dating a friend of mine, also from college. We were roommates in our sorority house freshman and sophomore year, right when my friend and I were seeing each other pretty regularly. Granted this was about eight years ago, but I assumed she remembered him from those days- turns out, she does not. We weren't super close at the time and I don't find it surprising that she doesn't remember the few times we hung out there.

She's a really good friend, and I'm really happy their relationship has been going so well, but recently she asked me why nothing ever happened between me and my friend- and I lied and said neither of us were interested. It was technically true in terms of a relationship, but I did imply that we hadn't slept together and later felt really guilty about it.

Long story short, I don't think her knowing would do any good, and at worst it would probably make her feel uncomfortable. At the same time, I can't help but feel like I'm hiding something I never intended to, and I know she would be hurt if she ""found out"" (despite it not being hidden at the time). I don't really want to lie about it for the foreseeable future, since they're getting pretty serious. It wasn't supposed to be this big secret that we're not supposed to talk about. I don't think it's appropriate to involve myself in the relationship, but I still feel like I'm lying to my friend. Am I the asshole if I just carry on with lying by omission?"

She is in a job that she says she doesn't like and knows people don't treat her well. She tends to get walked on and not treated with respect. I've told her for years that she needs a new job where she gets more fulfilled. She agrees with me but never does anything about it.

     Last month she had a bad day and said she wants to quit. I listened to her and told her I've heard her song and dance before but think she should leave. She tells me it's different and she will look for another job. Things cooled down at work and she settles back down into her rut after a week or so.

Today I get a call that she had a bad day. She wanted to tell me about it but I stopped her. Saying I told her last time, she is putting herself in this situation and I don't have the steam to hear her complain about the same issues she has had for years. Because I know it's the same issues and nothing will ever change untill she gets fired. I told her if she still decides to not to do anything about it, she doesn't have grounds to constantly complain how bad her job is and how she wants to quit and that I don't want to hear about it anymore.

c0mk6y	2019-06-14 17:06:04		AITA for telling my parents that I won't give my progress review sheet which contains my grades?	"This didn't happen today, this happened a week ago. I had my phone taken away for a week for ""bad grades"" (I'll explain the situation later)..

For context, I'm a 13 year old student who's currently in Year 8 (UK School). 

My school runs these ""Progress Review Days"" for students and their guardians to come and review the student's grades, meet the teachers... there is 2 progress review days per school year.

Ever since I arrived here (born in Latvia) which was back in Year 6, I have worked 2 hours a day extra going over what I have done in lessons that day and revising + learning English for an hour a day.

My parents never attended those Progress Review Days and just wait for a paper-version of the grades which arrives usually 2 weeks later in the mail. However this is not the issue...

...my issue is that they never appreciated the hard-work I have put into studies, sacrificing my play time just to get that extra revision... the way they review my grades is that they look at my ""Predicted Grade"" and if my actual grade is higher than the Predicted Grade I get a ""+"" next to the subject, if it's lower than the Predicted Grade, I get a ""-"", and in the end if I get 2 minuses out of 12 subjects, my phone gets taken away for certain period of time. Nothing else ever gets discussed during my ""Grade Review Session"", just ticks and minuses.

I asked them once why don't they appreciate my hard-work and grades as I get literally the best grades in my year, their response is ""If we compliment you, you will feel good about yourself and you'll ride off the track.""

Last week, my school ran a Progess Review Day and my parents didn't come again as ""they were busy"", even though they binge-watched some TV shows.

So when they told me they wouldn't come, as usual.. I told them that I won't give them the Progress Review Sheet as there's no point and I would rather reflect on my grades myself.

c0mj4k	2019-06-14 17:03:27	Shooshookle	AITA for not correcting people on my name?	"I have a name that is a little difficult to pronounce. I’m a white dude with a mom who smoked weed when she had me so the name is pretty strange. It’s normal if I was European but being around a ton of Johns, Davids, Kyles, etc my name sticks out. All through my life I’ve maybe had 20% of people who I’ve introduced myself to get my name correct on the first try. 


If they say it wrong, I don’t correct them. I just let it go. For example 
“Hello! My name is Shooshookle!” 
“Oh? Thats in interesting name. Shoo..shooble?”
“Yes.” 
Sometimes they ask if they can call me anything else and I’ll make up a name because I just don’t care for my name. I want to change it honestly but my mom said she wouldn’t speak to me and I’d have to do it “over my dead body”, she said. 


My friends if they introduce me and their friend gets my name wrong, I don’t make a deal of it. However, my friends usually get annoyed with me that I don’t correct them. They sigh or laugh and say “no, his name is ___” and it gets a little awkward and makes me look odd.

c0mbcy	2019-06-14 16:45:09		AITA for telling mutual friends that my ex was abusive?	"My ex was minorly abusive. I don’t wanna undermine people who suffer major domestic abuse, but he was manipulative and emotionally abusive and got physical with me towards the end of our relationship. He denied everything and it was hard for me to come to terms with

A lot of our friends were supportive of me and came to me afterwards. They were his friends first but many weren’t keen on being so close anymore anyway bc he’s just a draining and irritating person after his initial charm wears off.  When they’d ask about the breakup, I’d tell them what he did to me and they’d be shocked and most stopped any contact with him. I wasn’t going on a smear campaign but it felt good for people to finally believe me and acknowledge what I went through. By “turning against” I just mean they don’t hang with him anymore, no ones going out of their way to do anything to him. 

Here’s what triggered me to post this. Yesterday I saw him at the bar with a mutual friend I hadn’t seen in forever. Never was close with her but we were friendly. I went to talk to him about something unrelated to her and ended up sitting down with them to drink. While he was gone for a sec she asked how I was doing with the breakup. I said okay, and asked if she knew what happened with us, bc I hadn’t seen her in forever and didn’t know how caught up she was. She said no so I spilled the beans, partially bc I assumed they were hanging out again and I wanted her to keep an eye on his new gf, so she wouldn’t go through what I did. I want to warn this new girl but I’d look like a crazy ex. All I said was that he emotionally fucked with me and he put his hands on me a few times, and to please watch out for his gf bc she’s known to be a pushover and wouldn’t stand up for herself. Maybe I overstepped, I’m just worried for this poor girl. 

Little did I know that she was a victim of abuse herself so I struck a nerve. She asked him to leave when he came back and hung out with me, drunkenly going on about what she went through. I appreciated her support but my ex already asked me what the hell I was telling people to get everyone to hate him (I was honest and said I told people what an ass you were to me when they asked, he further gaslit me). Apparently they were getting into some low key business deal and she said she will never associate with him again. 

AITA for telling people about my ex’s shitty behavior, that teetered on the edge of abuse, making them not want to associate with him anymore? I only divulge when people ask, and I don’t really care for any kind of cordial relationship with him anyway. But I can see how I might be an asshole still. I don’t want him in my life at all and I try to distance myself from him and everything, but it’s weird bc we’re on a small campus and everyone knows each other so I still get entangled with him sometimes."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Situation:
This week, I had gotten a job and everything is going well except the 2pm - 11pm shift, 9 hours. We also live on a ranch that we have to take care of daily and takes about an hour to do so. Right now, the only people that are home are my brother and I, we work the same hours, and we are supposed to be taking care of everything together in the morning yet he is slacking behind as if he has a broken leg (On his days off he doesn't take care of everything by himself like I do, he doesn't fill most of the water buckets nor clean them, he doesn't let our inside-dogs outside to mess). Even right now, 11:35am, he is not even awake to do his part like he should be. It takes me a couple of hours to fall asleep when I get home at midnight so I only have around 8 hours of sleep if I were to do both of our parts.

What do I do? 
I get barely any sleep over this, as I do everything at 10:30am and leave his part for him yet if I don't do his part some days to pick up his slack then the animals suffer.

Around Christmas I had some other things happening (toxic relationship and emotional abuse) so I was stumbling with my studying a little bit and my parents started putting so much pressure on me. 

I have a tendency to spend my evenings playing games on the pc with some online friends and they took that and accused me of never studying at all and dad even said he'll put me in a rehab facility for it cause it ""overtook my life"". 

It escalated to the point where my mother locked me in my room and wouldn't let me leave and eventually hit me multiple times calling me crazy and just degrading me.

Back at the end of 2017 my dad bought me a 1990 Jeep Wrangler (YJ), because up until that time, I had never owned my own vehicle (I was 22 at the time). I was very appreciative, and excited to own my own vehicle, even if it was a beater compared to what he has bought my sisters (99 Prelude, 2010 Honda CR-V). My dad worked night and day working on that Jeep. He took off the dash and cleaned the dials, changed the oil, cleaned the whole body, repainted, swapped the seats with $500 racing seats and harness belts, new stereo, etc etc. I helped him do some of this, but the work was probably 20/80 in favour of him. I think in some ways, this was my dad's way of having a project with his son, considering we've had a rough relationship throughout my teen years. 

Throughout driving this Jeep I've have multiple problems. Unbearably loud engine to the point where I would have to wear earplugs when I drove, doors flying open once I hit 80km/h, gears grinding randomly, reverse lights refusing to work, fuel gage not working. This summer I got a job 2 hours north of where I live, so I have to commute on the highway with this jeep. Obviously this is not much of a commuter vehicle, and it was more obvious last night. 

On my drive, I was going 115km/h, and my vehicle started shaking violently, and then a heard a loud snap. Pretty much my front drive shaft had snapped in half, bent the pinion, slashed the transmission fluid tank, and put a serious dent in the oil pan. Along with this, had the momentum of the shaft been even a tiny bit faster, it would have completely broken through the bottom of the body and into my cab right next to my foot. This was kind of a final straw for me. 

My parents were nice enough to come bring me another vehicle so that I could complete my trip to work, but the damage was done. My dad insisted he fix it, and I don't really want him to bother. I've talked about selling this Jeep a few times in front of my dad in the last few months, and every time I mentioned it, he would almost start pouting. Now obviously the vehicle itself isn't sellable, but I could still part it out and get something a little newer and more ""commuter friendly"". I'm going to talk to my dad and explain the situation to him tomorrow, but I'm afraid he's just going to get upset, throw a fit, or get pouty and make me feel guilty. 

AITA here? Or am I justified in trying to move on from this vehicle.

*Edit*

Thanks everyone for the helpful replies! I decided that tonight I'm going to talk to my dad and say that I want to keep the jeep, but ask if he wants to come with me when I buy a better vehicle to commute in.

*Edit 2*

Well talked to my dad. He reacted worse than I thought. Pretty much started hanging things over my head and trying to make me feel guilty. So I guess this thing is getting sold and he can rest in his pride."	No A-holes here	0	0	58.0	26.0	0.0	0.0

It's less about me, it's more about my parents.
They are married and normally are a really good team. But sometimes they argue about really stupid stuff.
 So judges, we go back in time:

My grandmother was in hospital and the surgeons messed up, so the stich to hold the stomach together broke in some kinda way. She got in Surgery again and now it is OK more or less.
She has to get thrombose injections, but can't do it alone. So my mother and aunts are helping... Although it's mostly my mother  because we live near my grandmother.
You might ask yourself what it has to do with the arguing, well my mom is in a ton of stress. She is working from 6am to 5pm.

We are renovating a room right now too. So my father has besides work a lot of stress too.

Now the important part:
My mom came home, there was a bit of dust because of cement and all that.
Well my father asked why she was cleaning, she just came home. And made a little joke (in the way of why are you cleaning, I still got work to do) 

Well she snapped, she probably misunderstood him or whatever. She said why she hasn't married another man and that kind of stuff.

I tried to settle it a bit, asked my father why they argued. He said he just made a joke.
She said he just wants to look good and wants us to make her look like a villain.

I just procceded to dance for a bit, I noticed that I immediately didn't want to be here. I went to my mother and she agreed to get me out of there. When everyone asked what happened, I just said that I have to go now. It was an impulse, I didn't feel safe in there

I then chatted for around an hour with my mother deciding what should we do next. I immediately regretted going out of there ASAP. My friend (date) spared a chair for me because everyone sat down. But I still said no, and I was negotiating my decisions, What should I do.

After around an hour, I decided to not go there because I didn't feel safe in here, I can't go to public places (for exmaple. discos or events, not everyday life activities) becuase I have this fear of something bad happening. Also, I think that would be embarrasing to just go back there.

I'm now at home, regretting everything...AITA? I still can go back there, but it's a long way.

"I met my soon-to-be-wife (kindest person I know, sometimes a little naive, always sees the good side in people) 6 years ago at the age of 21. At that time we were both studying in the same place and grew closer. I had one girlfriend prior to her while I was her first boyfriend. 

The parents of my SO divorced when she was 11 years old, leaving her with her mother and younger sister. I was told that my SO had to take over as dad from time to time, doing the housework and so on at a rather young age. Her mother quit her job prior to the divorce and was at home 24/7. Money came from the dad and the state.

10 years later my SO still lived at home and her mother still was jobless.
My SO and I spent increasingly more time together. So far she only had the weekend for that and we split the days between me and home (e.g. MON-FRI: Study abroad, SAT: me, SUN: mother/sister). Suddenly my SO wanted to spent the whole weekend with me or wanted to go on a vacation for a few days and so on.

One day we visited a festival far from home and came back late in the evening. I was driving while my SO called her mother and asked if it was okay that she slept at my place and not visit mother like she usually does. I still remember my SO crying right next to me as mother shouted and screamed on the phone that that would be unfair and she has to come home at once. She didn't... We had these fallouts a couple more times and it summited in another massive outrage via phone a few months later. As my SO was crying again I just took the phone, shut it down and we spent the night at my place with me comforting her. Her mother then wrote messages to me, her and even my parents, calling us all fakes, me a pretending asshole and even worse, calling her own daughter a bitch, my bitch, multiple times. She told my SO that she will end up being my maid since I am too lazy and that I will cheat on her the moment I get tired of her. 
The next few days were hell for us. My SO basically crying nonstop, not being able to work.  I made the decision to block mother on her and my phone. My SO then moved in.
We kept this communication blockade for almost 4 years and plan to marry soon.

Through an old friend of my SO her mother was told about the marriage and initiated contact with us again, furious why she wasn't invited. She doesn't feel at fault. At some point in our wedding preparations we agreed that her mother may come to the wedding if she would apologize.

My SO would like everything to be normal again. I however fear that the best day of our life might get ruined if we invite a person who obviously hates me and our engagement.
So far my SO is fine with that explanation, but I know she would be way happier if we can all be ""friends"" again and her mother would come to the wedding.

c0lz7i	2019-06-14 16:16:16	NotANewInjuryTA	WIBTA for complaining to the hospital OR preventing my family from complaining?	"I fell in the shower and smashed my leg off the porcelain. My leg was bruised and swollen so I went to the ER. I got an XRAY and was told that I had a spiral fracture in my fibula. I was put in a walking boot/air cast. Spiral fractures can be pretty serious and require surgery so I was pretty freaked out.

 I was financially broke at this time and paying for the air cast cost me the last bit of money I had. For a full week of wearing this cast I could not drive and found bathing really difficult, sleeping was almost impossible. I work for a small company with not a lot of employees and now I had to be on light duties at work which was really inconvenient for everyone...we all had to work overtime to meet demand and put us behind (big time). I had to rescheduale a family vacation that everyone was really looking forward too upcoming in late June to September! 

After a week of being in this cast I went to my appointment at the fracture clinic where the orthopedic doctor took one look at my XRAY and informed me that the spiral fracture in my leg was at least 12 weeks old and was already fully healed. This past week of suffering was for nothing. 

I asked the orthopedic doctor WHY the inital ER doctor couldn't have told me that it was an old injury and she said because they ""wouldn't have known"". I am irritated by this situation but am frankly just happy that my leg isnt broken.

 My parents and immediate family members are FREAKING OUT and want to complain to the hospital and try to get the money back for the cast. I am almost 30 years old and don't really need my parents meddling and calling to complain. 

Would they be the asshole if they did complain and make a big stink? Or would I be the asshole for stopping them?

TLDR - I fell and was told I had a spiral fracture in my fibula and put into a cast for a week. The cast was expensive and completely threw my life off track for a full week not only inconveniencing me but others as well (I even had to reschedule an upcoming family vacation to September). Went to a fracture clinic appointment a week later and found out it is an old fracture that had already healed that I didn't know about. Now my family wants to complain to the hospital and get money back for the cast but I am saying they would be TA. What would you do?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I believed I had 2 good friends and 1 acquaintance (a friend of one of my good friends). I met them all when I first moved to the city about 5 years ago. I even considered one of them to be my eventual best man. 

These were my only friends at the time. We were all new to city without knowing anyone. We’d hang out at bars and shit, and we’d meet other people and start hanging out with them. One night we met some dude and he wanted to hang out with us. So whatever, we said sure. 

Fast forward, about 8 months and I didn’t really like the dude we met at the bar, my other 3 friends were luke warm on him as well, but they still hung out with him. He was just condescending and loved to argue all the time, thinking he’s always right, and he’s just not someone I share the same interests with (mainly women). So I let them know not to invite me to anything if they hang out with this dude because I didn’t like him. So they’re like ok...Well, that dude disappears for about a year without saying anything and it was cool with me (I thought it was for everyone else also). 

We had a group chat and we always had Thursday night plans to meet up at a bar and hang out, talk about guy shit, girls, sometimes we would even talk shit about this dude that I (we) didn’t like. 

On Monday of one week we had made plans to meet up Thursday. The same day, I had coworkers wanting to hang out but they knew it was  my usual night with the bros and I said I couldn’t go. Well, Thursday comes and my “friends” all flake on me to hang out with this dude that disappeared from a year ago, and left me basically with no plans the rest of the night.  My one friend was was even trying to make me become friends with this dude and convince to hang out that night. For some reason he was scared of me or something. It made me feel some type of way, i was ready to go out then the rug got pulled from under me. 

Anyway...

That was 2 years ago, I’m a little butthurt about it still. 

That was the last time I talked to them basically. The week after they flaked they texted in the group chat and I didn’t answer, or I would respond with one word like “nah”. Since I was the one that usually got us together, the group chat went silent. 

After that, they never texted me again. So it’s like they never even reached out to me, although I didn’t reach out to them either. 

This is the honest truth, didn’t paint this a certain way to make me look like I didn’t do anything. This is literally how it went down. 

Basically I just moved on. I see the one friend that I thought would’ve been my best man here and there (tailgates) but I don’t say anything to him, even tho he tries to talk to me.

c0lurl	2019-06-14 16:05:54	earthalit	WIBTA if I didn't tell my boyfriend about the money my dad left me in his inheritance?	"hi. first time poster (& on mobile, so please excuse formatting). 

my father passed away in March and it has been difficult for me to process since due to him being absent for a majority of my life & not knowing how to feel about the stranger known as my dad. yesterday, my step-mother invited all of us children into a group chat & told us dad left $600 for each of us in his life insurance policy. I told her this money was a blessing & it would either help with my medical procedures or to get new clothes or something else I can never afford to do for myself.

I feel ... guilty for not wanting to tell my boyfriend about this. however, it seems like every single time I end up with money, he ends up spending it all on Warhammer 40k models for him, something for his son, and then the rest goes towards bills. usually when I confront or attempt to talk to him about this, he states that it isn't ""a big deal"" or I get told that he's ""sorry that my family is an inconvenience to me.""  

when I attempt to assert that the money was specifically for something I want (or that this is specifically for me), it becomes an argument. then he systematically runs through my side of it with logic & reasoning and I end up feeling horrible for even bringing it up. I hate conflict, you know? 

I'm 26. I know that this sum of money should probably go to bills. I came from a household that had nothing in it growing up, so I completely forego things I want or need for the good of the household & others & I know I should probably use it for utilities.  with this, though  ... I sort of feel like this is something meant for just me, like I should get to choose, ultimately, to what it goes to.  I don't know what to do, so I guess that's why I'm here. objective third party opinions. WIBTA if I didn't tell my boyfriend about the money? should I only tell him about part of it?


EDIT 1: this is probably much needed information: my boyfriend decided to work full-time so that I could quit both my jobs and finish my degree. Since he's paying all utilities & I use my savings to buy groceries, I feel an obligation to tell him about this money. I do clean the entirety of the house & watch both of his sons even when he's here to try & make up for that.

UPDATE: told him about it. not the amount or anything, but I said I'd pay for bills this month. He agreed & said I should spend the rest on something I want. I'm gonna put it in a CD account, for emergency ""I need to peace the fuck out"" funds."	Not the A-hole	0	0	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0lr9e	2019-06-14 15:57:43	ThatOtherRussian	WIBTA For asking my best man to step down?	"Some context first, I've known the man for more than half my life and he's a really good guy but not my closest friend, before I got engaged I was asked to be the best man in his wedding which is taking place shortly after my own. When it came time to choose my best man I felt obligated to choose him.

 I only have a few really close friends, one of which lives out of state and the other is currently jobless so I felt as though asking them would not only hurt my best man's feelings/ego, but also put a potentially unwanted burden or responsibility on those friends. It seemed like an easy choice.

Recently, It seems as though my best man has been avoiding me like the plague. Always making excuses not to hang out, Ignoring texts, dodging calls, outright lying to my face when I call him out on it. He seems to forget that I know him and his personality very well, He hates confrontation and would rather ghost friends he doesn't want to hang out with anymore. He's even told me of such occasions in the past. 

Some months ago I had again reached out and was met with another excuse. I was fed up with it and asked him point blank why he continually makes excuses to get out of hanging out, It escalated and we didn't talk for a few weeks. After which I bit the bullet and made amends, despite feeling as though I was in the right. He made an effort for a couple months to come to gatherings or visit but he's since slipped into ghosting once more. I understand that he's getting married too and It's a time consuming, difficult process to get all of the wedding stuff lined up. So I just let it go when it happens and don't really reach out anymore

It feels as though we're just drifting apart, which is fine I totally get that it happens to even the closest of friends. I don't even know if I would consider him my friend anymore.  But with us being each other's Best men, It makes it harder to make that split. It's supposed to be an honor bestowed to the friend you care most about but it feels more like an obligation than anything. Thinking about him giving a speech about how we're the best of buddies kinda makes me sad knowing that it's not true anymore. I think going through my wedding having to pretend would be best but I haven't made my decision yet."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0lom1	2019-06-14 15:51:24	MundaneInstruction7	AITA by saying I would sue a guy who threatened to bash my teeth in if we met in real life.	"People involed: me (17 year old, male) , ""kyle"" (23 year old with 3 kids, male)

This all starts with being on a discord with some friends from Western Australia.

On this server im mainly known for not caring about anything and joking about anything, some people on this server find me annoying (which i can understand i am quite loud) and proceed to mute me and then we just don't talk and thats the end of it. This was the same routine for 2 year for new people.  


one day kyle joins the server and it seems like the usual new person who doesn't find me annoying and understands that im someone to not be taken seriously. I find out kyle has had multiple kids, having his first child at 17, (he did take responsibility and he clearly loves his kids dispite not having a stable income) this topic wasn't really talked about for much and was more of just a fun fact type of conversation.  


a week goes by with kyle being in the server and we don't like each other but we don't hate each other. a person posts an old photo of one of the people in the discord and we all make fun of the photo, more photos come and we are alll having a pretty good time, Im being a D\*ckhead by picking out things that don't even make sense. (e.g pointing out how someone had used clothes on the floor and how cringe it was) kyle then turns the focus to me while im doing my thing saying ""you're pretty judgemental, i took a look at your facebook mate and you can't really be saying this about others."". He posted a picture of me squating in front of a race car. everyone started to roast the picture like they would any other. 10 seconds into to this Kyle inturrupts everyone and says

 ""you are so annoying I'm glad i don't know you in real life but if i did i would bash your teeth in.""

 i said in return ""mate i would just sue you and you would'nt be able to support your kids"".

(i thought i was pointing out that what he said was quite stupid for a parent to say)

Kyle: what did you just say?

Me: that i would sue you if you tried to assult me

K: no, what did you say about my kids?

Me: that you wouldn't be able to support them if i sued you

&#x200B;

Kyle then went on a rant on how i was a know it all pussy and just how he was gonna block me on discord. the fun was clearly over and people were clearly taking kyle's side by saying how much of a pussy i am for saying i would sue him. I'd had enough and told him to hurry up and mute me and to stop talking about it. one of the people on his side then told me that i was acting tough over the internet and how i should just shut up. i mute both of them and thats it.

c0llpb	2019-06-14 15:44:25	nopasanadaa	AITA for not going to a close friends’ wedding?	"This happened a few years ago. I'll try to give enough context and show both sides.

Until this, I was part of a tight group of friends, all of us in our mid to late 20s. Our one friend ""Tom"" was the one with the house where we hung out most of the time. Tom would give me advice, do super nice things like throw surprise birthday parties etc. He met a girl, ""Anna"" and she instantly fit right in with the group. Anna and I became friends as well. Around the same time, another person in our group, ""John"" and I started dating. We even had the talk about how this might affect our friend group and decided to pursue it. Even though John was a fixture amongst the group, Tom warned me that John was not a good guy in relationships and that I shouldn't date him, but I didn't listen. Tom told me that John had a history of violence with an ex. This is where it is my fault that I continued to see John and I was seeing him through rose-tinted lenses... hindsight is 20/20. I see now that he was very emotionally abusive and controlling, though at the time I didn't pick up on the signs. When I asked, he admitted that he choked his ex once but had changed and would never do it again. I, though I shouldn't have, continued seeing him. Then a few months later he thought I was texting a guy and started trying to grab my phone, it escalated to him twisting my arm and then hitting me in anger and I was scared. We were in a car in the middle of nowhere, and I was without my phone. After this I finally ended things with him. 

Eventually I told Tom and some others in the group what actually happened. I started only coming around when John wasn't there and the whole thing became awkward. I was frustrated that they would still remain friends with John, but John had been around longer than me. I know they believed me, but I don't know if John downplayed it. Fast forward some time, I meet a guy and we end up dating for a year and moving in together. Tom and Anna also get engaged and I get a wedding invitation, without a plus one. I ask Tom about it and he said since I haven't been coming around that often, they didn't know my new boyfriend and were only inviting people they knew personally. Understood. I asked others in the group and everyone had a plus one except me and John, who was now single. I also found out that we would all be at the same table and couldn’t seat me elsewhere. I didn't feel comfortable going alone, so I didn't go to the wedding. I found out later that people had thought it was really wrong of me to not go to Tom and Anna's wedding as their friend. They stopped talking to me. 

There's been some mutual events lately, and I've been thinking of making amends with Tom and Anna. I know this is not a forum for advice, but that's the reason I'm posting about it now, since I'm seeing them pop up and I haven't ever figured out if I was the one in the wrong."

c0llhk	2019-06-14 15:43:51		WIBTA if I staged a break-in at my house?	"Hi reddit. I know this sounds extreme, but I am really sick of this and I want to prove a point. Sorry for the long post. Tell me if I’m an asshole. 

So, we live in a decent area, but there is a lot of petty crime, particularly theft. We have had all of our bikes stolen when the the gate was left unlocked, and we hear reports all the time of minor break-ins to cars and homes. Recently our neighbor had their car stolen. 

Well my mom finally installed an alarm system, but only after a few years of me begging for one. As a girl who used to be left home alone overnight often, I thought it was probably a good idea. The only problem is she never arms it. 

In fact, she often disarms it to go into the yard or where ever after I have armed it, and refuses to arm it again. She leaves the porch door wide open too. 

This all from a woman who in our previous house (with zero crime) told me if kept wearing headphones in the house, someone would break in and kill me (I get it, using fear tactic to make teenager not wear headphone. But really?) 

Anyway, to the incident. Last night when I got home late, she had not armed the house yet. Not only that, she had left the side door wide open. When I armed the house, she disarmed it to get the mail and didn’t turn it on again. So I said “do you not like arming the house?” And she snapped at me to “just shut up.”

Being told to shut up by my parents makes me really fucking mad. So I said something under my breath like “don’t be such an asshole.” Which I realize probably makes me an asshole. For that I’ve been “grounded” (I’m 21 lol) to think about what I’ve done. 

Well I’m thinking. And what I wanna know is if I would be be a bigger asshole if the next time she leaves the door open and house unarmed, I hide something big like a computer or fancy blender or something that she would notice. I want to prove a point that she 1) needs to arm the fucking house and 2) should never tell me to shut up, especially when it’s a matter of safety. 

So, AITA?

Edit: I have talked to her about it before. She similarly yells at me or dismisses my concerns. Also, my post is petty and I accept my judgement, but I am concerned for her safety too. Will ask other family about what to do.

Edit 2: I was never going to let it go on enough for the police get involved. Just enough to freak my mom out and say “actually it’s right here, but it could’ve happened because the door was wide open.” As people have pointed out, this would still be a dumb and asshole move."

I'm on mobile and Yada Yada. 

So for some background I have a very entitled older sister (28) and she and her husband live at home with my parents. Because I'm a Muslim I can only movie out once I'm married so that's why I still live with my parents. She hasn't moved out because they are in a comfort zone and my father pays for everything while they live their lives and act broke. They've been married for 6 years BTW. 

Anyway on to the story. My sister treats my younger brother and I like absolute garbage. She has insults us at every opportunity she gets especially in public and she's just a very nasty person. So she needed to go pick something up today and didn't want to go alone because she was taking her baby (3) with her. I politely declined as I don't help the hand that bites me. Anyway she created a performance and was being rude and demanded that my brother(15) went with instead and my father started shouting at my brother. So I got involved and I told my dad that it's not fair that he gets agressive with us because she wants something and we need to suddenly jump to help that's not how this works. So this started a very aggressive argument between my dad and I. She eventually went alone with the kid.

A lot of people are going to call me selfish and whatever but it's not like that. If she treated us different and was actually a nice person I would have loved to go. My dad always enables her bullshit and that's just not on. Don't treat me like dirt and then expect me to help you.

Once college hit and i got a new job, we were becoming more and more distant and it didn’t really feel like a great relationship anymore, so I ended it. I should also mention I was becoming more and more interested in another guy and shortly after the breakup, him and I began talking and eventually dating. This has been almost a year and a half and my ex and I don’t talk much. I see him on social media occasionally and around town sometimes, but other than that not much communication which I’m okay with. 

But then he texted me last night asking if current bf and I would be okay if ex and I got dinner together. Bf is not okay with it, doesn’t really like the idea of ex and I communicating at all but hey I can do what I want and it’s not like he’s trying to control me. Just isn’t a fan of it. I don’t really want to get dinner either tbh. I feel like it’d be awkward and forced and would overall not be a good time. I told ex that I didn’t think getting dinner was necessary and that we could just text to catch up instead. He then questioned why I didn’t think it was a good idea as we’ve both moved on and kinda made me feel like a dick for saying no in the first place. 

So, AITA for not wanting to meet up with him? I think it’d be interesting to catch up, but I would much rather do it over text or even if we randomly ran into each other (which is possible) , rather than forcing a meet up/dinner which would ultimately make my bf uncomfortable and would be super awkward for myself."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0lixi	2019-06-14 15:37:34		AITA for not continuing to support my sister after she cheated on her boyfriend?	"*This is my alt account as my friends know my main account.*

&#x200B;

So my little sister used to (20F) stays with me (27M) and my GF (27F). She is a student and can't afford a room on her own, even if she works part time. 

So now my sister used to date a guy (21M) who is also the brother of my long time friend. They both dated for around 3 years from the start of their college. Now everything was good, until she started hooking up with random guys on tinder. Apparently she was busted by her boyfriend. According to her she only went out twice with the same guy and it was a mistake. But her one mistake caused a big issue for me... my friend removed me and my GF  both from our friends group. Currently I don't know what the situation is with my friend and his brother as nobody from his family is responding to my texts or calls.

Now I know everyone makes mistake, but she did this on purpose. Me and my GF had agreed to kick her out of the house. My mum says she alone can't afford to pay for her and that she needs my help. My aunt thinks that I am the asshole for abandoning ""my own sister for my friend"", even my extended family thinks what she did was wrong, but making her homeless is a huge dick move. Also my aunt and mum are thinking that she is just a child and therefore will make mistakes 😒. So  we gave her a 7 days ultimatum to leave our house, so she can at least find a decent place to stay.

Apparently I am kicking her out because I personally know how being cheated on feels like. But I do kinda feel like I am making a wrong choice as my entire family is against it. So AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I added some more details about her:

* She spends all her time either at her friends house or on social media and does not even contribute to help in house.
* She also one time sneak weed into our apartment.
* She spends all her food money mum gave her on cosmetics or makeup.
* She was arrested one time for joyriding when she was younger.
* Also one time took out money from my GF's purse without permission.
* Came home drunk several time.
* Shouts and screams at my GF and mum.

So her cheating on her BF is not the only reason we are kicking her out."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"Using a throwaway since I lurk and occasionally comment on this sub from my regular account and based on all my past ""YTA"" votes i'm probably being a massive hypocrite. 

I was born and raised as far away from any sort of coast as you can possibly be in the US. I've been to the ocean one time in Florida when I was little and all I can remember is thinking that something down there is going to eat me. 

I hit the lottery when it comes to inlaws. The are the sweetest people on the planet, they are amazing grandparents (contrary to so many of the stories I read on reddit) and they treat me as well as the do my husband's sisters. I love them so much. 

My FIL is a really high ranking retired Navy officer and one of his favorite subordinates is retiring  in August. My inlaws have come up with a plan to cash in some stock, rent a beach house for two weeks and take their entire family on vacation to coordinate with the retirement ceremony. They are paying for all lodging, ask that we provide food and cook from time to time and they are paying for our kids' airline tickets (we would use my husbands miles for our tickets). It's insanely generous. 

With all that I said no. I physically can't go on a vacation where my kids are right next to the ocean. It just can't happen. They are good swimmers but so much could happen like the beaches are crowded and they get taken away, they wander into a riptide, they get hurt on the boardwalk and on and on. But mostly I am so freaking scared of sharks that I can't let me or my family go. I just can't. I know this might be irrational but it's not unrealistic. I just read a story of a triathlete getting eaten by a shark on a beach just miles north of where this beach house would be. It does happen. 

My kids are heartbroken, my husband is trying to be nice and not make fun of me but I know he's thinking ""why did I marry this crazy woman again?"" My inlaws are so disappointed because it would have been the very first time they would have had all their children and grandchildren in one location. My MIL is being so sweet to try to talk me into it but I just can't do it. 

AITA?

"I (m 18) work at a mall food court with several other employees. Since there’s a festival downtown and business at the mall has been slow in the afternoon there have only been 5  people working a day. 3 in the morning and then another 2 in the afternoon who come in and take over while the other 3 leave. An assistant manager opens while the general manager ( Kate) closes 

I usually open in the morning with the AM “Allison” (f 19) and my friend “Alex” . Allison  told the GM she couldn’t open anymore because  her brothers aren’t in school and she has to watch them. This meant that the GM opened with us instead.  The other guy in the afternoon “Frank” (m 30 something) would be closing with Allison.

Allison has worked with Frank before but never by herself. Frank is kind of weird but he’s not a bad person I guess.  The next morning everything is going the same as usual until we get a call from Allison asking if she can talk to Kate. They talk for a bit and Kate comes and talks to me

“ Are you willing to stay until close? Allie called and said she had some trouble with Frank last night and said she would feel better closing with you. “

I asked her what Frank did and apparently he kept staring at Allison and told her she was really pretty. Kate told me Frank stares at her too and that he’s just awkward but that Allison felt really uncomfortable. She called Frank and asked if he could start working mornings and he said he could but starting tomorrow because he was already doing something that morning. I told her she could move me to the afternoons from now on but that I’m not going to work the morning and afternoon shift in one day (11 hours). Kate was kind of annoyed I didn’t prioritize Allison’s comfort. Allison called again and asked me to please stay but I refused again. 

Tl;DR Co worker felt uncomfortable with another co worker and I was asked to stay from open to close so she didn’t have to work with him and I refused."	No A-holes here	0	0	8.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c0lfsr	2019-06-14 15:30:00	KatNms	WIBTA if I don’t help my parents pay back $300k Parent Plus Loan after their bullshit?	"My dad is the sole provider. My sister is 26 years old, finally employed, and lives with my parents. I’m 23F, graduated this year, employed, and live in the city with my GF. In total, my dad has about $550k PPL. My sister is $250k of that. My parents never made a single payment to either of our loans until late 2018. My parents have used some of our PPL refund money to pay their bills and mortgage. There were numerous times when my Mom took out $1k-2k of my bank account/refund and left me short on rent while I was in school.

My mom once forced me to let my sister stay in my apt so that she could work retail while searching for a full time position. My mom outright threatened me with “If you don’t do this, your father won’t sign your PPL again and then we will transfer the loans into your name.”, like she always says if I don’t do something she wants me to do. I basically had to hide my sister in my bedroom like a refugee and pay extra for utilities so my roommate wouldn’t rat me out. My sister only helped me pay for utilities ONCE for the whole year.

My parents refused to give me the login info for PPL. My sister told me my Mom wanted me to transfer money into my Chase account because they had full access to it. She’d already saved all the account info on the site and would pay the loan with money I transfer into there. They also tried to guilt me into refinancing on numerous occasions. My dad said “Well what about my credit? I’m supposed to be stuck with your debt?” and something about wanting a new car. Not to mention, my Mom put me on her Amex in high school to “build my credit score”, for it to constantly have 99% utilization rates by her and have over $4k in debt for the past 4 years. I took myself off the card and the next month my credit score increased over 100pts.

When I brought up the idea of splitting the PPL payments, my mom went ballistic. They said I needed to refinance the entire loan into my name and then cut ties with the family. They never gave my sister this hassle for login information, and not once did I ever say I’d abandon them. Now, I’m just waiting to see how they react to me closing my Chase account.

TL;DR My family has repeatedly lied and manipulated me into doing whatever benefited them most, especially financially, like paying off the entire Parent Plus loan. After a huge fight over giving me the login information, I went from wanting to pay it all off for them to 50-70%. They wanted to cut ties with me after I refinance the loan. Both my parents have been selfish and completely unapologetic for everything they’ve said/done. I’m now thinking of paying 30% or even 0%.

&#x200B;

c0lew6	2019-06-14 15:27:44	tracergreen	WIBTA for writing off an employee who skipped a training day for weed?	"English as a 1st language, mobile user, no other excuses.

I work in a restaurant of the ""fast casual""as variety an Assistant General Manager. Busy season is upon us, so lots of new folks. One guy just started yesterday, and was scheduled for a 4-hr shift tonight. We'll call him Brian. 

I haven't met Brian yet, but I was told that he did well on his 1st training shift yesterday. Tonight was day 2, and he had told a shift manager that he would be late because of a doctor's appointment. He first said dentist appointment, but we heard through the grapevine that it was actually for his medical marijuana ""prescription"". 

For context, we are in Colorado, where medical & recreational marijuana are legal. I partake myself as a responsible adult, my job doesn't care so long as it's not interfering with my ability to perform, don't smoke at work, etc. So I don't have it out for stoners or anything. To each their own. But because our company is Nationwide, it's not exactly ok under company policy. It's a grey area, with a little ""don't ask/don't tell"".

Additionally, having obtained my own card in the past, it's a relatively easy process, but can take a lot of time. An appointment doesn't guarantee you'll get in at your scheduled time, and it's certainly not a requirement. In fact, there are hundreds of places in town to get registered for these things, and they have pretty wide hours. 

Brian did not call to say he was running late. An hour into his shift, I called him and he said he was ""in the office, still waiting"". At this point, it's 6pm. He said he'd let me know his ETA when he had more information. Another hour passes and still nothing. A shift manager asked me if she should call him for an update, and I was pretty grumpy with the situation at this point. I wanted to see if he'd take the initiative and still show up... But you know how that ended. 

He didn't NEED to get a prescription because it's recreationally legal. It does earn you a discount though. He didn't need to get it TODAY or at the exact time of his shift. He could have gone earlier in the day, yesterday before that shift, tomorrow when he's off (because these businesses are open on weekends too), but he decided to skip his entire second day of training to get this card. 

I'm pretty miffed at the disrespect, and honestly I'm really unsure of the whole legality of it all since it's a ""medical"" card, but WIBTA for suggesting that we write this guy off? I'm a stoner myself, but you need to be a responsible stoner and show respect to your employer and fellow coworkers. I also think it shows a character that I'm not interested in working with, so I don't see the point in bothering with him any further. I think it would be best to cut our losses right now and tell him not to bother coming back."	Not the A-hole	0	0	219.0	19.0	0.0	0.0

"I manage our small branch office in a semi run down office suite, \~200 Sqft with 6 guys in it. It consists of a main room in which we all work in cubes, and a small conference room and break room off the side. We pay the cleaning staff who does the whole building to come in and clean our office twice a month.

Three weeks ago, this random person I've never seen before walks into our office and goes straight to the break room. No knock, no introduction. I turn to the guy next to me, and say ""Who the F\*\*\* is that?"", to which the person, from the break room, shouts ""IM THE F\*\*\*ING CLEANING PERSON"". We say oh, chuckle it off, and never thought twice about it.

&#x200B;

This morning I terminated our services with the cleaning crew, sighting their inconsistent and infrequent visits, as well as poor quality of service and attention to detail. The cleaning manager (owner?) apologized, and referenced the aforementioned situation where I ""swore at"" her staff, saying it made her person uncomfortable being here, which is why she was ""in and out so quickly"" lately, and that its probably good we part ways.

The old one is a few years old but still works ok, so we decided to give it to my son (12). No data, but he can get wifi and “text” using Google hangouts and play games. We gave it to him with the understanding that (a) he look after it properly and not lose it, and (b) that he may have to share it with me on an upcoming out-of-country trip (I can’t take mine because it is work-issued and we aren’t allowed to take our cell phones internationally). Son is delighted. 

Fast forward a few weeks. HB seems to be creating all kinds of rules around son’s care of the phone. He must turn it off every night. He must charge it every day. And now he is characterizing it as a “loan” so the phone still belongs to him. Twice now he has confiscated it because son did not charge it at night. I think he is being a dick because the natural consequence of son not charging it is that he will have a dead phone the next day, and he will learn to plan accordingly. HB would rather take it away to have him learn the lesson, saying the phone is still technically his and he wants to make sure it stays in good working condition in case he ever needs it again (I guess keeping it charged has something to do with this?) Son is very disappointed and feels like the phone gift was a bait and switch. 

I am tempted to just buy another second-hand phone to give to son and avoid what feels like an unnecessary power trip. So who ITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	23.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

I texted one of my go to concert buddies and he called me back saying he wanted to go and that he was with 2 other mutual friends of ours at the time and asked if he they could come too. 

I basically told him “no, I just wanted it to be a smaller group” plus the one guy doesn’t even like that type of music. I’m not sure if he was on speaker with them, but I’m sure they heard him ask and he probably told them my response too.

He texted me again later saying that the one guy actually liked the music but I still stuck with that I just wanted it to be a smaller, more chill group. For the record, I don’t want them to come because I find the 3 of them together terribly annoying, mind numbingly dumb (as they are usually high together and have adapted most of their stoned mannerisms into their everyday speech) and excessively bro-y. On top of that, the one guy who is interested in the music is pretty annoying in general and has done some not-so-cool stuff to a friend of mine recently.

So AITA for straight up excluding these guys (pretty much to their face) and giving little to no justification?

INFO: I forgot to include a few things. My friend who I am already planning on going with, is in the process of cutting one of the excluded guys out of his life (those are his words) as the excluded guy was a super scumbag to him. Although they seem to be on decent terms he wants as little involvement as possible with him. Additionally, the scumbag guy has a terrible track record of following through, often canceling the night before/day of even if he has tickets.

In his states of mania, he's broken their furniture, gotten aggressive with her (once in public!!), told her horrible things, etc. Hes being nonsensical and snaps at anything. This has been going on for probably 2 weeks now. 

It came to a head when he drove and crashed her car. She told him to stay at his parent's. The next day she picked him up from work and he started yelling at her on the street. He threw her phone. She said she left and left him on the side of the road. When she checked their house later in the night, he completely tore it apart and threw their furniture outside in the street. 

He has a serious mental health crisis. I have my own and understand how important a support network is. But there are boundaries to protect your own well being.

Edit: Sorry i forgot to mention:

He's always gone to therapy and a psychiatric nurse for his depression and ADHD. He got his new bipolar medicine yesterday. He goes to therapy every week but I'm not sure if he talks about this.

c0l6pp	2019-06-14 15:07:44		WIBTA by not letting my step mom come to my wedding?	"Around a year and a half ago, I met a really amazing woman. She's kind, loving, smart, beautiful; I've never had much luck in relationships, but I swear I hit the jackpot. We've been living together for around 8 months, and things are going perfectly. I'm actually thinking of proposing. My potential fiance and I started talking about what each of us would want our wedding to be like. What kind of flowers, who to invite, what kind of cake, stuff like that.

And it was then that I realized, I really don't want my step mom to be there. People say you should invite your entire family to your wedding, especially your parents, no matter what. But when it comes to my wedding, I really want to phone my dad and say, as respectfully and politely as I possibly can, ""Hey, Dad, my wedding is coming up. I want you and mom to be there, but I don't think she (my step mom) should come. You can come, and I respect if you don't want to come because she can't, but, I really think it would be better if she didn't come.""

Honestly, I'm genuinely torn about this. On the one hand, my step mom was physically and emotionally abusive growing up. She would make up lies about me, just to find things to punish me about, and try to convince me it was true. She would lock me in closets, starved me a good portion of the time, left me with an eating disorder by slowly picking at my self esteem, tackled me a lot, hit me, beat me with large objects. She screamed at me constantly, [like in this DaddyofFive video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmn6u7FQn-A). Looks, sounds, acts like this woman, except she's 300 pounds or so. Many, many many group punishments with literal torture. When she grounded me, it was never ""no tv for a week"", instead I was never allowed to do anything except sit in my room and stare at a wall for weeks on end (That's not a joke, that really was the case). Oh, and many, many times she locked me outside in the summer in Phoenix, 120 degrees, with no water for 4-7 hours. Also, I've seen her at weddings. If she isn't allowed to make it about herself she kind of throws a fit...

But, on the other hand... I was always taught as a kid, that your parents let you live in their home. They don't have to, but they do, and they get you food, and clothes, and you gotta be grateful for that because they did that shit out of the kindness of their hearts. As bad as she was, she cared for me, you know? I'm talking food and water, yo... isn't that enough that she deserves my love? Cause like, she decided to be there during my formative years. Yeah, she fell in love with my dad, maybe it was *only* that, but she could have easily left at any point, if she hated us, instead of staying. Maybe that says something? I mean, if you forget about the torture, and everything that happened, she is family, right? And family is important? I care about people and I don't want to make someone who cares about me feel bad, or to hurt them.

I'm not asking for advice, I'm just trying to capture both sides. Now, WIBTA?

Edit: I hate award speech edits, and this is not one of them. This is me saying, to almost everyone who commented here, abuse makes you confused about your worth, and what you deserve, and it really seems like you people understand that. In writing this post, I genuinely expected to be called the asshole, and I now realize that's because I really thought I was the asshole. Thanks for giving me perspective. I was helped today, I think you all showed me how to work this out.

For the first time in my life, I know that I'm in control of my happiness. And I've learned that I get to choose how my own wedding goes. This is a big step for me; I came here for judgement, I expected my feelings of assholery to be validated, but I leave having learned to respect myself a little more instead.

I appreciate the fact that she wants me there for 2 whole weeks but she will be recovering from giving birth, breastfeeding and doing general mom duties. 

I’m not wanting to spend my entire 2 weeks with a newborn baby. I asked her if it would be ok if I can visit for 4 days then go to South America for 8 days and come back for another 3 days. You would have thought that I suggested that she get an abortion because of her reaction. 

She told me that it was unfair that I don’t want to spend quality time with the newborn and her. I have seen my friends with their 2 month olds and they are absolutely miserable because of lack of sleep. When I stay with her and my BIL I fully intend to help them with the child. I.e if the baby was hungry give it the bottle or let her be able to take a nap while I watch the kid. That I don’t mind and I am willing to do those things for her. Change diapers is a no go.

I told her that I was supposed to get married during the two weeks and I want to be able to do something that would make me happy.

"Me and said friend, lets call him bob, grew up in a shitty council estate (ghetto), went to a shitty school and then went out separate ways at 18. I basically shot up the ""classes"", first by going to a posh uni, then through lucking into a shit tonne of money and finally through marrying  someone from a traditional upper class family, while my friend is still very clearly lower (no money, no education, min wage job). The difference has made things slightly awkward but I still consider him my best friend.

&#x200B;

Anyway we met recently at 25 years old and were reminiscing over our school days, when I said something along the lines of ""you know what, I enjoyed life so much more back then rather than in upper middle snobville"". few more lines were exchanged and he asked if I thought he was lower class, I said he obviously was but it doesn't matter. He said I'd become a snob and I tried explaining that I didn't mean it as an insult or care about it. We then awkwardly dropped it. AITA here?

&#x200B;

Q and A:

Do you consider yourself above him?

Yeah without question, basing this off how I got treated growing up lower vs now being middle upper, but I don't care or treat him differently. Doesn't mean he's not my best friend. Similarly with my wife I know I'm beneath her and don't care or treat her differently. 

&#x200B;

c0l5k2	2019-06-14 15:04:42	quinoa_rex	WIBTA for asking my housemates not to do laundry between 11pm and 8am?	"So I live in a house with 5 other people, two of whom are neatniks. One of them in particular does laundry about once a day, sometimes more. (I find that excessive but then again I'm used to having to be mindful of water usage.) The laundry is in the basement, and my room is about 10 feet from the washer and dryer. There have been a few instances recently where my housemate will do laundry around midnight, or around 7am.

I'm the only one who lives downstairs, and the tradeoff for a big room and a bathroom mostly to myself is that I can hear \*everything\*. Heavy footfalls in the living room and kitchen sound like stomping, and I can hear every word of normal-volume conversations upstairs. As such, the laundry is very audible to me, particularly the dryer.

I already have difficulty sleeping normally, especially getting back to sleep if I'm woken up. While I don't care what they do while I'm not sleeping, I do care when they're up early and putting shit in the dryer because it wakes me up 75% of the time. Missing that hour of sleep has a surprisingly large negative effect.

Most of the folks I've asked have said asking for a time cutoff is super reasonable, but a few folks have pointed out that I chose the downstairs bedroom, it isn't my business when they're doing laundry or why, and to suck it up and get earplugs.

So my wife is pregnant with twins and it is a high risk pregnancy. So she has to visit her gynecologist regularly.  I usually accompany her to these appointments.

But I don't understand why she makes weird comments. Everytime we visit her, she asks my wife if she feels safe with me. I asked her what she meant by that and she said it was just a formal question. Does she mean I'm abusing her or something? Idk, but she does that everytime. 

Also, she assumes that I know nothing about pregnancy. Like literally nothing. For example she asked me about my work schedule. I own a family business, which requires frequent travel. Now this doctor has a problem with me working and ""adviced"" me not to travel until the babies are born. I'm not even kidding. I actually found that hilarious. My wife doesn't have a problem with my schedule, but the doctor has. 

Sometimes she asks me these weird scientific questions which I obviously cannot answer and proceeds to make hilarious comments about how I don't know anything about pregnancy. I mean, if I knew everything, why would we go to her? I'm just baffled. 

So, I told my wife that I'm done with this doctor. I'll drive her to the clinic, but I have no intention of engaging in a conversation with this doctor. I also told her that the doctor insinuating that I'm abusive really hurt me. My wife starts crying and tells me that I'm oversensitive. AITA here?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0l4fy	2019-06-14 15:02:11		AITA for thinking my dad should have disclosed our house was haunted?	"This happened many years ago when I still lived at home with my family, but it’s been a debate ever since. Hoping the people of reddit will put it to rest.

My dad worked for an international company and was chosen for a project in a different country. We decided as a family to keep our house in our home country but move with him and live overseas for the duration of the 1-2 year project. My mom, sister and I stayed in our home country packing while my dad left to hunt for a rental house there, and we decided we would join him after he found one.

Apparently finding a rental was a difficult process and very little was available. My dad ended up finding a home that had a flat downstairs with a separate entrance. We would take the top of the house and a man we’ll call M lived in the lower half. My dad was clearly warned by both M and the realtor that the house was known to be very haunted. To this day I don’t understand why the realtor would tell him that (maybe out of good conscience), but she did, and M backed it up, saying everyone who had lived in the top half had consistent paranormal experiences. M said it wasn’t a dangerous ghost but that he knew there was a ghost.

My dad didn’t believe in ghosts but knew my mom did. He chose not to tell us because he was having trouble finding a place and didn’t want to “freak us out”, and didn’t even believe M or the realtor.

Needless to say, we moved to the new country and realized very quickly the house was haunted. We weren’t terrorized by any means- if anything it was a nice ghost but a very very active ghost. After two weeks living there, my mom confronted my dad saying “you’re going to think this is crazy, but I think the house is haunted.” His response was “who told you? how’d you find out?”

We moved after a few years and to this day I love my dad but think not telling us was an asshole move. He defends himself saying he didn’t believe in ghosts so had no obligation to tell us. My mom replies that being told by multiple people the house is haunted was enough reason to at least warn her. 

You know that trope of a dad in a horror movie who is warned over and over again the house is haunted but moves his whole family in anyways? That’s my dad. AITA for thinking he should of told us even if he didn’t believe it was true?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Me and my classmates decided to collaborate for an oral commentary exam and we suggested that we each write 3-4 commentary notes and share with each other to lessen the workload. There's only a few days left until the exam and 2 of my classmates have not contributed to any of the notes at all. I talked to them about it and they said they would finish something by today but nothing has been done. I do understand that they all probably have a lot of work to do but we still need time before the exam to memorise the notes, and I would feel cheated if I just gave them my notes without getting the same in return. There isn't much time left so I'm really tempted to just make most of the notes myself and remove their access to the notes I made if they still haven't done anything after one day.

"My best friend (of 17 years) had a party and invited a load of his class mates and some close friends. I was at said party and was starting to talk to new people I hadn’t met yet. Then I was talking to this girl there and we were having a nice casual conversation as you do and we exchange numbers at the end of the night to stay in touch. Weeks down the line we’re talking to each other quite regularly and (this is important) there was nothing going on between us, as far as we were concerned we were just two friends now that talk to each other regularly. 

Turns out that my best friend who hosted the party was into this girl and found it quite irritating/aggravating that this girl and I were talking regularly. Important: I did not know he was into this girl and had no intentions of “stealing” her away from him or anything like that. This lead to him ignoring me for a couple weeks and being a dick to me.

c0l0ag	2019-06-14 14:52:24	exjettas	WIBTA for wanting to cut my paternal family out of my life?	"Lots of dynamics here, I'll try to streamline the jist of the situation.  I'm a 29 year old woman, visiting home.  My mother is and was growing up, a semi functioning alcoholic.  My father suffers from schizophrenia and was abusive when I was a baby, so I grew up seeing him (and my grandparents) maybe once a year tops, until I was 14 and then not at all until I was an adult.  He never paid child support.


  As an adult I decided to attempt a relationship with my father's side, on their request. Over the years during visits both my father and grandmother push the topic of my mom's drinking to a point that is very uncomfortable and invasive, also insinuating she wasn't a good mother.  Although we have had our struggles I love my mother, and she sacrificed a lot to raise me on her own. 

 Eventually I came to a point where I explained I was uncomfortable with these discussions.  My grandmother wont leave it alone despite my pleading to just have an adult relationship that leaves my mother out of conversation.  I've decided to not see my grandparents this visit, and attempted to explain why to my father, who literally had no response.  When I've tried to work these issues out, or have an open discussion about lingering anger towards my father I get shut down, but then guilted for not wanting to visit or be in touch.  In fact, the first time I mentioned feeling anger that I felt obligated to visit them when no one was around for me as a child, my dad said point blank ""sounds like you need a therapist.""

We were having a bit of a deep and meaningful together where she dropped this massive bomb on me. She said, ‘don’t tell my brother, but I used to be a hooker and I’m thinking about taking it up again to make a bit more dosh’.
This took me off guard, my SIL is far from the stereotypical  prostitute you envision; she has a university education, has a pretty well paying job and has a family that has always loved and supported her.
For my SIL she looks back on her hooking days with a great deal of happiness; it was easy money and working in the brothel was really chill. 
But, now I feel really stuck. I feel like that if I was in my partners shoes I would definitely want to know that my sister was prostituting herself and plans to do it in the future. But, on the other hand my SIL confided in me and I don’t want to break that trust.

c0kwhd	2019-06-14 14:43:02		AITA for complaining to a clothing store that their male janitor was walking around the ladies' fitting room area?	"I went to a clothing store today and grabbed a few things to take back to the fitting room to try on. When I got back to the fitting room area (in the back of the store, somewhat closed off), there was a male janitor straightening some things up, and no one else was back there, customer or employee. He asked me of one of the rooms that already had clothes in it was mine. I was confused as to why he was trying to put me in a fitting room, said no and walked into another room.

&#x200B;

The fitting room I was in didn't have a door, but rather a curtain that didn't really provide full privacy. I probably should've just left but I assumed he would leave the area or at least not walk near the room I was in. I took my pants off and tried a skirt on and heard him walking around the fitting room area, walking past my room a few times and walking in an out of other rooms while. I could see him through the small crack between the curtain and the wall so I got fed up and put my clothes back on and walked out.

&#x200B;

When I left the fitting room area I found a (female) employee and told her about the situation. She asked me if he came into my room while I was undressed and I said no but that I could see him walking around because the rooms don't provide full privacy. She assured me that the guy had been working there as a cleaner for a long time. I told her that didn't matter - it's a clothing store that sells women's clothes and I didn't feel comfortable undressed and alone with a man walking around that I could see through the crack of the curtain. She made another excuse and I reiterated that I  was NAKED and I felt uncomfortable (clearly my point wasn't getting across) and then she said ""I understand and thank you for telling me"" with a fake smile.

&#x200B;

AITA for this complaint? Maybe I'm the asshole for getting undressed in the first place knowing he was walking around, but the employee could not have possibly made me feel dumber or more like a prude - which by the way, I'm totally not."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0kvz4	2019-06-14 14:41:43	BobIoblaw	AITA for not holding the door for a man in a wheelchair?	"This happened in 2010 and I think about it almost weekly. I was living in DC in a pretty large apartment building. Everyone in this building was very private. A quick nod in the elevator or a whispered “hi” is the most interacting you would do when you saw neighbors. One neighbor was in a wheelchair. I saw him often. He was always in the gym (all upper body; dude was ripped) and our schedules coincided where we would often be together in the elevator to the parking garage. One thing I noticed about him is that he didn’t want any special treatment. An example, one time I was holding the door open to the gym for him (you needed a fob, so holding it open was a courtesy of sorts) and he grabbed the door and insisted on me going in first. Almost like “I don’t need anyone to hold the door for me.” I observed it a few times in the building with other neighbors.  He wasn’t being a dick, but more making a silent statement portraying “I can do this, I don’t need favors.” I had no doubt he can open his own doors and do pretty much anything a walking person could do in terms of getting around on his own. His wheel chair was rugged looking— had the cambered wheels and I’ve observed things like him doing wheelies to get on and off curbs. 

The incident. He and I are on our way to the park garage in the elevator. He drove a distinctive color Subaru and never parked in the handicap space. The layout of this apartment had a security vestibule on each floor of the park garage. An enclosed glass room with a door on the right and the left. Because these doors required fobs and were there for security, they slammed shut pretty hard. When we excited the elevator, he normally would always go right. Another point I would like to make is that when the elevator doors open he always insisted you exit first. Now, whenever I would exit the vestibule, I would normally look back to hold the door for whomever was behind me. Because it was him and the fact I thought we were going separate ways, I didn’t look back and hold the door. As I let go of the door, I hear it immediately slam into his wheelchair. I wanted to turn around and apologize, but I didn’t.  Part of it was panic and awkwardness, but another part of me didn’t do it because I thought it would be like giving extra attention he didn’t appreciate. I don’t even know if he was anticipating the door and the slam I heard was just part of how he went through those doors or if he was thinking I would put my arm back and hold the door for an extra second. He proceeded to his car like he always does started getting in. Trivia. He would go through the rear passenger door, collapse and pull the chair in, and then move up to the front. He could do it in 10 seconds. So I do know the chair folded fine and he seemed unfazed. 

I’ve told this story a few times and get mixed results on if I’m an asshole or not. So reddit, I leave it to you to seal my fate after nearly a decade of cringing about this. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	375.0	31.0	0.0	0.0

c0ku43	2019-06-14 14:37:14		AITA for not wanting to invite my fiancée's friends to our wedding?	"A little backstory:  
Months  ago before we got engaged, a couple of my fiancée's friends confronted  her after learning that her and I were looking at rings. The reason for  the intervention was **on behalf** of a soon to be bride that is a mutual  friend of the group. The soon to be bride had her upcoming wedding  planned at a destination in another country (a whole other mess of a  story), and the friends thought it would be the ""worst thing ever"" if we were to get engaged in the other country, either  before or after the wedding. For whatever reason, they just assumed that  if my girlfriend and I were to get engaged, that it would ""steal""  attention from the soon to be bride, and would be the ""worst thing ever"".  


&#x200B;

At  the time the confrontation happened I had not settled on a ring.  However, shortly after that the stars aligned and I did buy a ring, and  as fate would have it, I took it on the trip and proposed at the perfect  moment (which also happened to be days before the other bride's  wedding). In my opinion, we did not distract from the other bride's  wedding at all, and did not make a show of it or demand attention.  
Nobody  flipped out, but the ""friends"" were extra cold towards me. The bride did not seem to care all that much, congratulated us and even gave a toast to us.

&#x200B;

  
So  now, weeks later, my fiancée and I are starting to plan our wedding and one of the first things we did was make a list of people who are  going to get invites.

&#x200B;

  
I  do not want the intervening ""friends"" invited to our wedding. They did not  want us engaged so I don't think they deserve to attend. Additionally,  they kind of suck as friends to begin with (they have rarely been there for my fiancée when she has needed them, have no interest in either of our lives, and constantly flake when invited to group functions).  
My  fiancée thinks they should be on the list since she has known them for years, despite her obvious misgivings and feelings of betrayal. I think they should not be on the list at all, or to have anything to do with our wedding.

c0kq9r	2019-06-14 14:27:48		AITA for not wanting to give my sister the £1000 she gave me for tuition fees while she gets £7500 from the government	"Some background, i'm from the UK, from a low income household. University Tuition fees here are £9250 for the year. The government loans this out, but due to my previous 3 years of study, I wasn't entitled the loan last year, so had to pay it out of pocket. My younger sister is also at University, but was entitled to the loan, so it was fine for her.  
  
On top of this, due to being from a low income background, we both receive a £7500 maintenance loan for the year for spending. All of my £7500 went on my tuition fee, leaving a shortfall of £1750 to pay out of pocket, which I had to pay within a week to enroll. I could afford to pay £750 from my savings, and I asked to borrow £1000 from my sister knowing that she's receiving the maintenance loan, and said i'd pay back when I could afford to.  
  
Over the next few months, I was studying full time, and working a job at the same time, usually working until midnight to provide for myself. I also couldn't afford the train the first semester and rode my bike an hour to University most days. It was an extremely tough time and I saved whatever I could, after a few months I had the £1000 saved. I started thinking though, she's got a £7500 loan from the government and is stress-free, while I worked my ass off for the past few months for that money, and every penny i've saved is going to her. I also started thinking, that if the roles were reversed, i'd gladly give my sister my entire £7500 loan for her education, and wouldn't ask for it back, because I didn't earn that money.  
  
Anyway, this situation started back in September, and neither of us made a huge deal out of it. She would only occasionally ask when i'm going to give her the money back. Now, she's spent most of her £7500, and is constantly asking for the £1000 from me. She's losing her temper over it, and I eventually explained to her why I think she shouldn't ask for it and just let it slide, and if the roles were reversed I wouldn't ask anything of her.  
  
She's pissed off at me, my parents are pissed off at me and made a huge scene out of it today, and I still feel like i'm not in the wrong here.

First off, I'm on mobile and auto correct is out to get me.
Secondly, I'm sorry for writing a novel. TLDR at the bottom.
I have 4 sets of those magnetic balls. Neoballs? Neocube? 3 of the same size and one that was smaller in diameter. To put them back in the container you straighten them out and form them in a cube. My nephew (7yo) spent the night with me and ""squished"" all of the cubes into a multicolored lump. I didn’t really mind, and it was a bit my fault for leaving them at nephew height. My sister and I (who was visiting from out of state) were bored and decided to sort out the balls (haha) while watching a movie. We used to do that when we were younger and we both enjoyed the quiet monotony of it. 

We got them sorted and I started forming them into the cubes. I noticed the purple didn’t form the whole cube. Same story with the other two colors. I had a sneaking suspicion my nephew had something to do with it. Hes around 7 and has been known to take things that were not his. I sat him down and asked him if he know where the rest of the magnets were. He didn’t say anything, so I asked him if he took them. ""Yes, I took some. I'm sorry!"" He seems to think saying sorry will fix everything and make it ok with no consequences. I told him he hurt my feelings and lost my trust. I told him until he earned that trust back, I’m going to have to search his pockets every time he left my apartment. His mom was standing in the room when my nephew and I had the convo and she heard what I said about checking the pockets. She agreed. 
We went back to her apartment and I told him he needs to immediately go get the rest of the magnets and return them to me. I sat in his room and watched him for a bit (kid can hardly stay on task). Finally he came over and handed me two magnets. I was missing at least 30 to 40 magnets. I told him he better find the rest or he’s going to pay for them. I told him that they were around $20 each making them cost around 80 dollars. ""You’re going to pay for them if you can’t find them. Not your mom not Nana. You.” My nephew got a shocked look on his face and left to his room.
 A bit later I went to his room to say bye to him as I was heading home to find him crying on the floor. He jumped up and hugged me and told me he was sorry in between sobs. I told him it was ok, but he still needed to find them when he could. 
I feel really bad for making him cry like that, but I don’t want him to turn into a little klepto. I need to work on child proofing my place I know but that doesn’t excuse the theft. AITA?
Ps. I don’t really care about the magnets themselves. Like my heart isn’t breaking that their gone. But they were expensive ad one set was given to me by my sister about 7 years ago when I was going through a hard time giving them a bit of sentimental value.

TLDR. Nephew stole a handful of magnets from my apartment. I told him he would have to pay back the 80 bucks they cost if he couldn’t find them. Found him sobbing in his room.

I mentioned to her that the only dog I could really see myself doing was a miniature Australian Shepherd. Well, she found one and I said no because we already have a lot going on in the house. Sure enough, she came home with a dog despite me saying no. And she came home with it the day she got fired from her job.
We've had the dog for a few months and he has been problematic to say the least. Whenever he was in his cage he would bark constantly, to the point where other people in the neighborhood were emailing the HOA about it. He chews everything. Pillows, garbage, garbage cans, our son's stuffed animals, remotes, etc. He terrorizes the cats. The worst is that he constantly goes to the bathroom in the house to the point where our house continually smells like it. I run a studio home and I have clients coming in a lot and it bothers me that the house continually smells and he always jumps on the clients. With my wife being out of work for a few months, we haven't been able to afford to get the dog fixed or get him his shots or heartworm medicine.
Am I the asshole for asking her to take the dog to a shelter??"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0klbg	2019-06-14 14:15:55		WIBTA if I went to a Male Review” against my husband’s wishes?	"Some background . . . I’ve been happily married for 3 years. My husband is wonderful and has many friends.  In our nearly 8 years together, he’s been to countless bachelor parties all over the world with his friends. 

Some of these parties have included exotic dancers or similar services. For example, he’s getting ready to go to another bachelor party soon where the best man has planned for a “Legs and Eggs” service where two naked ladies come and cook breakfast for the group. 

In all our years together, I know my husband well enough to know that strippers and clubs are not his taste or scene. However, he is the “go with the flow” type and will go to a strip club or do the “legs and eggs” thing if the majority of the group wants to. In essence, he’s not going to be the one to spoil the fun and thus, he participates. 

I’ve never been bothered enough by this to cause any friction in our marriage because I know these things are never his idea. I’m not naive enough to think I’m the last naked woman he will or should be allowed to see (I have no problem with porn etc.) and I trust that he would never do anything truly inappropriate.

As I’ve gotten older, I’ve probably gotten slightly more insecure about these things (I get older and the dancers stay the same age, ha) and I once expressed my feelings that I’d prefer for him NOT to go to a strip clubs when on these trips, but I never said he COULDN’T. What he ultimately does is up to him. However, I did also explain that as an adult he can choose not to go to a strip club or participate in having naked girls around by leaving if he’s really not into it. But, it seems he cares more about what his friends think of him than his own feelings, but that’s on him to come to peace with. 

Ok, now to me. You guys have probably seen or at least heard of Magic Mike, right? Well, there is a traveling male review that is Magic Mike style that will be coming to my city later this year. Basically, it’s hot guys dancing and grinding on stage for 2 hrs. There is no nudity. 

I want to go. I think it would be fun in a cheesy (yet hot) way and I was even considering taking my 70 year old mother with me because I honestly think we would both enjoy it while laughing and blushing. I have never done anything like this. I fully admit, I will enjoy seeing the hot guys. 

I asked my husband how he would feel about it if I went and his response was “I wouldn’t like it.” 

For now, that’s all that was said. I didn’t bring up how lenient I’ve been in similar situations because I didn’t want to be petty. 

Truth is, I’m leaning toward going regardless of his feelings because I don’t see it as much different than some of the bachelor party stuff. WIBTA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0ki0m	2019-06-14 14:07:27		AITA, or is my husband?	"Little backstory...

My husband and I are in our mid-thirties and we have three children. I used to work full time and my mom would watch the kids a couple times a week until my husband got home. After my third, I went part time and now work afternoons so my mom will usually pick the kids up from school and watch them until my husband gets home around 3:45pm. She has never wanted to be paid (she watches my brothers kids sometimes too). My husband agrees that we are so lucky to have her because she is a huge help.

So here's the story...We want to take the kids to Beaches Resort Turks and Caicos next year. Our room for a family of 5 would cost around $12,000. We had talked about asking my mom if she wanted to come which would bring the price up to $12,500 for 6 people. I think that she should only have to pay the extra $500. My husband thinks that she should pay 1/6th of the cost. So who is the a hole? P.S. I know that some of you should say that we should pay the $500 given how much she does for us and you're probably right but I don't think she would feel comfortable with that."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

&#x200B;

Edit:

I've seen the comments that have been left, and I can agree with a lot of them. I do, however, want to add some more details as well as an example onto this post to help with vagueness.

&#x200B;

Example:

This past week I returned from a trip where I was across the country visiting my older brothers, and upon arriving home, I was immediately greeted with them yelling at me about how I didn't tell them whether I was coming home AM or PM, and in their yelling, they called me names, told me about how I was a disappointment, and how I don't deserve anything that I have. Again, this was because I didn't specify if I was returning at 8AM or 8PM.

&#x200B;

Some of the comments point out that they probably feed me, clothe me, and do other things for me, and while some parts of it are true, some are not.

Yes, they do house me and they sometimes will feed me. However, at the same time, I pay for my own expenses, including my phone plan, all my purchases, I've purchased my own car ($800), put gas in it and everything, and pay for the car insurance as well. I am able to do this because I work two jobs, and am starting a third with summer break from school. Yes, I am 17, but I feel like some of these comments are playing that off as if I don't do anything for myself and am reliant on them for everything.

&#x200B;

Another example: 

I recently bought some new earbuds, and upon seeing them, my father screamed at me, and accused me of stealing money from his wallet to pay for the earbuds. Why I would ever want to steal from him, I am not sure, as I stated above, I have my own income."	Not enough info	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0kbe3	2019-06-14 13:50:10	bridbrad	AITA for going to a wedding that I know the bride does not like me?	To understand the situation in its entirety I need to give some background info. I (female) am very good friends with the groom. Ive been hanging out with his sister since we were 8 y/o and naturally became close friends with him. My freshman year of high-school we went to homecoming together and kissed at the football game but it never progressed into anything more serious, as he is a brother to me. Years later he starts dating his future fiance, the bride who doesnt quite like me. Reason being is that sometime in the beginning of their relationship I invited the groom, to a party where he ended up sleeping with another girl/cheating on his girlfriend. I told my close friends about the cheating but I didnt tell his girlfriend myself which she later found out through mutual friends. Now they’re wedding is set for the end of the month and she says she doesnt trust me (because i allowed the cheating to happen) and doesn’t like her fiance and I to hang out together. The groom has specifically invited me to the wedding and says he wants me there but I feel weird about going knowing i might make the bride uncomfortable. I wouldnt want someone to crash my wedding, but I also think she’s being unfair. Between our history in highschool and the incident with his cheating I cant decide if I should RSVP or not.

c0kagb	2019-06-14 13:47:33	throwawayacc12347	WIBTA for leaving the cleaning invoice for my old roomies?	"So in last December, I moved out cause my roommates were being petty after a fight and decided to go against our agreement of being civil since we had the rest of the lease. In the end of January, I got a ""Subleaser"" who was signed on as a fourth tenant. The two roommates were fine with this arrangement. 

So a few months later, a coworker decided to gossip with me about T from Sarah. Allegedly, she had pet rats  in the closet and they smelled bad. He also said that they ended up hating her for various reasons and so on. At this point, I cut him off cause I didnt want to talk/ gossip about Sarah cause it wasn't professional and I didn't want anything to do with her in a personal manner. 

Now, we get our security deposit back and  there is a $250 cleaning invoice fee. I email the rental company and they explain part is the first room where T stayed, has sunflower seeds and hair in the closet. Then they go into how the bathroom wasn't cleaned with having to wipe the surfaces down, the mirror, fixtures, ect. Then, they said the floor had clearly not been swept or mopped, the oven had not been cleaned, there were crumbs on the kitchen counters and the inside of the fridge was also messy and needed to be recleaned. They also said that a cleaning walk through needed to be scheduled which never was.  I don't have access to that part of the portal to do this part. 

I understand that we are all technically jointly or severally liable, but I don't feel like I should have to split it with them because if the rat part is true, they should have asked her to get rid of them or reported her to the rental company. They also can sue her for negligence and ask for idemnification. 

Then, as for the cleaning part, I know Jack doesn't like to clean which meant Sarah probably was gonna have to do it all and then decided to either do a quick shitty job or not at all. Additionally, I havent lived there in months, didn't create the mess and I don't have a way to access the apartment anymore ( need two keys) and if they wanted my help, they should have asked/ texted which I actually would have. 
Although, jack hold grudges and starts fights with me everytime he sees me so being in the same apartment would have started something or another. 

So WIBTA if I just let them handle that entire bill?

Update: I asked them about it and they said they have no idea as they cleaned for two days straight and they know that rental companies hire cleaners even if it's clean.  And that ""T said she'd be back to clean her room but I guess she didn't?""

I called the cleaning company about specifics and they said the had to spray and clean the stove three times, and that the floor had not been mopped due to residues on the floors."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c0kaeh	2019-06-14 13:47:24	imjustdumbguys	AITA for calling my step mom ‘Karen’ after the meme?	"I’m a 15 year old dude and I think I’m pretty funny but I’m probably about to get ripped a new asshole but here goes. 

I am probably what you’d call white trash but my best friend in the whole world is black and his name is Chimp. Our moms have been best friends before we were even born and they are still best friends today and everyone in Chimps family calls him Chimp. Now I don’t know why they call him Chimp but his real name is Devon but NO ONE who is not black apart from me and my mom and my little sister are allowed to call a Chimp by his nickname, but no one in his family EVER calls him Devon, I hope that’s not confusing. 

My dad married this woman who is basically a weird ex military wife last year even though he only met her last year too but white trash will do white trash stuff so it’s not exactly uncommon around here I guess. 

Whenever Chimp is with me kickin it at my dads place she will be so weird around him and tell my dad that he’s a bad influence on me etc. She tells him not to use certain words even if they aren’t cuss words, now Chimps mom is a nurse (so is my mom) so growing up they’d babysit both us kids for whoever had the night shift but because we are older now they do the night shift together some days and me and Chimp get to stay at my moms alone or his moms alone depending on who’s paid the electricity bill lol because both our grandmas live close by. My stepmom has started telling my dad I’m ‘not allowed to do it anymore’ and it’s pissing me off. She just doesn’t want me to be friends with Chimp but she has no reason for it other than RACE. 

I’be started calling her Karen cuz she’s a Karen let’s face it and she deserves to be called that. Her RL name is actually Katie which makes it even funnier and I made sure I showed her the memes and stuff because I hate her racist ignorant ass comments. She got really offended and told me I was being an ass. Chimp is my brother and he’s the most big hearted kid in the world. I’ll always defend him. 

She keeps yelling at me to stop calling her it and my dad who USED to be close with me keeps asking me to stop but I ain’t gonna stop until she figures out to watch her mouth about my friend.

c0k9d2	2019-06-14 13:44:35	andrewMacG	AITA for standing in the street to block someone trying to pass a school bus with its flashing lights on?	"Hello fellow assholes,

Every morning I take my kids to the bus stop for the oldest to hop on and go to Kindergarten. The bus stops on a busy one-lane-each-way road, and picks up 3 kids, 2 of whom cross the street when it stops. This stop is also at a T-intersection, with the bus taking a straight through path.

We've had troubles with people blowing through the school bus' stop sign, or racing past it with the lights on before the sign is out. People are just really impatient to get by. I think I get it, why wait an extra minute if you don't have to?

This morning, an impatient driver stopped at the butt end of the T to turn right, and I am standing at the corner he is taking. The bus is stopped and the kids and one parent are crossing. After the kids disappear from sight, this driver inches forward to start his right hand turn, right through the school bus's stop sign.

So I stepped out onto the street and stood there. Not even one metre ahead of him from where he is advancing, and I waited for my fellow parent to cross back to the curb and then some words were exchanged. The choice of my words were neutral and matter-of-fact, ""IT'S A SCHOOL BUS STOP"" but it was yelled pretty damn loud, and in front of my two younger children.

If there is a fire somewhere or an emergency this guy has to get to, he could just drop his window and say literally anything but there was no indication that he was anything more than opportunistic and impatient.

I blocked the traffic, intentionally. But I also don't take any punches when it comes to kids; that space is supposed to be safe for them to use.

So guys, am I the asshole here?

"It has been my lifelong dream to travel to Japan, since I have never had the money nor the opportunity to do so. Two months ago a friend of mine contacted me to do some business with a Japanese company and last week I was able to come to Japan.

I'm at Japan now, but before I came here, I obviously told my friends, coworkers and family... They got excited about it and I was filled with joy... But something happened... people started to ask for souvenirs; some of them even for very specific things like ""Can you bring me a specific Pokemon figurine?"" Or ""Can you get me a Godzilla figurine?"" Some of them through my wife... At first it was not that bad, but I ended up making a list because so many people were asking for things and I was afraid I was going to forget them... Some of them offered to pay me (once they got what they asked me for) but I feel awful for sacrificing a part of my trip to get them what they asked for, but then I feel more awful for not wanting to give anything. 

I spent a lot of money on souvenirs and favors, I also bought things for people that didn't asked me for anything because it wouldn't been fair...

I was here for a week, I had a day off (to be a tourist and not work on the project I came to do), tomorrow I go back to my country...I already bought everything on the list...

c0k6th	2019-06-14 13:37:42	CleverGirl_88	AITA for asking my bf to question his conservative religious parents?	"Hey everyone. Thanks for reading. 

My bf and I have been friends for over a year, sleeping together casually since 10/2018 and officially got serious/committed about 4 months ago. I love him a crazy amount and I’m serious about making it work long term with him. I should say that I’m 31 and he’s 29; I live in and own my own home, but due to some past health issues and general unfortunate life circumstances, he’s still at home with both parents. 

He’s been to my parents’ place many times for dinner, game nights etc. My parents never batted an eye when I told them he was staying with me in their guest room. And when he stays the night at my house, he always sleeps next to me in my bedroom. 

But according to him, if I were to attempt sleeping next to him at his place, his parents would, to quote him, “blow a head gasket.” 

This just feels really unfair and like a double standard to me. It makes me feel like his dirty little secret. 

Both his parents are very devout Christians (he is as well) and they didn’t have sex until marriage; they’ve been together ever since, so apparently they’re staunchly against unmarried couples sleeping together. Even though my bf willingly does so with me literally everywhere else but at his home. 

He doesn’t want to even attempt to open a constructive dialogue with them about this. I don’t think that’s right. It really bothers me, but he’s insisting it’s just best to leave it alone to keep the peace. 

Should I respect his parents’ boundaries or stick up for myself? Am I the asshole for asking that he stand up to them?

Pertinent edits:

—His parents do not know we have slept together and according to him, it would cause their opinion of both me and him to lower. Hence why I feel like a dirty secret. 

—I am under no illusions that I’ll change their minds. But I would hope a mature dialogue could be had about the premarital sex subject that wouldn’t result in name calling or disastrous behavior"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c0k4he	2019-06-14 13:31:10	chewybacs	AITA in this fight about utilities	"I live in a place with 5 people at school. Just to make it easier, their names are Annie, Madison, Talia and Brooke. We’ve been living together for 2 years and it’s currently summer. I am home and not living in the apartment. I still pay rent and internet but recently there was a fight about utilities. 

This summer, Annie has a class and is at the house w her boyfriend (he has an internship in the area) until schools back. Madison will also be at the house full time and Talia pops in every once in a while. Meanwhile, Brooke and I won’t even step foot in the place until school. 

We have a group chat and I asked if we could divide utilities for who’s living there for the summer. The prior summer Talia and Madison were there full time and Annie, Brooke and I were never in the house. It wasn’t discussed then because I didn’t want to step on toes but something just really irked me now (prob bc $) and I thought it was unfair so I brought it up (Random but relevant & you’ll see why- Annie, brooke and I had conversation about it the prior summer and agreed it should be divided). 

I send a text about the idea of splitting the bill proportionally and Annie is instantly upset. She brings up how we didn’t divide it last summer, her mother pays for her bills and that she refuses to pay more than we do now (our utilities arent expensive and especially in the summer it’s a lot  cheaper). We try to compromise and offer to change the split but she still isn’t having it and continually refused to accept. She then says ‘if it’s going to be like the she wants to be reimbursed for last summer when she was never there’. We do the math and give the numbers and she STILL refuses to accept. She flatly says ‘no I’m not okay with this. You’ll be hearing from my parents’ 

At this point I’m so frustrated and outburst that this makes me want to move out and it’s her fault and it’s already ruined my year (I know it’s messed up & owned up to it). I state how it’s unfair that I won’t be in the house until September and that I don’t want to pay for her electric and showers. The debate continues and she is still is rejecting and eventually we all just stop responding and the fights ends. 

The problem is eventually resolved and she compromised however, instead of letting the whole house know, she only texts Talia that her parents will pay (bc she takes care of the bills) and leaves it at that. I still haven’t spoken to her since, however from conversations with my other friends Annie is was saying how “what I said made her cry” and that “she felt like nobody would listen to or respect her.” She also stated that “this was her moms money and she can’t just say yes without her approval”

Annie is the girl to hold grudges and never apologize. I don’t want to apologize because i think she was being irrational after we continuously made efforts to compromise. It also makes me angry that she is playing victim. Also her BOYFRIEND is living there. He isn’t paying rent or contributing to the bill. I wanted to bring that up but too much has happened."

I tried to message her one night after my daughter went to bed it’s my only free time 
So decided to tell me “she doesn’t reply to guys” at night.
Even though that’s never been an issue ever before And that she knows tons of girls who don’t appreciate being messaged like that .

Am I the asshole for taking this in a hurtful way and kinda snapping at her since I thought we were close friends and it’s never been an issue before 
And I basically got the reply “if a girl says don’t message her at night then don’t”

EDIT : I should of clarified the reason I messaged her late at night was to make sure to see if she still needed a ride to work today (something she asked me for ) cause if I was I needed to set my alarm earlier than normal to accommodate

It’s more just a change in her behaviour Like this was never an issue over the last however many years she would message me late at night sometimes midnight or later , even within the last couple months she’s has

c0jw1b	2019-06-14 13:07:49		AITA for saying I'll work for free and then quitting?	"I have a modest writing background, and someone local was interested in creating a new streaming show. They wanted a script writer, and the idea sounded really interesting to me. I met up with them at a local coffee shop, and right from the get-go it was awkward. I tried to buy myself a coffee, but the guy insisted on paying, and I finally relented. 

He talked about the show, we went back and forth on the ideas, and it actually sounded promising. But then he hit me with a question I wasn't expecting, and asked what kind of money I was looking for. I guess I should have expected it, but for some reason I just thought we were gonna discuss the show. Anyways, I'm not a confident person, and can't do salary negotiations. So I just said I'd do it for free. 

A few days after the meeting, I wrote him and said I'd no longer be able to do the show due to time constraints. Which was basically true because I needed to devote the time to paying work. If he had just offered me a fair rate, I likely would have agreed and that would have been the end of it. But asking me to set a value on myself--can't do it.

In any case, I may be an asshole, but I'd rather be an asshole who's getting paid than a chump doing a ton of work for free."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0juiu	2019-06-14 13:03:32		AITA for expecting my boyfriend to help with the housework?	"I’m (21F) and I’ve been with (25M) for almost 2 years. For the past year (ish) we’ve lived together. We know that we moved in quickly but that’s just how it’s been. 

The issue I’m having is that even before I fully moved in he never cleaned. He was happy living in a mess, he never washed dishes etc. Since moving in he has not cleaned anything. The flat is a tip the majority of the time especially because I’m a full time student nurse so I do 12 hour shifts and had a part time job on top, meaning that some weeks I was working up to 65-70 hours a week as well as doing coursework. I’ve obviously had to neglect the cleaning to prioritise my education and to be honest I’m completely exhausted. 

We’ve both got a history of mental health, with me stopping medication for the past 6 months but due to stress (job hunting and academic) I’m going to have to go back on them. He’s just started treatment with antidepressants since a year ago his maternal figure in his life died and he has been depressed but it took a wake up call about a month ago to make him realise he needs help. 

He also bought a hamster a year ago and he barely looks after it. I’m always the one changing it’s cage and feeding and watering it. I’ve taken to now demanding he feed and water it because I want to prove a point. I also let all the housework pile up to see if it will hit a point that he decides to clean but he doesn’t. He works a 8-5 job 5 days a week and just sits and watches tv or plays video games. 

I’ve no issue with him relaxing but I’m always expected to cook as well which is fine just now because I’ve had holidays for 3 weeks but when I’m not we result in eating takeaways or if I say it’s your night to sort dinner out we always end up with a takeaway. We’ve both put on weight with this and we spend so much money doing this as well. He pays all the bills and I know I get a good deal because once I’m working full time I’ll be paying half but he’s been nice and let’s me live rent free but at the same time he hasn’t bought any furniture for the flat it’s all hand me downs, apart from his office where is new monitors and PCs because he likes gaming. Since we’ve been together he’s bought a TV because he broke the other one. I’m usually the one to buy the basics (and I don’t get paid much to spend my money on this either) he lately bought some stuff for the kitchen which I’m grateful for but we want a new bed and I’ll be expected to buy that. 

I’ve had time off and I keep getting told how lazy I am when he comes home because I’ve not cleaned but I just feel like he doesn’t even help. When he’s at home he just watches me do it. I feel like his mother. He won’t buy himself new clothes because he doesn’t see the point so I’ve got to feed, clothe and clean for him. I just feel like it’s not fair at all especially when I work more than him. 

Am I the asshole for just wanting a bit of help? I just feel so defeated with my mental health being low and he just doesn’t seem to help me."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0juhr	2019-06-14 13:03:27	meme_teen	AITA for asking a customer service guy at a hospital about what would happen if people showed up without ID?	" allegal immigrant shows up at a hospital- we agreed that it seems like an undocumented woman in labor for instance would be able to have a baby at a hospital, yet such a woman would not have insurance, and it would be potentially very difficult for the hospital to go after her for the money afterwards, since her job presumably isn't documented either.

I asked my mom if I could ask the medical tech guy. She said no, that it's not the tech's job to answer random questions. So as the hospital was releasing me, my mom went to the restroom and I went to the ""financial services"" section of the hospital where they work out deals with people who can't pay. I asked the customer service guy what would happen if people showed up with serious medical issues (say, in labor) without ID. He was sort of confused by this and said he didn't know, but that they would probably try to get a SSN to see if they were a criminal or something.

Anyway, weird answer, because it implies we were maybe wrong that an undocumented women could go into labor there.

Anyway I told my mom about this and she got upset- she said that that guy wasn't expecting to take random questions from a non customer, and that I wouldn't appreciate it if she started barging into my room and asking me random questions (I live at home; gap year before law school). She also said that for all he knew, I could have been a nutjob, and that I was in any case distracting him from his work.

I may be an asshole for these reasons. I had another idea, also. It's possible the hospital is performing medical services for undocumented immigrants but that the employees don't want to admit it to randos like me, for fear we will snitch. So by asking him about it, I spooked him, making me an asshole.

Edit: some commenters think I'm anti-immigrant, but I'm more interested in how the financial services guy talked tricky about something the hospital was obligated to do. I'm not against this obligation, I'm against the tricky language (which I think he was in some way ordered to have!). I'm just sorry to have forced him to be tricky with me- I'm sure he didn't enjoy it, but I was half-expecting him to be as candid as you all have been."	Not enough info	0	0	50.0	112.0	0.0	0.0

No one knows about this and I don't like talking about it, but when it came to light of everyone's plans while we're out I mentioned that I probably won't be going, the person whose leaving is a nice person and I want to see her off but I really don't feel comfortable being out and around everyone while they're high.

I don't care what everyone else is doing and I know and don't want to tell people what they can and can't do around me so when I said i probably won't go they all started kicking off and having a go, a few even throwing out a few insults.

c0jtwz	2019-06-14 13:01:53	HunterRye	AITA for kissing a girl who (kind of) called my friend a racial slur?	"Something finally happened that I can post here. On mobile, and bad at typing, so forgive any mistakes. Anyways, here goes. TL:DR at bottom, if this is long enough. Anyways, here goes.

So, my friend, Sarah (fake names, duh), used to be friends with another girl, Rebecca. They got into an argument and one of Rebecca's friends called Sarah a spic. Rebecca knew what was being said, but neither typed nor sent the racial slur. 

The other day, Rebecca informed me that one thing on her bucket list was to kiss me, as I've been her friend for a long time. It was a bit weird, but I try not to judge. This girl saved my life a bit back, so I felt as though I owed her, and I kissed her, more as a favor than anything else. It wasn't romantic in any way, and it was just a quick peck on the lips, not heavy making out of anything. 

I told Sarah about it, because I didn't want her to hear it from somebody else. She's really pissed off at me about it and feels like I wronged her (Sarah) by kissing someone who was present to  her being called a racial slur. I, however, don't think I am, because it didn't really mean much to me, it was just helping out a friend in my eyes. I was not at any point trying to excuse what Rebecca knew was being to Sarah. Of the few people I've brought it up to, none of them think ITA. 

TL:DR - I kissed a girl who was privy to my friend being called a racial slur because it was on the girls bucket list. Friend thinks ITA, but others I have talked to do not. 

So, dear Reddit. AITA?

Edited for clarity, and to highlight a point:
 Rebecca did not directly call her the slur. One of her friends typed and sent it, Rebecca just knew what was happening."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	62.0	40.0	0.0	0.0

(i'm a cyclist, soon to be motorcyclist) and i don't want to be killed by an idiot on their phone. and after enough pestering he was like fine whatever i won't (i know this is bullshit but i warned him) he also told me some other guy in our class texts and drives, i talk to him and he says ""i don't the other guy does (referring to the first guy)"" i couldn't be bothered anymore and gave up.

so today, going through snapchat stories, i see second guy the one who ""doesn't do it"" has recorded himself stuck in traffic in the driver's seat, which wouldn't really be enough proof (it would be a tough one to prove) until he turns the camera to the back to show the cars infront. and for a few frames he shows his RPM gauge, which shows the engine is on.

Time and time again growing up, he would say something really hurtful reminding me of just how sexist really is (i.e. calling me a slut in 6th grade because a boy from my class called me to go over homework...) 

About a decade ago I joined the Air Force and like an idiot I married a guy I barely knew (the marriage lasted all of 6 months). When my father found out that I had eloped with a Black man (oh yeah, my dad is also racist), he called me and told me that he couldn't believe I married a n****r and that he was going to fly out to the base I was stationed at and kill me. Well, I immediately notified the authorities and didn't talk to my dad again.

A few years back, I arranged a visit to my Aunt and Uncle (on my father's side) for the first time in years. When I arrived at the airport, my Uncle was there to pick me up... With my dad. Obviously I was livid, but I know my Uncle probably invited him hoping we'd make amends. Well of course the very first conversation we had was about how he doesn't understand why I joined the Air Force instead of finishing my degree. For the first time ever I was firm with him and told him to cut the shit, that I was here on vacation and wanted to enjoy my time with family and if he mouthed off to me again I was going to leave and stay at a hotel. He wasn't happy about it, but he stopped. After that visit, he started emailing me with small talk on and off.

Last year, I married a wonderful man and was so unbelievably excited to introduce him to my family. I arranged another visit to my Aunt and Uncle... And told them I'd be bringing my husband by just to introduce him but that he'd be staying with his family separately since they live nearby. A week before the trip, my Aunt called me to tell me my dad was coming yet again and that she doesn't think it would be a good idea to bring my husband because it would upset my dad. I was of course upset about this, but I still wanted to visit and spend time with them and my cousins... So I respected her wishes. I told my Uncle that my dad surprising me like this wasn't ok, and he was caught off guard. My dad had made it sound to him like I knew he'd be there. 

After that visit, I emailed my dad telling him that trying to make things right with me was pointless and that it's too late. I told him about my husband and how it's because of him that I didn't bring him to meet my Aunt and Uncle. He emailed me back apologizing for everything he's done wrong and asked if I'd let him make it up to me. I told him absolutely not, that I've gone a decade of my life without a verbally abusive father and I've been doing really well without him. I told him that he's as good as dead to me. I then told him to never contact me again. I know those are really harsh words and I said them out of anger... But it was exactly how I felt and still feel.

Since the start of the year they've been requesting a certain amount of rent on top of the food/bills I already contribute to, which adds significant strain on me financially.

"So we have a DND large role-playing group on discord, it's not one that's a therapy or a support group.

People have threatened to leave over it because it limits their dialogue and if they don't interact with said character and comfort then they're called 'homophobic, transphobic or agreeing with abuse."" That's when people started to leave the chat. This isn't a one time thing, it's happening consistently for months now.

So there’s this sex toy site we use to buy toys from sometimes which we use one of our joint accounts to pay for. The site has a unique name it appears as on bills mainly for discretion. My husband was sorting out his own personal bills and out of plain curiosity and interest I just looked at one of the slips and noticed that site was on the bill from a while back. It seemed weird that it was on there as we always use our joint account for that stuff. So I did a bit of snooping around the house looking for what it could have been and I found a silicone limp penis (almost like a dildo but limp). When I cross referenced this with the site it turns out to be a toy that guys can wear in their pants to make them seem ‘bigger’. So I confronted him about this and he was really embarrassed.

"One of my friends has been on a dry spell recently, let’s call him Mick. Mick has contracted both genital and oral herpes from an unfortunate drunk hook up years ago. 

He was upset afterwards that the girl didn’t warn him beforehand - which I believe is relevant for the story. 

He’s been wanting to get back into dating and told me that women tend to unmatch him immediately when he mentions his STDs. It’s understandably frustrating, but I felt it’s good on him for being upfront about it. 

That changed with his last tinder encounter. Mick told me she’s a great girl - pretty, funny, witty. He was *really* excited about going on a date with her and I assumed he had told her about his herpes situation (as he with other girls before). 

We arranged a double date, Mick and Tinder Girl, as well as my partner and I. Things went well in the beginning, we were having a great time and I could definitely feel the chemistry between the two. 

However, here’s where I might have been an asshole: Mick and my partner went outside for a cigarette, so Tinder Girl and I were the only ones at our table. We ended up talking about Mick, and I mentioned how excited he had been about the date, especially since he hadn’t exactly been lucky on tinder so far. She couldn’t see why, since he was great guy and she enjoyed the date so far. 

Mind you, we’ve had a few drinks at this point and I told her that he’s had a lot of girls unmatch him due to his ‘situation’. She was confused and asked me what I meant, so I told her that I meant his herpes. 

She got upset and told me that he hadn’t told her, despite her specifically asking about STDs. Apparently, Mick claimed to be entirely clean. 

She thanked me and stormed out, sending Mick an angry message and later blocking him.

Mick said I ruined his chances of scoring that night and is *really* upset with me. He said it was not my place to say anything and I should’ve given him the chance to tell her - but honestly I don’t think he would’ve (given that he specifically lied about it on tinder when she asked). I feel bad, at the same time I think she deserved to know beforehand. 

I genuinely wish for Mick to have successful dates, but not through being deceitful. It wasn’t on purpose, I assumed he had told her prior to this - but maybe I do suck for even bringing it up?

Although I feel deepest symphaty for her situation I don't really want to be donor. I don't wanna sound like selfish brat but I need to think about my future. 

Some of you might think that it is just the test and I might not be suitable match but  if would turn I am her match i would still refuse due to health  complication that this could bring.

I never had good relationship with her anyway. She used to be racist to me and was harassing me in early staged of relationship with her brother. Now we are on civil terms but I never forgot about past.

Am I the asshole here?

So she decides to say that im going to pay rent because im arguing with her that shes saying shes paying me to look after the dog, logically im not getting paid im just not paying rent for the fortnight (i pay fortnightly rent cause i get paid fortnightly) and so i tell her im not getting paid that im only not having to pay the rent because im looking after the dog.

Tl;Dr My mother is asking me to look after the dog for the weekend while they are away and she's saying she's paying me to do so but she's not i just don't have to pay rent for the fortnight and she's got turbo mad at me.

I went to college to study graphic design and I am happily working at an editorial company. My friend is a product engineer and is currently studying a postgrad in graphic design.

&#x200B;

Recently, my friend got offered to do a packaging project for one of her teachers, it'd be a ridiculous amount of money for two weeks. I know that i should be happy for her but I am actually quite angry (?). I am very lucky to be employed but, many of my friends, who studied the degree with me, are unemployed or not working as designers since it's not that easy to find a job. I even have a friend who's currently studying a master's degree in packaging design who cannot find a job.

Another thing that bugs me is that she's not experienced. She asks me about basic things every single day. And I know it's not her fault, but she's been studying graphic design for 7 months, how could she?

c0j85x	2019-06-14 11:55:40	firesirene	WIBTA if I distance myself from my friend group because I feel like they are treating me as less important?	"So, I'm (19F) currently in my second semester of Uni in a city that is near the city I was born in. At the beginning of the first semester I was alone at Uni. Within the first week, I met many amazing people and a friend group of 9 people formed itself, without anyone knowing the other ones before that. I was completely taken aback with how fast I managed to connect with these guys, as we almost all have the same taste in books, movies, shows and music, and after some time it surfaced that we all had dealt with a lot of hurting stuff in the past. 

I'm not going to go into detail, but every 'member' of our friend group had dealt with emotional and/or physical abuse in their life till now, especially from parents and significant others, and many of us have mental illnesses that add to the fact. Out of the 9 of us 4 are seeing a therapist because of their issues. It may also be of note that all of us are queer, except the one guy in our group, who is straight.

When we discovered this, sadly, connecting feature of us, I was unimaginably glad to finally have people I can talk with about it, who understand what I've been through. Especially our group chat is a place where we often talk lightly and make fun of our trauma, as a way of dealing with it and accepting it as part of our lives. 

I've never made a huge deal about my past, I can talk about it without feeling fear or sadness, but I also acknowledge the fact that I had to endure years of damaged self-image/worth to have become the person I am now, and yes, sometimes it still creeps through, but I learned how to focus on the positive.

Now recently I had noticed that the group seems to splinter off into small 'couples' or 'triples' of people who do stuff outside of Uni together. I always try to position myself as a good friend to all people of friend groups, hanging out with them whenever I can, and being very open about meeting up.

I realized that none of them seemed to make an effort as much as I did when it came to their friendships with me (a position I have been in in every friend group I've ever been in), which almost sent me spiraling down into the mindset I had four years ago, which is that I am worthless and I should be glad when people so much as acknowledge my existence sometimes. 

I've been playing with the idea of distancing myself from this friend group for about a week now, knowing that I'd be pretty much lonely at Uni then and that if they'd find out they'd probably cut all connection with me completely or I wouldn't hear the end of it about how much they actually do care about me and how upset they are that I even think of them not caring. 
(They also made some joking remarks about me not fitting into the group because of me not having ""daddy issues"")

c0j77d	2019-06-14 11:52:30	pinkesthannah	AITA for being the only one upset that my sisters friend got with our brother over our current vacation?	"This week my sister and our friends (more so my sisters friends) are down visiting my two brothers in Florida. The friend who’s trying to get with my brother (let’s call her Anne) is 22, and my brother (let’s call him John) is 21. I’m eighteen (F) and my sister is sixteen (she has older friends). My brother visited home two weeks ago and that’s when their “fling” began- my brother kissed Anne.

Anyhow, we’re down here now in Florida, and have been here two days. All of us were sleeping on the couch tonight, my sister, Anne, other friend, and me- and sometime past midnight, Anne goes into my brothers room. The moment she went in there I felt as though she’s half my friend, and I feel subtle betrayal by brother as well. They’ve seen each other in person but maybe 6 days in total all together, and now Anne is risking her only close friendships for an irresponsible fling with her friends brother. To me, it just shows how little Anne cares about her friendship with my sister. They're really close, and have been for over a year.

I talked with her about a week before we came (before she’d bought her ticket), for a long time, urging that she probably not even come as it could make mine and my sisters only vacation together in a long while unnecessarily complicated. I told her if she really likes my brother even though it wouldn’t be ideal, that she should take it slow, as she was already in some kind of a relationship the day John (brother) kissed her. I told her it would put an awkward air about everyone if they got together while we were here. She totally agreed with everything I said- and told me that she wouldn’t go, saying that'd be best because if she were to go go, she’d inevitably get with my brother (she literally said this- she said, if I go, I will get with your brother, as though her care for her friendships is dramatically lower than her level of self control). So I said, don’t go. I told her over and over, bluntly and respectively. But the next day, she bought the ticket. My sister would never tell her she couldn't come.

Another reason that this is a tricky situation, minus from the obvious, is that she has already been with my OTHER brother (to some extent) less than a year ago. My other brother, (let’s call him) Will, and John live together. Double violation! My sister thinks I’m over reacting about it all. I this point, I'm questioning whether I even have warrant to feel upset. I now don't know how I'm to act around them. I’m upset with my friend and my brother, honestly, but I don’t want to show that as I don’t want to ruin the rest of our time here together.

Final clarification: I understand most people would be upset about this, I more so just don't know how to handle it, and don't know who's really the worst asshole in this situation."	Asshole	0	0	26.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

c0j6r7	2019-06-14 11:50:59	awaythrowww754	AITA(Not serious) for jokingly saying my friends lazy because they don't want to bother spending 1+ hour on the public transport to get to the beach?	"So, I want to preface this by saying that it was not a serious fight but I'm just curious. We usually are pretty direct with each other and there are no misunderstandings. I am not mad at them but they were pissed at me for an hour or so and they thought I was in the wrong.

We were just 4 people chatting on the group chat A,B and C. A and B have both grown up near the sea, meaning it doesn't take them more than 10 minutes to get to the beach. Me and C on the other side have grown up in the populated city and if you want to reach the nice and clean beaches you have to be on public transport for at least one hour. 

So I was just saying to the group chat, that now that it's getting hot we should go to the beach sometime. A and B were like ""No that's too far, there's no reason even to bother because we have gotten used to be travelling only for 10 minutes not 1 hour"". I was like ""Come on just for once,that doesn't make sense"".

They insisted on not wanting to come and we had a casual conversation about it. At some point I curiously say ""I mean not to wanting to spend 1 hour in the bus shows a little bit of laziness don't you think?""

They tell me that they find no meaning in it, and I agree(but I show my agreement with a joke cause I thought it was a light conversation and nothing serious)

So all of a sudden A and B stop talking and I confront them about it. They tell me that they didn't like that I characterised them as lazy, and that was their only problem with me.

Important to say that C was supporting me and was calling them lazy too but they have a little beef with C going on and maybe that helped with their pissing off.

 So there's that.


I'm not gonna force them to come, everyone makes their choices and I didn't really mean to call them lazy. 


We are good now but I'm just wondering why they took it so bad since we are usually pretty chill and open to insults with each other

TL;DR: Called my friends lazy because they have gotten used to needing only 10 minutes on commute to get to the beach and don't want to bother commuting for 1+ hour

I really don’t feel comfortable using something from the bin to wash my face so I asked her again to pay for a new one. She got angry with me and claimed she had “done enough already”. I pointed out her poor apology and asked if she even knew she’d done anything wrong – I have to admit my tone was snappy because at this point I was really annoyed.

I am now going through that awkward period where I run into situations where I have to disclose friends that we are no longer together.  I take responsibility for what happened and whenever I discuss the events with close friends and family, I do not shy away from the truth. I want it to be clear that I know it is my fault, and I regret it a lot. Her family also knows what happened by her disclosure, in case that matters.

c0j2cs	2019-06-14 11:37:01	AdditionalTwo0	AITA for not wanting to deal with my mothers relationship issues anymore?	"Hello Everyone,

I (22M) have been living with my mom (45) since my mom and dad broke up. She raised me as a single mom, but i have a good relationship with my Father and he Always supported me. Since the time, when they broke up (i was about 6 years old) she stumbled from one troubled relationship into the next. Always ""using"" me for comfort, when something in her relationship went wrong and i felt responsible for her as a teenager. My mother has lots of psychological issues herself. Problaly some kind of relationship-attachment disorder and an overall anxiety disorder. She is already in psychotherapy, but it is not helping. Long Story short: she is not able to leave relationships that are toxic and isn´t able to live by herself/alone forcing herself into the next relationship with the next messed up guy.

Her recent relationship (About 10 years now) is with a psychologically ill man, who is very narcisstic, only cares about himself, runs away for days sometimes weeks without notice, without any clue where he is going and what he is doing. During These periods my mother is devasted, crying most of the time and has really bad mood in general (almost depression like states) and she always wants me to comfort her in this time. An when the guy comes back....nothing changes. she is mad at him for a short period of time and then all is whoopsy daisy till the next time. 

The Point is, i really can´t do this anymore. it is stressing me out a lot and i don´t want to deal with this anymore like i have the last 14/15 years. So this time, i told her, that i had enough of her shit and her relationship troubles and that i want her to leave me out of it. That did not went well, as expected. She told me, that i have grown emotionally cold and distant to her (which i have, i just can´t handle it anymore), that she needs someone to be there for here, to comfort her. I get that, i really want to help, but not in this way anymore. Nothing will change from it. It´s just perpetuating the cycle.  I told her exactly that and she understands, but also told me, that she is not able to leave this relationship. It will mentally break her, because of the anxiety and attachment issues mentioned above and that is pressuring me a lot to just continue how it has been. She is not seeing herself being able to change anything even though she wants to. I am just overwhelmed with this situation. It has been a shitty year for my mom (health and workwise) and i literally don´t know what to do.

I want to move out this year, continue studying in another city. But i am really worried that she won´t be able to take it.

She has no one else supporting her. She isolated herself. But i want to have a life myself as well.

So AITA here?

My wife and I were happy, we all talked about life changes, how great it is to be growing up and have a bond that many women share, and also joked about the 40 year sentence of cramps and discomfort. My wife and daughter then talked privately about all the specifics and anything that my daughter would have been embarrassed about bringing up in front of me. All in all, my daughter seemed pretty happy about all of it. 

After a few days, and after my daughter had told her maternal grandmother and aunts, I asked her if she would mind if I told my mom and sisters, who live in a neighboring country. She said yes, she wanted them to know about her milestone.

Now, I grew up with two sisters and myself, along with a single mother. They (sisters) told me *everything*, all the time, so I'm pretty aware of all the ins and outs of women's health, even if I haven't experienced any of it myself. My mom, on the other hand, was more reserved and traditional, so she simply never brought it up. But I didn't believe it to be taboo. So I decided to text my mom and sisters and let them know the good news. My mom immediately responded to the group text with ""This is inappropriate."" One sister replied with ""Oh noo! haha"" and the other didn't reply at all. I told my mom that it's fine, I had permission to share, and that there's nothing shameful or weird about it. It's not like I was giving graphic details. She said ""Ok."" and nobody else responded to the text.

Individually, I sent a text to my sisters saying that I probably shouldn't have brought it up to mom and that, to me, my daughter's health and milestones shouldn't be treated as secrets or shamed. I've bought tampons for my sister, I've bought tampons for my wife, I've taken my daughter to many doctor appointments, so I see no sense in having discomfort with these things. It's been a week since, and I have not heard from anyone.

That being said, I do realize that it's not something to shout from the rooftops, which is why I asked permission from my daughter and only shared with my mom and sisters, and never planned to share with anyone else. But I may have done something wrong in telling, so AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I like my stepson well enough and get on with him in general, but I’m not close with him and from the start of my relationship with his father, I was placed in a ‘awkward older friend’ sort of category and so I have 0 authoritative rights over him really. 

When he comes over for the weekend his father will spoil him rotten and essentially allow him to sit there on the xbox from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed. He will bring his son snacks and drinks of either pop or water, and his son will place them on the side in the living room and eat in there. 

I’m tired of feeling like a maid and hunting the house for dishes, clearing up empty plates and wrappers, and I’m equally tired of washing up after this boy. I’ve spoken to my husband multiple times regarding this he says he’ll stop enabling his son or tell him to clean up after himself. It’ll get better for a week and then next week we are back to square one. 

In my eyes he’s 13, he’s more than old enough to do small chores like take the fucking glass from one room to another and to rinse it out. I’m happy to wash up dinner plates, etc, but if he’s being served snacks then either he or his father needs to be washing it up, not me. 

I’m also not at the house often on the weekends, I work full time and when he has his son for the weekend I’ll often catch up on my own social life as the two of them never want to do anything other than play xbox together. My stepsons idea of a fun family day is his father and I sitting there watching him play fortnite all day. 

Things came to a head today. My husband took his son on vacation (I wasn’t invited on this trip) for a week and they’re due back today. I thought the house was clean and tidy but lo and behold I saw ANOTHER glass today, and it was my personal drinking glass that my mother had bought for me shortly before she passed away. It’s nothing special but everyone knows in the house it’s my glass and it’s not to be used by anyone other than myself. I must admit I had quite an emotional reaction and broke down crying because my mental health just isn’t great at the moment and I feel like playing maid to my stepson isn’t helping with my stress levels. It could have been my husband, so I’m not blaming my stepson straight away, but I’m just very tired of feeling like a worker drone whenever I get home.

I’m aware I sound quite cold towards my stepson in this post and I will say whilst I do genuinely overall think he’s a nice child, I am struggling with being a stepmother as I feel people don’t really understand how sacrificing and difficult it is. It’s a job no one wants to sign up for and as soon as you do you’re not allowed to express any dissatisfaction because the moment you do, you’re told ‘you shouldn’t have got married if you didn’t want to deal with a kid, he’s YOURS now’."

c0isfn	2019-06-14 11:04:07	ieuanj_00	AITA for causing a breakup?	"I know the title already suggests that I am indeed TA, but hear me out.

Some backstory. I've previously been speaking to this girl (18f) brought her around my house a few times, let's call her Kate. A couple weeks ago, I cut off communications with her and many others, letting them all know that I'm deleting social media until exam season is over (I'm from the UK, had A Level exams) and that they all have my number and are free to text me. During our time of seeing each other, Kate had explained to me about a girl that she dislikes (let's call her Jess) however it is not a strong hatred, let me make that clear. This will be relevant later on.

Fast forward to last night, I had finished my last exam so I thought, why not get back on social media (Instagram, snapchat etc). Kate and I started talking almost immediately, turns out she has a new boyfriend whom I know but we aren't really friends, let's call him Luke (18m). The first day that we start talking she's already confiding with me problems that she has with being in that relationship, e.g. they argue almost everyday, and that she worries she might not trust herself to stay loyal if she's drunk because she previously wanted to have a ""hoe"" summer before she goes away for university.

Now, back to the situation. I have no problems with Jess, the girl who Kate hates so I have her on snapchat. Jess has posted on her snapchat story a picture of Luke, herself and another of their friends. They are essentially in the same friendship group.

I let Kate know that Jess is there with Luke and his mates in a banterous manner as if to just annoy her, unknowingly aware to the fact that Kate doesn't know. Turns out Luke withheld the fact that Jess would be there and said he was just out with the lads as he feared that Kate would indeed freak out if she knew, and that's exactly what happened. Kate explained to me how she doesn't want him hanging out with Jess because she's supposedly trying to be manipulative in pulling Luke away from Kate.

In the end, Kate was very pissed and upset that Luke hid this from her, I tried offering all of my support and advice to no avail. They must've argued a lot that night alone with Kate at some point saying she doesn't know if she wants to be with him. Fast forward to this morning, Luke has texted Kate saying that if Kate doesn't know if she wants to be with him because someone she doesn't like is around him, then he's done with the relationship.

Sorry if any of this may be unclear, feel free to ask for more info. 

TL;DR: I let a girl that I've previously done things with know that her boyfriend is out with someone she dislikes. She gets angry, he breaks up with her.

c0iopi	2019-06-14 10:51:38		WIBTA if I intentionally wasted my dentist's time?	"A little over a half hour ago, I was waiting for a dentist appointment. The dentist was running late by about 25 minutes, and I was parked on a meter, with my time coming to a close. I approached the receptionist and asked if it would be okay for me to go move my car (I can't afford a ticket). She asked how long I'd be, and my response was that I don't know, as I'm not from the area and would need to find somewhere to park then walk back to the practice. I suggested rearranging the appointment and the receptionist said it was fine and sent an assistant to tell the dentist.

So here I am trying to rearrange the date when the dentist herself storms up to reception and gives me the dirtiest look ever. She then jumps into a 15 second or so rant about how she's not happy about this, and basically saying I'm wasting her time before glaring at me and returning to her room. I'm stood there shocked at the unprofessionalism and even the receptionist looks uncomfortable. I rearrange my appoint.ent with the same dentist (apparently it must be the same dentist who did my check up) then leave. 

I'm now thinking that I 100% do not want this woman messing with my teeth, and I'm even considering moving practices and filing a complaint. My question is, WIBTA if I didn't inform the practice until after the appointment that I was moving, so that the dentist had another wasted slot?

The practice isn't an emergency dentist AFAIK so I wouldn't be putting anybody's health in danger."	Everyone Sucks	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

For whatever reason my husband expects that I come home at 7pm and cook his dinner every single night. If I’m not organised and cook dinner then he would prefer to just not eat, or he will cook himself dinner and not me. So far this year I have only ever come home from work once where dinner was prepared & that’s because I told him he needed to cook dinner because I had an appointment that would run too late. 

Is it bad of me that I wish just once a week I could have a meal prepared for me when I get home? Especially since I do it every other day of the week?

c0ilrn	2019-06-14 10:40:55	Pugshugsandmugs	WIBTA for reporting an employee for making me uncomfortable?	"So I don’t know if I’m overreacting but there’s this one coworker whose made me feel majorly uncomfortable when I worked with him. So far it’s just been twice coz it doesn’t look like our schedules cross much. Anyway, last week is when I first met him. I introduced myself when I first walked in when he was already in the midst of his shift. Later when I went to go attend to my duties, he came up behind me, placing his hand on my lower back to ask for my name again. Also during this shift i was doing my own little duties when he’d repeatedly ask if I needed help. I wouldn’t find it weird if we were slow at the restaurant, but he was currently in the middle of taking orders when asking if I needed help with my little tasks.

It’s been a week before today when I worked with him again. When I walked in, he greeted me enthusiastically, though getting my name slightly wrong. Then as I began to do my work, he was making small talk, asking what I did before my shift etc. the only reason I find it odd is coz he wasn’t talking small talk like this with any of the other employees, just me. When he left his shift, he came up behind me and placed his hand on my shoulder to say goodbye. I was pretty unnerved by this but Im not sure if anything good would come out of reporting him to our manager. It’s also worth mentioning that I’m not the only girl working here and that he doesn’t really act the same with the other girls. Also if it helps, I’m 18"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0ilob	2019-06-14 10:40:32		AITA for refusing to pay $9 after I ate almost nothing?	"Alright so a few hours ago I went to dinner with a few friends and since i had already eaten i was not hungry at all, and was just going for the social aspect. However, when we got there and they were deciding on what they wanted to eat i didn’t ask for anything since i wasn’t hungry at all. I was on my phone not paying attention while they were deciding since i wasn’t planning on eating. 

Where i will acknowledge i screwed up was in the fact that while i did tell them i wasn’t hungry, i never explicitly said i did not want anything, and while i was on my phone they were going over what they were ordering and one of them asked me “is that okay shortboy57?” and i replied with “yeah alright”. 

Now the food comes (just to be clear they ordered two different types of wings and some wedges) and i ate a single wing and a single wedge while they all ate at least 7-8 wings each and quite a few wedges each as well. After everything is finished (they ate all the food that was ordered) they said “so everyone’s going to pay $9 for this?” this was the first i had heard of this as i was not paying attention when they decided this. 

As i said before, I acknowledged that it was my fault for not being clear or paying attention, so i told them i would pay $5 instead of $9, since i never specifically agreed to split it and they essentially had all the food to themselves. I was expecting them to be flexible enough to allow this, since there was enough of us that this would result in everyone else having to pay less than $1 extra each.

Instead what happened is they all good extremely angry at me and demanded i pay the full $9, and that if i don’t they will never eat with me again. They went on to say that even if i has not eaten a single thing i still would have had to pay $9. 

So AITA? If i am are they overreacting over 80 cents extra to pay?"	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0ik8n	2019-06-14 10:35:05	Taylartot	WIBTA for not wanting to travel with people I'm stuck with?	"So a little back story, I'm currently living abroad with a volunteer program. With said program, you have to be with 2 other members of the group at all times when outside the city. (Any traveling must be done with at least three people) We have a group of about 30 people, but the last two weeks will be just two other volunteers and I.

Our current vacation plan is to go to Beijing for three days and then Shanghai for four, but I don't want to go to the Shanghai half. Frankly, neither of the volunteers I am with are kind to me whatsoever. One of the volunteers I am with is absolutely awful towards me. She actively has tried to convert me to her religion, chastised me for having beliefs contrary to hers, asked me lots of politically charged questions then sent me religious texts refuting anything I said, openly used homophobic slurs in front of me, invited people into our room whilst I was sleeping or changing or otherwise not presentable, woke me up repeatedly every morning/overnight because I snore, and on and on and on. Because of this, I requested to change rooms. Since I have moved, she ignores me at all times. If I speak to her, she won't look at me nor respond. When teaching, she won't collaborate or acknowledge that I am there. She has removed me from every group/social media she has. It's petty and frustrating. I've done everything in my power to be mindful of her beliefs and her space yet she still is incredibly hostile towards me.

This leads me to my dilemma. If I don't go to Shanghai with them, they don't have an opportunity to go and will have to return to the US without having gone. If I go with them, I will be going into debt and staying in our hostel the entire time while they vacation. (I can't afford to do anything while there. I can afford transportation costs, hostel costs, and will have to put any other expenses on my credit card.)

I'd like to note that they had the opportunity to go earlier in our semester when we had a larger group. We had a Shanghai vacation planned and booked, but they dropped out last second and we had to scramble to find another member of the group to come with (again, we have to have three members outside the city together at all times. The two girls and I are the only ones left.) So not only have I been to Shanghai on a vacation that they nearly had cancelled, but now they expect me to pay for a second one so they have the opportunity.

The good person in me wants to take one for the team and just go. I feel bad because they quite possibly won't have an opportunity like this again. However, they are both absolutely terrible and I can hardly afford to pay for this. I don't know what to do.

c0ifhv	2019-06-14 10:17:00		Wibta if I told my friend she can’t stay with me to go to my friends parties anymore?	"So I (24F) recently moved and made a great group of new friends that throw excellent parties every few months. I invited my friend (25F) from home who lives about 3 hours away to probably the second one I ever went to, and since then she also came to another. She enjoyed them massively, but I have to admit I hate going to these parties when she’s there. She gets really fucked up which is embarrassing and means I have to deal with her feeling like shit the next morning and getting her home, she wants to stay way later than I can, (legit she will not leave until about three hours after I want to go (we’re talking about 7AM) and as she’s staying at mine I can’t just leave because it would mean locking her out) and at these parties I barely see her anyway as she runs off with people I don’t really know. 

The issue is my friends have started inviting her without talking to me, and now when there’s a party she books time off work without asking, assuming she can stay in my house. For the most recent I told her I might not be able to even go as I’m starting a new job on weekends and she just said she’d book the time off work anyway. 

I’m feeling really frustrated, but I know she doesn’t have a lot going on at home as she’s fallen out with some of her friends recently, and my friend group are very different to anyone she’s ever met. 
I’ve suggested she asks the people that invited her if she could stay, but realistically she’s only met them twice at 2 parties so I know that’s not fair on anyone. 

So wibta if I said she couldn’t stay with me anymore, knowing it would be locking her out of these parties that are clearly making her happy?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

 My SO and I have been casually following the NBA finals since she is from Toronto, and I've watched the past few games with her as well. Tonight we were watching Game 6, which was potentially a final-ending game. She was with her friends in Toronto and I was eating dinner alone, but also watching the live streams. 

Around the second quarter, my roommate invited me to grab dinner with her and I discussed it a little with my SO who didn't seem happy that I wanted to ditch the game. I still went to dinner because I wanted to spend more time with my roommate, since my apartmentmates and I are graduating this Sunday, two of us are moving out Friday, and the other two on Saturday, so we don't have a lot of time to spend with each other after this weekend and today is the last non-moving day we have together. 

After dinner, I rushed and made it back in time to catch the last half hour of the game. After the game and celebrations, my SO was busy talking and celebrating with her friends so I started helping my roommate clean the apartment. My SO then got upset and said I had the entire night to spend with my roommate and it wasn't even urgent to have dinner with her.

My thought process was that I am likely never going to see my apartmentmates again after this weekend and so I want to spend this time building memories and bonding before that happens. From my SO's point of view, I guess I still have 2 days to spend with my roommate and the game, if it ended the NBA finals, would only come around this once in a lifetime (Raptors toppling Warriors streak). There might be more to what she is upset about but tbh I'm not great at analyzing social situations. AITA for this?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0ibpx	2019-06-14 10:02:56	setsulko	AITA for rejecting a gift and making my mother cry?	"Obviously the issue isn’t that straightforward so let me provide a little backstory. My mom is quite clingy- not controlling by any means, not strict, she’s kind and giving and loves her kids very much. I’m 24F and living at home with my 23M partner, previously lived out of home but had to move back because of money issues. When I lived out of home, mom would show up unexpectedly with gifts- kitchenware from the 80’s that she thought was really handy, homewares I had no interest in owning, clothes that I’m not comfortable wearing.. all things she “surprises” me with. And it’s not that I’m not thankful, she’s an excellent mother compared to some others I know- but a lot of these gifts feel very forced on me. I just like to make my own purchases, especially when it comes to homewares since I’m sharing a life with my partner now. It stopped for a while after we had an argument about it, but now that I’ve moved back home it’s starting up again.

She bought me a pair of pants I wouldn’t wear, a few shirts and sweaters I’m not comfortable in, denim jackets and jeans even though I’ve insisted to her many times that I do not like denim (I think it’s ugly, personal preference)- plus more 80’s kitchen homewares “for when you move out!”. 

Today she came into my room after work and excitedly said “bought you something today!”- a navy blue tracksuit shirt with bright pink stripes down the side. Not my style in the slightest but even if it was it would be the same issue. I do not like having these gifts forced on me. So I rejected it. “I don’t want this. It’s not something I’ll ever wear, I’m sorry you wasted your money but I won’t wear it.. please don’t buy me things without asking first”. 

Mom smiled and walked off to her room, and I heard her crying a few minutes later. I checked on her and she said “I don’t know why I bother trying, you obviously want your independence” (this was said in a kind of snarky tone)- and after that I left.

Now I just feel awful and guilty because I hate making her cry. But I don’t think it’s unfair to not want all these unwarranted gifts that just go into a box of junk at the end of the day. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0	511.0	77.0	0.0	0.0

c0i9jz	2019-06-14 09:55:10		WIBTA For forcing my hyphotetical future child(ren) to have a hobby?	"Okay, I am aware this sounds weird and silly but hear me out.

I, (23F) like probably many other young people have thought about having kids in the future and what the life would be like then. My boyfriend (22M) and I like to play out these funny scenarios what we would do with our kids and just think how our kids would turn out. 

I wasn't never really able to have any hobbies, I only used to draw with old pens on my spare time and now it is really bugging me off. We used to live a bit further away from the city where all the activities were. My mom would always say that my hobbies are mine and not hers, meaning that she would not drive me to city, so I was never able to have a hobby. 

My boyfriend on the other hand was able to try out whatever he wanted, and his parents would support him which is exactly what I would have wanted for my parents to do when I was a kid. 

One day we had a conversation about our hobbies and my bf was explaining how he wished how his parents would have pushed him a bit more towards one hobby, instead of allowing him to change a hobby when he felt like he was challenged. I on the other hand was just hoping that I could have gotten some support and my parents allowing me to have a hobby, especially since they now joke about me being completely talentless. 

We laughed and agreed that in the future, our (hyphotetical) children will be able to have any hobby they want but we will also support and ""force"" them to follow through if the hobby gets challenging. Obviously if the hobby becomes too stressful or unbearable we allow them to change it, but we would want them to do something so they won't end up regretting having no hobbies as a kid in the future. 

And now to the WIBTA part: 

I met up with a friend (24F) a couple of days ago, and as we were chatting I mentioned the previous conversation we had with my boyfriend. 

 I thought I would have a fun reaction to why I am thinking about such things  but instead it lead to a horrible rage, to my friend saying I am not allowed to force people  or choose how my kids live their youth. 
She said that I would be a horrible mom for forcing my kids to go through some annoying hobby and said that she hopes I will never have any kids. 

I kinda just froze and laughed it off saying that ""Well, I don't have to think about having kids for a couple of years anyways..! "" 

Things got pretty awkward and we both just quietly decided to end the evening and I left. 

It's been a couple of days and the comments she made haven't left my mind. I felt quite bad for what she said, and would I really be an asshole for doing that?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Backstory and Cast (names changed / dropped for privacy) 

5 years ago I started dating M. M has 4 children, 2 girls, 2 boys. All between the ages of 23-28. The two girls have 3 children each. (We'll call one S)

The second girl, G, recently had a hard life lesson. Her husband has been since I've known him emotionally abusive, controlling, he liked to blame his bipolar and borderline personality disorder for his actions toward his wife, but he's a good father. It sounds strange I'm sure, he was a different person with the kids. 

So, on to the current scenario.

A few weeks ago, G called me one night telling me she didn't feel comfortable staying home. I immediately went and fetched her to stay the night with us. The whole night her husband is blowing up her phone, almost nonstop. The next morning, he's still going. She doesn't want to come home. 

Five minutes later he shows up on my doorstep and gives me their youngest (1 year, older two in school) no diaper bag. He wants in. I told him no. He was 6'4, 200 lbs. If he got in there was NO way I could get him out. G, goes out for 20 minutes to talk, and comes back in sobbing, he'd threatened his own life, we called 911 gave them the car info while I called in for supplies for the baby from a friend.

While speaking with the police the sheriff called in, they found the car wrapped around a tree, he was in the hospital, critical condition. 

I was there with G, through everything over the next few weeks.

Arrangement for the children to be picked up from school, to and from her job, getting his family in from out of state. Going through the trashed car to pull his tools. I had been taking her driving for months and she finally got her license. She told me she was going to leave him. That she deserved better. I was so proud of her, stepping into her new found roll so flawlessly. I was working on getting her a car to replace the one he'd totalled.

In that time, he was released from the hospital. Into the care of G's sister, S. Who lives two doors down. 

Last night I got a message. 

""He came home, it wasn't forced, he's different now"" 

I was done.

For months during our driving lessons I'd explained the cycle of abuse, how it waxes and wanes depending on what he wants. 

She knows.

But when I found out I told her I needed time. Because I Am upset. She almost had it. I explained to her that I didn't want to blow up and say things that might hurt her, that I wasn't mad, just disappointed. 

So the question is, AITA for pulling my assistance (driving her too and from work, she was also looking for me to take one child to daycare along with financial aid and favors) to take time to process? She has access to a car to borrow until we get the titles for the one she's buying. 

I just feel guilty, but I'm also hurt.

c0i3oz	2019-06-14 09:33:36	aitathrowaway9797	AITA for Introducing my GF as a Model?	"So I have been dating this Girl for awhile now. She's beautiful. She works as a professional model. Not like an Instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything.

She also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. She usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. For some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. She only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor.

So the other day I was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. I said ""Thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model"" and she shot me this dirty look. Later she said I was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and I had no right to correct her. That what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. That her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.

I dont see what the big deal is so AITA here for telling people what she really does for money?

\*\*Edit just to clarify I she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. I just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after I did it. Also I was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when I introduced her to my friends.

\*\*Edit 2 Theres so many comments and I am trying to read them all. I do respect her. I do love her for more then her beauty. Shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. She's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. Honestly I am blown away with how pretty she is and I've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. So that part does excite me.

I genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think I am the asshole for this I do value how much money a field brings in. When I chose my area in college I did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. I am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and I am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. I'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.

I shot an apology text (We're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her Dojo. She said we can talk after work and I offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.

&#x200B;

\*\*Final Edit

At this point I imagine no one is reading anymore I asked the mods if I should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.

I was really bothered by the things people said. Not because I wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. I didn't want to be the guy everyone said I was. I really didn't.

&#x200B;

First I want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. Yes I knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. We have been dating for around 3-4 months.

&#x200B;

Next I want to say She was meeting some of my good friends. I was not trying to ""show her off"" in that she was a trophy for me. I was trying to point out her accomplishments. I thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. I can see where I was wrong. I did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and I felt it was more glamorous. I am an asshole for that. I did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and I'm also the asshole for that too. I wont deny it. But I DONT just see her as a trophy. I do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because I learned something really really important.

&#x200B;

After this thread blew up like it did and I had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick I was I knew I was dead wrong and had fucked up. I texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. I asked her if we could talk about it and I could try and make it up to her. She agreed. I told her I wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if I could sit in on some of her classes. She said she would like that. I made it top priority. I left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.

&#x200B;

What I saw really opened my eyes to be honest. I watched two classes and took part in the second one. The first one was her with a kids after school class. She was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. Someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. Thats dead wrong. It must be much harder to teach kids and I think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. I saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she DOES want to be a mom one day).

&#x200B;

The second class was a womens self defense class. I took part in this one as ""the bad guy"" and I was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. I got manhandled by about 15 women. We had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. For those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)

&#x200B;

I definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. She taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. Most importantly I saw the qualities beyond her appearance that I love most about her really shine. I realized the things I love most about her; Her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. This is really the part of her I love. It doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. I also saw how much she loved what she was doing. I saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. I'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong I was.

&#x200B;

I told her this when I went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. She also filled me on the modeling thing. She doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out

&#x200B;

First off its not as glamours as I thought it was

&#x200B;

She said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model

&#x200B;

She works as a model because of a few accidents. She was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. Thats all it took for her to be a model. It took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. She started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. She feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. She said being called a ""Model"" defines her by her appearance defines her by WHAT she is and not WHO she is. She doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. She doesn't feel that being a ""model"" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.

&#x200B;

She doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. That she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. She doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. She feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. She wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.

&#x200B;

This is where I lit up and felt I had something to really offer her. I work in finance. Go ahead hate me but I DO like money. I like to have it, I like to make it, I like the freedom it affords and I like to watch it flow and grow. So I offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. I thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what I know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. We both win. She agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and I will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.

&#x200B;

Finally I asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.

&#x200B;

I know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. I learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. In the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why I love her. So honestly thank you AITA yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but I needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. Is she the better person? Yes she is. Do I deserve her. No I dont, But I am going to do better. I really do love this woman, I wont ever do this again."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0i0qn	2019-06-14 09:21:29	maddog264	WIBTA for getting even with my roommate who f*cked me over	"Super fun story time. So this was one of my years at college. (Super anonymous).

I was in a FWB type relationship with this girl for awhile. Her roommate sorta crushed on me, but she was seriously mentally unstable and the first time she found out we were FWB she went on a temper tantrum. I had to console her until 430 as she was trying to harm herself and say she would switch roommates, leave school, drop out, etc. She wouldn’t admit she was jealous, but it was evident. 

Anyway, I talk her down, and we all go to sleep. Wake up the next morning to find out that the FWB and roommate talked and they agreed that everything would be good between them if me and the FWB stopped hooking up. Obviously I was pissed because I hate the thought of a third party dictating how my life is going to happen and I didn’t get any say in this conversation. But I was actually ok with not being FWB with the FWB since neither of us were all that invested. However, the FWB was kinda just saying that and somewhat unsurprisingly made a move like 4 days later and we kinda just picked everything back up. Fast forward for like 2 months of “covert operations” and it’s a standard Friday night. I’m chilling with the FWB and I texted my roommate that I’m in the room w FWB. 

So we get to introduce my roommate now. My roommate is a wack dude. He has issues of his own and made a lot of mistakes with being an asshole. I always covered for him though, even when he was doing things that went well against my own morals. He fell into a bout of depression when everyone realized he was a huge asshole and I was basically the only person that was nice to him for a good month straight. Anyway, the only thing I ever asked of this kid was to keep me and FWB secret just to prevent a shit storm. So this Friday night, he knows I’m in the room with FWB. He gets a text from FWB roommate (who hates him, but leverages the possibility of a friendship) and he tells them me and FWB are in the room, and he gives them his login and passcode to get into our room (keycode lock with app that requires login). This turned into a 4 hour shit fest, FWB roommate is pissed at FWB for “lying”, (no context just gonna say it’s a hypocritical accusation) FWB roommate next day bought a knife to scare FWB, FWB moves out bc of how scared she is of FWB roommate, FWB is placed across campus and me and FWB fizzles out because a 20 minute booty call is not as convenient as a 15 second one (we lived opposite the stairwell one floor from each other).

Fortunately, my roommate trusts me. I know his password to everything,

WIBTA for getting even. An eye for an eye. He’s talking to a girl on Instagram and I want to ruin his chances. Keep in mind I won’t say anything to hurt this other girl. I’ll probably just be like hey I had a GF and she wants me to block you and for you to block me. He’s getting his phone fixed rn so I only have like 2 days to decide."

c0hzle	2019-06-14 09:17:05		AITA for showing my son how a slut mother would be after hearing say i'm a slut for more than a year?	"My son has been calling me a slut since a little more than a year ago, why? because i receive his best friends with a hug (that's right, just because of that and only his best friends which are only three), i tried to explain him that it wasn't something bad but since it was clearly bothering him i stopped.

Weeks later i wanted to have a Facebook to chat with my brother and sisters (since we're from México and they're living in the US) so i asked for help to my son but he rejected it (in front of his friends) to what one of them offered to help and he sent me a friend request at the end, what was my son's response? calling me a slut who wanted to fuck his friends via Facebook so again i ""pleased"" him by deleting his friends (by that time 3 of them were my friends on the social network).

All of this time i was trying to get help both for me and my son since clearly there was an evident problem, also. in case i haven't mentioned i'm a single mom for almost all of his age (he is 18yo).

It went worse when we traveled to Hawaii, i had to go for a business trip and took my son with me, he and his best friends planned to gather money to come with us and their parents talked with me about it, it ended up as a 5 people trip.

I have to repeat we were in Hawaii, full of beaches, well, my son would be calling me a slut more and more because his friends would see me wearing bikinis ""most of time"", his friends always would tell him to. stop, that he was going too far with me, that i'm his mother, etc.

It exploded when i uploaded a cropped photo that we took the first day where the 5 of us were, what did i crop? everyone except for my son and me, my son again saying that i was presuming i was with 4 guys like a slut, this was the last day of the first week of the trip (it was a two week trip) and that's where i exploded.

When this happened we all were in the apartment, i was fully clothed, what was my response you'll ask, well, i showed him what a real slut would do.

I took off everything except for my underwear, i was too ""friendly"" with his friends, i would ask them how i looked in my undies and did all kind of things (without going much more further than that).

It just took two days of me behaving like that (more like a day because i'm only counting that night and the next day) when my son apologized to me, since then he hasn't called me a slut but reminds me almost monthly that i behaved like an asshole and that we could have talked it so my question is:

Friends and I had a movie night the other day and watched a film called Puppet Master: The Littlest Reich. If you've not seen it, it's an absolutely ridiculous B-movie comedy/horror about a Nazi puppet maker who possesses his dolls from beyond the grave to go on a murder rampage. It's absolutely as stupid and cheesey as it sounds. (Note if you do watch it: it is pretty gory, though it's godawful unrealistic B-movie gore and obvs there's some heavy Nazi imagery but, I mean, my gay ass wasn't offended and neither was my Jewish friend so take that for what it is)

One of the friends was relatively new to our group and I like her enough but afterwards she kept talking about how scared she was of that movie. I kinda incredulously said ""really? *That's* the one that scared you?"" (We'd watched some actual horror films that night too) and she got super indignant, saying how she's scared of dolls so yes, she was scared of that one. I pointed out I'm freaked out by dolls too but come on, that film isn't really *scary* and it's not even really supposed to be. She's taken the huff big time with me, saying that I'm insensitive and making her feel unwelcome in the friend group and even going so far as to call me a bully. My intention wasn't to bully her, I just thought it was daft to be genuinely frightened of such a dumb, self-aware parody of a horror movie. AITA or is she?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0hwvq	2019-06-14 09:06:16		WIBTA for watching videos like this at work?	"This is a follow up post to my previous post - https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c0bxk3/aita_for_watching_videos_while_i_work/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&utm_term=control_1


I am very much aware how watching videos on my phone made me an asshole, especially since I would be picking up the phone every few minutes to play a new video.

I have decided to leave all media consumption to my laptop. I am working on creating web applications in my internship and so is everyone at my table so it's expected for us to have our laptops open all the time unlike our phones.

Now I won't have YouTube take up the whole laptop screen. That would definitely make me the asshole and show that I don't care or respect the company. It would also keep me from multitasking. 

Instead, I am planning to watch videos like this - https://imgur.com/a/bAVlXWW - except on my laptop and not my iPad.
Basically, the video would be on a small corner of the screen while not at all disrupting the view of the tools I use to make the web applications. I will be able to resize and move the small ""pop up"" whenever necessary too. This way I will be able to multitask while looking straight at my laptop screen (like everyone else) and my tools will take up most of the screen. I will be able to use the tools and work while the video is playing. It won't be distracting to others at all because the video will be playing in a small corner of the screen and not take up the whole page. Because of where I am seated, no one would even be able to see my laptop screen (this is a rough sketch of how we are seated - https://imgur.com/a/LXhlDUz).

I will be wearing wireless Bluetooth headphones and not my wired earbuds so I won't need to worry about the earbuds making a loud thud on the table if they ever fall out of my ears. 

Searching up videos won't be time consuming either. I watch the same content creators almost every day so I won't be spending hours on end pulling up a new video, just a few seconds. 

So, WIBTA if I do this?

If it helps, those sitting at other tables didn't have any problem with me using my phone since I got stuff done - only the interns did. So I doubt they'll have a problem with this."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So about eight days ago I (31) began messaging someone(23), I found through another sub, who made reference of learning to love themself again. Our conversation became fairly personal as we talked about anything and everything and it eventually migrated to another platform outside of Reddit. Now, I don’t have many friends irl so when I begin talking to someone new I tend to be very chatty but will respect space and boundaries when asked. Fast forward to last Monday, our conversation progressed as it normally did throughout the day until I started to get one word answers. This was due to them having a long day and being tired, I told them that was no problem and they are welcome to go to sleep whenever. The following day our conversation began with me getting reassured that they were not upset with me for any reason and our talks carried on like normal but were somewhat short as we were both busy with work.  Next day they regressed back to one word answers and me driving the entire conversation, until they say they’re in a funk and may take some personal time for a bit. So I respond supportively and express interest in continuing the conversation, to which they say thank you. Now comes yesterday evening and I see a familiar face pop up on my feed under a new username, less than 24 hours after there claim to feeling off and going mia. So I check to see if there old profile is still active, which it is aside from several of the posts being deleted. I decide to send them a message in our off Reddit conversation to tell them I look forward to talking again and am happy to see them posting, regardless of it being a new account. I have received no message in return but do have do have read receipts on so I can see that they opened the message I sent, then carried on and started posting to their old account again within the last hour. So am I the asshole for being upset ( but not expressing it to the other person short of detailing it in this post) over being ghosted with no definitive explanation after over a week of fairly interesting conversation?

c0ht46	2019-06-14 08:50:41	theejaybles	AITA : Asked my my brother if he could find a replacement for me to attend his wedding	"**edit**:  I talked to my brother and he was very responsive to my view point and listened respectfully. He related that he definitely wants me there but holds no Ill-will if things aren’t able to work out with me attending.

 I live in the US and my half brother is getting married in Canada next month. Due to a past DUI  in 2007 I have difficulties in crossing the border. I have been pretty transparent about it. Been trying to get the proper documentation together over the past couple months to ensure that I can be deemed rehabilitated in the eyes of Canadian Border Patrol and gain access to Canada to attend the wedding.
 
he set a deadline (this weekend) for me to verify that I would indeed be able to attend, no formal invitation physically, but had responded to an email from him(and fiancée) that I Intended on attendance for the two day affair. 

I took a bus up to the border for a day trip to see if they would let me cross the border. The border patrol officer was pretty straightforward about the information the at they had about my criminal record:
DUI in 2007 possession of marijuana charge in 2009(later amended to possession of paraphernalia with intent to consume) which the latter they didn’t really care about, so that was pretty much a non-issue.

Although, when I received that marijuana charge it stemmed from me being searched due to **an outstanding warrant for my arrest for failure to appear to a court hearing related to my DUI** I served the time and had to pay fines.. yadda.

I disclosed the extent of my record, but they had limited details about the circumstances of my that arrest and its relation to my initial charge. So, I contacted clerks in the appropriate counties for documents that will provide more comprehensive information about this arrest to provide proof that it wasn’t a second alcohol charge, for my next visit as soon as I can.

Well, I explained through Messenger the rundown of what I had experienced and how I was trying to find resolution to this problem to attend and also discussing alternative options (temp residence permits and visitors visa) 

I was trying to do the research to determine the investment of time and resources I would have to commit to be there to attend the wedding. 

•The response I got after my **wall of text** explanation was that they were getting(purchasing) outfits for the wedding, which is in mid-July, this upcoming weekend and if my efforts to attend aren’t successful(“if everything falls through” as he expressed ) I was expected to reimburse their expenses for the outfit.
Well, I’m attempting to be diplomatic and explained that I can’t guarantee that I would be able to attend due to potential inadmissibility to Canada and if they would like to find someone to replace me that they were welcome to explore their options. I had never responded to an official invitation to the wedding, only intent to attend via email.

If I were able to gain admission to cross the border to attend and be there in support of their union I would proceed to due so on my own dime with no financial obligation to them."	Not the A-hole	0	0	2353.0	97.0	0.0	0.0
c0hso6	2019-06-14 08:48:37	Ninjamortal51	AITA for sharing my opinion about Avengers game	"Howdy Lads, (attention links were taken out due to reader's complains there are new conversations minimized)

Today i watched Square Enix's E3 Conference, for one reason: ""The Avengers game"".

To be honest i was kinda down when they didn't show direct gameplay (i know some scenes looked like it was gameplay and the trailer was made in the same engine as the game with the same resources), And if you have seen last EA'S E3 you know what i mean. (I'm looking at you command and conquer Rivals)

so i decided to go to a comment section in a trailer video, to share my opinion and see if others have the same idea. surprisingly yes and cue the problem.

**The problem**

You see every community has: "" that guy "" the one who says don't be like that, then proceeds to say I'm doing better than you, and be like me. (with all my respect to everybody)

This is the original comment someone posted, and the tantrum begun here. [Massages](https://ninjamortal51.tumblr.com/image/185585308712)

The guy that i ran in trouble with let's call him hank (not his username nor real name because i don't know him i just made the name up for easier referencing.).

but his response kinda threw me off, here. It was mean for someone who just commented, i understand sometimes people just have a bad day and they spill their frustration on other people, but calling me toxic and that i throw people of the game that they are exited for ?

Woah that is a whole another level, so i responded

now if you read this you notice i talk about someone who is named: ""SkiDzz"" (not his full username) well this guy commented on hanks first opinion about the original comment and said this. and hank replied back to him like this.

and hank didn't stop here he got to another person and criticized his opinion after my last reply to him, which he didn't answer. (let's call this guy John) [Massages](https://ninjamortal51.tumblr.com/image/185585333322)

Now i just what to ask: AM I THE ASSHOLE or you can say: The idiot here ? i personally think NTA.

Edit: thanks for the response i apologise for being an asshole, please forgive me. gonna apologise to hank now, thanks again for the responses."	Asshole	0	0	38.0	19.0	0.0	0.0

c0hqs6	2019-06-14 08:40:25		AITA for not wanting to go over to my boyfriend’s house anymore because of his dad?	"My boyfriend and I have been dating for around 5 months and we both still live with our parents. I’ve gone to his house multiple times and most of the time, only his mom is there and she treats me quite well. At first she didn’t like the idea of us dating but now she actually likes me and wants my boyfriend to propose to me as soon as we graduate from uni. 

However, his dad is another story. Whenever I’ve seen him he’s always been quite rude to me and barely even says hi. I used to think that that was just how he was, but, after of my performances, which my boyfriend and his dad went to go see, his dad saw my friend and said he could’ve done much better than me and gone for her instead. My boyfriend just brushed it off and when he told me he said that he would never. I was upset but I didn’t say much because I understood that he doesn’t know me very well and is just judging based off appearance. 

Two weeks after that my boyfriend invited me to his little sister’s birthday party and I went. There his dad was really rude to me in front of his whole family and every time he saw me he’d walk away and scoff. When I told my boyfriend about this he was confused but didn’t say anything. Now, it’s come up that his dad doesn’t want him to invite me for my boyfriend’s birthday party and that he only wants him to invite other girls so he can look at other “choices” as he put it.

I can’t even go to the party because I’ll be out of the state, but I just straight up said that I wouldn’t be going to his house anymore except for special occasions where like there is a party because being around his dad made me uncomfortable and I didn’t want the situation to escalate more. He told me that I was being immature and that I should just ignore his dad.

c0hpiu	2019-06-14 08:35:05		AITA for deba	"So, I got into a long argument with my dad and sister (who both served) about the military. It started when I made fun of some boot things. I know I’m a civilian but I mean it was really cringey even my older brother who also served agreed. They didn’t like that I said that and They keep saying I shouldn’t join now because I hate the military. 

I basically told them:

“I don’t hate the military, in fact I think it’s necessary and can be quite noble. That said I hate the fetishization of it. It’s not glamorous when people are fucking killing each for whatever reason . I think most veterans deserve at least some respect for putting their life on the line, and doing a job most don’t want to do. However I find it stupid how brain washed people can be about it.  

Not every soldier deserves my respect, it should be earned like everyone else. The military serves one goal: to protect/serve the people.”  Not going to debate if they are doing a good job at that or not (that can lead into ww3 in my home). When I said all of this they got really mad saying “you didn’t serve so you can’t criticize” “and those people you joke about are risking their lives which deserves our respect”. 

Most of my family thinks I hate the military now  and shouldn’t enlist, I think quite frankly their out look on this subject is dumb and influenced by their time serving.

  I also want to point out this has nothing to do with any lack of respect for my father and siblings. I’ve thanked them for their service and respect them for it.  I want to think my common sense here is right which makes this  a popular opinion thus making this a validation post but I’m really unsure if I’m NTA here. 

Them saying “my attitude sucks and I shouldn’t join because I hate the military” bothers me.

I left my old school about a year ago. after i left, i went to a new school in the same city. its about a 20 min bike ride from my old school to my new one, so not that far.

&#x200B;

many of the people i spent over 4 years there, including some of my best friends started to just ignore me after i left.

after about two months of trying and failing i decided to give up and to give them the cold shoulder.

I (19f) am a group leader and student in a 2-week study trip to Malta. I am in an advanced English class with 10 other people. 

The teacher is probably in his late 60s/early 70s, he is Canadian and quite a good teacher. I think that the course is a little easy for me but there is no other course available, more difficult at least.
In class we do exercises in pairs and the teacher walks around the table to help, then we check them all together.

My problem is that whenever I ask a question or propose a possible answer, he is standing behind me and either rubs my shoulder or my back replying to me.

I haven't noticed whether he does this to other people, but I do not feel comfortable with him doing it to me and, frankly, it kind of creeps me out. I don't understand if he is just trying to be supportive or if there is something more to it, but honestly it makes me quite uncomfortable. 

I don't think I am giving off any kind of vibe, besides genuine doubt in an answer I or someone else gave. The rest of the class either hasn't noticed or just doesn't care, since their faces do not express much.

I haven't talked to this to anybody, because it is the last day of the week and next week I might be transferred to another course for unrelated reasons, but I was debated in whether talking about it to the other group leader I came here with (she's mid-50s f by the way) because yeah, this kind of makes me uncomfortable."

c0hi9p	2019-06-14 08:03:20		AITA for challenging an aggressive woman driver	"Driving home, the whether conditions are wet and a 2 lane road zipper merges to 1 lane before a roundabout. Theres cars in both lanes and most people merge-in-turn... Normal right? Well, i come driving down the second lane, i see a large gap, enough to fit my car twice inbetween the car infront and this woman driver behind. I must have been going about 30-35mph at this point. I merge into the first lane and take the first exit on the roundabout, the woman behind me gets VERY CLOSE to my ass, i'm surprised she didnt hit me. 

The first exit leads straight onto a residential estate, its quite compact with cars and theres often kids running around, so i slow down to 20mph. This woman is literally on my ass, so close i can practically taste her and i couldnt see anything else in my rear view mirror. This stretch of road is about half a mile long and i continue to go 20 and shes still following me. I slow down a bit to 15mph because shes being aggressive and hopefully telling her to back off. She doesnt. So i slow down to a stop while putting my left indicator on. I roll down my drivers side window in hopes that she will stop and tell me what her problem is. Instead she aggressive drives pass me, flipping me off and shouting ""wanker"" out her window.

Now, what i did next i am not proud of, but i just wanted an explanation on what the hell her issue was. I live at the bottom of the road turning right, but she turned to the houses on the left. I saw that she parked up on the side of the road on the left. So i went left, stopped next to her, gestured to roll her window down. 

The woman looked visibly flustered that i challenged her (i understand that. i'm a 27 y/o, 6ft guy with a beard, i can look threatening but i'm the least aggressive person around). She rolled her window down and i said ""Excuse me, is there a problem?"" and she has a confused look on her face and silence, so i repeat ""Was there a problem?"" she just said ""What?"" while her face was going bright red. So i repeated again ""What was the problem? You almost hit my bumper and then flipped me off shouting wanker at me?"". She looked around like she had no idea what i was on about. So i got a little petty and made a jokey comment saying ""Look, i maybe gay but it doesn't mean i like it up the arse all the time"". As i said that, she went from 0 to 100 in a split second saying ""You pushed into my lane and i had to SLAM my breaks on, and then you go 10mph down this road and you follow me to my house? Are you a psycho, what is your problem?"". I simply said ""i live like 5 seconds behind me, i hardly followed you, i just wanted to know what your problem was"". She cut me off before i could finish and she says ""What the fuck is wrong with you pervert little faggot"" rolling up her window. 

Honestly, that last comment made me laugh so i just drove forward, turned around, and as i was driving pass, i smiled and waved her goodbye where she was screaming at me giving me the wanker gesture."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Since we've worked near these guys for years we occasionally extend offers to each other to get the other party high.

I've been sick the past two days so I haven't went to work.  Today she came home joking about how a couple of the headshop guys ""peer pressured"" her into doing whip its. I instantly got pissed off. I told her I thought it was a stupid idea, and that I thought it was weird she was huffing nitrous with these guys in a fucking storage room.  She told me I had no place to tell her what she could or couldn't do and that I ""shouldn't make her feel small for having fun"". Then went on to try and tell me that they were in the middle of the store, which I have a hard time believing.

Me and her (the friend) aren’t super close, but still fairly good friends. A while ago they came over to my parents house to pick up a gift from my mom (our parents our friends as well), and on their way out my dad asks if she’s going to invite me to the graduation party. Me and her sibling aren’t friends at all, we took a couple classes together back when I was in high school but that’s it. Since my mom called her out though she invites me out of politeness, although not very enthusiastically.


I had no interest in going and was kind of upset that my mom dragged me into it, so I end up making an excuse not to go (I don’t have my own car and simply said I didn’t have a ride, which was technically true because both my parents were out for the night but my mom had previously planned on picking me up). Didn’t really feel that bad for not going because she clearly didn’t care if I showed up anyways. My friend was pretty upset that I couldn’t come though, so I said I’d send her sister a graduation gift as a kind of “sorry” note. 

After a while of thinking, I remembered that I already gave my friend a pretty expensive gift for her birthday not too long ago, and her sister didn’t congratulate me on my graduation, birthday, or anything else (I mean I don’t expect her to, like I said me and her sister aren’t friends at all). So I don’t really feel like shelling out money for a graduation gift for her, especially since it’s not like an actual birthday or anything. I’m also far from rich. I already told my friend I would though, which was probably a dumb idea, so I feel kind of guilty if I don’t.

Honestly I don’t care too much, but I haven’t talked to my friend since then and it would feel really awkward just messaging her and acting as if I never said it, so I haven’t spoken to her since. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

He lost his driver‘s licence around the time of his first rehab, because he was caught driving drunk.

I just found out that he is still driving, which is bad in itself. But he does so absolutely drunk and sometimes even drugged.

"So backstory, peacefully I’m minding my business and the old lady behind me (late 50s, early 60s but not terribly old, healthy).  So the woman struck a conversation with me, which is odd because I’m not very approachable, and generally this doesn’t happen.  The conversation started about the length of the post office line and the slowness thereof.  She proceeded to tell me she was a native of Colorado but spent 44 years in Connecticut.  I’m m/41, pretty middle of the road, but hippies in Eugene set me off.  After her mention of how things are now different here in CO, I agree, I’m over it can’t wait to move to Oregon.  That was when she told me her son lives in Oregon and it’s pretty and he loves it.  I say great.  Then my hippie twitch got the better of me then said, Eugene, I’m not a fan, “f’ that place, can’t stand the school either.  I said I’m from eastern Oregon, we see nothing but madness emerge from that city.

But I simply said well, this is easy to resolve, as we just won’t speak, have a nice, I turned around to ignore her.

Up until now, we only interacted online so I took it upon myself to finally go visit this friend of mine. So far, everything has been great and the country I'm visiting is great too. The only thing is that I'm currently sick. 

Whenever I travel, I normally get sick due to a poor immune system. While my vacation has been wonderful, I do admit that it has been very difficult to do anything with enthusiasm. I had terrible stomach pains, dizziness, nausea, sore throat, lightheaded ness, and etc. My friend knows that I haven't been well too.

c0hdwb	2019-06-14 07:45:02		WIBTA for taking my friend's dog away from him?	"I recently moved into a friend's house at my university for the month. He's traveling for the summer, and so his room, which he shares with his brother, was open. The housemates graciously allowed my living in the empty bunk and welcomed me nicely. This friend of mine (Will) has a dog (Ada), who when I arrived had fleas and spent all day every day locked in the room. She had bald spots where she'd been scratching like crazy, and had red blotches all over her tummy.

The brother works a full time job with irregular hours and is not very good with living things. He tries, but he only spends a couple of minutes a day paying attention to her before playing video games for the rest of the night. He had no idea how bad the fleas were and when I eventually brought up that she needed to see a vet it was news to him. Fleas aside, Ada's life was really lonely and it was clear she was sad. Will, who was Ada's actual owner, had already been gone for weeks by the time I arrived, but I learned from the housemates that this was generally how she spent most of her days even when Will was ""present"". Will lives an erratic lifestyle as a busy college student, and though I'd only ever known him to be an excellent friend, this commitment to his friendships came at the cost of being a neglectful dog owner. The other roommates, though they're good people, are uninterested in caring for Ada, though they disapprove of Will's neglect (especially considering that it usually resulted in dog poop on the floor which Will refused to clean).

Ada is energetic and smart, and surprisingly obedient in spite of her lack of training. Since I've begun living at this house at the start of the month, I've slowly begun taking over the responsibilities associated with dog care and flea removal between my classwork, and she's been visibly happier, I love watching her thrive!
 
But, once my month is up, I'll leave and she'll go back to the same existence as before. All the housemates agree that she should be given up to a home where she can receive the attention she needs, and they agree that I would be a good option as a foster dog parent until a forever home can be found (tbh, I'd love for my home to be her forever home, but I'm reluctant to make that choice as I'm also a busy college student and fear that if I try to keep her, it'll be the same sad life Will gave her).
However, I'm scared to reach out to Will, as this idea of giving up Ada was a point of major controversy between Will and the housemates months ago. I don't want Will to hate me, but I can't just watch Ada get neglected. It's not right and Will should know better.
 
But, I have to wonder, does speculating what is essentially stealing my friend's dog make me an asshole, even if the circumstances are what they are? I feel crazy for considering this since she's not my dog, but I feel morally obligated to speak out for Ada since she has no voice of her own."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Anyhow. I’ve been getting over a cold and have been sleeping early anyways, and one of them knew I had an 8am because we had talked about when I’d be moving out and when each of us would pack. They both also had people over and were talking loudly in the connected bathroom (this is in a dorm) for like half an hour after I said I was going to sleep. And then they both decided to start packing—until 4am. Basically ended up only getting two hours of sleep before my last final and was absolutely dead through the whole thing. 

So fast forward several hours after I packed up and started driving home, I text them basically saying I felt that was a big dick move and they should have planned better and that I felt it was very disrespectful and rude. (The one who had a flight could have packed earlier and the one who didn’t have the flight could have packed the next day, especially while I was gone at my final...) AITA for not wanting them to have been packing and being loud through the late late night before my exam, and AITA for calling them rude for it?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"So I was at a Gamestop and bought a physical copy of the Smash Ultimate Fighters Pass about a week ago. I forgot and only remembered now. I live with my parents as I'm only 16, and my mom drove me there and back. 

Tonight I woke up, checked Discord, and some people were talking about the new DLC characters for Smash Ultimate, making me remember. My parents were awake when I asked them about it, which was odd since it was 3 AM and even I had fallen asleep (even if it was just for an hour or two, for some reason I don't tend to sleep long.) My mom told me it was in her purse, which I didn't know until then. I offered to get it so she could give me the pass, but she yelled at me not to look for it myself. I got it, but she told me to go to sleep. I said I would if she gave me the pass, and asked if she would.   


She nodded, I gave her the purse. She didn't give me the pass, she yelled at me to get out. She also told me that she would keep the pass from me for 'at least a week'. 

Considering that I bought it with my own gift cards and my mother never gave it to me after I got back home, I don't know who's more wrong here. I know that I am at least somewhat at fault for asking at 3 AM, but I was worried I was going to forget again. Am I the asshole here?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

so I'm really into makeup and there was a palette that I've been wanting to buy for a while and I had the chance to, but since my birthday was coming up (back in May), I was told not to by a friend of mine. 

the reason he told me not to buy the palette was that another friend of ours had messaged him asking what I wanted so he told her 'oh she really wants x' and she apparently went through a bit of trouble to get it (went to a bunch of stores). he saw her before my birthday and she even showed it to him.

well, my birthday came around and she didn't give me anything. 

I saw her recently and she saw that I have the sister version of the palette (think pokemon x & y) and she said that she really likes the *other* version (the one I thought I'd be getting) and that I should get it (can't bc it's sold out everywhere lol).

I'm going on vacation soon so I won't be in the country for her birthday (July). I was originally planning on getting her makeup from a brand that's hard to get in the states (but based in the country I'm going to), but now I kinda don't want to.

c0hbu3	2019-06-14 07:36:18	Engeneus	AITA for making my sister carry all her junk.	"So a few years ago me and my sister were going to visit some family in Sheffield, we lived in Darlington at the time so this involved a fairly lengthy train journey followed by a tram journey. Knowing having lots of bags on public transport is a pain in the arse I carefully packed so all my stuff was in one small wheeled suitcase (we were only going for four days so this wasn’t hard). I go check on my sister to see how she’s doing and she says “I’m going to need you to help me carry everything”. “Everything consisted of her handbag, her suitcase (which was at least three times the size of mine and stuffed full), her trumpet (because she was in a good brass band and absolutely had to practise every day) and her guitar (as far as I could tell because it was new and she wanted to show it off).

This pissed me off because I’d deliberately packed to avoid this and she hadn’t even asked me first, I’d have still said no but we’re British, politeness is a big issue for us. This started a big argument that resulted in her refusing to leave any of it and defiantly carrying all of it on the bus to the station, the trains and the tram. All the while she was trying to guilt me into helping saying “all those people will be wondering why doesn’t he help that girl” to which I’d respond with “I don’t give a shit”. I genuinely didn’t care either, she’d made her bed so now she must lie in it. She’s also a somewhat militant feminist so the hypocrisy of this pissed me off even more. She’s generally quite happy with sexist comments or actions if they make her feel special, otherwise it’s like you just tried to attack her.

Anyway, we got there eventually and stopped bickering and I even helped her carry it on the journey back. After all, she’d already made the mistake by this point.

I read up on INTJ depression and saw that INTJs are very likely to develop depression due to being perfectionists and not being able to stand up to challenges. That is basically my life story.

I have classic INTJ habits, I overthink, I overanalyse and I basically can't live without overthinking and seeing the negative in a situation that isn't even happening.

I have been told multiple times by this friend and other friend to stop, to stop overthinking and to stop being obsessed with overanalysing things in our school life. And that it ruins the mood of things.

I said that it is hard for me to stop. Since this is the essence of my being. But I do try my hardest to restrain even worse things in my head.

I told her about personality types. How I got tested and got told I am an INTJ multiple times. How people can walk on the lines of a personality type but mostly won't change much since it is rooted inside of them.

She said that they are all bullshit. That people can do whatever they want and that it is their choice to behave this way. And that it is their choice to control themselves. 

I might be overthinking this but there are many studies proving personality types, so this statement annoyed me and I really want to tell her that she is ignorant to disregard all of these studies and disregard so many people telling you this is real.

c0haq5	2019-06-14 07:32:01	3catznatrenchcoat	AITA for telling my roommate I can’t afford all of our bills on my own?	"So I’m really upset about this whole situation. My roommate (who I’ll refer to as Carrie) recently left a min wage job that she hated, for a higher paying job. It’s been about 3 weeks and she walked out and decided to go back to said previous job. 

Verbatim the conversation went like this. 

“Carrie I will not be able to pay your half of our bills in the case you’re short.” 

“I did it before I can do it again.” 

“Right but this was before you had rent, utilities, and car Insurence.” 

“I’m not staying at a job I hate because it pays more.” 

“I don’t think returning to another job you hated that pays less is the best solution.” 

Here’s where it gets tricky. We had plans to get a place but it wasn’t until the fall because I wanted to establish a good amount of savings, however she was in the biggest rush to move out of her moms and told me she will use her income tax money that she saved  for our first months rent and security deposit while I paid just under half for both the first months rent and security deposit. She insisted it was okay and that she wants to gtfo asap so let’s go. 

Fast forward, Carrie texts me saying that what I said really hurt her feelings, that she was able to save up the security deposit money making min wage and it’s messed up I said I wouldn’t help her because she’s always willing to help me and our other friends. 

So I apologized, I told her that she is right, I said something really rude and i took it back, I told her I only said that because I was concerned for not only my livelihood, but hers as well, and that I trust she knows best for herself and I’ll support her as much as I can. 
I also said that of course I will help where I can but truly I just can’t afford all of our bills on my own and I wish she was more responsible about quitting rather than walking out with no notice. 
She then tells me that my apology is BS and she forgives me but she won’t forget and she’s gonna show me she can live on min wage.

I decided to throw a joint birthday party for my brother/end of finals week party in my apartment. He and I go to the same college, are in the same major, and are involved in the same clubs, so we have a lot of overlap in our friend groups. Since the group of people was going to be relatively small (seeing as my brother really only wanted to invite one or two people I wouldn’t have invited), I offered to make brunch and mimosas for everyone. 

About a week before the party, one of my friends texted me and said something along the lines of “I invited a guy from Tinder, remember to make extra food for him!” I was kind of taken aback, since I hadn’t realized she was seeing someone. I asked her about him, and found out that this was going to be the first time she’d be meeting him. I was uncomfortable with that, and texted her “I wish you had asked me before you invited him - I’m not really comfortable with this, and I’d rather you didn’t bring him.” 

My friend lost it, and told me I was being ridiculous. She left the group chat for the party, ended up not coming to the party at all, and texted another friend of mine that I was being unfair. 

My other friends are split on this - some of them think I was in the right and that my friend was being rude and childish about the whole thing, and some of the think I was in the wrong and that it wouldn’t have been an issue for her to have a date in an apartment full of people.

The thing is, she is perfectly capable of driving. I absolutely hate car rides longer than 4 hours, even when driving. Add to the fact that I’ll most likely be listening to Christian talk show radio and her talking about Jesus the whole time, I’ll be in hell. If I was able to listen to my music it would be a little more tolerable, but not much. 

I already have been “needed” to go across town a lot just to do basic stuff for her like cook meals and stuff. I’m getting more and more irritated as she sees me as an excuse to not get the surgery she needs for her leg. She is just using the plan to go to Texas as another procrastination technique. 

I’m expected by her and my parents to be there at a moments notice for her and I’m sick of it because the one fucking time I refuse to do something I’m a selfish and ungrateful asshole because she is an old woman.

c0h4is	2019-06-14 07:08:08	throwawyholly	WIBTA for ending a friendship where I'm their only support?	"So uh, kinda throwaway because I've only used this for a post in advice that got no replies.

&#x200B;

To sum it up, an online friend is heavily relying on me for their mental health, not seeking professional help, repeatedly triggering me, and overall acting manipulative according to everyone I've confided in about this. **But, I'm their only source of support.**

&#x200B;

Well, tonight it got to a whole new level. They changed their Discord username to a direct reference to something extremely triggering and dangerous, so I messaged them in concern and flat-out begged them to seek help. They made excuses, as always. When I told them the subject is no joke and that it's unhealthy to base their identity off a reference to it, they simply said ""I'll be fine.""

&#x200B;

At some point they asked for advice on calling/texting the mental health hotline I told them to, but it seemed kind of... disingenuous? I asked if there was anything specific they were worried about, and they pretty much seemed set in their ways that they wouldn't call/text because ""my mind is just that way."" So that was that.

&#x200B;

Several friends have said there's nothing more I can do, that people can't be helped if they don't want help, and I recognize that. They urged me to stop talking to them, and I'm tempted to, but...

&#x200B;

The only issue is **they constantly say I'm their** ***only*** **source of support**. The only one they trust. The only one they can talk to. The only one who listens. Etc. So, basically, **if I stopped being their friend, they'd have** ***nobody*** **at all.** I'd never be able to live with myself if they got into a serious crisis because of me, or rather lack of me.

&#x200B;

I'm practically at my wit's end. I want to help them so bad, I just can't keep this up, I know it's no good for either of us. **But cutting them off would surely make them feel even worse.**

Last year my husband graduated in biology and has been working as a tech while he applies to a master's program. He is a hard worker and tries to make all the money he can so he immediately started working nights and working overtime. He worked the night shift on the surgical floor for 16 months, and during that time I got pregnant and had our first baby. He didn't take time off when I had her, but because full time is three 12 hour shifts a week, he was able to arrange his schedule so he'd have a few days off after I had her.
It turns out having a newborn is hard af, especially with PPD and a husband on nights, so I encouraged him to switch to days. A spot opened up in the ER (where he had been wanting to work) and it was for mids (11am to 11pm) and he took it.
He's been on this new shift for just over a month and doesn't like it. He says that his co-workers have been really difficult to get along with and that he's been called out at work when he's there busting his butt. I asked him to give it a try for 6 months because it is SO much better for me and the baby, and he said he would.
However, today when he was at work, he texted me saying that he got offered the same position but on the night shift, and he took it.. he said that he tried days, didn't like them, and is excited to get back on nights.
And I'm over here like.. what? That wasn't our agreement! I thought after 6 months we could discuss it again and see what we thought would both work. I feel like telling him he needs to go back and say ""sorry, I changed my mind, I'm staying on days"" but I don't want him to hate his job. He works hard and works a lot so I do want him to be happy there.
When he was working nights I felt like I never saw him, and I felt like I was drowning with having to care for our baby. I know he will keep doing overtime and I know I'll hardly see him once he starts nights again. WIBTA if I ask him to suck it up and work with the difficult co-workers on days so that our daughter and I can see him more?

Tl;dr my husband wants to work nights bc he doesn't like the day shift coworkers. He accepted a night shift position without asking me. I don't want him to bc we have a baby and I'm mentally exhausted."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

  Yesterday I met up with a woman from tinder. We had a great time and ended up going to my place (read: my parents place) to enjoy the rest of the night. This morning she kinda snuck out and invited me out to karaoke with her friends after she got off work, I enthusiastically agreed.

  We met up at her place of work when she got off of her shift, left so she could change, and picked up her friend. We went to this (kinda trashy) karaoke spot and people were drunk singing all night. At one point we all went out for a cigarette and this is were the fuck up begins. As we are walking back, “forgot about Dre” comes on and I’m immediately cringing because some drunk asshole is about to be yelling the n word to a group of strangers. I started to say something to her friend about this (who’s an African American) but don’t get the chance to finish what I’m saying. I walk back into the bar and sit with her and say how whoever is singing shouldn’t be saying “n word” (no hard R) and she calls me out on it right away and says I shouldn’t be saying it either. I agree with her and tell her she’s right. At that moment, between two Caucasian adults, I thought it was appropriate to condemn whichever drunk ass thought it was alright himself. The night goes on and we talk about the incident a little more, I explain by saying that my half brother and nephew are African American and I pray they never hear me say the word to which she says “but are you black? You shouldn’t say it at all. She says she’s done with our date and I walk back to my car about three miles away from where we started and drive back home.

  I’m really conflicted because this is an issue I never have to want to have with my family and my brother uses the word even if I’m seriously uncomfortable ever saying it. I thought I was alright expressing myself here and got burnt. Help me learn from this please. Also, don’t fucking gild me; if we’re gonna be serious about this go and support a black owned buisness today. Mike Render of RTJ had a cool bit in his Netflix piece “trigger warning” about this and if you’re interested in spending money because you feel strongly about it, I’ve just suggested a better way.



TL:DR I said that the guy rapping out “forgot about Dre” probably shouldn’t be saying the n word. My date gets pissed and tells me to walk home.

The cops put a warrant out for his arrest and finally arrested him, but his court date is still pending (thus he is not found guilty/not guilty yet.)

c0gx97	2019-06-14 06:41:33		WIBTA if I bailed on this road trip?	"My childhood friend, we’ll call her S, planned a big road trip across the country to Colorado and wanted me to come as a birthday gift. It seemed like a great idea for a while until a few things made me weary:

1. She got an air bnb which is this huge cabin up in the mountains 45-60 minutes away from the city, which completely throws me for a loop because, why would we want to add more driving to a road trip??? 

2. Only thing that we had planned to do was go to the Colorado pride fest, but that day it’ll be thunder storming, as well as four other days out of the six day trip, rendering outside activity useless.

3. She wants to head out on this 15 hour drive AT NIGHT. I’m talking we’d be leaving at like 8:30PM with no daylight whatsoever. I’ve had a bad gut feeling about this road trip for a long time but the fact that we’re starting it off at night with TWO separate cars doesn’t help at all.

4. So many people bailed that it comes down to her, her girlfriend, her girlfriends younger brother and a mutual friend that the brother wants to hook up with, which would leave me to be completely fifth wheeled, even if they say they’ll do their best to keep me included I know S and I know that she’ll do what she wants in the end.

I told S I felt like I wanted to bail and her response was “don’t do this to me”. The only other people I’ve told about cancelling were my mom and boyfriend, both of their responses were to follow my gut and cancel.

As selfish as this might make me seem part of me wants to take control of my autonomy and have the response “I don’t want to go” be enough for everybody for once. So reddit, WIBTA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c0gv73	2019-06-14 06:34:11		AITA for hurting my friend after he hurt me and didn't apologize	"My friend (let's call him O) invited a bunch of people over, myself included. The group of people was our friend group at our old school before we graduated. We're pretty close and all good friends.

 In O's backyard, he has a small zipline that goes from his treehouse to the ground, but if you go on it, you need someone to stop you at the end or you'll either crush your balls or lose your virginity to a rope. More about this later. 

So a few of us are sitting in O's living room. I'm sitting on a bean bag. One of my friends (we'll call him S) decides to come over and jump on top of me for absolutely no reason at all, but not a friendly jump. He basically cannonballed on top of me for absolutely no reason at all. 

He landed mostly on my leg. I yelped in pain because that shit fucking hurt.  I wasn't too upset because I don't think he meant to hurt me bad, but it really did hurt a lot and I was pretty pissed and groaning on the ground in pain.  He never apologized despite my obvious pain. 

Now to the zipline. S wanted to go on the zipline but he needs someone to help him stop at the end. This is when I plot my revenge. Long story short, I don't stop him. Instead of crushing his balls, he flies off the zipline into a space between O's fence and yard (sort of a pit maybe). S ends up cutting his forehead and the back of his leg. The fall looked much worse than it was. He laid down on the ground for a minute and we all freaked out.

I immediately apologized multiple times. I wasn't sure what else to say. He got up soon and we continued our day like normal. He was fine other than a few scratches. He could have cracked his head open or worse and we both knew it. I continued to apologize throughout the day but he just kept saying ""ok"" or ""it's fine"" in ways that implied it was not at all fine. 

After we all went home, I apologized again. I didn't mention that I only did it because he jumped on me or anything. I took complete ownership of what I did and genuinely asked him to forgive me. 

Instead of forgiving me, he sends me this super long text saying he no longer wants to be my friend, I'm uninvited from his birthday party, to stay away from him during future group hangouts , and that he's not interested in making up in the future. 

I was completely surprised. I knew I'd hurt him but I didn't realize he was that upset. I just responded ""I'll respect that"". 

I get I shouldn't have hurt him even though it was revenge, but I already genuinely apologized multiple times and I'm not sure what else I can do.  I hate when people are mad at me and also S is not even that hurt. He could have gotten really hurt, but he didn't so I don't understand why he can't just forgive and forget.

It all started with my father. My father had two marriages/divorces and also two sets of kids. His family adored his first wife and didn't like my mother at all. That transferred to us children. His kids from first marriage were adored us not so much. I remember as a kid being sad that in my grandfathers house there was a wall with pictures of all his grandchildren except me and my brother. There were other things but that is not the case now. My father let this happen for years. Now my brother and me are adults and it doesn't bother us anymore. 

My grandfather died last week and I'm our family we get cremated. On Monday there was a funeral which we all attended. Family all across the country has arrived. My father has told me that after the funeral all family is going to get drinks after. Later he, my uncle, my aunts and all family that arrived from out of town will have a gathering. All family, me my brother, my half-siblings, my cousins that live in our town won't attend because there is no room for all of us. We were fine with that, my mother baked few cakes for to help my aunts which we gave to my aunt day before funeral.
After the funeral and drinks my brother an me left home to hear that everyone except us were on that gathering. My father confronted my aunts for the first time in my life how come my brother and me weren't invited and everyone else was. They said that what they are supposed to do they didn't invite everyone but they arrived on their own. My aunt to ""fix things"" through my father officially invited me and my brother to lunch after the burial of the urne. She knew my brother and me were working and couldn't attend.
In the evening my father calls my brother and tells him that he, my uncle, my aunts and few family members who could attend had lunch after urne burial. Also can he come by to pick up doggie bags my aunts gave him for us because we couldn't be there. I went completely ballistic, really wanted to tell-off both my father and my aunts. How dare they give us scraps from their lunch after everything. My brother and my mother  calmed me down. They say I should let it go because my father and my aunts are in mourning and it wouldn't be right to fight with them now.

So I made a new friend in school, and I really enjoyed her company at first, but now she's just irritating to me. She is some how able to pick up on all my insecurities, and comments on them. A few weeks ago my boyfriend met her for the first time, and he followed her on instagram, the only social media platform he uses. The next day she told me she noticed it was odd that he didn't have any pictures of me on his instagram. It's something that has bothered me a little bit, but then again, everyone knows he and I are dating, I've spent time with his family, and he only posts on instagram a few times a year. Her comment kind of triggered my insecurities, but I dealt with it on my own, and moved on. Next she made comments about how she did not think it was okay for to me to hang out with one of my guy friends alone because I have a boyfriend, and that her ex-boyfriend would have hated that. She said things that implied that she did not think my boyfriend must be very committed because he let's me go out with my guy friends and doesn't get jealous. Before this all had happened, I confided in her that I had a miscarriage and she told me she was judging me for not being on birth control and saying that it was not a very adult thing for me to do.

&#x200B;

Today was the last straw for me, before class started, she asked me if I would like to get drinks with her after class. I told her that I couldn't because I had plans with my boyfriend to go to dinner and a movie. During class my boyfriend texted me and told me he was sorry but he forgot he had plans to watch some important basketball game with his friends. I told him that was fine and to have fun, and he said he would clear tomorrow night so we could see the movie. I told my classmate that I was free now because he had canceled and that I could get drinks. She said she couldn't believe I was mad that he canceled on me for a basketball game, and how demeaning she thought it was. I was really annoyed at this point, and I snapped. I told her in a semi-aggressive tone that I did not like her constantly commenting on my relationship, and that her judgements were getting to be too much for me, and I was just going to go home. One of our mutual friends texted me and told me that I had made her cry. I felt really bad, but I kind of don't want to apologize because her comments have been a detriment to my happiness and my battle with self growth. Am I the asshole?"

c0gu8w	2019-06-14 06:30:59	Legionx37	AITA for not attending the funeral of my best friends father because of my phobia?	"I was personally cut off by a life long best friend (since 4th grade) a few years ago because I didn't go to his father's funeral. I have a phobia of dead things. I have a weird, uncontrollable voice in my head that pipes up whenever I see anything bigger than a small insect dead saying, ""If you get to close, you're going to catch the death from it. You'll breathe it in and then you'll die too."" I know it's irrational, and I certainly don't *believe* that I can ""catch death"", but I can't stop that voice in my head.

I've only managed to attend two open casket funerals in my life, not that closed ones are too much better. And going to one of those was because I was really young and was basically forced to when my grandfather passed. I freaked out the whole time, which everyone saw as a kid mourning his grandpa extremely roughly. 

The second one I went to was my grandmothers', and that one I went to because we were so incredibly close at the time. I'm her only decent grandchild. My cousin, her granddaughter, is a drug addled, (thus-far) irredeemable mess. Being an adult this time, and having kids of my own that loved her as well, I forced myself to do it, but I couldn't be a pall bearer or even get close to her myself. I held it together though, and did attend the graveside service.

So yeah, I don't do funerals, and if I do, I do them badly. That's why I didn't go to his dad's funeral. 

We live a few towns apart now, with him staying in our hometown while I moved a few towns over to be closer to my aging grandma and father, so we didn't get to hang out as much anymore, especially when we each got married and started having kids and careers and life and whatnot. But we were keeping in touch through social media, random passes through each others towns and even the very occasional planned hang out. But here it is, years later, and he still won't talk to me after several apologies and begging. At least his wife (a good friend herself) still keeps in touch.

So I guess he's still my best friend, but I'm not his. feelsbadman.

I try my absolute best to deal with his issues, but sometimes I have my own and don't feel like dealing with his. For those of you who don't know, borderline people tend to cross over any boundaries set. Their feelings are always more important than anyone.         

With that said. We planned a small get away this weekend but I have to work tomorrow and I don't know when I'll be able to leave work yet. He knows that, he's used to it. Every Friday is chaotic for my job. I also have an important meeting tomorrow and I needed time to prepare for it.         

Tonight, his anxiety kicked in. He kept asked me when I'll get off work. I don't know. You know I don't know. He kept asking. And asking. And asking. When are we leaving? I don't know. When are we gonna get there? I don't know. Over and over.        

Sometimes, Borderline people can be like children. No matter how often you repeat something, they don't understand.         

I told him I needed space to get ready for my meeting. He said no. I locked myself in my office to work. He got anxious and kept knocking at my door. He said : No we're gonna talk about it right now.           

I got upset and I told him to fuck off. He got mad, started playing the victim (another thing Borderline does) and now he's upset, blaming me for his anxiety.

It has Winnie the Pooh characters around the bottom half of the dress (in colour). It doesn’t look overly fancy due to the characters on it, but it is still really nice. Is this inappropriate to put on her for a wedding? Of course I am going nowhere near the colour white, my dress is blue and my partner is wearing a kilt (three guesses where we are from lol). But I’m not sure if the white rule extends to infant babies? I’ve not been to many weddings. Everyone so far has said it will be fine, but I’m tempted to just stick a different dress on her but feel bad as it was gifted to her and the person who gave her it is excited to see it on her at the wedding.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0gr1h	2019-06-14 06:19:18	filibertosrevenge	AITA for not talking to my friend after he applied to the position I told him I applied to?	"I'm currently unemployed. I've got wealthy parents, so I'm well off, but I've been trying to get a job since the semester ended. Things got pushed back for me regarding one opportunity because of reasons, so lately i've been applying to places I wouldn't mind working in.

I found a posting on indeed for an entry level lab tech position at a water analysis place. They're looking for someone with a background in bio and chem, perfect for me because i'm majoring in microbiology with a minor in chemistry. i applied and was actually super excited about it, because I'd absolutely rather work in a lab than at the starbucks in a barnes' and noble.

My friend and I are both undergrads, but he's a senior going into his last semester and I'm only about to be a junior. He's working in a research lab this summer, drives for uber/lyft and works a 9-5 in a kitchen. The dude has three jobs, n I was kinda uncomfortable when he immediately said ""yo where'd you see that job posting?"" when I told him how psyched I was to have applied there.

He said ""I need a chemistry job more than you do"" (he's a chem/math major). He tried to tell me that water analytics was a ""chem job, not a bio job"", b/c he drove an uber for some guy who worked there. He got resentful and accused me of thinking I was better than everybody else, acting like because I don't want to ""scrub floors"" I'm a dumb brat who wants everything handed to her.

I respect the hustle. I really do. I don't think he knew necessarily that I'm completely willing to work a service job, I just haven't heard back from the places I've applied to yet. I'm not a rich girl who thinks she's above people for anything, I just know that I have a real skillset now.

What I feel really hurt by was the fact that he said he needed this job more than I did. Maybe it's true, I don't know. But all I know is that I'm behind him in experience and this was a job that I could garner some serious resume beef with. I'm sure the same is true for him, but he's been working in research since last semester. That kind of thing is an incredible opportunity that i've been trying to get involved with for basically a year. Not only do I need this experience, but the fact that he has experience over me means he's more likely to land the position. Also, I hate being concerned about this, but he's a handsome, well-spoken 6'1 dude and I'm a 95lb fem with limbs that make people say "" I could snap this in half! ur so delicate and small!""

I told him if he applied for the job + got it I wouldn't talk to him again. He said he didn't care and he laughed because I don't think he was taking me seriously at all. Anyways tonight he sent me a snapchat of the Indeed posting (I told him where it was obvi) saying ""guess where I just applied?"". I didn't respond. I don't think I can talk to him even now.

Is this shitty of me? Should I just get over it? Is he right and should I just apply to McDonald's instead of searching for positions in my career? Ugh.

(Edit, i commented this but I'm going to put it here anyways since there are a trillion comments on this post now????):

To clarify, like, I really did come to this subreddit to ask if I was being overdramatic. I know I can be sensitive sometimes. And it's not as if I've actually stopped talking to him--at this point, all I've done is not reply to a snapchat that he sent me tonight. All I am is genuinely hurt by his behavior and I don't know if I should bother continuing our friendship. At the end of the day I don't give a shit about the job but I feel like he has no respect for me."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	51.0	27.0	0.0	0.0

c0gnm1	2019-06-14 06:06:55	lopali	AITA for egging my friends because they wanted to do the same? Kind of	"Hi there,

currently I am on a camping trip with my scout group. Two days ago I overheard that three of my fellow scout leaders were planing to prank me by waking me up with an raw egg to the face and ask me a stupid question about scouting to see what my reaction would be like. We're very good friends and there was no reason for them to prank me, nothing happened between them and me on the days before. 

I had to prepare a lot of work for my studies in order to be able to be a part of this trip and even drive back home to give a short, but important presentation at my university on Friday. 

As I knew that the 'prank' would take place during the night before my presentation I was a little bit in an uproar. I prepared three raw eggs next to my sleeping bag and was ready for payback. 

As they woke me up in the middle of the night before my presentation there was no egg involved but I was so perplexed that I followed through with my revenge. Three eggs to their face. 

They were furios. After some short explaining they told me that they never thought about waking me up by egging. I was confused and felt guilty. I felt so bad, that I even cleaned up the mess in our tent, while they were showering. 

I couldn't wrap my head around the whole thing and asked other scout leaders, if they knew anything about the 'egging'. And fair enough, they told me that the pranksters spoke about the egg plan multiple times when I was not around. Most of them told me that they heard enough to be sure that they would follow through, but didn't bother to tell me because it sure is a little bit funny. 

The pranksters are pretty pissed about bit and still sleeping while I am on my way to uni and writing this post right now. 

So am I the asshole and should feel guilty?

So, around 7 pm today, I decided to make dinner for the family. I made chili dogs. Something quick and easy you know? 

So I'm standing at the kitchen counter and I'm grating the cheese when my older sister walks into the kitchen. She looks into the pots on the stove to see what I'm making. She picks up the spoon I was using for the chili and starts stirring it. I say to her 

""Oh you know what, I don't need any help, but thank you! I'll call you when dinner is done"". I tried to be as nice as possible because I really did appreciate that she wanted to help. She says okay and goes to talk to mom. A minute later, she comes back and starts picking spices out of the spice cabinet and adds them to the chili. I got irritated. I raised my voice  and said 

""I said I don't need help! Get out of the kitchen!"" She started getting defensive and said, 

""I just wanted to add some spices. Don't you want it to taste good?"" She uses the SAME. DAMN. SPICES IN EVERYTHING. Cyann pepper, seasoning salt and black pepper. It gets old. I don't do anything though. I mean what can I do? They're already in the chili. So I huff, roll my eyes, and go back to grating the cheese. 

I was over it in like 5 minutes. My sister however, apparently brought it up to her boyfriend, according to my other sister who's always hanging out with them. I guess I was being a bitch?

Fast forward to after work, around 6PM and I have my prayers. This recipient then calls my phone number and asks about the parcel. I tell her that I came by her house to deliver but she failed to respond to my call and that no one was home at the time. She then persistently asks for a delivery by today ASAP and I calmly informed her that it's past my work time and I have my other duties to attend to(prayers, chores, etc.). She started to become really really annoyed with my refusal to comply even after I referred her to my manager and offered to come by the next day as soon as possible even though I have a planned outting.

20 minutes of solid talking didn't do shit and that was when I told her I needed my time right now and she needed to call later. I tend to hold back on vulgarities but when she said that ""I also have a family to tend to but a job's more important at the moment so could you just come down right now and leave my needy and shitty family for the time being?"" this was after repeatedly telling her no and I got annoyed she decided to bring a social class and ontop of that insult my family on the matter and so I became unprofessional and told her to ""fuck off"" and proceeded to hang up.

AITA for telling her to fuck off? Should I have delivered and save the troubles or was I in the right? First time encountering someone like this on the job so I don't know.

By the way, the package is a food blender and my manager is still handling the situation."	Not the A-hole	0	0	53.0	27.0	0.0	0.0

So, for context, I’m a Boy Scout, and I went on a 1 day camping trip with my troop just last week. One of the activities that we had planned was a hike, and we went to the camps lake. In the lake, there is a wooden dock connected to it, and you can go on there. Well, I went onto the dock while some kids were skipping rocks, I knew that they would not hit me because the dock was high enough for none of the rocks to hit me. One of the kids, who we’ll call Ken started to throw rocks as well. Here’s where the trouble begins: He throws a rock that lands just in front of me and lightly splashes me. Here’s where the altercation starts:

Ken: “OP, did it hit you?’

Me: “No.”

Ken: “Did it splash you?’

Me: “No, and can you not do that again.” 

Ken: Gets another rock, and throws it before I’m completely done with what I’m saying.

Me: “Dude, what the hell?”

Ken: “Did it splash you?” 

Me: ......

He threw one more rock after that, then started to encourage a much younger Cub Scout to throw a rock at me (two other kids also encouraged him to throw it.

The kid threw a good sized rock, that was about 5 feet from hitting my head.

I. Got. Mad.

They started to make up excuses, and just said, “Well, I didn’t expect him to take it seriously.” 

I was still upset at them, and we left shortly after because kids were getting bored.

At the campsite, I confronted Ken:

Me: “Dude, why did you try to hit me with rocks?”

Ken: “I didn’t try to hit you, I just tried to splash you.”

I kept telling him that I didn’t feel safe even if he was only trying to splash me, and he just kept on saying that he wasn’t going to hit me.

Now I’ve never told anyone this, but he did the EXACT same thing last year, and he did hit me lightly on the back.

I said to him today that he already tried to hit me with a rock twice, once this year, and once last year, he just kept on saying “Get over it.” And “What I did last year was different.” 

He ended up blocking me on social media, so I can’t resolve it there, and my mom’s calling me an asshole for not resolving it.

c0git6	2019-06-14 05:50:43	Chazman199	WIBTA to ask my brother to store some stuff for a few days.	"Four years ago I was backpacking Europe. My eldest brother lived in London with at the time 1 kid and SIL. With about a month left on my trip I visited them and asked if I could leave some stuff at their place (I was flying home from London). SIL made a bit of a fuss saying they’re place was tiny and it was a bit of an inconvenience. (It was like a pair of boots and about a shoebox size of stuff). They begrudgingly accepted.

Once I returned a month later I stayed at their house and got into a little argument with my SIL, we have been civil ever since but never the same. I did get the feeling I overstayed my welcome at their house as I’d come and gone a handful of times during my Europe trip. Accepting that the strain on the relationship was my fault.

Since that time they have had two more kids (one new born) and moved to a bigger house. In July my partner and I are also moving to London. We are currently backpacking Asia. We have to get to the U.K before the 31st of July to activate our visas. One of my best friends from back home will be in Italy the first week of August. 

The ideal plan is fly into London for a day or two to get visas (organise our own accomodation). Then fly over to Italy to visit my friend. As we will be dealing with budget airlines we’ll only take carry on. Should I ask my brother if I could leave two large packs at his place for at most a week until we return to London?

c0ght8	2019-06-14 05:47:11	tegale95	WIBTA if I don't go to this wedding that my mom wants me to go to?	"So I am a 24 year old female, I am currently living at home with my mom. 

We recently got invited to a wedding reception for a cousin of mine (a second cousin). He has already gotten hitched to a woman from out of country. His family decided that they wanted to do a reception for the family to get a chance to meet his new wife. 

This wedding is occurring over the July long weekend. We live in Canada so July long is Canada's birthday weekend. Both me and my 22 year old brother decided we did not want to go because it was in the middle of our long weekend and we dont know this cousin well enough to feel obligated to go (if this was any other weekend I probably would have gone). My mom was upset and tries to convince us to come. I had plans with my boyfriend to go camping that weekend before I found out about the reception from my mom. I said no initially.

Unfortinately just today our camping plans had fallen through so now my bf and I have no plans. I told my mom that now that we have no plans that we could probably go to the wedding reception. She informed me that I cannot bring a plus one as there was no option on the invitation. Which kind of miffed me because I have been in a committed relationship for a year now, my brother also does not get a plus one (he has been in a committed relationship for 4 years). However I have an older sister (25) who has recently gotten engaged and she was allowed to bring him along (they are also not going to the reception because of a previous commitment). 

I understand that plus ones can be expensive, it just doesn't seem fair that some have the option  bring their significant others but some not. 

This isn't the only reason I feel upset about this wedding reception. I found out today through my mother that I was not invited to the reception facebook group. This group has probably more info (that I cant access) and I feel annoyed that I was forgotten. I know my mom and sister were invited to the group but I'm unsure about my brother. 

So because of this I went to go look at info in the actual invitation to see if maybe there was something there to help. This invitation  is directed to ""[Mom's name] and kids"" which annoys me because I dont think they think of me or my brother as an adult. I also found out on the front of the invitation that they spelt my name wrong. My name is not difficult and is also very easily accessible to find on facebook if they didnt know how to spell it. I feel pretty disrespected.

"Apparently the server had been curt all night to the table but I honestly didn’t notice, I’ve been a server and if you bring my food and keep my drinks refilled you don’t have to kiss my ass. I feel for the plastered smile server and I really don’t care if you’re saccharine nice to me. Apparently she had rubbed the person I was with the wrong way however. But again I didn’t really care until I handed the server my ID card and she exclaims “Oh! You do NOT look your age!” I awkwardly laughed and asked if that was a good or bad thing and she said “You’re the same age as my sister (25) but you look 29-30.” I was immediately offended. It just seemed like such an unnecessary and rude thing to say. I know 30 isn’t old, but it just seems so rude to tell someone for no reason that they look older than they are. When the check came I tipped her 8% which I have never done. My standard is 18-20% and for small bills like $15 I’ll tip $5 just because I know it’s hard to make money with small check tables. I also mentioned it on the survey I took. So A part of me feels bad but the other part  of me feels justified. AITA?

EDIT: Should’ve mentioned this in OP but I was focused on telling the age bit. That wasn’t the only issue. When I ordered my drink I got a Beer on draft, and she said you want a bottle and I again clarified I wanted it on draft. When she came back she brought a bottle and when I mentioned I wanted draft she said, “No, you said you wanted a bottle,” set it down and walked off. She also mentioned my looking older than I was again as she approached the table. I checked with my friend because I was honestly confused, I always drink draft. My friend verified that I had said draft. I waited for her to come back to actually order what I wanted but the only time she came after that was to drop off the bill so I just drank the bottle. My friend’s order was also partially wrong."	Not the A-hole	0	0	26.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

It ends by an SMS that tell me that he ll never wanted to see me again, even on his death bed as I was the biggest mistake of his life. We never talk to each other again. 

6 month ago, I saw a big amount of money land on my account. After looking who was the sender I discovered it was from him. I immediately took my phone and try to reach him to know what the f was going on. He told me that they sold my grandma's house and it was a share of it...after hanging up without let me say anything. 
I ve called my aunt to know if it was real or not (my dad was sometimes lying to me concerning things like this) and it was. 

So I try to reach him again to tell him that I don't want any kind of money from him, as I have not swallowed the pill from last year... And I'm waiting for real true excuses... No response at all.... 
I didn't send back the money.... I was deeply in need, but today I really feel like I ve should.... 

Anyway last month I was with my aunt on the phone, and we talked about my relationship with my dad . She told me that I should reconnect with him, as he made a step forward by sending me the money from the house. I told her that my feelings are not for sale but she keeps telling that I'm a douche because I didn't send back the money to prove my point.

c0gg5j	2019-06-14 05:41:28	altariaa	AITA for quitting a job without notice, after the company accommodated my schedule?	"first time posting here, so sorry if i start fumbling with details.

  


i worked at this skilled nursing facility for just over two years. we specialized in aiding the elderly with daily living (bathing, meals, therapy). i worked full-time, which meant i was on a 4/2 schedule. 4 days working, 2 days off, so every week would be different. this was the standard scheduling for the nursing staff.

  


in 2018 i went to nursing school. it took some convincing but they were willing to employee me as a weekend-only CNA, then eventually to only saturdays. even then, i was so exhausted from school and clinicals that i would call off once every month after april. that's shitty on my part tbh and i'm surprised i wasn't let go for that.

  


what sucked was that we always had trouble with staff-to-patient ratios (unfortunately it's common in SNFs). in addition to losing someone who no longer works full-time, my call offs would make it difficult for the rest of the nursing team. instead of having 8 patients, aides would each have 13 per shift to bathe, assist, and monitor. even though i felt like i had an amazing relationship with my co-workers, i can imagine how upset they were at me and my unreliable schedule.

  


when i finally became a nurse, the company took me back as a full-time employee. now, i had greater responsibilities that included medication and charting. i started working night shift, much to my discomfort. however, my supervisor told me it was my time to repay them for the accommodations from nursing school.

  


then, the beginning of next month rolls along. i'm a full-time employee, so i just have to follow my 4/2 pattern, right? nope. apparently the month has me marked for 6 days straight, 1 day off, then 8 days straight. i got a handful of calls and msgs at 12AM asking where i was on my supposed-day off and didn't know until i woke up the next morning. i had aligned house renovations with my days off, so i was furious when i was told that i was expected to work.

  


i sat on it for an hour, and just said... fuck it. i quit. days after renovations were done, i returned to the company to meet with my supervisor and executive director. they were telling me how unprofessional i was being and asked for me to reconsider. i told them i was extremely angry they had changed my schedule without asking/informing me prior, but they told me that it was my fault for not looking at the schedule beforehand to speak with them about it, and that this happens all the time in any type of employment. in addition, they brought up the whole ""obligation"" again, saying i was lucky to still be employed. me, being more pissed that they weren't taking the blame for my crazy schedule, walked out.

  


it's been months now, but my friends/ex-coworkers mention how crappy i was to put the company through all that. it's been messing with my judgment... was i TA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	39.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

She lives in a different state and over time, our friendship has morphed into the kind of thing where we see each other maybe 2-3 times a year, but when we’re together it’s like no time has passed at all.

My boyfriend loves sports, he wants to go into a career relating to sports. I love and encourage this, we often talk about football, baseball, soccer and whatnot and I genuinely love listening to him talk about it, not just because he's excited but because I also actually like these sports a lot. For some reason basketball is the one that I will just never really follow. As much as I love playing and watching sports, I find the hype around it to be really stupid and it frankly annoys me. 

I don't show this and when he's excited I let him get excited without ruining his fun. I listen to him talk and engage in the conversation to the best of my ability. Right now my city is going crazy and my boyfriend is beyond excited. He is, as I write this, practically rioting downtown with his friends to celebrate the big win. I know he's going to want to talk about it or whatever but I just don't care about it anymore. I really just do not give a single shit about the games that just happened and I just find it irritating having to pretend to be interested just to have something to talk about with strangers who are excited about it.

So I have been accepted to and am planning on going to a university that my sister graduated from and is now working at in administration. She is one of the biggest reasons I am going there because she is my legal guardian, which means that i get a large tuition discount because she works there. She recently asked for a raise and received a small one that she is not happy with. Now that I am going to be turning 18, she won't be getting my social security anymore, but she also won't have to be paying for anything for me, so in my eyes it seems like she should be fine. Her husband also lives with her, but has no job, and is supposedly currently looking for one but every job he's had in the past few years he has quit or been fired from for no good reason. Instead of trying to get her husband to pitch in, she is trying to find a job that will pay her more, which will make me lose the tuition discount that is the biggest reason I want to go to this school.  Without her help, I will either have an extreme amount of debt or not be able to go to college at all. Am I being selfish/ an asshole? I feel kind of guilty but I kind of resent her right now because it seems like it's not even a factor in whether she stays or not. I know that she is not the asshole at all here, it's either I am TA or nobody is. You can decide that.

Edit: Just to make it clear, I am in no way going to try to stop her from getting a different job or lash out at her about it or anything, but I just feel like she really wanted me to go here BECAUSE she would be able to get me a tuition discount, making me excited about it as well.

Edit: I also wanted to make it clear that my parents are dead and that legally, they are my guardians and parental figures. Not that this means that I'm not the asshole, but I think people are taking some of this post as my sister being just my sister, and not my parent, which she is. And also, that I shouldn't be talking about my brother in law like a deadbeat when in reality it's more like my dad being a deadbeat.

The guys car is also only 2 inches away from my rear and I say out loud to my family ""look at this idiot. Parked his car too close how do we get out? "". Then I hear a voice from behind ""I can move that for you"" and he goes in and pulls out. I feel bad and I only said that because 1)he was on a red curb 2)he was really close to my car

c0gdaf	2019-06-14 05:31:35	GroundbreakingMud2	AITA for not donating to the end of year gift collection at my kid's school?	"My child attends a private school. The school accepts kids as young as 2.5 up through 5th grade. Two times a year - for the holidays and at the end of the school year - the head of the parent committee asks the class parents at the school to collect ""donations"" from each class that go towards buying gifts and cards. 80% of the money each class collects goes to the main and support teacher. 20% go to administrators and various other teachers like art and gym. They suggest $20-100, however in the past we have gotten follow up emails saying the contribution pot was low and encouraged us to give more.

My other child goes to daycare which accepts infants through pre-k. They also collect money, but only at holiday time. They ask for $25. All the money goes into a big pot and is evenly divided among teachers and kitchen staff.

I have no issue showing my appreciation to teachers - they are underpaid and have a hard job. I do strongly disagree with admins taking a cut of what should go entirely to teachers. So, instead of donating to the collection, I buy amazon gift cards and give them to the main and support teachers directly.

Am I the asshole for bypassing the collection and giving my ""donation""? Even though it hurts the gym and art teacher too?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My son recently decided to stop being friends with a kid who he seemed to be really good friends with. His buddy did something pretty bad and he made the choice not to associate with him.

My sons blunt and told this to his friends face. It hurt his feelings. Mom confronted me and wanted me to make him change his mind and apologize for “being mean”.  I told her I won’t make that choice for my son but I’ll go talk to him. 

So moms standing there wanting a resolution on the spot I walk to my son whose playing at the park after school and I give him the scoop. I tell him not to let me sway his opinion, there’s no right answer, and he’s not in trouble  and if he truly felt this way to stand by his choice and I’d back him up.  So I walked back over and said my son isn’t changing his mind and I refuse to make him. 

 The Mom says the kids are to young to split into groups and doesn’t want to see the kids divided. So I should mend the fence, I think my kids have a mind of their own. 

So AITA?

And now my fiend Mia has a ponytail that pulls her hair back and makes it look like she has a big forehead. So one day I noticed this and called her big forehead to annoy her and she said to stop. I didn’t stop tho because I remembered how they made fun of me and I thought this was kind of revenge for that. Now my friend group is calling me an asshole and saying what I should apologize to her for that but I don’t know because they never apologized for any of the stuff they said about me.

c0gaz4	2019-06-14 05:23:45	throwwayawayoverther	AITA for not defending partner from threat by my family?	"I put the important details that give context to why my sister loathes him enough to threaten him.

I’ve (32F) have known partner (34M) since high school. We dated on and off in college. After a few years apart, we reconnected and started a relationship.5 years in, things are going well. Partner proposes. Wedding plans are made, dress is purchased, deposits are put down on a venue, when my partner totally changes: he gives me the silent treatment, starts harping on my flaws and where we are more different, says we don’t fit but doesn’t break up with me. I’m very emotional throughout, trying to explain how badly I feel and how cold he’s being and what can I do to make things better.  I reach a breaking point after about 5 months of this and return the ring. I move out, devastated.

9 months later, we get back together, he mini re-proposes.  Thenhe falls back into the same pattern as before: silent treatment, cold, emotionally withdrawn, rude and dismissive of how I feel (I’d cry and try again to explain how I was feeling, there was some gaslighting as to nothing occurring like what I was talking about). Then I discovered after 2 months of this that he was cheating: I broke up with him, gave him back the ring and moved out again and started my grad program.

We have slowly been putting the relationship back together after a year (therapy and true horror/repentance on his part). Enter my family: they hate him. After years together they were close with my partner. The first time around they were sad for me and saw how devastated I was (I cried a lot and was pretty depressed during this period). They expressed concern when we got back together. After the second breakup and cheating, they basically think he’s a liar, used up years of my life and played with my love for him and threw it away, and that I am an idiot for trying to go to therapy or forgiving him. I don’t really try to change their views: enough things have occurred that a lot of their feelings are grounded in events and statements and truth.

So at home, my sister sees my partner at an event this evening (they work for the same large company but different buildings/departments).  She hasn’t seen him in probably a year and half. She tells him that if he is fucking with me again, she will destroy him. She texts me about this interaction, as does my partner (he doesn’t go into details).

I feel conflicted. As a partner, I should probably admonish my sister, and my instinct is to apologize to my man on her behalf. But there’s an equal part of me that’s like, my sister’s feelings aren’t invalid or wrong, and my partner made this mess and did lie and cheat, so while he doesn’t deserve threats, it’s reasonable that he would receive them

c0gahf	2019-06-14 05:22:10	T1SSU3	AITA for trying to disassociate myself with a socially awkward peer	" 

Ok so basically their is this kid, let’s call him Ryan, who me and multiple other kids on our street used to be friends with. We all were friends with him during pre k.Over the years the relationship faded and we stopped talking as much. Eventually it came to a point where I rarely spoke to him ever, but me and the other kids would still hang out and do things together. Since middle and high school, he drifted away from everyone until he was just another random kid in the neighborhood. This happened because we just started enjoying and doing different things.Another thing to mention is that all the parents on the street are close (new years parties, etc). So since we all knew each other for about 10 years, so did our parents. All the moms also have a groupchat. One day out of nowhere all of our parents started getting messages from Ryan's mom requesting us to hang out with and include Ryan in future activities, we didn’t think much of it at the time, but one day we were all buying food at harris teeter (grocery store) when we ran into Ryan’s mom, she greeted us, said a couple things and left. Before the day ended, I got a message from Ryan stating that next time we go to harris teeter we should invite him as well, and that he can contribute (pay money as well ). Then a short time later his mom decided to invite all of us kids to a party at his house, nobody wanted to go as we didn’t really talk to him at all, but our parents forced us to go and called us out for being assholes in a sense. Once we went to his “party” we tried interacting with him but he barely spoke and it was a very weird and awkward experience. These “parties” happened a couple more times after that and again we were forced to join in. Then one day I decided to invite a couple friends over to my house (people from different areas as well) and we decided to go to Olive Garden. Some of my friends decided to go home and get money and come back, while they were gone Ryan’s mom must of seen them and she messaged all the Mom’s and said that Ryan was feeling excluded and that she as a mother didn’t know what to do about it, then all of us were forced to invite Ryan to olive garden or our parents wouldn’t allow us to go. While inviting Ryan, Ryan's father came to my house and decided to have a small talk with some of the boys. He eventually started to talk about Ryan and why we were excluding him. At the very end of the conversation he asked us if we started drinking yet (freshman btw) and we said no, he then continued to tell us that once we started to drink we could drink with him. Then for the next couple weeks Ryan started following us everywhere, after swim practice, pool parties, etc. It felt kind of weird for him trailing us. So reddit me and my friends are posting this to see if we are assholes if we try and get out of this “friendship”.



Edit - forgot to add that his dad also said some stuff about how Ryan quit chess and other activities so he could try and fit in and be like us, he apparently also started watching football to connect with us. Idk if it’s relevant information but just in case.

In comparison to this, I take pride in the cleanliness of my car's interior, free of unnecessary devices or junk.

I was turning 18 the week after the cruise so we decided to celebrate it on the cruise (I had 0 clue this was happening) 
we head to the main restaurant and sit down to eat, after dinner I was picking my dessert and I hear the happy birthday song start, I then have a crowd of people surrounding me and singing happy birthday. I had tears in my eyes and was starting to cry because I was not able to leave and I had around 50 eyes on me and it made my anxiety 10 times worse, I looked at my mum and was not pleased. 

after they left I got death glared by my dad and I sat there kinda annoyed. I also did not eat my cake as it was chocolate and I hate chocolate. way to sweet and makes me sick. 

my family seemed annoyed that I was not super happy and got even more when I refused my cake (it was a mini one)

after talking with my mum it turns out she booked it and then realized I would hate it but never canceled it.

So I’m the younger sibling here and when I was a little younger, my older brother has asked me to get things for him. He’d ask me to bring him a bottle of water, cup of juice or soda, a bowl of cereal or something he forgot to get for him. I continued to do this with no objections until this year. I figured that he’s old enough, he is capable of standing up, walking downstairs and getting his own stuff for himself instead of bothering me. So I started to say no to him. This resulted in him getting mad at me and answering back with responses like “Dude, can’t you just do me this one favor,” or “Come on, don’t be an asshole.” I still say no and sometimes he actually does it for himself. It wasn’t until today where I felt a little pissed.  I had just come upstairs to chill on my computer after heating up some fries. He was there sitting playing apex legends on our ps4 when he looked at me and asked to get him water. I told him no and to just get it himself after he was done with his game, but he kept arguing and calling me a dick because he was in a middle of a game. After getting tired of his arguing, I said fine and I went downstairs to get him his water. After, I took my fries and went to a different room to think and eat my food while writing this. I started to think that he is my older brother, but does he really have the right to continue to make me do these things for him? Am I really the asshole like he says I am?

c0fwct	2019-06-14 04:36:55		AITA For telling my neighbor I'd go to dinner with him and his friend?	"So i'll try to explain this the best I can. For context I'm in my twenties. I have an older neighbor (in his late 40s/early 50s I'd guess) who has been my neighbor for a few years. I'll call him Bob. My boyfriend knows of him, they've talked and have been friendly. The neighbor like's to invite me and my kid (toddler age) out sometimes for dinner or lunch just to be nice since he makes good money and likes to spend it and he's also very talkative. I usually politely decline as I'm very shy but occasionally I'll say sure (each time I've EVER said sure my boyfriend has gone with me). So this is what happened:

My neighbor has a friend who's about the same age as him. My neighbor said this friend wanted to take me out to dinner. The neighbor was talking about all of us fitting in the car, etc, we'll have to figure out the car seat for the kid, etc. etc. So I assume ""Oh, we're all going. Okay that's fine "" and shrugged and said sure. 

So over the next few days Bob is trying to give me his friend's number (which I'm like, why do I need his number? He can just get ahold of Bob. A bit weird but whatever). Bob is telling me that his friend has money he likes to spend, has a nice car, etc. and once again I'm just thinking ""uh okay, that's cool"". Not really thinking much of it. I'm starting to think this sounds a little weird but it doesn't cross my mind at all that he's trying to set me up with his friend because he knows for a fact that I have a boyfriend.

So today Bob stops me again to talk as I'm walking into my place. He asks if I'm still down for dinner and before I say anything he says this ""And maybe you can find a babysitter? My friend doesn't like kids running around on the first date. And I don't know what type of relationship you have with your boyfriend but maybe idk you don't have to tell him you know"" I was so \*shocked\* and it was only then I realized he was trying to set me up with his friend. I didn't know what to say so I just nodded and said I had to go and closed the door on him. I go straight to my phone and text my boyfriend (who's at work) what happened and how I felt uncomfortable. My boyfriend proceeds to call Bob immediately and chew him out. Bob said that I kept saying yes and I was interested so I'm the one in the wrong and it's not his fault. 

So basically now my neighbors (Bob and his family) are mad at me because my boyfriend called to chew Bob out and because I closed the door on Bob's face. They think I'm in the wrong because I had agreed to going to dinner and seemed interested in the friend (I wasn't - at all).

I live in a house in a suburb, and everyone has a curb out the front of their house. My house has plenty of curb space. So does my neighbour. A few months ago I got a new neighbour that has been putting her bins next to mine, between our driveways. She parks her car out the front of her house on her lawn, so I guess she doesn't want to maneuver her car/the bins around each other on bin day? There's room for both, but you wouldn't be able to put the bins in/out while the car is there without some man handling of the bins.

The way our property is divided, if I assume the fence is correct and invisibly continued all the way to the curb, she would have maybe a foot of space between her driveway and that invisible line that she could put one bin in if she hugged it right against her driveway. That's not where she puts it, just saying for all fairness it isn't entirely mine though 80% of it is.

The reason it annoys me is: if and when anything falls out of the bin when it's emptied, it's going to blow into my yard and be my problem. She also leaves them out for days after they've been emptied which just bothers me since I feel like I'm already letting it slide and she's not appreciating that, so they're constantly out the front since she only seems to take them back in for a day or two a week to fill them. I take some care in my yard and I also know burglars can sometimes assume a house is empty when bins are left out. And lastly I take care of that little strip of land that's probably hers, kill the weeds etc.

Keeping in mind I've never met this woman, WIBTA to ask her to stop putting her bins in front of my house?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	430.0	26.0	0.0	0.0

c0ft7v	2019-06-14 04:27:48	throwaway123294	AITA for wanting to move out from my mother?	"Hey all, throwaway account cause people know me on Reddit.

&#x200B;

I'm currently at a bit of an emotional crossroads, and I'm really struggling with making this decision. Let me give you some background details.

&#x200B;

I (M17) am high-funct aspie, and I've always valued independence above most other things. One of my proudest moments was buying my first car with my own savings. I'm also fairly easy going, allowing for mistakes because, hey, you learn from your mistakes. I've also recently escaped high school, where I was bullied pretty badly, and come out as bisexual during this time. 

&#x200B;

My mother (F57) has never really understood how I worked. She's temperamental, organised to a T and a clean freak, and often fights with me about my habits. She has:

\- Lied to me about being gluten free and dairy free (I wasn't, she and the rest of my family are, and they didn't want me to bring foods they would trigger their allergies. While I understand the logic, I found out earlier this year, and not from them)

\- Been fairly uncomfortable with me since I came out. Not openly aggressive, but noticeably different. 

\- Slowly but surely clamping down on my independence. I'm no longer allowed to leave without telling her where I'm going, allowed to have my own alcohol in the house (problematic for when I turn 18 soon), and I have a 11pm curfew.

However, I also know she's going through some major stress at the moment. She was recently fired (she told me she quit) from her job, and her mother (my grandmother, who lives in another country) has Alzheimers, which she's taken the brunt of. I really don't want to send her over the edge, but I really can't stand living around her. I love her, but I think small doses is best for me at the moment.

&#x200B;

What do I do? Am I an arsehole to move out? My financial situation is fragile, but enough to support myself if need be.

c0frpm	2019-06-14 04:23:08	makerofwid0ws	AITA for telling my mom about my friend's shitty home life?	"(TLDR at end)

&#x200B;

First, I want to clarify that this happened when I was in middle school/high school, I have since graduated high school, but I never really got closure on if I did a shitty thing or not, so this subreddit sort of spoke to me. Here's the story, sorry for length.

&#x200B;

When I was just starting my freshman year I was entering high school with a group I had known since about 6th grade. One of these girls (we'll call her K) had constantly complained to our group chat about how terrible her home life was, how she never really received attention from her parents, they were emotionally abusive, etc. She had texted the group that she had tried to hug her mom and she pushed K away. I was on my way to church at the time and mentioned to my mom that I thought K was being abused at home, which concerned my mom, and I told the chat I said this.  


My phone BLEW UP over the next hour. I didn't read anything because I was at church but my friends were pissed. They literally even tried to come to my house, but I wasn't there (In retrospect, I had no idea what they planned on doing if I was there) but they believed I shouldn't have said anything.  


I'm not trying to ask for sympathy or guilt trip, but that was a really rough point for me. I literally lost all my friends after that going into high school which was scary enough on its own, and it made the first half of my freshman year pretty much dogshit.  


Basically, I felt justified in telling my mom because I was worried about my friend's safety, and my friends thought that I was in the wrong for saying anything because K was ""handling it"" and didn't want anything to happen between her and her little brother. In the end, nothing ever came of it and she still lives with them (She's the same age as me)

After 6 months my financial situation changed dramatically and I was forced to take a second job. I tried to make it work so I could still take care of him but the new job would mean he would be alone for over 12 hours a day. I put out a listing and extensively interviewed candidates and eventually settled him in with a loving family who he fell in love with instantly. They send me regular updates/pictures and I'm in tears over how happy he is. 

That was 3 months ago. Every single day I walk into an empty house that doesn't feel like home anymore. However my friend told me about someone he knows who is looking for a home for a cat that they have.

c0fohi	2019-06-14 04:13:40	lxx133	AITA for flipping the bird in front of a child?	"TLDR: a mom lost it bc I flipped off a stranger for nearly hitting my car. Am I trash or am I not?

So, the story is set in MA aka the land of asshole drivers & all I wanted was my tiramisu cake. 

The bakery is located on a busy main street & has a small parking lot. You can't always pull safely into the lot so I signalled early to give people time to pass me. Naturally, I was most of the way in when a car started to pull out of their spot so I halted. Out of nowhere, a car is up my bum on the main street & lays on the horn at me before peeling around & flipping me off. I felt righteously indignant so I rolled down my window to return the gesture. 

As I'm pulling my arm back in, I see a mother & preteen have exited the bakery during this interaction. The burby mom is already shaking her head & wagging her index finger & I'm sitting there like lame duck thinking, ah come on they're after me on all sides today. The kid looks embarrassed & the mom comes at the front of my car & up to my window, which I could not be rolling up faster.

She says: We go high when they go low, and I was like yeah, ok, just leave me alone lady. She then told me what I did was trash & I am trash. At this point my window was mostly up but I was peeved so I kept it cracked for listening. I told her she wasn't my mother & to leave me alone (real mature, I know but I'm in my late twenties getting scolded by a woman maybe 10 yrs older than me), like go be with your own child, I don't need a lesson. I had regrets the moment I mentioned the child because then she lost it screaming at me. 

I wasn't looking for a fight & thought she was a loose canon for coming on foot guns blazing at a stranger in a car. She started walking away at this point screaming & I was like alright alright sorry I upset you, have a nice mother's day, which was similarly not well received. I meant it as a white flag but she already hated me.

She drove away mad while I picked up my cake with an accelerated heart rate. I don't think I was right for flipping the other car off. It was purely reactionary & had I seen the young girl, I probably would have refrained from throwing a middle finger in the air. I also don't think the woman had any fair grounds to insert herself physically & verbally into a confrontation that she had no stakes in just because I did something semi rude in public. I had literally just finished engaging in an incident of road rage. What lesson did she think she would teach me? What reaction was she looking for? Like I could have been insane & shot her or run her down. 

I'm inclined to think we both suck. Like I get it, I'm a jerk throwing a middle finger up but if that makes me trashy, she's just as trashy for engaging the way she did. You can't just walk up on someone's car and call them trash without being a bit trashy yourself imo. I've had varied reactions recounting this in full & am happy to provide more information. 

I accept any judgment, I've been the Ahole before and I'm sure I'll be one again."	Not the A-hole	0	0	31.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

c0fmpf	2019-06-14 04:08:32	Throwaway05052019	AITA for telling off my brother-in-law	"So, a few weeks ago my sister & brother-in-law(BIL) had to stay with me & my parents for a couple of weeks while some renovations were being done to their house.

I have a German Shepherd, he’s 11 & a half years old & I’ve had him since he was 6 months old. Where I live out in the rural parts, there’s no leash law & the small private neighborhood I live in dogs are free to roam. My neighbors have dogs, all of which are spayed/neutered & my dog’s familiar with them since they’ve been here as long as he has. They all stay in their own yards mostly & the only time they venture out is to go to the neighbors pond to swim & cool off & the neighbors say they are cool with it.

My sister has a small dog we’ll call Squirt, he’s some sort of jack russell/chihuahua/weenie dog mix. I reminded my sister that my dog is territorial, he doesn’t tolerate unfamiliar dogs on his turf, especially if they aren’t neutered, mine is, hers isn’t. I told her even though he’s old, a little hard of hearing, more arthritic & seemingly slow, she shouldn’t underestimate him because he can surprise you. When she took her dog out to use the bathroom she made sure my dog was in the opposite yard. It worked fine the first few days, but one evening she was late taking him out & my dog saw them & made a bee-line for Squirt. My sister picked him up before my dog got to him, & put her arm out in his opened mouth to keep him from biting Squirt. My dog realized what’s happening, doesn’t bite her, & lets go. Funnily enough, he’d just went for a swim in the pond & smelled seven kinds of terrible, lol. During this fiasco, my sister lost her balance & fell to the ground. My dog while trying to get out of the way ends up falling over her & getting her just as filthy & stinky as he was. She finally gets her self sorted, comes back to the house with Squirt & gets a much needed shower. 

My sister wasn’t mad or angry, she said she didn’t think he could be so fast for his age. When she told the story to BIL, mom & dad, my BIL said that my dog better be glad he stopped when he did & didn’t bite her because he would have shot him. At this point I’m like seriously WTF!? So I said yeah, well if you shoot him, you better make sure you dig 2 holes, because your ass will be going in one of them! 

He was mad I said that, but I told him this is my dog’s home, he was doing what’s natural for him or any dog. For him to shoot my dog for protecting his property would be as stupid as me shooting him for protecting something of his.. My dad said I overreacted & it’s just a dog (he said this trying to be rational & diffuse the situation, but made it seem like my dog didn’t matter), but it’s not just any dog, it’s MY DOG, & he’s been with me & this family for 11 & a half years. 

I didn’t apologize for what I said, nor do I intend to. I meant every word of it, my BIL didn’t apologize either, he was still serious about shooting him & wouldn’t listen to reason."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	4.0	0.0	0.0
c0fm4h	2019-06-14 04:06:48		AITA for my friends car getting towed	"I live in an apartment complex where the only visitor parking is in the front of the building of which theres only like 10 spots for and ever since I have been living here (it's been almost a year) we have never had any problems. Multiple people have parked there over night before including that same friend but tonight after we came back from getting dinner his car was gone. We saw that the tow truck was towing another car in front and rightfully assumed what had happened. 
When we got to the impound lot where his car was we asked how long have they been towing in the front of the building and he said that they have always done that but this has never been a problem before and we've never heard of this happening to anyone of our friends living here. Clearly no one else know about this either because by the time we got the to impound lot the worker there said he had already towed three cars from the front. The fine ended up being $250 and he was really upset (which makes sense) but then he started talking about how he was mad at me and my roommate for it too."	Everyone Sucks	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c0flkf	2019-06-14 04:05:09	nahyeaoksurefine	WIBTA if I put up a privacy fence to prevent neighbor kids from having access to my dog?	"I'm moving at the end of the month to a duplex. The neighbor's side of the duplex clearly has a bunch of young kid stuff in the yard. We'll be sharing a chain link fence, so I know the kids are going to be able to see my dog in my yard. I don't have kids and I don't feel comfortable with kids petting her/playing with her, since she's never really been around them. I think it's kind of a liability issue for me and an unnecessary risk for the kids. She's also a smaller breed, and super trusting, so I'm always cautious about her falling if being carried or her being accidentally stepped on, and I know how younger kids can be with that. 

I feel like kind of AH about it, but my plan is to immediately put up a privacy barrier after we move, maybe something bamboo-looking, on my side of the fence to prevent contact through the fence. I don't want to be rude or to come off in a way that might offend my neighbors, but I don't want their kids playing with my dog. I'd honestly rather not have to confront them unless the kids actually enter my yard or something."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My dad took his own life a year and a half ago, so obviously father relationships are a sensitive topic for me.  My dads birthday was June 22nd so it’s also a sensitive time for me.  My relationship with my stepdad isn’t the greatest, we argue a lot and he’s harsh on me, but I’m told it’s “out of love”

I decided to give my stepdad a card and not give him a tangible gift.  I just gave him a card that had a joke in it and wished him happy Father’s Day, and I said I loved him  and hugged him.  

My mom is now pissed off at me for not getting him anything and said it was an asshole move since I got gifts for my dad when he was alive.

Well i thought i was being sweet and slipped a starbucks giftcard in the card I had gotten her. Well when we exchanged our cards she got upset that there was a starbucks giftcard in her card. She kept going on about how impersonal it was. And that she would give those to her coworkers that were leaving her team at work. I got slightly offended because it was just a little something extra since we dont do actual gifts, and not to be petty but I didnt get anything other than the card. But now we're fighting and all shes saying is she wanted flowers instead of the giftcard. Am i the asshole for not getting her flowers instead?

Edit: yes i know flowers would be the more romantic thing to do. In my eyes flowers are kind of cliche. Everyone does it, and they will die in about a week. 
I also have a hard time buying flowers for her when she asks for them every other week. I know getting them would make her happy but my personal view on it is that a gift like flowers should be spontaneous and not when she asks for them. If she knows shes getting them whats the point?"
