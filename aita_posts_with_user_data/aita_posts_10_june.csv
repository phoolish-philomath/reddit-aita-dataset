bz7pcb	2019-06-11 03:59:53		Aita for getting mad at bf and his mom	So my fiance's mom, accidentally texted me, taking shit about him. She said that he and I were hermits coz we haven't had her over to our new house (we're still unpacking). She also said that she has been driving by our house a couple times a week. I'm livid,  he says it's no big deal. He went over to see her and apologized for me, told her I'm having health problems and haven't got the house in order and that's why we haven't had her over. Now I'm even angrier, with him. I'm a functioning agoraphobe, and have PTSD and anxiety. I have to mentally prepare myself before interacting with most people. He is too, in fact, he doesn't do family events unless I accompany him and sometimes insist that we go. I've gotten into gardening big time since we moved in; and now I'm afraid to go to the front yard in case she does her usual drive bys and I have to interact with her unprepared. I literally feel violated. My family doesn't live close so he never has to deal with bad behaviour from my mom and dad. I feel that it's unfair that he's unsupportive, blames me and is generally nonchalant about my discomfort with this whole thing. AITA?		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Since college started 2 years ago they have distanced themselves in varying degrees from the Church. One is now Wiccan and the other two practice no religion. I understand religious differences and growing into different people but I have a problem with the repetitive, hurtful jabs at Catholicism that they make in our group chat. Repeatedly making comments about how all catholic priests are awful, how Catholics should be “cancelled”, how Catholics are homophobic and disgusting. These are all generalities they make with no concern for how they make me feel. They tweet similar things. I stand up for myself and my faith but am brushed aside because it is 3 against 1. I muted them all on twitter and have been silent in the group chat. WIBTA if I ended the friendships with them with no explanation? It would be a lot less dramatic and easier in my opinion. Their friendships do not make me feel any better as a person and I have nothing in common. I just don’t know if I owe them a reason after 6+ years of friendship.	Not the A-hole	0	0	14.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

bz7lw9	2019-06-11 03:49:58	BrontosaurusStore	WIBTA for writing a book that I know would hurt a mentally ill former friend?	"I struggled with mental health issues for most of my childhood and adolescence, and almost all of my friends growing up were ""problem kids.""  I don't think any of us were bad people, but all of our problems combined to create an incredibly dysfunctional friend group.  I'd like to write a memoir about our experiences, but I know that at least one ex-friend would be extremely hurt by this.

""Kayla"" was my childhood best friend and would be a major character in my book.  I believe that in what I've written so far, I've presented her fairly: she could be arrogant and abrasive, but this was because she was struggling with several mental illnesses (borderline, PTSD, and others) and trauma from an abusive childhood.  (And obviously, I am changing names and details to protect her identity.)

Still, I know that if I publish this and she ever finds out about it, she will be very upset.  A lot of what I discuss is deeply personal (for instance, the abuse and neglect she suffered).  I'm sure that having any of this published, even with her identity obscured, would leave her feeling violated.  I also think that she would be angry at the negative light in which her family is portrayed.  For most of her childhood, she was in denial that her parents were abusive, and I think that even now, she would feel defensive of them.  Also, she expressed a desire in the past to write her own memoir about her life, and would probably feel hurt by me ""stealing"" her story.

I have not been in contact with Kayla for several years.  I'd like to interview some of my other childhood friends if they're willing, but I'm scared even to contact Kayla and tell her I'm writing about her, because I know that conversation would not go well.

I feel like I'm the asshole because I want to write about another person's problems in a way that I know would hurt them.  At the same time, I feel like that's unreasonable: if writers had to respect everyone's wishes, almost no biographical writing could be published.  I've been going back and forth on this for several years and can't decide whether what I'm thinking of doing is okay or not.  I think I have a right to write about events that I witnessed, but I also can't shake the feeling that I'm doing something really wrong.

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are asking why I want to share this information to begin with and whether I need to disclose Kayla's abuse to tell my story.  So, what I'm struggling with is that as a result of abuse, Kayla acted out in ways that negatively affected me.  For instance, I had depression that became a lot worse when she consistently told me I was ugly/stupid/etc.  Obviously I can discuss that without going into her backstory.  The reason why I wanted to delve into her backstory is that without that context, she comes off badly, and that isn't really a fair portrayal.  She did a lot of inappropriate things, and they were pretty much all motivated by trauma."	Asshole	0	0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bz7lqj	2019-06-11 03:49:30	hugsalot12	AITA for calling out gymnastics school for poor management?	"I called a gymnastics school a month ago asking about summer classes. I wanted to start after dance was done, 3 weeks away. The person said they had a 6:30 class on Tuesday and the summer classes started after June 1. Perfect. They take down our information (no credit card) and I move on with my life. 

Tuesday after June 1, we have a call from the school saying they don’t have a 6:30 class on Tuesday and don’t know how we were told there was one. The school said they had a 6:00 on Thursday. We pick up our daughter from daycare (in her leotard) and tell her that gymnastics is now on Thursday. She is sad but we do our best to keep her mind off it. 

Thursday comes and we arrive early to register. At 6:05 I ask where her class is. They tell me there isn’t a 6:00 class. Only a 5:30  on Thursday. At this point I tell them about how they told me 6:00 Thursday. I don’t understand how this has happened twice in 3 days. 

The school does take my daughter into the 5:30 so she can at least do a little bit of the class. The receptionist then shows me the schedule. None of the classes work with my work schedule. I know 5:30 is only a half hour sooner but my husband and I work till 5:30 and we’re already needing to leave early to make 6. The school said they would call Friday. They didn’t and I found another school and scheduled a trial class somewhere else. I looked online Thursday night and online they did list a 6PM Thursday class for her. 

I posted the review on Facebook basically stating the facts of what happened and that we would be going somewhere else that could figure out when the class is. I felt that they needed to know that what they had done wasn’t okay. I had expressed that to the receptionists but was basically dismissed twice. I was moving on. 

Today, I got a reply from them on Facebook from the owner stating that she (the owner) was on vacation, and the receptionist had left the week before so those people were filling in. She offered some free classes and asked us to call her. 

At this point, I feel like we are moving on and I don’t want free classes because I think the expectation is they can win us and our tuition money for the summer back. The class my daughter got to do while I sat and fumed went great, but I don’t think that a school that doesn’t know when to have students there is good for me.

Am I the asshole for posting my feelings about a company online and then declining free classes offered after a bad review?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	111.0	54.0	0.0	0.0
bz7k6o	2019-06-11 03:44:46		AITA For being upset with my GF, her mother and her family for sharing my medical issue?	"Last week I had to go the ER and was in too much pain to drive, so I got my girlfriend to drive me. After a few hours we left and I set up an appointment with a specialist to get a second opinion. My girlfriend and I have been dating for a long time, so I told her the details of that doctors visit. 

But... she tells her sister. Her sister and I are close, but she’s married to someone I do not care for. He in turn told my GF’s mother, who proceeded to attack me with questions at a large (60+ person) event. If I had it my way, this information would have been kept on a need to know basis.

GF’s M: “Why didn’t you tell me you had a *redacted*?! I’m worried sick! Is it cancerous? Will they have to operate?” 

I was extremely embarrassed. I’m a very private person, and having my information nearly yelled for all to hear was humiliating. I responded with light anger and told her not to ask or talk to anyone about it again. Later that day I told my GF how upset I was with the situation and how I do not want anyone being told anything about my health in the future. 

I asked for an apology from my GF’s sister and mother and now everyone is saying that I’m being an asshole “for demanding someone apologize for being concerned about me,” but I’m mad at how my information was shared without my consent and how it was put on display for multiple people who have zero to do with any of it. I’m not dying, nor is this something that’s impeding my ability to live an enjoyable life so why does anyone have the right to know about it?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

**Original Post**
Recent lurker and officially joined and decided to make my first post to determine - WIBTA here...

The backstory -This guy I started talking to has an ex wife and a daughter with her; then also an ex fiancé and two children with her. We met on bumble and when he said he might still be in the midst of legal trouble with the ex fiancé. I immediately said (prior to meeting), “well then, let’s just be f*ck buddies!”  We had sex the first night we met then spent the next three days together non stop. 

Needless to say, feelings developed and now we’re “talking” with intentions of getting serious. Not a single day goes by without us talking to each other. We’re both very busy so since we don’t see each other often we’re not making things completely official yet however, he’s stated we’re exclusive and we both got off dating apps. 

So, the dilemma - He went to his daughters soccer game and his ex wife tried kissing him in front of the kid and friends. He told me about it and I blew up. I felt weird. I told him that if there’s a chance he wants to get back with her then he shouldn’t pursue things with me. He said he curved her advance and just wanted to be honest with me. I then apologized for snapping and we moved on. Until, just one week later when the ex fiancé dropped off the kids and tried to make a move on him as well. She apparently asked to hook up one more time. He again told me about said situation. I honestly was kind of dumbfounded.

I am a professional who put my career first and so I don’t have kids at the moment. He has three and two exes that apparently are still trying to hit it. 

AITA for snapping at him when he was being truthful to me about what happened?

bz7fyu	2019-06-11 03:29:45		AITA if I insist on taking the bigger bedroom in our new apartment?	"Hola, people of reddit! I am in a bit of a moral quandary here regarding an upcoming move.

For background: I have a roommate. She moved in a couple years ago because my previous roomie left suddenly We get along but she's extremely lazy and never leaves her room except to make food. Recently we decided to change apartments for a variety of reasons (sketchy neighbours, rent too high, commute sucks, caretaker's kid is being a creepy weirdo, etc.). It was my idea at first but she got on board right away. We found a nice new place that's cheaper and way closer to our work.

Problem is, one of the bedrooms is a ""master bedroom"" and thus a bit bigger. She tried to say she should get the bigger room because I'm ""hardly ever in my room."" (Her definition of me ""hardly ever"" being in my room apparently means ""occasionally spending time in the living room"", whereas she basically lives in her room.)

I told her I don't think that's fair because I have a much larger bed. I have a california king bed that barely fits in my current room; she not only has a smaller bed, but it's also a loft bed, meaning she sits at her computer desk underneath it and thus has even *more* space. Plus I still spend plenty of time in my room. I have an active sex life, and sometimes I need to get work done in there because she doesn't understand that when I'm working in the living room with headphones on it means I don't want to be bothered. I think she wants the larger room for her VR gear (I've told her she can use it in the living room if she wants, but she doesn't feel like having to move her computer every time).

But regardless of bed size, I feel like I'm entitled to the bigger room because I've done 100% of the legwork making this move happen. She agreed we needed to move but then straight up told me she expected me to do all the apartment hunting. Then when I found potential places, she couldn't even be bothered to come view them with me. We had two chances to view the new place and she turned me down the first time because 11:30 AM was ""too early"" for her when she worked until 8:30 PM the night before. The second time she was worried she'd be late for her online D&D game.

This also meant I had to run back and forth across town getting her signature on paperwork and taking it back to the landlord. She's also contributed zilch to the hunt for an affordable moving company or discussions with current landlord (we had to extend our lease by a month).

tl;dr am I a dick for feeling entitled to the larger of two bedrooms when I did all the work securing the new apartment and roomie couldn't even be bothered to look at it? Judge me!"	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bz7f0u	2019-06-11 03:26:58	VallixxIsHere	AITA for wanting to live with my dad?	" 

So basically, my parents went through a nasty divorce when I was around 10 years old, lots of nasty texts, fighting, family clashes, and my mom cheated on my dad while still being technically married but living in separate homes. The Divorce really affected me the most out of me and my siblings (12F) (13M) who are both younger then me (15M). I've really hated my mom for the longest time, since she was the reason the divorce happened. She won't admit it, but she only divorced my dad so she could run off with this other guy.

Anyway, my parents share custody over the three of us, I go to my moms for a weekend and the following week, then my dads for the weekend and the following week, etc. Now, my mom lives on this really shitty dairy farm that her and her new husband (guy she cheated with) started up. This farm is out in the middle of no where, I have absolutely no friends in the area, and I of course, only have my learners license, so I can't get out of the damned house. I would bet good money if you called child protection services, they would say the house is unlivable, it's that old and trashy. I hate it there. I have a gaming laptop so I can play video games, but that gets extremely old after a while, and on top of that, my mother is also forcing me to work on this dairy farm. I know what you might be thinking, ""Oh.. OP is one of those lazy twats that sits in the basement and plays video games all day"", that's not who I am. I enjoy video games, but I get sick of them. I do have a job at a farm in the area of my dad's house, but I only work there when I'm with him, and I work every single day I have at my dads. I also workout every other day and get up at 4:00-5:00 AM every morning (I'm planning on enlisting out of high school). I love my life at my dads, his house is newly renovated and not rich at all, but it's a nice place, I can make coffee every morning, workout, and play Skyrim in the morning before school. After school, I go to my job and work 1-2 hours on school days, and two 2hr-4hr shifts on Saturday and Sunday. I am in no means lazy. I just hate my existence at my moms, there is nothing there that is contributing to my future, especially the fact I don't get along with her. I also am forced to go to this ridiculous church in the small town near the farm. There is absolutely nothing to do at her place, and until I get a car, it's going to stay like that. It doesn't seem like much a problem, but it just drags me down every time I'm at her place.

I've asked twice if I she would let me live with my father (very politely, I said I still would like to meet with her every week or every other week). Both times ended in a lot of shouting and her crying. So, there it is, AMITA for wanting to live with my dad?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	216.0	50.0	0.0	0.0

Hi, I am genuinely confused right now if I am being an asshole for being upset about a “joke” that my teacher made today. I was in class today and our teacher arrived a bit late. We were making fun of this because it’s a rule that if students are late to class, they get a letter grade off. Anyways, as he is joking around and saying “I know, I know, I’m sorry.” I say “It’s ok I’ll let it go this time.” Keeping with the light mood. He returns with “Well that’s ok because everyone hates you.” I was thrown off by this because of how out of the blue the statement was. My classmates laughed at this, making the general “Ooooh” statements. I laughed it off, because it felt appropriate, but inside was actually hurt deeply. When I mentioned it to some of my friends and classmates, they responded generally with “Well it was a joke, don’t think about it too much.” I understand it was meant as a joke, but I still feel like such words from a teacher are inappropriate. I also, at least to my knowledge, am a responsible and well-behaved student, which makes the fact that he said it to me a bit more hurtful. If I am in the wrong please let me know, but I just want to make sure I am not overreacting. Depending on what the general consensus is, I was planning to approach my teacher and just let him know that his comment stung. I generally can let insults roll off my back, but even though it was a “joke” it stuck with me.	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bz79t6	2019-06-11 03:12:09	spoogetti	AITA for making a friend storm out of my house over unruly demands? (Money related)	"Hi reddit, 

I have a friend who I like to throw work to from time to time to help him with his financials.  Just small odd jobs I need help with. We’ve never really had an argument before today. 

He has a power washer so he cleaned my deck for me, and we agreed to a set price.  No problems there.   While he was doing the deck I asked him if he was interested in helping me sell some hydroponic equipment since he had a truck and is usually a good guy to work with.  I told him I would give him 30% of the final sale (an expected $7-900 for maybe 4 hours of work).    My expectation was that he was going to prepare the equipment for sale, make sure it was cleaned and take some photos.  He was happy for the opportunity I thought and agreed to do it the next day (today).  

Today he shows up at 1 and I buy him lunch.  We get to my house at around 3 and I am in the basement where the equipment is working alongside of him.  Eventually I have other things to do, so I go upstairs and he continues to work for another 2 hours or so. 

When he’s all done he shows me his phone which has an invoice on it basically stating that he wanted $700 for the laborious part of the job today, in addition to 35% of the sale.   It adds up to about $1500, well over $120 an hour. Obviously I’m not paying this, I had no intention of paying him beyond the 30%, I would have even done 35 if he had asked me first before presenting me with an outrageous bill.

bz795e	2019-06-11 03:10:10		AITA for not wanting to live with my parents after graduation?	"My parents moved to Dubai from London the year before I started uni. Initially they said that they’d get a 3 bedroom pace (one for them, my brother and myself for when I visit) but what they found was a massive 2 bedroom apartment. I was pretty okay with this as I’d really only live there for a month or so at a time during holidays and I was chill with sleeping in the living room or sharing with my younger brother. 

I recently graduated and while the plan was to live in London (making this post obsolete) I managed to land a good job in Dubai with a salary a fresh graduate could only dream of in London. My dad can’t understand why I won’t live at home - the way he sees it it’s a rent free (we’re of Indian origin and parents charging their kids rent isn’t really as much of a thing with us as it seems to be in the UK and US) accommodation for as long as I’d like allowing me to save up some serious cash. I’d also be able to have all my meals sorted and spend time with family. 

I agree that these are all great advantages, but from my view I can’t, as a 22 year old graduate share a room with my teenage brother or be sleeping on my parents’ living room especially when I have the means to not do so, especially after 4 years of university. I need my privacy, and my brother hs privately expressed he needs his, which I agree with - he’s 16 after all. For what it’s worth, I don’t think my dad fully appreciates the privacy angle - he grew up very poor in India, sharing a room for most of his teenage years with his parents and has worked really hard to provide his family with a great home. The way he sees it it’s no big deal because hey, he had to do the same thing. It may also be made worse because I was looking at flats in the same area as my parents, so he doesn’t see the point in living so close to them, yet not being under the same roof."

I just agree with him to everything he says, despite the fact that I disagreed with almost all of it. He said that it’s offensive to the Christians in the room (I’m friends with people from several religions, and most of them were in that room, and we had all come to an understanding. Most of the other people don’t care or weren’t listening) and that it would be RIGHT for him to come up to me, even outside of school, to tell me not to say that. I knew I would be cutting it close on time with the final already and didn’t want to get into an argument.

bz76va	2019-06-11 03:04:10		AITA for wanting to stick my ex-girlfriend with our lease?	"First some backstory so you know just how horrible this girl really is...

So, we first started seeing each other last summer. We met at work and she we started hanging out on breaks. Over the next few months, we confess our love for each other, I leave my relationship because of how much happier I was with her. Fast forward to October and she says she's going to be moving 3 provinces away to live with her mother as she was still living with her ex and the lease was almost up with nowhere to go after that. Long story short, once the lease ended we renewed it, and we move in together.

Fast forward to January 2019, we move in together, everything is great. Over the next little bit our relationship deteriorated. She's one of those ""free spirit"" types and it became clear over the next couple months that she couldn't be in a healthy relationship, she felt ""tied down"", she ""gets bored"" of the relationship. She would shut down when something bothered her so, like any healthy relationship, I ask ""what's wrong?"". Every time I tried to have a conversation with her it never worked because she's incapable of adult discussion. So the issues built up to the point where I was fed up and just sent her a huge text about it.

Her response? ""Wow I guess if that is how you feel about me then it's not worth trying to fix things. Maybe it's just not working out."" So I'm pretty broken up about this wondering what I did wrong. She goes out the NEXT DAY and fucks some guy, comes home with a big ol hickey on her neck. So I say ""Wow you're not wasting any time huh"" and explain how it was a little fucked up and insensitive that she would just immediately go out and fuck someone the day after she breaks up with me. She goes ""Wow stop being pissy and passive aggressive with me"", storms off to the shower, and says ""I'm just going to go for a drive for an hour, you're pissing me off"". She then spends the next 30 minutes getting all dolled up. Yeah, clearly going for a drive. She didn't come home that night, and I'm not a fucking idiot. 

I thought about it and I didn't remember actually signing a lease. I gave my landlord my bank information but I didn't remember signing, so I called her to confirm. Turns out, when the lease was renewed, it was only renewed in her name. Turns out, I can legally rescind my banking information, tell her to go fuck herself, and move out without having to help her find a roommate. I can stick her with our rent, her car payment, her insurance payment, internet, electricity, 2 cats, groceries, her phone, gas. I know damn well she only has a bit of money to her name after bills are all said and done and that's with me paying my half of the rent and helping out with the other stuff.

She had a Chinchilla and a Cat. She let her Chinchilla roam around the apartment free and there was like a years worth of poop everywhere and the room reeked of cat piss. She moved out without cleaning anything and left it for me. I confronted her about it letting her know I didn’t appreciate the mess and was pretty upset about it and asked her to give me $20 for dealing with it. She told my roommate she wasn’t sure why I was so upset and that she simply forgot. She even has her mom defending her and making me out to be the asshole asking for $20 bucks.

Traffic Cone Neighbor has contributed to the gene pool, you see, and believes the cone and sign make it safer should Traffic Cone Offspring wander into the street.

If Traffic Cone Neighbor wants that stuff on their driveway, cool.  I just have a problem with it being in the street.  It's one more obstacle to dodge.

Few months ago we where at an after work event and where both a bit tipsy and got to talkin and I let slip that Ive had sex with another man once and had a few non sexual but sensual relations with men. 

Since then shes been dropping comments about it time and again, going on and on about how I should get myself a bf and such. Ive made it very clear to her that I dont apreciate it and that im uncomfortable with it, and it got better for a while. 

A few weeks ago we where both on our phones and I find a picture of one of those heat activated cups, going from pitch black to rainbow with the text ""Im Gay!"" on it. I show it to her and we both laugh and I think thats the end of it.

Last monday i show up at work and she said shes bought me a gift. Suprise suprise, its one of those cups. I get sorta pissy about it and ask her to take it back.

Now, I have never realy been comfortable talking about this before, not my own sexualuty, not about others, and I certainly dont think its my other coworkers business. Not that i dislike them or anything, but thats all that we are, coworkers.

Now shes mad at me for not accepting her gift, and also for repressing my sexuality (wut).

So I have a long drive to work and there’s a long road out in the country that is a one lane road that I travel on for 8 miles or so. There’s no posted speed limit so city laws say 55 is max speed, I usually go around 60-65 I’ll admit on the straight parts where I have a large line of sight. There’s a truck in front of me today that keeps braking and putting on his turn signal but then speeding back up and continuing on. I assume he doesn’t know where he’s going very well. He drives with his turn signal on for about 3 miles.

I’m giving him a lot of space cause I don’t feel like constantly braking. He goes up over a hill and I see him finally start to turn it looks like. I’m going 65 but slow down over the hill to 50-55mph. He was quite a ways ahead of me when I saw him start to turn in the distance about half a mile I’d say. So I didn’t slow down too much thinking he’d be done turning by the time I came over the hill. Well I come over the hill and he’s just sitting there straight in the road at a standstill with his turn signal on. I slam hard on my brakes but I can’t stop in time, so I check and there’s no oncoming traffic so I swerve around him to avoid a accident.

So I know I shouldn’t have been speeding and I probably should have slowed down more over the hill, but overall, who was the bigger asshole here? Me or the truck?

bz748r	2019-06-11 02:56:49		AITA for letting my gay roommate continue to give me massages after he admitted he was interested in me romantically?	"Okay I’m 24 and my roommate and I have lived together about 2.5 years. 

About 6 months ago he admitted he had feelings for me. If I wasn’t so oblivious I would have seen this coming but I didn’t. I’m pretty open minded and confident in my sexuality. He’s asked me to cuddle before and I was cool with that because who doesn’t like cuddling right? Writing it out, I guess it’s a bit weird but I always felt fine with it. He also frequently makes jokes (which apparently weren’t jokes) about the fact that he thinks I’m hot. But I always just laughed it off. 

The other thing that should have tipped me off is that he’s very touchy feely with me. Which brings me to the massages.

It’s not completely weird, I guess, because he actually does go to school for massage therapy. I have lasting shoulder issues from baseball so I get regular massages anyway. So it seemed like a great fit. 

The things is, one night he drunkenly admitted that he was really into me and that he sort of gets off on our massages. I was shocked but, again, probably shouldn’t have been. 

When we were both sober I explained that nothing is ever going to happen between us, which he understood. 

But I feel like i might be in the wrong now for basically letting him still do the massages and stuff for free. He also cooks for me all the time (which I basically never do for him) and he takes on the majority of other housework as well. Before I just figured he did all this because we were friends. But at this point I know he does this because he likes me in a different way than I like him...

This may sound bad, but, I don’t really want things to change. I’m pretty comfortable with how things are. Am I an ass if I just let things be?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I’ve been taking my dog there quite often and she’s always been great with the other dogs and most of them have been good with her. I’ve never seen any real issues between any of the dogs.

So we go to the gate where the other dogs are and I’m glad she’ll have some friends to play with. Her and the other dogs do the little through the gate sniffing. I go to open the gate and let her in and the owner says “I wouldn’t do that”. I’m obviously confused. He goes on to say that his dogs aren’t good with other dogs. So I tell him he really can’t be bringing his unfriendly dogs to the park, it’s for everyone. He then goes on to say they are okay with people and I tell him that’s not the point. He can’t have aggressive dogs there. He then tells me I can take my dog on the small side (which is maybe half the size). 
I tried to get him to understand he can’t do that and my dog isn’t even allowed over there and he just walks away from the gate."	Not the A-hole	0	0	326.0	15.0	0.0	0.0
bz72tz	2019-06-11 02:52:55	silver-moon-	AITA for “ostracizing” my crappy roommate?	"All this happened this past year. My university has a system where you can request roommates, and my four friends and I (all 18/19 F) all requested a suite together. Another friend wasn’t starting til spring semester, and we wanted to keep the sixth spot empty for her until she came. 

Unfortunately, my university’s housing decided to place some random girl (“Kylie”) with us as the sixth person. We weren’t happy, but we talked about it, and decided to try not to take our frustration out on her. 

It was okay at first, but then Kylie got really demanding and annoying. She insisted that everyone be quiet starting at 10 PM, she tried to move her random junk into the common area, and she insisted on being included in some of the stuff my friends and I did. She also told us we couldn’t speak our language around her (we all come from the same culture, except her) and she always accused us of gossiping. She’s also a different race from us, and I think her rude behaviour is fueled by racism. 

Finally, we had a small party for some of our friends, and a guy ended up shattering the glass on our end table (long story). Kylie refused to chip in on the repair costs, even though they were supposed to be split six ways. 

We are moving to an off-campus place this fall, and we will be happy not to deal with her high strung attitude. However, she’s in the same summer class as one of my friends/ roomies, and she hasn’t stopped talking crap about us since she moved. I think the whole situation was her fault/ the administration’s fault, but I want a ruling. Are we assholes?

E: people were asking, so I thought I’d clarify. 1) The table broke because our friend was sitting on it. He offered to pay, but we told him no. No, Kylie wasn’t specifically invited, but she was around, and she had some of the snacks we made. 2) None of us are religious, but 4/5 girls come from Muslim families (our friend Sara is Christian). When Kylie told her dad this, he started calling our suite a “no go zone.” I thought that was offensive and I told Kylie to tell him to knock it off, but she didn’t speak up."

Where I go, it is free and completely non profit, we don't pay them, they don't pay us. It came to a boiling point last Sunday and I'm wondering if I'm the asshole here, I mentioned how I don't want to be forced to go to karate the two days a week, two (really three) hours per day, all the time, I am a teen, I want to enjoy life, I want to hang out with friends, my girlfriend, and not feel tied down Tuesdays and Thursdays. When I brought this up, he blew up on how I will be doing karate until I graduate (another year) and that I'm being influenced by my girlfriend, who actually encourages me to go, and that I'm disappointing and disrespecting my instructors, I don't think I can do karate 4 hours a week for my sanity. I am skinny but do not have a six pack and my dad always chides me for not doing crunches and getting a six pack and it honestly makes me think I'm fat, which sounds dumb, I know. However, since then I've been wondering if I'm the asshole considering I have so many responsibilities, I feel I'm just passing them off to other people to have fun for myself, so Reddit, am I the asshole?

Edit: I open up, close up, set up and put back the mats that cover large area, I teach kids, colored belts, and those with learning disabilities, I organize the pads and mitts, all out of choice, my house chores include garbage, dishes, drying laundry, kitty litter, cleaning/sweeping, and during the summer I do yard work, I have a job to pay insurance, and I tutor a kid on Saturdays for two hours

Edit 2: forgot to mention, he told me not to work on Tuesdays and Thursdays because of karate, even though I have to pay for insurance

Edit 3: my dad has no karate background, before my license he'd drive me to karate and watch and does not help out at karate or around the house, he likes those horrible karate movies and that's it lol

"So basically my girlfriends daughter(8 years old) had this cat that had been in the house for awhile and been her pet for some time. My girlfriend lives with her daughter her sister(35 years) and her mother. Her sister has down syndrome and they got her a different cat that was old and needed a home, the sister with DS wanted a pet.

So there wasn't any problems but eventually the cats start spraying to mark their territory. It became a huge problem because theyre spraying on cupboards, walls and the carpet. 

The cat who was spotted spraying the most was my girlfriend's daughter's cat. We started to put them both outside but the sister with downs would just let the cat in whenever because she obviously doesn't understand or doesn't care to understand the problem. My girlfriend s daughters cat got left outside more because it's more evident and she gets caught spraying.

So my girlfriend's daughter's cat ends up getting sick and it gets so bad they had to put her down.

It infuriates me because she was here first and they let this old ass cat in and basically pushed my girlfriend's daughter's cat away. now the mother and sister are silent on the issue and my girlfriend feels responsible.

AITA for wanting to assign blame to the sister and mother? They basically brought this old ass going to die soon cat in, it created a problem, they put the other cat outside it got sick and died and they dont seem to think it's their fault.

Here’s some backstory, I am 36 and adopted by my grandparents, my birth mother is legally now my sister. My mom has 3 biological daughters (53, 56, 59).  

My mom (adoptive mom, I only refer to her as my mom), is in a nursing home since the beginning of the year. I am her power of attorney and trustee. I worked with a lawyer to get her on Medicaid to pay for the nursing care she receives, found someone to rent her home so her mortgage would continue to be paid, have taken her to all her dr appts, and so on. My sisters, even though they live close (the furthest being about 45 mins away), have not helped me with anything, don’t visit her except maybe once a month if that. Now one of them is fighting me in court for guardianship.

I believe my relationship with them is irrevocably broken. Because of all this court stuff, it got me thinking about the future and what happens when my mom passes away. I know that I am able to be civil with them and put my personal feelings aside, but unfortunately they are not able to be the same way. They are the kind of people who cause scenes, yell, scream, threaten, and so on. I know this because we had several things happen at the nursing home and also the hospital where these incidents happened. I do not want my moms funeral to be ruined because they are not able to be adults, I know my mom would not want to be embarrassed (even though she would be gone) in front of other family and friends who are there to pay their respects. 

I never thought I would have to ask a question like this, and would typically never want to keep someone from their mothers funeral, but they really aren’t the kind of people you can reason with. So WIBTA?"	Asshole	0	0	138.0	16.0	0.0	0.0

I don’t quite remember what she said, but something along the lines of “I thought you said pump 12” And I said, “ No I specifically remember saying $10 on 10. I can’t pay for all of that” Which is true because I only had a twenty dollar bill, and did not have my debit or credit card on me. I told her I could pay $10 because that’s all the change I had left, but I didn’t have money for the other $10.20. We went inside so she could explain it to her manager. He  said “Well she thought you said on pump 12”. I told him I could only pay $10 because that was the rest of the cash I had on me, and I was about to offer to come back tomorrow and pay the rest of it, but the lady attendant said she would pay the $10.20 and swiped her card, and said it was her fault.

WIBTA if I didn’t go back tomorrow and pay the lady the $10.20 that she ended up paying, even if I specified only $10 and she gave me the $10 back in change, which obviously means she understood I only wanted $10?"	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Now, some background. My wedding was pretty nice overall, but we were pretty broke college students so obviously couldn’t do everything how we wanted to. In the end not a big deal, but still not ideal because I was insanely stressed out over money the entire time. Also, my now husband had his appendix removed six days before the ceremony and caught a cold in the hospital, and his family kept him out until 4 am the night before, so he wasn’t in the greatest of conditions. 

That being said, the most important driving factor behind this desire is that we very nearly got divorced. There was some emotional abuse going on, but he’s totally turned it around and we are finally happy. 

So I’d really like to throw the “wedding” I want in a few years at our 10 year anniversary. He’s fully on board, but I’m anticipating some serious judgement from his family, especially given that they don’t know about the near-divorce. Leaning strongly towards “you do you” because I’m not asking for any money or gifts, literally just want people to show up, but I’d like to feel a bit firmer in my choice in case I get some backlash.

bz6xtt	2019-06-11 02:39:08	ItsVinn	AITA for not showing up to a meeting for a possible freelance work opportunity which I just learned to be actually a MLM?	"I'm currently searching for a job, although there are informal offers, I'm still waiting for the company that I'm eyeing for before I decide on a job by next week. I also have considered working freelance, therefore I positively responded to a LinkedIn connection to meet her to discuss possible freelance work, which she said was Digital Marketing, and confirmed a meeting with her.

I arrived at the office building lobby ahead of time, and she claimed that she was still on her way when the designated 1pm meeting was supposed to happen. I am pretty impatient time wise so I just asked her some further details about the freelance job--- and I learned it's actually from [USANA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USANA_Health_Sciences). --- which I admittedly didn't ask if what company would I do digital marketing for, or what's the nature of the digital marketing job I'll do prior to the meeting.

What I've initially thought as a digital marketing opportunity turns out to be for a MLM, which I simply believe are scams. I still said I'll wait for her companion who she claims would fetch me.

I am familiar with USANA and I know they're selling overpriced health products and they're very much involved in trying to recruit people to distribute USANA for them. There's also links on Reddit about how [USANA is basically tricking people](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/9clk8q/its_about_to_get_extra_juicy_on_my_timelinethis/). Turns out her companion is going to another meeting and the connection I had on LinkedIn would meet me instead.

I know its going to be a scam based on some experiences of other Redditors convincing you to shell money outright to start the work opportunity. And the connection did text me that yes there's no commitment but I have to invest if I really want to start the work opportunity.

By that time, she was like near the office lobby already (5 minute drive from the venue), and I texted her that I had ""some prior commitments that I have to do"" (I'm also doing event management for a youth council) and I had to leave. (especially she was an hour late to the agreed meeting) So I did waste her 2-3 hr commute because I'm not doing shit with MLMs. I don't regret traveling 2 hrs either to that office, either.

What I did might be unethical, considering I've agreed to a meeting and I backed out last minute, but I feel like it was towards what I feel are scams (multi-level marketing). Do you think I am the asshole?

**TLDR:** Agreed to meet a linkedin connection to discuss a possible freelance work opportunity. Learned it was for a multi level marketing company (selling health products) via text and I escaped and backed out last minute, minutes before she arrived at the lobby to meet me because I feel the company is a scam. Am I the Asshole?

I was scared that people were gonna react poorly to it, and I hate confrontation. I specifically asked Steve if this was going to happen by sending it out, and he promised me it would be fine.

It was not fine. I got so many reactions, people were all over the emotional spectrum, and I had hell to respond and explain myself over 50 times to different people. I have very bad social anxiety when it comes to close friends, and this was a very miserable experience for me as I didn’t know what was going to happen, Steve was fully aware of this. 

But I was really mad when Steve just kinda left, only for me to text him with small responses, he said I could use him to blame for it, but not many people bought that. I told Steve that this was a big asshole move on his part, but he told me that I could have very well not sent it.

I have some really nice friends, who kinda helped me out though this, excluding Steve who didn’t do squat except for the blame game that didn’t work. This entire consequence fell right upon my shoulders and I felt like Steve had some to pay for this, he knew how much I used to trust him, and I thought he kind of used it to abuse it a bit. 

Needless to say, I asked my Dad and he told me that if Steve told me to jump off a cliff, that I wouldn’t do that. But I told him the circumstance was very little, and my trust in him was very high, and Steve was fully aware of it.

my parents decided to throw me a leaving party despite my objections. 
I decided that I would say goodbye to everyone on the last week before my trip and I did just that, my mum still wanted a leaving party, no matter how much I refused.

she then told me the leaving party would be a dinner at 6 at a nice restaurant, my issue was that my flight was at 1 and so I would most likely be asleep. mum just chose to ignore that bit of info. 

I slept in and missed the dinner, I woke up to 23 missed calls and so I called my mum on the way to the airport and she was so mad and told me how ungrateful I was and that I left the whole family hanging. turns out my cousin flew up to surprise me.

"Every year my in-laws (who I love dearly and get along with very well) pay for my husband and I and our 3 kids to go on a Disney Cruise with them as our Christmas present. This year our cruise (last year's present) takes place over the new year. My husband and I were talking and decided that because we were going to be in Florida for the cruise anyway (we have to fly from CA) that we would go 5 days early and take our kids to Disney World as our Christmas present to them (this would require major budgeting on our part but we could make it work). 

We informed my in-laws that this was our plan and that they were welcome to join us if they liked or we would just meet them at the cruise terminal on the appropriate day. Hubby and I got down to planning, we watched every YouTube video about restaurants, dining plans, and FastPass usage, looked at crowd calendars, and then came up with a plan for when we will be there (it will be over Christmas and very busy at the parks so sit-down restaurants need to be reserved 180 days out and FastPasses 60 days out). Meanwhile, my in-laws decided that they would go and they also invited my husband's sister and her family (who are from NY). 

My in-laws want to pay for everyone's flights, resort stay, and park tickets. My MIL also now believes that the idea of spending Christmas at Disney World prior to the cruise was entirely her idea even though my husband and I thought of it and discussed the idea with her a month before she decided to turn it into a family reunion of sorts. 

Hubby and I are extremely grateful for their generosity in wanting to pay for the trip (it would have been a financial stretch for us), and we have no issue with everyone being there, but we still want to follow the schedule that we initially planned for us and our kids.

Because of this, his family has more or less not accepted me into the family, citing my religious beliefs as the fundamental reason why. They have tried breaking us up before we got married and have interfered even after. As a result, we decided to go no contact with them.

Fast forward, his only younger brother is getting married and they have invited him to the wedding. My husband and his younger brother are not close at all and his brother never made any effort to hang out with me or get to know me even when I tried. I’m thinking it was because of his parent’s way of thinking and because the brother is a goody two shoes parent pleaser, he always avoided me, hardly ever saying more than a simple hi or bye. Safe to say, while I don’t think his brother is a bad person, I personally don’t have any feelings toward him. 

They want my husband to be there because he’s the brother but the family has made no effort to include me on this. In instances where I have been around the family since no contact (funerals, let’s say), I have gotten attitude from various family members and it’s been stressful to say the least.

bz6vf0	2019-06-11 02:32:41	hard-time-ult	AITA for refusing to abide by the religous rules of my parents house?	"basically the title 

sorry for formatting and stuff i'm on mobile.

so i turned 18 in early april and i am still very dependent on my parents, i can't drive, my job is not self sustainable, and i don't even have my own bank account.

My parents are very religious while i wan't nothing to do with religion at all, because of this my parents and i have butted heads alot in the past and most resently it was because i refused to attend saturday mass. I hade been forced to attend mass every saturday for basically my entire life and for some reason i though i would be free of having to participate in religion once i turned 18, this did not happen and when i refused to go to mass yesterday it resulted in a screaming match which ultimately led to me getting kicked out by my dad for a majority of the day. during the argument my dad got increasingly more agitated that i was arguing with him and hurled insults my way which in turn lead me to start swareing.

my parents like to imidiatly shut down any oposing argument from me of my siblings by labeling and and all comments as ""disrespect"" ""or back talk"" they expect us to do anything and everything they tell us to do with no protest, which has also led to screaming matches. 

So when i protested to attending church because in my mind im 18 and should have the right to religious freedom, my parents imidiatly shut me down with ""you live under our roof you follow our rules"" i still said i wasnt going to go and my dad started saying things like im a spoild brat (which i dont think i am i buy most of my stuff myself and never ask for money, unlike my siblings who beg for stuff constantly"" but he was yelling at me so i yelled back that if he thinks im spoiled its his fault for spoiling me, after that he told me to leave.

so after walking around the down town area for a couple hours and staying at a friends for a bit i went back home where i was lectured by my mother and father about how im disrupting the house hold by putting doubts about their religion in my siblings heads and asked why i couldn't be apathetic to their plight, i said that i couldn't care less if my siblings were religious or not and that questioning your ideals isnt such a bad thing, then they said that THEY cared if my siblings were religious or not and that its their duty to rais my siblings chatholic, then they said something like is one hour of your day really too much to ask and at that point i completely shut  down because i realized no matter what i say nothing good is gonna come from it. 

However now that ive had time to reflect im not so sure i'm in the right, my parents are giving me a place to live paying for electricity, food, water, and other nesesitys while i try and figure out what i am supposed to do with my life and although i don't agree with some of their rules and their way of enforcing them, am i alowed to complain?

so yeah am i right in my stance that i should have more freedom, or am i naive in asuming anything would change now that im an adult? AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

The past month I’ve been getting minimal sleep and haven’t had time to relax. This past week has been particularly hard for me. However as of yesterday afternoon, my commitment that was causing the stress has been fulfilled and I am finally able to relax. 

Now I am on vacation with my family. My mom asked me if I wanted to go to a Museum tomorrow and I said sure. Tonight, she let me know I will be traveling to the Museum alone as she will already be in the city. I will have to leave the house at 8 am and travel one hour taking various trains to get the the Museum. My mom asked her friend if she could get us special tickets, and she now says I have to come or she will be embarrassed. 

I told her I don’t want to go. The last thing I want to do is wake up early and navigate my way in a city I don’t know. All I want to do is rest after a very hard month.

I don’t think it’s fair to take me saying I would be down to see a Museum and force me to go across the city in the morning. I understand she told a friend she would come, but I feel as though that is her fault for committing without confirming details with me first.

bz6ta2	2019-06-11 02:26:57	FormerNiceguyIncel	"AITA for ""catfishing"" a girl to find out why she was being randomly rude and passive aggressive to me?"	"So I'm 23 in junior year. There's this weird tinder-esque app/site that's more 'campus based' (and may have been a pioneer to tinder) but more intended for missed connections, but it was pretty much used the way tinder is now. So long story short, it eventually gave me my first hookup! and she ghosts me the following week. Whatever.

Confidence is built a little, and a week later, surprise, ANOTHER hookup! This one is relevant (I'll call her Anna) so here's what happened. I meet Anna for dinner, we connect, make plans to hang out later in my dorm and have a drink and maybe watch a movie. So Anna comes over, we do just that, have ONE beer, and watch a movie, cuddle, figure out the rest. We have the awkward talk about staying in touch and where it's going, she's a bit hesitant, mentions it's cool we have a mutual friend (relevant). I'll call her Betsy. Now, Betsy and I were never close, but she was friends with a lot of my friends and we would smoke together sometimes. Anyway, Anna says we should go our separate ways. I accept that.

Sometime later I cross paths with Betsy, I innocently ask her ""hey, so you know Anna?"" She then looks at me with a smirk and says ""yes, she told me everything, she's my close friend"".

Later on I notice that whenever I see Betsy, she's particularly cold towards me, glaring and not even saying hi. I honestly have no idea why and it's getting to me. Especially since I was about to be living with a friend of hers.

So I'm probably TA here - knowing her AIM, I use an anonymous throwaway and message her. I don't 'pretend' to be anyone, I simply don't identify myself, I'm just a weird mystery person - but she still willingly talks to me after I say some things to get her attention, trying to figure out who I am (I know, weird). Still not knowing, she somehow opens up to me about random personal stuff, and eventually drops a bombshell ""I'm a generally nice person, the only person I am mean to is this guy named FNI, but I have my reasons for that"". She then says ""FNI basically stalked one of my friends"". At that point I'm done. But rather than identify myself right away, I send Betsy an email explaining that it was me and giving a rundown of what happened between me and Anna.

Of course, we then have a conversation where she freaks out, and apparently what happened was that Anna was shitfaced when she told Betsy about me (over a day later), and then didn't remember that she told her - so somehow with weird leaps, she convinced herself that I got her shitfaced (even though she would have had to have been for over 24 hours which makes no sense). Also because her perception of me was some weirdo so the idea of me hooking up with someone was probably far-fetched to her, much less her friend, so she somehow had to convince herself it wasn't consensual.

I later also found out she was going around telling people I did that, which, combined with the perception I described above, might make me think Betsy deserved this. Thoughts?"	Asshole	0	0	58.0	11.0	0.0	0.0

Not in poverty by any means, just lower than middle class. Everyone in my community was in the same boat so I hardly even noticed, honestly. Anyway, my siblings and I adopted a habit of buying joint gifts for things. Usually one of us would come up with the idea and then just collect money from the others BUT we would lie about the cost and say it was cheaper than it truly was. Usually it would be some awesome coupon or we found a great deal and so the price the rest of us saw in the store, in the ad, etc was never “what I paid.” I know for a fact every one of us has done it and we all know the others do it, but we don’t talk about it. I don’t know when it started, but we are all adults now (youngest is 30) and it is still going. The thing is, now they are all in a similar SES bracket as we were growing up while I make quite a good living. My career field is highly specialized but loosely connect to mental health so they just assume I make a social services paycheck since that is the closest thing they can think of to what I do. I’ve never corrected this assumption 1) because I don’t want to brag and 2) one of my siblings has a history of theft and once drained my (extremely poor) bank account. That was over 10 years ago, but his general entitlement toward “rich people” hasn’t changed. I’m not rich compared to actual rich people but I am compared to him and my home community. 

I  am thinking about this now bc my sister told me my portion of our dads bday present and it’s at least half of what I actually owe (she found a really good coupon!). I feel like I am taking advantage of a sweet sort of tradition we had as kids by not chiming in with “why don’t you let me pay a little extra” or just flat out telling them that I make more money than they think I do. But I also don’t want to be put in a position of any of them asking me for money or trying to take advantage (mostly just one of them). I also don’t know that they would understand that I may have more money but it is being saved for future things. My family tends to be a “spend it while you got it” one. I am already well aware that I’ll be paying for our parents’ care as they get older since they don’t have an actual retirement plan, for instance.

My fiancé (20sM) and I (20sF) have been together for 6 years, engaged for 1. We are both each other’s first relationship & partner. 
The only thing that causes tension between us is his lack of sex drive, which I’ve made him aware of for the past 2 years and we have been slowly talking about alternatives and solutions. 

We talked about having an open relationship. As we got more comfortable with each other and with our relationship, we both agreed that we would be ok with an open relationship if we were honest with each other. This conversation happened at least 10 times and it has always ended in consensual agreement each time. Neither of us ever actually acted on it.

A few weeks ago, I started seriously considering it because I was very unhappy with our sex life (still am, by the way) and asked my fiancé if “I could download tinder to find a FWB” (exact words). He said yes. I downloaded tinder and after week found a person that was in the same boat (looking for a FWB, same kinks, physical chemistry, etc.). We chatted for a bit and decided to meet up soon after. 

The day of the meetup, my fiancé was out of town and asked casually what I was going to do that night so I told him. He completely flipped out and said things like “So you were actually serious about everything” and “If you did it I don’t think I would love you anymore”. I told my tinder friend that I can’t show up anymore and I’m sorry, then ghosted him. I also had him on kik, which I immediately deleted as well tinder. 

It’s been 2 weeks and I reinstalled kik to talk to my friends, and saw new messages from him but haven’t opened any of them. I want to talk to him and give proper closure and apologize but I don’t know if that would be the right thing to do since my fiancé asked me to cut off all contact with anyone that I might have talked to.

So Reddit... AITA here? I seriously thought he was ok with it, but is this a line that you’re just not supposed to cross? Was I TA to ghost Mr. Tinder? WIBTA if I talk to him and properly apologize? Please I have a moral dilemma and really need help."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

(btw the things I felt she needed to know I had already told her). She was more upset about WHY I chose not to tell her than what I actually told her. So to prove a point, she and asked me to tell her a truth I thought she couldn’t handle. 

I told her that I didn’t think she was THAT good at sports and it crushed her. I told her that her athleticism kept her from being terrible but still it crushed her.  She’s not the worst player and I would pick her on my squad before anyone else no doubt but the way she talks about her athletic abilities makes her sound like she played collegiate sports.

I selected one of these ""Mystery Games"" after I won as a joke (Mystery Game 69) but found out the game is not something I would like. Considering this game had been visible in the rotation for a few months before becoming a Mystery Game, I didn't want to just donate it back to the streamer. Therefore I turned to Discord.

This is where the story begins. I posted a link to the game's steam page with the message ""I don't really want this game but I got a key, anyone want it?"" and got muted. It was an automod as far as I know, so I assume it just was triggered by the link. I was muted for ""advertising"". I felt that was an incorrect punishment (the server also doesn't have a ""no links"" rule, just a ""no advertising rule"". Luckily this discord has a helpful bot you can dm and it posts the things you say in a mod chat. They encourage you to use this bot if you feel like you were falsely muted. I have the dms pulled up so these are direct quote

Me:  Ik I posted a link but it was because I got a steam key and I don't really want it

Bot:  The staff team will get back to you as soon as possible.

Me:  I want to give away the gam (typo was in the original)

Mod speaking through Bot:  send it here we'll use it as a prize or something

Me:  Can I be unmuted first?

There was close to 5 minutes silence, which isn't much but I knew the mod was there since he/she just spoke

Me:  I'm not sending the key if I won't be unmuted, there are other servers I can give it away in that won't mute me instantly

Another Mod speaking through Bot:  Then you can go ahead and go to those other servers and give it away there :) <3

Is there anything else I can help you with?

And that's the end of my story. I don't feel like I'm in the wrong but I might have been, I really need a second, or third, or fourth, etc. opinion.

bz6nzy	2019-06-11 02:12:50	drflanigan	AITA for messing with a roommates internet after they invited my ex over on multiple occasions?	"I broke up with my ex boyfriend, he got a new boyfriend

In my second year of school I moved in with one of his friends and a few of mine (I disliked his friend but she was part of our friend group)

I explicitly said I did not want him in our house, because he cheated on me and the whole thing was very raw, and I wanted to be comfortable in my house.

She invited him and his boyfriend over without telling me, and invited him over on my birthday as well. IATA for this next part but I got very drunk one night and her phone was nearby and I read their messages and her inviting him was all intentional to make me feel like shit. They said that he would come over to ""surprise"" her, and he would bring his boyfriend too. They wanted me to be the one to answer the door and catch them making out (although this never happened as I went home the weekend they both came over, but the boyfriend was a surprise to my other housemates who didn't know he was coming). They both specifically planned ""meet ups"" to make me feel bad.

We had a router in our home which everyone was connected to for WIFI. We split the cost for the router, but she never paid me.

In a subtle move of complete passive aggression, I would go into the router settings and block her laptops connection whenever she pissed me off. I would leave the apartment since I was the ""computer guy"" and she would come to me to fix it, but I would just leave for hours at a time and not enable the internet for her until I came home.

She also asked me for all my notes to study for a final exam for a class we shared but she never went to. I gave her my notes, but I cut chunks of the info out before giving them to her, intentionally omitting important information or equations.

I am petty, but am I really the asshole here?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	7634.0	967.0	0.0	0.0

I moved in 6 months ago with random college students off campus. By chance, they're all female. We lived together and got along fine for 6 months until recently.

We get free pest control with our rent, so Ashley (alias) scheduled it. She moved all the contents of every drawer and cupboard out of the kitchen, so he could spray.

When the pest control man came, I was the only one home. I told the pest control man to spray Ashley's and Susan's (alias) room (they share it), and the kitchen. Beth (alias again lol) didn't want her room sprayed, and I didn't want my room sprayed, or the bathroom we share. So I told him don't spray Beth's or my room or bathroom.

I didn't want the kitchen to be sprayed, but I don't own it so I told him to spray it. I pay for my room, so I decided what happens to it. Also, it's not like my room is infecting anything. I've seen 30 bugs of every variety all around the house, focused in no particular area in about 180 days, which is like one bug per week. That's normal, right?

I got an angry text from Ashley when she heard about certain rooms not getting sprayed. In the text she told us we could ""pick all that shit up, i will only put up my personal things"" in the kitchen. It was a speech.
For a few days I left the kitchen stuff in the pile, because I didn't need it to be in drawers. Susan now though wants the stuff to be put back, and wants me to help put things back. She doesn't think Ashley should have to put anything back, because she did all the work to get everything out. The whole bug spray event was a ""group activity"" she says, despite me never signing up or agreeing to it. I didn't say I would help. The man was scheduled without anyone's knowledge until it was already in motion. They were doing their own thing, in my mind. I don't think I should have to clean up after they did their own thing. Beth and I's separate rooms don't infect others. 

I don't plan on picking anything up in the kitchen.

She invited this person into our home and gave her a slice of pizza, which is why I’m mad at her. This person isn’t just some innocent person though. This person constantly berates my mom and my family. She talks badly about my mom saying things like my mom is a drug dealer. She has said my mom cheats on my dad, which she doesn’t. It’s gotten to the point where we have had to kick her out of our house twice and threaten the cops on her because she is that horrible. Not to mention she treats her dog like crap. She is overall just a bad person, yet my mom is still nice to her. She is not our family or anyone close to us, so I don’t know why she is being so nice to her. She told me that God wants you to be nice to everyone, regardless of how they treat you. I don’t agree with this at all, which is why I’m giving her the silent treatment. I have told her in the past that she is evil and I don’t want her over, yet she doesn’t listen.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I sang something quick and the guy goes “That was really bad singing. You sound like the guy from Tiktok that sings in cursive.” I said “Really?” and he said yeah. A couple minutes later I said to him, “Were you being serious?” He said yeah, I really don’t think you’re a good singer at all. I said “oh” disappointedly. 
Later in the day I posted a singing video on my Instagram and I said in the caption something like “ I’ve taken two years of singing lessons but being insulted is okay too.” He saw it and responded with, ‘who cares if you get damaged that easily, you insulted me, i don’t fuck with you anymore tbh...” etc. I never insulted him.

She eats it right up and loves stirring the pot for her own entertainment. She finds it amusing. She’s one of those people who says “she hates drama” but secretly loves it. 

At her workplace there is always one thing or another but it’s all somehow the same. She wants to talk about it any time we talk but it’s just annoying at this point.  She also is the type to think things like Instagram likes, Snapchat streaks and leaving people on “read” is a very big deal. (No judgement here, just not my personal cup of tea). I can’t tell you how long I’ve spend listening to her talk about “read receipts.” Every time we talk, she also talks for hours about work/people she hates/drama she started. No exaggeration about hours here either.

bz6fxv	2019-06-11 01:51:09	FaerieOfEternalDark	AITAH for notifying my best friend of her BO?	"My best friend has had terrible body odor ever since I first met her. Recently it's been worse than usual and our other friends can't stand the smell. They don't say anything to or around her but when she's gone they begin complaining. Some of them are even considering hanging out less because of it. I decided to be the one to approach her about this issue since i'm the closest to her. 

I spent all day yesterday trying to come up with a way to tell her about her BO without offending her too much. Earlier today I finally figured out what to say and went to her house to tell her. We made small talk for a few mins and I then began with ""Look . . . there's something I have to tell you"". I simply told her how lately everyone (our friends) have been noticing a foul smell and that we believe that it's her.

She was silent and looked away from me for about a minute and then responded with ""How dare you pin this on me!?"" I told her that I didn't mean to offend her and that I was just delivering everyone's complaints to her. She then told me leave her house and as I was walking out her door she said ""I didn't know how much of an AH you were""

bz6b3e	2019-06-11 01:37:25	FeonixPheathers	AITA for not letting my friend stay at our house?	"Most of my friends have worked at a resort nearby, we've known each other for years and we're truly family. Amanda and many secondary friends and acquaintances live and work at the resort and will come to visit. But Amanda has a problem that she never lets you know when she is going to be in town.

Last year Amanda would come to town, no notice, usually with a friend and stay at ""Liz's"" or with a friend, couch-surfing. Before she got a car she would come to town and not have a solid plan on how to get back. One time she got annoyed with a friend because he said he'd pick her up on the way, but thought better of it due to weather. She had to work the next day and had to get someone to cover her shift. She was pissed with him.

I recently came to stay with Liz, her bf, her roommate, and 2 dogs. I'm briefly here until I move in with a friend whose roommate is leaving. I've helped pay for rent and utilities where I can, but I don't consider myself their roommate.

Amanda and a friend came to town to hang. The town was busy cause a of a big event. She called me right as I got off work and said she was close. We eat lunch, I asked her where she was staying. She said some friends who are a couple said they could stay since they had extra bedrooms. These friends were helping with some of the parties in town, helping set them up and then they went out and got all made up and costumed, they were busy.

Amanda didn't hear from them and the party had sold out, so we didn't see them We don't make it to the bar until really late; the party was still churning but had calmed down. We cannot find the couple and it turned out that they had left cause they were tired.

Amanda asked if it was cool crashing at Liz's, but it was late, I didn't want to disturb them, and I know they would've said no. I told Amanda this and she got a bratty. She said that I shouldn't need permission cause I paid rent and can have guests if I want. I told her I did not feel comfortable doing that. She keeps saying things like ""Looks like we'll be staying in the car tonight"" and then trying to say that she could just sleep on the floor in my room. I tell her that I do not want to do that. She was also trying to give me shots and drinks but I felt uncomfortable and was sobering up.

We end up at a small party. I'm mingling and since I'd slowed my drinking I wasn't keen on leaving yet. It was about 2 in the morning and I can tell Amanda is getting really tired and drunk. She asks me again to let her stay and I tell her no. She says that we are adults and I say back that adults would take responsibility for their own lodging before they come to town. She storms off saying that it wasn't her choice not to have a place to stay, friends bailed on her. I presume that she slept in the car for the night.

I told Liz about Amanda and she was relieved that I said something. It's the start of the summer and she doesn't want her home to be a hostel."	Not the A-hole	0	0	336.0	112.0	0.0	0.0
bz6b0d	2019-06-11 01:37:15	thememorist	AITA for being tired of a friendship	"I have a friend who has been a friend since we were 11-12 years old. We reconnected about 5/6 years ago. Well she has always had a habit of planning something with me only to call it off to do something else with someone else (dinner with a different friend, shopping with her mom/siblings/ basically if it sounds more fun she drops our plans under some pretense). Well she has struggled with a bad relationship for a long time, a lot of emotional baggage and cheating. She finally got out of it, but very quickly jumped into another bad relationship (cheating, controlling behavior, very early red flags that I and another friend have both expressed to her). In between these relationships (and even during them) I was there. Apartment hunting for her, helping move, spending weekends, texting her during bad spells, meeting up for dinner, meeting up for “therapy sessions” whenever she needed it, as soon as I could, all this despite the fact that I have a young family to attend to as well as various health and personal problems. I tend to have very few friends so I try my best to give my all to the ones I have. Well now she is completely busy with her own life. We’ll make plans for dinner and I’ll drive to the city she works in (which is 30 minutes one way) and then 10 minutes before we’re supposed to meet she backs out, claiming she is tired. She will tell me she’ll let me know about plans for the weekend and then claim something came up but then I’ll see that she went out drinking with other friends (I drink but I rarely just get drunk for the hell of it and lately have had health issues that I can’t drink with). She is moving hours away with the new guy, so I asked if we could get lunch before she leaves, “absolutely! Let me get back to you with a date”. I’ve heard nothing. I had emergency surgery last week, she knows I did, she hasn’t checked in on me even one time. I’m feeling incredibly done with it and am tempted to just quit putting forth the effort and see if she eventually ever reaches out. I absolutely don’t want to harass/annoy her. I’d say right now I reach out to her roughly once every other week and usually ask to meet up once a month. WIBTA if I just stepped back and made her put in the effort and if she doesn’t, let it die?

Edit: I feel like I didn’t give her enough credit, I said this in a comment below:
My biggest issue I guess is that I know she is moving, finding a new job and has had many issues with her relationships. And I love her, I want to be there for her and not just drop our friendship... she is great when we get together. Very generous and fun. She is a giver a lot, I don’t want to be yet another person who lets her down.   She just has a tendency to be flakey and failure to communicate."	Not the A-hole	0	0	58.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

I have a terrible case of social anxiety, so I just said ""hi"" and proceeded to drown my attention in my work as usual. My social anxiety is so bad that I can't even try to be friendly with someone who's nearly 10 years younger than me.

After leaving work today, I just felt so bad. Not for myself but because it felt like I was being rude to both my co-worker and their sibling. This feeling like I'm some sort of trash has been bothering me this entire day.

I just need to know if I was truly in the wrong and whether I should have put effort or not into saying something more than just ""hi"". The last thing I'd want is to make anyone feel bad because of my lack of action, and I really don't want to use my social anxiety as an excuse.

As we finished eating, he said “okay, can you clean up now?” I told him I’d rather wait a few minutes, chill out and digest; I don’t like cleaning up the whole kitchen the moment I’ve finished eating. (And before anyone jumps to conclusions, this is true, not just an excuse to not clean. I always clean up when it’s my turn.) 

He says he wants it clean now because the mess makes him uncomfortable, and he’ll help me if we do it now. But I say that it’s okay, I’m happy to do all the cleaning by myself, I just want to relax for a minute beforehand. 

So, he sighs dramatically and goes “fine, I’ll just do it by myself” and starts cleaning. I shrug and go to the bathroom, and when I come back he gives me a glare and pointedly ignores me, so I say “I don’t appreciate you being passive aggressive just because I didn’t clean everything the exact moment you wanted me to.” It felt like being a teenager, where my mother would pull things just like this. So we got into a small fight. 

Anyway things were resolved, but he still insists it’s just better to clean right after we finish eating and I’m being lazy and gross by not doing that. Is that true, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	316.0	16.0	0.0	0.0

bz65vv	2019-06-11 01:22:56		AITA for not turning up to my brothers 21st birthday?	"So my family has always been tight-knit and close but my brother recently started his own coffee shop so he is not at home as much and I hardly see him any more. He is constantly missing family events, dinners and he even missed the whole of easter to spend time at his precious little coffee shop that he puts all his heart and time into. Along with that if he does have free time spends it all with his girlfriend so I don't even see him ever. 

&#x200B;

I am joining the RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) next and will be missing a lot of family events as I will be travelling abroad a lot like him and will be unable to attend but he is still able to attend these events. But he has had time to go to these events but yet he doesn't show up and his cafe is only 15 mins away from our house.

&#x200B;

That's the back story \^

&#x200B;

I Just had my 18th birthday and had a massive party and invited a bunch of people but he didn't turn up because he said he needed to work at his cafe (keep in mind it was a night party and his cafe closes at 4 pm) I thought this was a dick move so when he had is 21st birthday party a week later I put myself on the roster for work and just didn't turn up to his party at all and instead worked.  On top of that, I didn't buy him a birthday present or celebrate his birthday in any way, as like an act of revenge almost. We then got into a fight and he said he is too busy to come to stupid parties like mine but got angry for me not turning up as the 21st birthday party is the most important in life.

I come from an area where there have been lots of attacks on women, and murders have been increasing lately. I was stopped on my street while walking my dog and a man patted her, said he’d seen me a few times and thought he knew which house I lived in.

That freaked me out so I didn’t go inside my house because he’d stopped at the corner of the street and could still see me/could see where I lived if I went inside. I called a friend to come help me figure out what to do and eventually called my dad as well. By this time the man had been there 40 minutes and hadn’t gone inside a house, he was just walking up and down the street.

My dad told me to call the cops or he’d do it for me. I never normally trust cops and hated that I had to call them, but did.

The man told the cops that he’d moved in recently and was waiting for a friend to help move his stuff. I find that a little hard to believe but I’m not following it up with the cops.

"I've known my stepdad for about 8/9 years now, and while he is a pretty okay guy, there is some stuff that I just cannot stand about him. For example, when I was younger, often times when he would walk into a room and see me, he would say something along the lines of; ""Ohhh you still got that face?? It's so ugly, you should try getting some plastic surgery!!""

I always hated when he did it, because despite the fact he was 'joking', I took it to heart. I don't want to pin the blame on him for everything, but something tells me that him doing this could have contributed to my severe lack of a self esteem now that I am older 

I currently go to therapy, and during one session, my mom was there, and I explained to my therapist about what used to happen with my stepdad and I, and my mom got upset. She said that my stepdad was just joking, and that it was our little joke. I disagreed with her statement, as even back then, I clearly showed that I didn't appreciate what my stepdad was saying about me

Today, just about half an hour ago, my stepdad walked past my room, saying something similar to what he used to tell me, but instead he 'jokingly' said it to my stepsister's best friend. My mom thought that he was talking to me, and so she said that my stepdad couldn't say that anymore because I didn't like it. That doesn't sound bad, right? Well, unfortunately my dad said it in a tone where it was obvious that she was mocking me.

This girl has been a really close friend of mine for a really long time and I don’t wanna loose her friendship so I don’t want to be an A-hole.
      
We live about a bit far from each other so we don’t get to see each other very often. I got engaged months ago, and I asked her to be my maid of honor.

 I haven’t been able to see her in a while so I asked her if she wanted to come over and stay the night. She said yes, so I started cleaning and all that stuff. The day before I double checked if she was coming and she said she was really busy so she couldn’t do this week but we could meet up next week. This happens 5 weeks in a row. No I’m not joking. So I decided maybe I should plan something more fun, because then maybe her boyfriend would be able to come and then it’d be better. 

So Every year my fiancé and I go to a theme park, I told her that her and her boyfriend could come with us if they paid for their tickets. She proceeded to say she had stuff to do but she could do the forth date that I set. Point is we moved the trip 4 times.

 I contacted her before the deadline of buying tickets and asked her if she was still coming. She said her summer was really busy and she didn’t have anything for that day yet, but she probably would, and she didn’t want to buy tickets and not be able to come.

bz646a	2019-06-11 01:18:09	DJT4Prison	AITA for admitting my assistant manager gave me weed, resulting in him being fired?	"So years ago, I worked in a national chain restaurant as a server. Sometimes I also worked as the togo person, meaning I took the orders over the phone (this was before you could do it online), packaged the orders up, took them out to people's cars, ect.  Anyway, one night, the new Assistant Manager (he had been there maybe two or three months) ordered dinner on his night off.  I bring his order out to his car and he gives me joint as a tip! Though the, it wasn't that great a tip given that it was a small, poorly rolled, and the weed was of poor quality.  But I thought it was pretty hilarious and just had to share it with someone. So I told Madison, a girl I sorta had and thing for and had been friends with since high school. Didn't want the entire store to find out, so I didn't tell anyone else. As far as I knew she didn't  tell anyone either.

Well, at least not until a couple weeks later. Apparently (I wasn't there) she and Assistant Manager got into a big fight and she ended up getting fired. And so she decided to get revenge on him and possibly save her job (she still got fired) by telling the General Manager about how Assistant Manager gave me some weed as a tip.

I go into work the next day, completely oblivious to this.  General Manager brings me into his office, straight up tells me that Madison told him that Assistant Manager gave me some weed and asked if it was true. I was completely shocked, and without really thinking about it, I admitted it was true.

Later that night, District Manager comes in. I tell him the truth also, figuring it was too late to lie. Then both General  Manager and District Manager talk to Assistant Manager, and soon after he leaves and I never see him again.

Anyway, I felt really conflicted about it. If never told Madison or probably even if I claimed she was lying, Assistant Manager wouldn't have been fired. On the other hand, maybe he deserved to be fired for giving employees illegal drugs at work.

And even though it has been a long time, it is still something I think about relatively often. So AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	1989.0	91.0	0.0	0.0

bz61xe	2019-06-11 01:11:35	mikkiv	AITA Pregnant girlfriend. Annoying mum	"Backstory, my girlfriend and I found out we were having a baby very quickly after we got together, about three months. It's okay, we both ultimately wanted a family which we both talked about when we were dating. I'm 27, she's 24. It was earlier then we were both expecting but ultimately we're both happy. 

My girlfriend and my mum straight away did not get off to a good start. My mum has this annoying way of dealing with things and my girlfriend can be a stubborn person who has a habit of, what I feel, taking things a bit personally and sometimes making things a bit of a bigger deal then they are. 

Example, when we had our 16 week scan and found out we were having a girl my girlfriend showed my mum and she said something to the effect of oh she looks like an alien! Now I know her, she was just joking around but my girlfriend got upset, but i can understand that. I just tried to play it off. My mum then upset her by saying she thought it was going to be a boy (I think my mum was hoping for a boy). And that did upset her and I can understand why. 

A few other things happened a long the way that made my mum and my girlfriend not get a long and basically not build a relationship and it's made my mum feel like she's not involved in the pregnancy and my girlfriend, understandably, has not made much of an effort to involve her. 

Cut a long story short we had our baby shower this weekend and with this feeling of my mum's lack of involvement brewing she had one too many wines and essentially let her feelings be known in a not so dignified way. Saying to my girlfriend (and her mum) how shes not felt involved and that she better let them see the baby when she's here and that she was upset that my girlfriend went and bought the crib without my mum (my mum made a big point of wanting to go with her to buy it). 

It kicked off in the morning with my girlfriend and her mum literally screaming at me that it's not on what she did and how it was out of order. Which I can understand cause I know how my mum can go about things and she definitely could have gone about it a different way. My girlfriend and her mum tried telling her she is of course welcome to come see the baby etc. She lives 100 miles away.

My girlfriend is very upset with my mum and is saying how she's not allowed in the house and she doesn't want my mum around at all because it just causes arguments between us. I of course try and stick up for my mum because although she is an idiot she is still my mum and I understand why she might feel the way she does. She hasn't been involved and on top of my brother and his three kids moving to Singapore recently she is very sensitive and not in the best place at the moment.

AITA for thinking my girlfriend, although justifiably upset, not letting my mum see the baby in the house where we both live and refusing to care about our baby and her grandmothers relationship is a little unreasonable?"	Asshole	0	0	7.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

My town has this annual summer parade where all the local bands march through and play music and different organizations walk though. It goes through a few streets and everyone comes, so it’s super crowded. It’s set up so that there are cones and the audience can stand anywhere behind a cone. I came halfway though the parade to watch my little brother perform and found a spot behind the cone that was empty. A few feet behind it, a few women were sitting on the street curb. I stood there and one of the women who sitting down asks me to move over to the left so that she can see. I just ignored her because it was super crowded to my left and I was in an empty spot. Nothing happens for like ten minutes, then she asks again and I ignore her again. The lady gets pissed and then points to her friend and says “some of us have been standing here the whole time and we need to sit down now and if you’re standing you’re blocking our view. It’s very rude.” I say nothing. Then the woman’s friend stands up and tries to make her point by standing directly in front of me, like close enough that the back of her head is in my face. This was weird so I just moved slightly to the right. Then the lady says “that’s even worse. You’re blocking our view. Why don’t you just sit down so we can see. It’s very rude.” They were so annoying so I  walked to a different spot. Don’t think standing there was wrong cause I was behind the cone. If they wanted to see then they can stand up or move.

&#x200B;

We get to see each other about once every 3 weeks to a month, maybe longer. Whenever he comes up to see me, he always wears these oversize, old, light blue jeans, oversize jackets or sweatshirts, and a hat. As someone who cares about how I look and take a lot of time putting an outfit together for when we go out, it kind of feels like he does not care when he shows up wearing old ill fitting clothes and a hat because he doesn't want to do his hair.

&#x200B;

Whenever I bring it up that maybe he should find some better fitting pants he tells me those pants are working pants and they are comfortable. Well, we're at the mall you aren't working now are you. I know he has nicer looking clothes, like some newer black jeans, but he just chooses to wear his older ones that don't fit. He also tells me he can't afford to just buy new clothes, but the thing is I have given him nice clothes and helped him buy some nicer clothes.

&#x200B;

I have given him a pair of Japanese denim jeans that are very nice and fit him well, but he doesn't wear them. I have helped to buy him this leather bomber jacket that fits, he doesn't wear that either. I tell him it feels like he doesn't care about me since I like when he dresses nice and if I only get to see him once a month I would like him to look nice for it, just like I take my time to get ready and put on makeup and do my hair instead of wearing sweats and a sweatshirt with unkempt hair.

&#x200B;

I have even had discussions with my mom about it and she says he just looks like a ""thug"" in those clothes.

&#x200B;

I just don't know if this is something I shouldn't be saying to him because it seems so superficial, but at the same time the amount of effort he puts into how he looks is kind of the level of effort he is willing to give me, which doesn't seem like a lot."	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bz5ym8	2019-06-11 01:02:13	gffwbthrowaway	AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to hang out so much with her previous FWB?	"For context, we’re all female. So I’ve been dating this girl “Annie” for a few months. Things have been going pretty well but there was something that struck me as kind of odd. When we first started dating, she told me that her housemate was her previous FWB, “Kayla”.

Essentially, Annie and Kayla dated for a couple months (they never became girlfriends, but they casually dated for a while, I think four months). Things didn’t work out for one reason or another and Kayla ended it with Annie. They decided to become FWB shortly after. They were good friends and got along well, and both of them wanted to move out of home but couldn’t afford their own apartments so they decided to move in together (2bd2ba). I think they were FWB for about a month before they decided that it would be too complicated to continue that sort of relationship if they were to move in together. They moved into the same apartment about two months after they ended their FWB relationship. Now they’re housemates and are close friends.

Annie has assured me that everything is completely platonic but I can’t help but feel uncomfortable. It’s inevitable that they hang out because they live together but sometimes Kayla would call Annie out of the blue (e.g. when she’s driving home from work for company on her way home). Or sometimes they’d hang out in each other’s rooms late at night. I don’t really have anything against Kayla since she’s cordial to me but I just feel uncomfortable by this whole situation.

AITA if I make my feelings known to Annie? I’m not sure what I expect to come from it. What’s a reasonable thing to ask for and what isn’t? What if I asked for them to stop hanging out so much? I feel like they spend more time together than I do with Annie (but of course they live together so that’s a given).

Earlier, he went in the bathroom, asking beforehand he went in, if I would help him set up some apps that he needs to use.

He came out, said he didn't need help when I asked, and then watched Hulu. Later on, I went downstairs, and he came down some time later, and was complaining about the app. I asked again if he needed help. He seemed reluctant, but said yes.

I went upstairs, used his laptop to get it to the stage where he can put in a username and password and all his other information.

Once he sets all of this, at least fifteen minutes later, he asks what to do next. I say set your availability. He asks me how to do that. I click to the page where availability is set, and set it up to add a new availability for him starting tomorrow, and tell him to finish it however he wants.

He doesn't understand, and asks me to explain it to him. I think the concept of availability for a job is self explanatory and tell him to drag his times around to reflect his availability. He still doesn't understand, and after repeating pretty much the same stuff a couple of times, I'm starting to lose my patience, and I'm raising my voice.

"I work in an autism center, and I have some particularly violent clients. It’s not uncommon for me to have scratches, bite marks, and bruises on my limbs. (Don’t worry. I love my job. The injuries are just a shitty side effect)
 
I’ve dated my boyfriend for 3 years and have had this job for 1 year. I’m 25 my boyfriend is 35. I know, age gap.  
 
This age gap made my mom hesitant of my boyfriend from the get-go. 
 
Since starting my current job my mom has made “jokes” about my boyfriend abusing me. She’ll see a mark and say “geez boyfriend, take it easy or I’ll have to call the cops. Teehee.” It’s always in this way where I can tell she’s concerned but tries to play it off. 
 
 To make things clear, my boyfriend has **never** been violent with me.
 
About 6 months ago I sat my mom down and said that I didn’t appreciate these jokes. That my boyfriend hasn’t and would never hurt me. My mom brushed it off and said I was too sensitive, and that she was joking. I reiterated I wanted her to stop and that my boyfriend is not violent. (My boyfriend also doesn’t like the “jokes” either but I didn’t mention that so not to throw him under the bus)  


My mom hasn’t made a “joke” since then.
 
So unto the current situation
 
I was working with a client on Friday who head butted me. This client has never been violent before so I let my guard down. Silly me. Lesson learned.
 
I got pretty ugly black eye from it.
 
Saturday, my mom and I hung out. She commented on the eye and was genuinely concerned. I explained what happened. She let it go and seemed to believe me.
 
Sunday, my mom invites me over for dinner. My boyfriend was working this night so I go alone. 
 
It’s not dinner, it’s an “intervention” with my sister and dad. They sat me down and explained they were concerned about me and that they knew my boyfriend was hitting me and that I shouldn’t be ashamed that they’d help me.


**i was livid**  


I basically screamed at all three of them. Mostly my mom. I can’t remember all I said but it was like “You’re so dramatic! You’re such an asshole! Boyfriend is great! You’ll never be half the person he is!” At one point I called her a Bitch. I’m sure I said some meaner things I don’t remember. I kind of blacked out and left.


My sister texted my later and explained that my mom came home crying from Saturday. She asked what was wrong and mom said she wasn’t sick and tired of my boyfriend hitting me. My sister organized the “intervention” with my dad. She apologized to me and said she didn’t realize my mom was being so dramatic. I don’t totally believe my sister didn’t know my mom was being dramatic. 
  
 
I’ve heard from my dad that my mom is upset with me and wants an apology. 
 
My boyfriend is kind of annoyed I yelled at them because he says it’ll make my mom hate him more. I asked how and he said “now she thinks I’m abusing **and** brain washing you.”

I'm getting married in January, and have started making some decisions about our wedding party. My fiancee has a small family, no siblings or cousins, and a small group of good friends, whereas I have 4 older sisters (I'll call them Jane, Amy, Mary, and Ann), a younger sister (I'll call her Sophie), and 3 younger brothers (I'll call them John, Mark and Joe). We wanted a traditional wedding - bridesmaids and groomsmen - so we decided to 6 bridesmaids/groomsmen on each side so that he could incorporate both my 3 brothers and his 3 closest friends, and so that I could include all of my sisters and have a non-familial MOH so none of my sisters feel like I'm playing favorites. I felt that it was very respectful and diplomatic, especially because my family has a tendency to be competitive.

All of my sisters were really gunning to be MOH, especially Mary, and when I told them that I had chosen my childhood best friend (who I've remained very close to), they all were a bit disappointed. Mary talked a bit of smack about me to Sophie, who totally tattled to me, but I didn't confront Mary about it.

I also got a lot of pressure from my siblings to have a flower girl and ring bearer, but as most of my siblings have multiple children , I didn't want to pick, so we decided not to have any. Of course, I got flack for that and Mary had a meltdown, accusing me of not thinking her son, who was bit in the face by a dog last summer and has bad scarring, is handsome enough to be part of the wedding. I told her I didn't want to have to pick between my nieces and nephews, and don't want them to feel I'm choosing favorites. She understood and apologized, saying she was feeling a bit emotional about her son's injury, which I understand.

The other day, Sophie came to me and said that Mary had started a group chat of all of our siblings, except me. The first message she sent was asking for opinions on whether or not it would be okay for her to ask me to put her husband in the wedding party, so that she could walk with him. She told our siblings that she didn't want to be photographed walking with another man, because it would ""start rumors"" (which I think is bullshit). She said that I've been excluding her from the planning process like dress shopping (I invited just my mom, grandmother, and stepmom), and I didn't let her have any input on choosing bridesmaids dresses (nobody got input on bridesmaids dresses), and she thinks this would be a nice olive branch. Jane, Ann, Mark and Joe agreed with her, but Amy was against it and John wanted to stay out of it all together. Mary was really unhappy with her own wedding, so I feel she might be feeling that she needs to exercise control over mine to make up for it, but this isn't Mary's wedding 2.0. It's *my* wedding. I don't want my husband to have to compromise on his already small social circle so that Mary can be appeased.

I had asked if he had another name, because he had given me a standard english name. I only asked because I am learning Japanese, and my penpals use english names. 

So anyway he goes no this is my real name, why did you think I had a crazy name like Ming Ting something. And OKC wasn't sending messages in order so the whole chat was kinda jacked. I said something like nono sorry lol.

So we ended up mentioning serial killers, and he called me serial killer billie jean, then said ""what's my name?"" i didn't really understand what he meant, but I retorted with the name he mentioned earlier, Ming Ting something- as a joke to the serial killer comment.

He then proceeded to start being an ass, and says something like ""hella racist"", asks me if I get off on a power dynamic over asain dudes, blah, blah- and I couldn't tell his tone because he had made a joke earlier and I couldn't tell it was a joke.

Then he says you know what I think you have serious issues, and I'm like wtf is happening? I ask him what he was talking about.

He doesn't respond so I'm sending messages saying I think we had a communication error, I know Ming whatever isn't your name. And I refreshed and he had blocked me. 

So now some guy I thought was pretty cool and possibly could have been a friend has left and blocked me thinking I'm a racist.

I spent summers in the house. No friends. No TV. Because of failing grades. Which to my defense I never got up. I ended up graduating. But I learned throughout my life that yeah my Dad is a good guy. But awful parent. His anger is prone. And I get anxious when voices get loud in the house. But I'm 19. I can forgive him, but I won't.

My little brother is 13. The ability to interact with friends is none. He has no friends. I bought him a guitar to see if he could do something. He loved it. But now his grades failed and my dad pretty much ""perma grounded"" him which flashback to all the times I was yelled at. Got no help. And later was told to suck it up. He threw away most of his toys. Which he had mostly nothing to begin with. We use his room as a storage closet pretty much. The things he's kept were childhood books and baby clothes. All he does is sleep in his room. I try to get him out of the house. But I actually makes me cry seeing what he did to me, manifest into another person's life. I almost didn't graduate because that asshole yelled at me instead of sitting down and working with me. So I want to forgive him. But I also don't want my brother to end up like me.

Edit: I would risk getting kicked out, he grew up thinking 18 you should have your life figured out. I live here, but in his words as an ""Expense"" and a ""waste"" so there is that, the only thing im risking is I have nowhere to crash, as I have no friends, so I have to put up with it for now, but I will be there for my brother, Hes grounded over one failing grade I found out.

I (22M) started working at a small town market in their deli two months ago and so far everything has gone well, but I have a coworker who, on my manager’s (MNR) (F) own admission, is a bit of a problem. He has borderline nonexistent hygiene (doesn’t shave, has ratty hair, has awful BO), goes on smoke breaks every twenty minutes no matter how busy we are, and really doesn’t acknowledge customers unless you point them out to him. MNR says that he has a poor home life, living with his dad who may or may not take his anger out on him. 

He also has a history of finishing closing procedures early and leaving before he’s supposed to (not a slightly early thing, more so over an hour early).

Last night I was closing, but he was scheduled to be there until a certain time to help me with whatever may come in as a dinner rush. He does his usual act of doing all of the closing stuff early (six hours before we were set to close) and he gets up and leaves the deli. I figured he was going on another smoke break until twenty minutes passed and he wasn’t back. Due to state laws if you work more than 6 hours you are required to go on a 30 minute break. I text MNR and explain the situation (he was scheduled to be there for another 90 minutes before he left) and she’s obviously pissed. She texts him and he comes back begrudgingly and interrupts me while I’m helping a customer to tell me to go on break. I text MNR back and she says she’s writing him up. 

Knowing that this has happened before, I know that this isn’t going to go anywhere because she thinks he has the potential to be violent if she fires him due to his mannerisms and behavioral issues. 

I explained this situation to my mom and I told her next time I’m just going to the owners or GM of the store because ultimately their word is the end all be all. My mom warns me not to break the power chain and just continue to go to MNR because enough write-ups will get him sacked, but historically that hasn’t worked. 

If it’s true that his home life is as bad as I’ve been told then I sympathize with him because that’s awful, but ultimately he’s still affecting our workplace in a negative way, and what he did is considered abandonment to many companies and would result in termination.

bz5tsl	2019-06-11 00:49:41	itsjustme135	AITA for ignoring my mother's Christian values?	"I'm 19F. I work part-time (currently applying to schools) and live with my parents and pay admittedly cheap rent ($300 for my room). Market value for a room in a house is about 500 including utilities/internet etc. Me and my dad are atheist but my mom is Christian. 


I started dating this guy M19. We didn't have much of anywhere to go to spend time together so often we went to my place. We would say hi to my parents if they were home and go do our own thing. I wanted to get to know him more before really hanging out as a family with him.


He slept over one night and my mom walked into my room in the morning (seeing his shoes at the front door still) and yelled at me for having him stay the night. I tried to explain that the buses had all stopped running and I didn't get what the problem was anyways. We had never talked about boyfriends staying the night before but I never had to ask or warn if friends were staying over. 

Anyways it ended up happening again. We stayed up too late watching a movie and I felt bad making him walk an hour home so late. 

My mom freaked out at me that I was disrespecting her boundaries for her house (my dad refused to comment or take sides). 


I know her issue is us having sex due to being Christian, but I'm not Christian and she knows I don't share her values. We also never had sex during these nights, and honestly could have sex during the day with even more ease than the night so i really dont get how it matters. I'm paying rent (admittedly not much) for my bedroom space but feel I should be able to use it or have people over within reason. 

I really do feel it is about her Christian values. My family always had an open door policy for my friends - I never had to ask or warn them if someone was staying the night (Including a platonic male friend who twice slept over - was completely ok with them). The only difference in this situation to my platonic male friend is her fear me and my boyfriend will have sex. Which makes me feel it is more about her trying to control what I do with my body because she sees it as a sin.

Am I the asshole for feeling like she is forcing her morals onto me and that I should be able to have a boyfriend stay the night?

Edit:
My parents had met him multiple times at this point.

My dad doesn't care if I have a boyfriend stay the night but isn't willing to intervene. 

My parents go to bed rather early and would say goodnight to us and my boyfriend would often stay till 1-2am on Sat when there's a night bus and they never minded how late he stayed. Again making me confused about what the difference is whether we are awake or asleep.

Since leaving I have been a part of a group chat involving all the people who sat at the same table for lunch (it was a big table). For a while it was just talking about exams and memes. That was until last week when I was out drinking for a friend from works birthday and while drunk a girl from a trip of girls who I've made it clear in the past that I don't like sent a message saying that they were on London seeing the K-pop band BTS and me in my brilliant drunken state thought it would be a good idea to give my opinions on said band.

Cast: 
Me
Girl 1 and Girl 2 (The two girls in London for BTS)
Girl 3 (The leader of this trio that bitches about people behind their backs) 
Guy

G1: Hi guys. In London. I'm drunk
Me: OMG same. But in (Town we live in)
G1: Me and G2 see BTS tommorow
Me: Are you there to protest them? 
G1: WTF no. I'm there to see them. What's wrong with them like.
Me: Lots of things 
G1: Like what? The fact they write songs about self love? They donate all their money to charity? 
Me: Just like every other Tom, Dick and Harry with a guitar.
G2: Why are you trying to be hard and cause a scene? 
Me: I'm not
G2: Then don't reply
Me: I was just giving my opinion
G1: I get that you have your opinion against them but try and make your argument valid. 
Me: Sorry that I dont like your favourite band. 

-G2 has removed you from this group-

I messaged FG 
 
Me: Hey could you add me back please?
FG: I thought about it, but their pretty pissed off right now. So I'll add you back once they're chilled.
Me: Can I just ask. Was I being a dick?
FG: Want me to be honest?
Me: Yeah
FG: So yes you were. She was just so excited about it and you totally killed her mood.

I got added back to the group the next morning. I scroll up and read the messages sent after I left (Cause yeah, you can do that on Facebook messenger)

G3: And I opp-
G2: Cba
G3: G2 snapped this is queen behaviour
G1: She snapped before I went moik. Like why would I travel across the country just to protest. And I know you all have your own opinions against music and I respect but that wasn't fucking valid.
Guy: He just got yeeted
G1: My mood is ruined
G3: Me knowing he's not going to let this go. OK but imagine him trying to drag race someone in his Fiat 500 
G1: I'm sorry guys I don't wanna annoy you all with my K-pop stuff I'll stop.
Guy: Op: *gives a very uncalled for criticism on a musical group* G2: hold my beer... yeet
G2: G2 doesn't take shit cba. (Before anyone asks this is G2 talking about herself and not a typo)
G3: (sends meme about talking garbage) All of us at OP's opinion
G2: G1 feels better y'all. Fucking OP made her feel bad.

And it was at this point they stopped talking and I was added back making us fully caught up on the chat. I sent one last message

bz5sra	2019-06-11 00:46:57		AITA or hypocrite for snapping at my mom for telling my daughter foul thing?	"Okay, to begin, yes I know that this sounds like an obvious question to answer, but it comes down to whether or not I'm being a hypocrite and a bad mom.

We both have a deep aversion to Islam as an ideology. My reasons are because I'm LGBT and hate the idea of any belief system oppressing people, but this post isnt about the morality of Islam (or any organized religion really). 

While I might have an issue with Islam, I keep that to myself around my daughter because she is only FIVE years old. While I want to guide her to be a good person, I do NOT want to indoctrinate her. And on multiple occasions after spending time with my mom, shes said things like ""Democrats are evil"", ""Hillary Clinton kills people"", and ""Muslims are animals"". Tonight I snapped and told her that what she is doing is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. At best, my daughter is going to get expelled from school for repeating this stuff, and at worst she is going to grow up a hateful person regardless of what I do. 


My mom countered by calling me a hypocrite because I swear in front of my daughter on occasion, let her watch me play violent games like Bloodborne, and explain to her in detail what the parts of her body are. She says my ""negligence"" is going to mess her up more than being honest about the ""goat fuckers"". 

In my defense, even though she is only 5, we live in an age of technology, and she already hears her friends swear. I'd rather teach her that swear words are only for private conversations and only for adults than shield her entirely.

Second, yes I know Bloodborne is violent, but it doesnt bother her, and even then I dont let her see the graphic and realistic cutscenes, just the monsters and blood. She isnt bothered at all and thinks ""mommy is great at killing monsters"". She said she isnt scared of the dark because I'm great with an ax. Silly, I know, but I also know my child and she isnt bothered. Again in the age of technology it would be worse to shield her. My own mother made me wait until I was 16 to watch anything PG-13 rated after she approved it. Imagine how disturbed I was when I found out the internet contained anything worse than Pokemon. 

Lastly, as far as her body goes... I'm in med school, so naturally I talk about medicine, and my daughter loves learning about what i learn. She was fascinated in learning about how to repair a hernia, and honestly, I'm SO PROUD that such a tiny child isnt squeamish and is so interested in learning about health, even the ""gross"" parts. This interest has made her the bravest kid I've ever known. 

But despite all my reasoning, I still feel guilty, and I feel like I may be wearing blinders. But I dont think I'm a bad mom. Shes already an honor student, excelling in everything, and displaying intelligence that I can't take credit for because shes self motivating, but I still want to nurture it, not shield her from the world as I see age appropriate.

bz5qky	2019-06-11 00:40:51	babylullaby	AITA for not telling or consulting my subletter about getting a cat?	"TLDR: I did not tell my subletter that I was going to get a cat. She found out and is very unhappy. 

I am a university student living in a college town. I am working at the university this summer and rented a room from another student from the May to August. We did not sign any lease and I just transfer the rent to her at the beginning of every month. At the time when I rented the house, I did not have a cat so we never discussed pet policies. 

I have been going through a rough patch recently and I thought getting a pet might help me emotionally. So I got on the internet and adopted a free-to-a-good-home cat at the beginning of June. I did not think this was going to be an issue because where we are located, landlords are not legally allowed to refuse pets. Thus, I did not ask my subletter for permission to get a cat or informed her that I was going to get the cat at all. 

I got a message from my subletter today saying that she heard from someone else that I got a cat. She said that the landlord does not allow pets and she wants me to get rid of the cat. I responded saying that a no pet clause is illegal so the landlords have no right to ask for such a thing (also they have never come by ever so I also don’t think they will ever find out). She responded saying that since we never signed a lease, I am just someone living in her room and paying her money. I am not a tenant and have no association with the landlord. She wants me to get rid of the cat because she has a cat allergy or else I can move out by the end of the month. 

I do not think I will be getting rid of the cat since I am only looking to sublet a place for three months before transitioning to another place and I fully intend to take the cat with me. So I will probably move out. There is much more supply than demand when it comes to summer housing so I do not think I will have a problem finding another place. However, I felt very guilty after she told me that she had a cat allergy and I felt that I have handled this entire matter very inappropriately.  although she will never come in contact with the cat, I am afraid that she might have an allergic reaction due to remaining particles of the cat even after I move out. But at the same time, I think since I had paid her to rent the place and tenants are legally allowed to keep whatever pets they please where I live, I was within my right to get a cat without consulting her on the matter. 

AITA for not telling or consulting with the subletter when I adopted a cat?

Edit 1: Sorry there seems to be a lot of confusion about the landlords not being allowed to deny pets. This is actually true in Ontario where I live. Landlords are not allowed to add no pet clauses or charge a pet deposit here.

The four who are now in college each got $100 from me.  I received lovely, prompt thank you notes.  Their parents don’t have a ton of money, they’ve all worked through HS and saved for college, took out loans, and 2 of them started at community college to save money.  We’ve always done a little cousin gift exchange at the holidays, and they’re always genuinely, vocally grateful and always write thank you notes.

We have three graduations this year - a nephew and twin nieces.  The nephew is like his older siblings/cousins, but the twins are the polar opposite.  They are bratty and entitled, have never worked a day in their lives, have been given cars, expensive clothes, etc.  Their parents will be paying for all of their college expenses at private 4 year schools.  One year, my parents (their grandparents) splurged a bit and got all of the cousins Kindle Fire tablets.  These two opened them, took one look and said, “We already have iPads and MacBook Airs, so...no.”  And then handed them back.  Not only do they never write thank you notes, they never say thank you.  

I told DH that I was planning on giving my nephew $100, as I’ve done in the past, but will probably get the twins nice cards and $25 Starbucks GCs.  He said I shouldn’t give different gifts, and I said that I wasn’t obligated to give equal gifts - I believe this is fair, if it equal.

He lives a bit further away, and I realise it's not so practical for me to go all that way to simply drop off something. So I thought about mailing it to him. 

Then I remembered he mentioned he dislikes surprises. And I thought about the implications of me mailing to him and if he would hate the gesture more than anything. So I texted him to ask about it.

As expected, he ain't a fan if I were to do it but it left on this sort vague, open ended note and it would depend on the gift.

bz5nis	2019-06-11 00:32:33	fromz2z	WIBTA if my fiance and I refuse to help my Mother with dental bills until she gets a part-time job?	"Obligatory - long time lurker, first time poster.

First, please understand that my mother means the world to me. But she has a TERRIBLE track record with money - blew through two separate inheritances with nothing left and filed for bankruptcy a few years ago. 

She's been described as ""a con-man's dream"" - very trusting, not very discerning. 

6 months ago I got engaged to the love of my life. A year before our engagement, (we had already been together for 2 years) he revealed to me that he had received a sizable inheritance. More than enough for us both to never have to work again and live quite comfortably.

Now, again, we aren't married yet and I have absolutely no claim to this money nor do I care if he has money or not. He's my partner in all things. The money is just a bonus. 

A few months ago, I get a call from my Mother saying that she desperately needs dental work and can't afford it - roughly to the tune of $5k. Can we please help? 

I speak to my fiance and offer to get a job solely for the purpose of paying for her dental work. But he insists to help while also raising his concerns that this is a very slippery slope and he is not a bank.  

I agree and decide to fly home for a week and help my mother go through her finances to see what is going on, where there may be wiggle room, etc.  

Long story short, it's a mess but 
we come up with a plan to get her a part-time job (she hasn't had one in years) that should squarely put her back in the black in a few months. I also inform her that my fiance has offered to help with her dental bills but she needed to get more than one quote from dentists as $5k seemed pretty high for what she needs done. 

This morning I get a series of of emails with quotes from her dentist totaling in $9,000 in dental work, and a final email saying ""Thank you both so much. Why don't we call is $4,800 this month and $4,100 in July, so you don't have to send me so much so soon. Love, Mom""

I am FLOORED and my fiance is PISSED. How did it go up so much? Where did she get the idea that we'd just be giving her $9k? Also, HOW does she think it is OK to ask my FIANCE for this much money? We aren't even married yet!

I broke down in tears on our front porch in frustration and anger. I feel that she is taking advantage of my fiance's kindness and it breaks my heart. 

My fiance now wants to step in and ""have a word with her"" which I dread but also feel it's completely within his realm to do so. 

We both agreed that she will not receive a penny until she gets a part-time job and can start to bring some of her own money in.

But this is an overall shitty situation and I am torn vetween 2 people I love.

bz5n05	2019-06-11 00:31:05	DocSchiller	AITA for removing my sister in law from my life? (longish)	"I'd love to learn your opinions regarding this.

My wife has 3 siblings. The youngest (F 30ish) is easily offended and gets into verbal fights and arguments quite often, including with the family. I (M38) like to stay out of drama and didn't have any issues with her in the past. 
Important for later: She likes to take pictures at family gatherings without asking beforehand, which I don't care for at all. I've told her this in the past many times with mixed success.

Rewind back to Easter Sunday 2018 - family had gathered for lunch. I casually talk with her and bring up her Ex, who I had really liked, to learn how hes doing, should she know. She refuses to answer and appears super shocked by my question (breakup was 5+ years ago).  I never knew this was an issue for her, I wouldn't have asked otherwise. 
Lunch progresses, she takes her usual pictures (also of my wife and our daughter). I frown at this, but don't actively object.

Fast forward later that day, we get into a fight via WhatsApp which escalates from a normal conversation. She gets on my back with lots of drama, how dare I ask her about her Ex.
I reply I never knew it was an issue and - since we are so nicely asking each other for favors - request her to delete the pictures of me and my daughter she took today.
At this point she snaps and becomes very furious and insulting, which is something I right out refuse to subject myself to. I quit the conversation and block her number. A few minutes later, she leaves the Family WhatsApp group. No contact until December, I ban her from our appartment until she feels she can speak to me in a civil way. This includes not seeing her niece (never been really close, only visited when she needed something or a favor).

I've seen her again at Xmas dinner 2018, haven't spoken with her more than ""Hi"". No contact since.

To be honest, I do not miss her at all. AITA here for being so abrupt with my actions? I know her for 19 years (ever since I met my wife). No attempts have been made by either side to contact.

Thank you for reading this.

Edit:
Wife was ok with my decision. We consulted beforehand and she felt it was the appropriate action to meet that bratty attitude of her sister.

None of the other siblings got involved.

Also, I never knew the breakup was bad. I just really liked the Ex and had hoped she was still in touch. He never finished his law studies and I tried to convince him more than once to continue, since he was very talented (I'm an attorney myself). We sadly fell out of touch 1-2 years ago.

Edit2: Thank you everyone for providing insight and sharing your thoughts. 
I agree that my actions were too exaggerated and harsh. Guess I was the A-hole (at least one of the possible AHs) after all.
Nevertheless, I am content with not having any contact and will most likely not attempt to rekindle."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	16.0	6.0	0.0	0.0

bz5lob	2019-06-11 00:27:28	dadthrowaway78529	AITA for refusing to let my ex take my child (not her biological child)	"This is a complicated situation. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I had a one night stand with a girl in college. She got pregnant and wanted to keep it in spite of me wanting nothing to do with it. She agreed to let me out of it and raise the kid herself, but she still came after me for child support so I've been paying out the ass for a kid I never wanted. I don't want to have anything to do with the kid. The mother is a materialistic, lying money grubber from what I can tell of the situation, so I just pay what I'm legally required to and stay the fuck away.

After this, I met my wife and got married. We had a daughter and the marriage disintegrated due to addiction problems on my end and mental health problems on my ex wife's end. After the divorce, my ex wife got in touch with my baby mama and they started getting the kids together and hanging out together in spit of the fact that I did not like this and did not want my daughter around that woman. 

My ex wife recently had a mental breakdown and isn't able to take care of our daughter. I am not able to care for her either due to my own financial and addiction problems that I'm working on. I would like our daughter to go into a group home until I or my ex is capable of caring for her, which will happen in the next few months. My ex wife wants my daughter to live with my baby mama. I put the veto on that, as she has to right to take in my daughter who she isn't even related to and I'm sure she's just doing it for the extra money. I don't trust her to care for my daughter as she requires and I wouldn't be surprised if she blows the money on herself and/or neglects my daughter. 

My ex wife is furious with me and blames me for our daughter being in foster care. I think I did what's best for her, as she will at least go to someone who has experience with kids in her situation and who is vetted and less likely to be abusing the system.

My father-in-law was in the backyard talking to my husband and my kids (7 & 5 years old) wanted to go outside with them. I told them not to because grandpa and dad were talking and grandpa has a short tempered, which I believe it to be true. My 5 year old asked if men had short tempers and I replied that wasn’t the case since I’m a woman and I short tempered. 

Later today, my 7 year old tells my father-in-law that I said that he had a short temper and he got very upset. My son said it in front of my husband and mother in law as well. The moment was absolutely awkward. My husband asked me to apologize to his father, which I did, but my fil is still upset. I honestly don’t think I did anything wrong. I don’t think having a short tempered is bad, but now I’m wondering if maybe I shouldn’t have told my kids that.

After we moved, she asked me if I could swap the power from the old house to the new house and pay last months (March's) light bill. She usually pays the light bill but I dont mind because she just got a new job and is still paying off college loans. So I go pay what I thought was March's light bill. Fast forward to today when she goes to pay it, its almost 500 bucks! She calls me at work so I take my break and go find out what up. Turns out, when I paid the light bill for the old house, I actually paid Februarys light bill as she was a month behind and I didnt know. She swears we were all caught up but the lady behind the counter showed me every payment that we made and we were without a doubt a whole month behind. So I paid the full amount and went about my day. Now shes mad because she thinks I paid too much, and that the light company screwed me out of almost 200 bucks. AITA? For further info, we decided that were not ready to mix our finances just yet as we've only been married a year and we've heard most newly weds argue over money. This is the first time money has cause any stress between us and we've both been pretty broke until now. I'm caught up on bills and I'm paying off my loan soon.

That had been sorted out and we decided we were going to go in July.

I decided to quit my new job because of issues I have with the company and instead travel. My friend of a few years had told me we should go on a roadtrip and I told her if I was available I would. Now that I am quitting, her and I decided to go on the roadtrip we have been wanting to fo gor the past year. 

We discussed it today and decided we would go to Canada. I specifically stated we shouldn’t go to the same city that my girlfriend and I were going to and she agreed so we are deciding to go to Montreal. 

My girlfriend asked if I was still planning on going to Toronto with her and I told her yes and that was that.

When I told my mother, she said she knows how girls think and that I shouldn’t go to Canada because it would pretty much ruin my girlfriend and I’s experience and is a mean thing to do.

bz5drl	2019-06-11 00:06:59	frthr11	AITA for cutting off a friend for not getting me a card for my wedding?	"For full context/saga, you can check my post history.

My friend and I have been having some tension due a series of let downs. Each time I expressed how it hurt me, I tried to understand why it happened, and forgiven her. Previously, I've just let things slide because I value the friendship, and I can see its not malicious, even if its hurtful. But when things happen repeatedly, it starts to make me feel unimportant and devalued as a friend.

So a few weeks prior to my wedding she had reached out to repair our friendship. She apologized for past behaviour, said that I am important to her and that she wants to work on having a close friendship. I told her that her inconsistency frustrates me and I never know if I can rely on her, but it's not like I think she's a bad person, just maybe not self-aware or honest with herself. I told her that we can start with a clean slate at my wedding. She asked if there was anything I needed before the wedding to help with, and I said no. She asked what explicitly do I need from her at the wedding, and I told her that I don't expect anything different from her than I would anyone else, just celebrate fully. She told me to tell her if I was ever upset about something and she would make time to talk it out. 

Wedding happens. It's a beautiful night. Wish I had more time to spend with everyone as it was a fairly large wedding, but she came over to us to chat for a bit and danced with us on the dancefloor. However, few days later we were going through the cards and saw that she was the ONLY person to not give us a card. I was very hurt and disappointed. This is not about the gift, literally about the card and the thought/sentiment from someone who was *very* close to us as a couple. It was also frustrating that I wouldn't be able to bring this up to her without looking like I cared about a gift (people were very generous, and unless her gift came from the heart it wouldn't make a difference). For me, this was the bare minimum for me to continue moving forward in our friendship, to show she cared in the most basic of ways.

So 3 weeks later, as I'm getting ready to just cut this off, she messages me saying that she's an idiot who forgot to send the card and just wanted to confirm our address. I was polite but dry in my response and she knows I'm upset. In the context of a healthy friendship it's not a big deal, I could've easily given her the benefit of the doubt. But because of our conversation, the state of our friendship, and the fact that she said that this is something that she wants to work on - this hurts and angers me and clearly shows me that my friendship is not valued enough to put in the most basic of effort. I'm also tired of always bringing things up, having her tell me everything I want to hear, and then the cycle repeats itself.

So a little background, my sister is getting married like the title says, but the issue is this, our whole family is in California while the groom's family lives in New York. Through a series of events it was decided that the wedding will take place in NY, ok that's all fine and good, but the tickets are going to cost over 700$ per person. Now I work but I'm also a student and that's a huge amount of money for me, so I figured that since I'm shelling out money for the ticket and probably lodging I'm not also responsible to give my sister and her husband-to-be a wedding gift too am I? Basically me coming is my gift. I can barley afford that as it is. So, WIBTA if I go to the wedding but don't give my sister and her husband-to-be a gift?

We are both in college and have a mutual group of friends. I'm not super big or very strong. My friend and I are taking a photography class together, but our friendship has recently not been going well. So we have lockers in the photography room at school, and in the school syllabus it says that we need to be ready to clear out the lockers at any time when there is maintenance to be done. We have to pay for lockers. I let my friend use my locker because she said she didn't want to spend the money on one. I decided to buy one because I don't have a car and I take public transportation / walk to school and carrying all that equipment back and forth everyday would be too much for me. So last week our teacher told us they had to do maintenance  on the lockers and all our stuff had to be out of them. If there is stuff in our lockers it could be thrown out, or we could face a fine. My friend missed the class because she was getting ready to fly to another state for a wedding and I guess had not packed or prepared anything. I told her that they were cleaning out the lockers  and we needed to get everything out. I explained that I have to take home my camera, my tripod, and my other equipment along with my laptop and text books for other classes and I couldn't take both sets of our equipment. She asked me if I could take an uber, I told her I couldn't afford that right now. I literally had about $30.00 in my bank account and I would not get paid until friday. She got really mad and came down to the school. She texted me and asked me if I could run outside with all her equipment, but that would mean leaving all my stuff alone in the art building, and risk it getting stolen because I wouldn't be able to carry it all. (My school has a big theft problem.) She got really upset and huffed into the building to grab her stuff. I told her I was sorry and she responded very coldly ""it's fine, I'm just going to miss my flight over this."" Since then she hasn't talked to me and our mutual friends keep asking me what happened. I've been uninvited to things, and I feel really bad. I honestly don't think I could have helped her. I guess I could have gotten an uber home or asked someone to talk me. AITA?"

He's came to help me get my car running when I was stranded in the winter at midnight. Been there to help get me out of the house when my depression reared it's ugly head durring a spat of unemployment.

He went to jail a few days ago for a warent on a 3yo court date he missed. I agreed to stop by and feed/water his dog and let him out to pee and what not. When I got to his house the state of this dog broke my heart. He's an old dog (14yo), and in very rough shape. Missing big chunks of hair near his tail, skinny, his nails are so long they are twisting and breaking off, the wax from his ears has drained down and matted into the fur below. I'm livid with this guy, to neglect another living thing in such a way. I called my father about the situation because he has always been my moral compass and it a great human being. He told me what I already knew, that I had to put an end to the situation. He also offered to take the dog and get it to the vet and get him the help he needs. As well as giving it a good home for the few years he has left. He wouldn't however ever let this guy have him back. The other alternative is the aspca or the pound, sadly though given the dogs current state and his age chances are he would be euthanized. I don't want to see this happen, he's a sweetheart, and a gentle guy.

Needless to say I'll be giving this guy a peice of my mind and letting him know I won't have anything to do with him from now on when he gets out. So reddit WIBTA if I let my father take the dog or should I just involve the authorities?

UPDATE: Called our city's version of aspca today, gave them the details. They will be picking him up in the next 24hrs.

Additionally, I have a sort of large collection of oddities, bones, misc. dead parts, things of that nature, etc. I am an artist, and quite a bit of this figures into my work.



The other day, my roommate and I are sitting out on our porch, smoking a bowl. I've been eyeing a specific two-headed calf design lately that I'd like for a tattoo, accompanied by a beautiful poem (I can try and link it if anyone wants to see it and/or if it might be relevant).


He asked me what the inspiration was. Without missing a beat OR thinking, I immediately said ""oh, I love freaks, I'm a real big oddities collector"". He didn't bat an eye, and neither did I; at least not initially. 


In passing, i mentioned the story to a friend, because they'd asked me how my day had gone. I filled her in, and she promptly told me what i said was uncool. I am now double guessing myself (as i often do in social situations).



I genuinely didn't mean to, and I don't believe it phased my roomie. But I want to ask you guys if you think I should say something or apologize.

My step-mom has a daughter who is a year older than me (for reference, me and my step-sister are both teenagers). I stayed with my mom during their trip and my step-sister stayed with her aunt. Last Wednesday (6/5) I got a call from my step-mom. She put the phone on speaker and her and my dad said that they got married earlier that day and I was the first one they called. She said that my dad surprised her with the wedding. I felt like the world was crashing around me and I started sobbing, they only heard a little bit but I told them congrats and they hung up to tell my step-sister. 

The four of us are really close. My dad and my step-mom have been dating for 4 years and engaged for 2. My step-mom is like a second mom to me and I love having a sister since I’ve been an only-child for most of my life. My dad and step-mom asked us for the past two years whether my sister and I would be upset if they went to a courthouse and got married without us there and every single time we told them that we would be incredibly upset and angry if they did that to us. 

Today I saw my dad for the first time since the marriage and in the car to his house it was pretty quiet and we didn’t talk about what happened. When we were about 30 minutes from his house we started talking and I pretty much freaked out and started raising my voice and getting hysterical about how hurt I am. He said that he wasn’t thinking about what the family would think, they just didn’t want to wait any longer and the thought of just getting married in our home state never crossed their mind. I told him that he could’ve called beforehand or gotten my step-sister and I a plane ticket to be there to see the wedding. He thought that the happiness of them getting married and me and my step-sister becoming legally sisters would outweigh the sadness of not being there. I told him that it doesn’t even come close. 
At dinner today, all four of us talked and my step-mom said that when her and my dad heard me cry on the phone it broke their heart and it took them a while to get over. I said “Aww, you guys have had it so rough, haven’t you?” It was rude of me but I felt that it was condescending of her to say something like that. 

I’m not mad that they got married, I’m mad that they didn’t consider telling any of the family beforehand or thinking about how hurt and betrayed my step-sister and I would feel.

AITA?

My kid was bullying other kids when in public school. Ex knew about my decision to homeschool, ex-MIL did not for a time. I decided to homeschool originally because I felt I could teach my kid just as well if not better than any other teacher, then when kid proved to be not mature enough and the principal recommended to wait a year due to being a young 5 with other classmates being 6 and to give kid more time to mature, I knew I was correct in my decision. I am not asking for judgement for my decision to homeschool. I am not asking for judgement to see if ex or I was TA. I am asking for judgement between ex-MIL and I only. I just gave some backstory to help with the judgement. Ex-MIL’s tone when she said I was not fit to teach kid DID imply that she thought I was too stupid to do so since I had not graduated from high school even though the reason had nothing to do with my intelligence. Also, every school is different and kid’s school has a 0 tolerance rule, so yes, it is true that kid was sent home nearly every day despite the fact that I was working with the teacher for behavioral concerns. Please only pass judgement for the situation about ex-MIL and me. Sorry also about a wrong title, I tried to change it but it won’t let me.

I knew our kid wasn’t ready for a large classroom, but ex and I compromised and gave our kid a trial for kindergarten. The teachers and principal agreed with me after just two weeks. I was called almost every day to come pick up my kid for one reason or another. Finally I got ex to agree to withdraw our kid from school. So ex and I agreed MAYBE next year.  

Kid still wasn’t mature enough to handle a large classroom setting and I’d been homeschooling anyway. I decided on my own then to not enroll kid in public school and just continue my plan to homeschool. Kid is thriving in learning academically at that point, but still having a hard time sitting still for longer periods to pay attention and not get into trouble.  

Ex-MIL kept pushing to have kid in school (not her kid, right?) along with ex. Finally she told me that I wasn’t qualified to teach my kid. Legally speaking, anyone can homeschool at any time for any reason if proper documents are taken care of (if required). My first thought was “How can anyone be so stupid to not be able to teach their kids for kindergarten, or even at least the first few grades?”   

Anyway, I ended up bending the truth when ex-MIL would ask how kid did in school and what was learned etc., not mentioning that I was homeschooling but just giving a quick summary of what I taught that day or week. When ex-MIL found out kid was being homeschooled and not in public school, she was irate and didn’t talk to me for quite some time. My ex was never happy about the decision to homeschool but he wasn’t home with kid as much as me due to work to see how kid’s learning and focus was going much better at home.
  

Of course I feel I’m in the right, but a different perspective may be necessary. So, AITA for basically lying to ex-MIL and homeschooling kid anyway, or is ex-MIL TA for basically saying I was too stupid to teach my kid?"	Not enough info	0	0	36.0	19.0	0.0	0.0
bz59r7	2019-06-10 23:56:21	FinnacRYThrowAway	WIBTA if I cut contact with my mom over her boyfriend?	" I (F17) and my mom (F41) have had a great relationship for the entirety of my life. When her and my dad divorced, she buckled down and started working non-stop to be able to support me and my two brothers. My dad has not really been there for us in any shape or form, so I've always been grateful for the love my mom gives and the sacrifices she makes to keep our family happy and together. So, I was entirely supportive that she does whatever she can to make herself happy, she truly deserves it for being such a wonderful woman. 

Enter her boyfriend about two years ago. Initially I was rather nonchalant about the whole relationship, after all as I said, if she had finally found someone who could make her happy, then who was I to complain? I was happy she'd found someone special, but recently I've made an effort to get to know her boyfriend because I didn't want my mom to be sad. And to be very honest.... I just can't fucking stand the guy.

It's not like he's just annoying (though he is) or rude (which he is). He's constantly making ignorant remarks about a variety of things that include race and sexuality. To provide more specific examples, he constantly refers to Chinese people as ""orientals"" and makes jokes at their expense (they can't drive, they eat cats, etc). When I was over at his and my mom's place, I was unbraiding my hair (I'm black). He (white btw) started feeling my hair and saying how weird it felt. I was visibly uncomfortable, but I've never been very good at confrontation so I didn't say anything. When my mom noticed and told him to stop, he laughed and kept going. He refers to gay people as ""fags"" and is one of those people who thinks if the LGBTQ people can have a Pride Parade, then so can straight people.

Furthermore, my mom has a drinking problem and she has for quite some time. My family has supported her and recommended that she seek help, but her boyfriend is just very...confusing about it all? He gets mad at her for drinking (since a relative of his died from excessive drinking) and threatens to kick her out of the house when she gets drunk (my brothers and I live with our aunt, so she'd have somewhere to go). However, then he'll turn around and bring HARD liquor into the house and drink it around her and invite her to drink, it's just fucking confusing and very counterproductive. 

She frequently invites me to their house and I usually oblige since I want to make her happy and she's done so much for our family, but I just don't want to be around this dude anymore. It's not my place to tell my mom who she can and can't be with, but at the same time I don't feel like me pretending to like this guy (since when around him I just get quiet and it's clear I don't like him) is much help either since it still upsets her.

bz5890	2019-06-10 23:52:37	NitzMitzTrix	AITA for purposefully alienating a coworker who makes me feel like shit?	"So I've got a coworker, luckily we only work 2/8hrs together on every days but the start of the week, in which there being no second shift I come to work at the usual hour. He is very opinionated, fancies himself a comedian, and is ALWAYS right. Now, I started taking issue when he kept making me ""in charge of the farts"", he has some sort of compulsion to talk about bodily functions and exotic diseases. Then he kept making inappropriate comments that paint me in a horrible light(I lost my earphones and he claimed I threw them in the garbage while laughing maniacally. Then he kept trying to aggressively matchmake between me and another worker. When I finally told him about my bf overseas to get this to stop, he started ranting about how people of my bf's nationality are psychoes who will suddenly flip out on me, conflating his nationality with its more well-known neighbors, and even after correcting him, he kept talking shit about my bf while constantly encouraging me to ""settle"" for the other worker, which made me angry. After I let everyone know I'm applying to a university where my bf lives, he started ranting about how I'll never get accepted as it's extremely difficult and I should have picked an easier place like Romania. I have several other reasons for picking my bf's place, namely it being the only place in the West outside of my country where my ethnicity isn't implicitly or explicitly persecuted. I kept making my case but he'd repeat his over. and over. and over. He'd also start blaming me for every single thing that's out of place at work, as the night shift manager(who bore the brunt of having to deal with his attitude before he had to latch onto me) got more and more secure in her role and blaming her implicitly was no longer viable. That combo of constantly being the scapegoat and having my life, hopes and dreams torn down whenever I'm forced to spend time with him really pissed me off.
Eventually, I snapped at him yelling at him to stop making a mess and blaming it on me, which again prompted him to tell me how I'll fail in my school because I lack the culture. Thing is, after having to hear him mewl for a few days and a mandatory finger-wagging from my managers, I found a pattern to exploit: After alienating him sufficiently, he'll give me enough space. So I started tearing him down verbally and generally being a bitch to him so he won't want to be around me to make my day Hell, and for the past month or two, it's working! I let out some steam and he gets insulted enough to keep his distance for at least 20 minutes in a row. Now I know how it sounds, but we have occupational therapy people AND he denies having any psychiatric conditions on the many times he implied I do(I do, yes, but no, that's none of his damn business, as I got through the front door a company worker, same as his)

I texted hubby at work and asked if he had hired anyone (highly unlikely but you never know) and no. He knows that due to my history I don't open the door to men I don't know/am not expecting. He asked the neighbour to go over and see what was up. 

Neighbour wasn't quite home so it took a bit. Turns out the guy had misread the house number. Guy asked our neighbour if we were likely to pay him. He was given a diplomatic answer. 

Later Thai evening as I was getting the kids ready for baseball he walks up to me and asks if I can pay him for the work. He said that he had to re-assembke our plastic play structure (he's the one that moved it) I said that unfortunately I don't have the budget for that and I tanked him. He tried a few other tactics but I actually don't have money to give him. He eventually left. (He then, I later learnt that he went and complained about me to my neighbour, because he did a job and we should have paid him) 

so... Should I have come up with money to pay him? I don't carry cash so I really have no idea how this would have been accomplished but. Should I have worked something out?

bz56cc	2019-06-10 23:47:45		WIBTA if I confront my cousin's boyfriend?	"Hello again, friends.

So, my cousin is somewhere between a best friend and a sister for me. We've been raised together, and I adore her to little bitty pieces. I also really like her boyfriend, we've know in each for a while now, and he's a good kid (he's 20, my cousin and I are 21).

They've been through a lot together, and just recently, they've been through my cousin's mom dying and her step mom skipping town - all in the last five months. Her family is, in a few words, falling apart.

And instead of coming home to her own home, with her dear boyfriend of four years and their dog, she's coming home to his entire immediate family.

His mother recently got out of prison, and after she got kicked out for illegally staying at another person's home, she ""stayed"" with my cousin and her son and then never left. His little brother was already living with them, and his little sister also recently moved in with her kids in tow. 

And it's hitting absolutely killing her. His family leeches off her, and has since they started dating. She's practically raised his siblings because his parents are deadbeats, and if was his family. And now, her family is falling apart and she has to come home to his family, all shoved into a two bedroom home. And he refuses to set any boundaries, saying he won't kick out his family, which is something I do understand, but this dedication is coming at the expense of his girlfriend, who also pays for the home they're living in.

One day, while she's at work this week, I want to go over there and talk to her boyfriend. I know it's probably a bad idea, but I want to try and give him a different perspective. On one hand, I'm obviously in my cousin's corner, so he might see it as an attack. On the other, I'm relatively removed from the situation, so I can separate my personal emotions from the situation.

So, my question is - would I be an asshole for getting involved? I know it isn't really my buisness, but my cousin is between a rock and a hard place, and she's faltering, and I just want to help her in any way I can."	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bz568o	2019-06-10 23:47:31	halfcleandisaster	WIBTA if I tell the teacher I share a classroom with to fix the black hole she's created?	"First year teacher at an urban high school. Our school is overcrowded so many teachers share classrooms. The teacher I share most of my space with is Bea. 

Also, the person who had this room for **a decade before us** was a total asshole and left everything behind.

Bea is also a first year teacher at our school. She brought everything from her old classroom and unpacked it around the room and left it **everywhere**. I was able to carve out a small space in the corner and a closet.

I teach only English Language Learners, so I wanted to put up posters for them. I asked her where I could put them and she said ""Thanks, but I don't really need that."" I asked about dictionaries on the table and she said, ""I don't think my students will need those."" I was taken aback but I didn't want to ruffle feathers as the newest gal on the block so I dropped the subject and moved the dictionaries to a side table. 

In the second semester Bea and I now share the room 50/50 (more than before). We are friendlier now. However, the classroom continues to be a disaster. Every day, her students leave out computers, food and more. Her students have destroyed some of my dictionaries. Everything moves every day and I can't find pencils. Worse, the **three** tables that comprise ""our"" desk are covered in papers, coffee, etc. Bea often forgets papers and comes in when I'm teaching, which I don't mind, but once she made a negative comment about my class's behavior that sent them absolutely berserk. 

My students help clean and are sad about the mess. Bea just sighs when I ask if hers can help too.

The wrinkle: Budget cuts. I am counted under a different budget line, so it was guaranteed that Bea was going to lose her job. Bea understandably has a negative attitude towards work. We don't know who will have this room but I don't think whoever has it next should have to deal with it like we have, so I've been trying to clean it up.

I started cleaning a few weeks ago and asked Bea if she was going to start soon. She said ""no, and honestly I don't care what state this room is left in. I'll take my stuff but that's it."" I can understand her not wanting to help me throw away the old guy's stuff, but there is a LOT of her stuff to clean as well. It's been a month since she brought bins but nothing has gone in them. Every day she says ""I just feel so underappreciated by this place right now. I'm not coming back anyways so it doesn't matter."" Meanwhile, I've been staying late to clean old guy's stuff and offering to help her.

I mentioned it to my colleague/best friend at work today, and she's with Bea. She argued that when she was a new teacher on cleaning day she never left when the clock struck 12. I don't want to leave a messy room and I'm tired of being put off for 5+ months.

Unfortunately I've learned that some employers are according to my friend who works in HR said are going to reject me because I'm overqualified which I didn't really believe until both a Starbucks and McDonalds rejected me. The last business that's reasonably close to me that hadn't rejected me was a Best Buy. So I applied. Got a phone interview. At the end of the phone interview I was told that I'd get called back soon with my in person interview time. I was excited got my dress shirt nice and ironed and hung up and ready to go. Out of nowhere Momday my Best Buy account has a No Longer Considered Status on it and when I tried to call and drive up there the HR person called the BOL isn't there. The general response from the r/Bestbuy subreddit seems to believe that I was overqualified for the position. I find it immoral to create another account with worse qualifications but I really need the money if I'm gonna survive much longer. I figure best case is it works and I get a position and they get a position filled or in the worst case they recognize me and ignore it.
Would I Be the Asshole if I made another account? (I prefer AITA in the title)

My Customer Service manager told me a month ago that a manager from our main competitor was joining us as pet time office staff. Okay, no problem, I thought. 

The new office staff, who we’ll call Jen, started about 3 weeks ago. I don’t know what it was, but something about her turned me off. I still was nice and polite, but it was a bad guy feeling from the start. 

We first trained her to be a cashier, then to work the Self Check Out area, then the desk. Whenever I or other office staff would comment on how to do something, she would say “well, at the competition, we would do x y z”. I started to very easily be annoyed by this, since she would do it whenever I would say the tiniest thing. Once I was bagging for her and reminded her to press a button on the POS and she snapped at me and said “honey, I know how to cashier”. She later said she was sorry, that she was just frustrated with everyone telling her what to do. I just reminded her that we were showing her how to do it OUR way. 

She has been here three weeks and still refers to things as how our competitor does it. Many of the associates below me have come up to me to confide that they don’t like her, and I agree. She has a strong personality and talks way too much. 

She also is too “friendly” with one of our other cashiers. She’s about 50/60 and the cashier she talks to is 18. She will poke his sides, taunt him, like she has a schoolgirl crush on him. And it’s completely inappropriate.

I offered her my cell phone number one time when I went on break and she would be alone on the sales floor, and she rudely responded saying she didn’t need it, she’s been up there alone before. When I came back from break, she said “im sorry for earlier, I don’t want you to call me a bitch”. I told her straight up that I hope she thought more of me than that, that my positive attitude has shown through. She said “I’m sorry, I don’t think that way of you, it was just my way of calling myself a bitch”. I told her she shouldn’t deflect her negative thoughts of herself into “my” words.

He particularly disapproves of the fact that I work, send the kids to daycare, and expect my husband to contribute to the household equally in spite of the fact that he makes more than I do. If my father in law had it his way, I would be waiting on my husband and kids hand and foot at all times. 

His recent tactic of snarky comments has been to say that everything we own or pay for is done with my husband's money. If I buy my husband a gift, FIL says, ""Is it really a gift if you're spending his money?"" If I pay for my FIL's coffee, he says, ""well, really your husband is paying for this."" It's annoying and frustrating. I tried being snarky back, didn't work. I tried talking to him about it and he just pretended he didn't know what I was talking about.

The final straw was that my kids have started saying it. I mentioned to my husband that I was going to get my hair cut and my son pipes up with, ""so you're going to go waste dad's money on yourself?"" and both kids start laughing. My husband told them that they were being rude and they defended themselves by saying that grandpa says it all the time! Apparently he's taken to telling the kids behind my back that I'm wasting my husband's money on myself every time that I buy anything for myself. One of my kids straight up called me greedy and selfish.

I'm livid and I want to ban my father in law from seeing my kids until he admits to what he's been doing, apologizes, and actually stops doing it.

We allowed them to stay rent free. We have a small two bedroom house, about 1200 sq ft, and they were buying a house 2 miles away that's 4 bedrooms and twice the size.

So as a joke (I wouldn’t really tell her he’s ugly seriously) I told her she could to better which is true, she’s very pretty, nice, and funny and her boyfriend is like 2 years older than her which isn’t a big deal but for our age it is.

So she responded with a paragraph telling me to keep my comments to myself and that it makes her sad. This was confusing to me because she’s said things to me MUCH worse! So she’s deciding to get upset over something that will last a month maybe?? 

Anyways, I told her it was a joke and honestly a compliment towards her because she could do alot better and from what I heard about him he doesn’t seem that good. 

I felt a little bad because I really don’t like hurting people’s feelings and if it did truly hurt her I’m sorry but she’s made me feel so much worse before and we joke like that deprecating jokes against each other are usually what we do! 



-Am I the asshole for joking with my friend about her relationship (which she’s done to me) when she’s said far worse to me and joking about stuff like that is regular in our friendship?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bz4w5w	2019-06-10 23:22:22	eatsaltedpeanuts	AITA for showing that I don’t want to hang out with smaller kids after they were (kinda) bratty?	"Last week, my mom asked me if I wanted to go to an escape room with someone that I had a negative opinion on (normal entitled kid), and some other kids I didn’t know. I always wanted to go to an escape room, so I just decided I’ll just stick it out and try to get along with everyone. I get there, and I just see kids running around and playing tag (they were in 4th grade). So I just decided that I should just stick to my phone and shut up. Then, a kid comes up to me and asks about my earphones (I have airpods) I answer politely and then they just leave. Then, the guy directing the game starts giving instructions, and me being me, I sit at the back of the room and listen there. Then my mom forces me to get up and sit with them, and I go to do so. Bratty kid I knew pats down the seat next to her to sit, but I make a beeline to the seat with the least amount of people. We go through directions, and they seem like kids I wouldn’t get along with, and give me weird looks when I ask if I can practice decoding a lock that they have.


Then the director leads us to our room, and they immediately start giving me bad impressions. One kid comes next to me and tells me to solve a lock, and then just ditches me without any info, just to put a number lock. I ask him to come help (the lock was hard to put the code in with one person) and he just tells me to do it later. Also, the entitled kid I originally knew was a huge brat, saying that since she was the only girl she basically gets anything she wants. Then, I solve a lock with one kid and he takes all the credit (I didn’t really care about that) but then later I come to see what lock he’s doing and he finds a clue at that moment. I watch him put it in, and after, he looks at me and says “you didn’t do anything, don’t say that you did.” This really pissed me off but I shut up knowing that he’s only in fourth. Most of my other experiences are regular entitled kid experience, like them taking stuff from my hand for puzzles, etc. We eventually finish, and we get to picture time,

During the picture, I’m kinda a a-hole. I first just skip the pic, but they drag me there. I just stand away from the group, and have a neutral face (my neutral face kinda looks like a frown tho) Then I hear entitled kid say “IM THE ONLY GIRRRRLLLLL, I GET TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE) This really pisses me off, but I don’t say anything. The EK then demands that next time, we should have b day parties together at this place (including me). Then I get in the car, and drive home.


My parents then get mad at me, saying that I should’ve pretended that I want to hang out with them and that I need to be a leader. I don’t really think it was that bad, I kept my mouth shut but showed that I didn’t really want to hang out with the group again. But idrk, be honest.

bz4w0j	2019-06-10 23:22:01	momwantsahugewedding	AITA for wanting to keep my wedding small even though it'll really upset my mother and possibly cause some heavy family drama?	"My fiancée [25F] and I [25M] will be marrying next year. I've done some thinking over the year that we've been engaged and come to the conclusion that I really just want a small wedding, ~60 or so people. We are mostly in agreement, though if she had it her way we'd be walking over to the clerk's office at lunch and calling it a day.  

My fiancée's family is small; they would contribute ~40 members, but they're easily cutting that number down to fit our guest list. The problem is my parents. They both have big families, but my mom's is more daunting. With three siblings and twelve or so aunts/uncles, her side of the family would make up a sizable guest list, easily 90 people if she had her way. My mom is also the type of person who is close with even tenuously linked members of her family, and she keeps good relations with kin of increasingly slight connection. It's a trait I usually admire about her.

I've tried having the conversation with my parents about this situation, but they won't hear it. My mom acts like I'm trying to bully her. She doesn't want to cut her list at all; every person I suggest removing sounds to her like an insult. She thinks my wedding will destroy her relationship with her family. My family can be hard headed so there may be some hurt feelings if some people get cut and others don't; it might cause some rifts.  

Then there's the cost. Fiancée and I both work full time, but neither of us get paid well. We're in a high cost of living state and I'm struggling getting myself out from under some foolish credit card debt (nearly there!) and a mountain of student loans. We have to budget ourselves just to think about moving out and making car payments. Looking into it, having a wedding the size my mom would want would put us at around $14k just for the venue and catering, our total cost probably landing in the $20-23K range.  I wouldn't pay that much for one event even if we did have the money. My mom has tried to compromise on this point saying that she will pay for the plate of every one of her family members, but even being generous that would put her at contributing $9K-12K, and my we would be on the hook for the rest. She claims the difference will be made up in gifts. It's possible, I suppose, but not something I want to gamble on. My mom insists that when they had their wedding and were able to afford a down payment on a house out of it; I just don't think that's at all likely for us.

The mood in my house is very sour whenever wedding talk comes up. My mom's dreading the day we make our small wedding plans known, because she will be the one primarily receiving backlash for it. I genuinely feel bad for her. But I don't want to spend more money and increase my stress because some judgmental family are going to be shitty. However, sometimes I think I should just bite the bullet to save my mom some heartache. So should I be compromising more? Finding a way to stretch the budget to include more people? AITA?"

bz4u8m	2019-06-10 23:17:19	peacockideas	WIBTA if I asked my in laws to stop giving my kid gifts for every holiday?	"Background to start: Basically we go to the in-laws for every major holiday, Christmas (gifts appropriate), Easter, Thanksgiving, fourth of July etc. 
We are by no means well off but are doing better than his entire family. Sisters are single moms, living in crappy apts working paycheck to paycheck barely scrapping by, and parents are doing better but its really looking like they may never get to retire due to finances. Meanwhile we just bought a house (not an expensive one but a house nonetheless), and almost never have to worry if something comes up.

Our son is the baby, hes 5 while all the other kids are teens or older.

Every holiday. And I mean every single one. All three get him elaborate gifts, we're talking 30-50. One time one of them bought something that was 150 not for Christmas or a holiday just randomly. It's gotten so bad that between them and my family (where so far hes the only, though I have talked to my family about toning it down, since I'm comfortable with them) my kid has mountains of toys, just more toys than a kid could ever use. I've even given quite a bit of chalk, crayons, coloring books, toys etc to the daycare and he still has more toys and art supplies than one kid could ever use, and hes only 5. I get that they love him and hes the baby, but honestly it's gotten so bad I almost never get to buy him anything cause I always feel like he already has too much. Add in the ""they're broke"" factor and I think like ""why are you wasting your money?""

I've tried saying stuff like ""you really shouldn't spend this much"" and talking about how things from the dollar store make him so happy. Hoping they'd maybe tone it down at least. But so far it continues. 

I've brought it up to the hubby and he just brushes it off. So I guess I'm asking what you guys think. WIBTA if I just came right out and said ""ladies save your money, hes got enough"" or should I just be glad that he has people who love him and want to spend what little money they have on him, and continue to give stuff away when they dont know?"

"After all the journalism that’s come out recently about the negligent, selfish and toxic effects of social media companies and other big tech firms, I found myself unable to stay friends with the people I know who work for them on the corporate level. I think that you have the right, when you’re choosing your friends, to consider who is paying them money and what potentially damaging effects their work has on the world (I can see someone making a similar objection to friendship with employees of the Catholic Church or, to flip it around, Planned Parenthood.) That said, I feel like there’s a case that I’m a hypocrite since 1) I used to work for a large tech company (although I left after growing disenchanted) and 2) I still am close friends with many people who work in finance firms, which are arguably even worse. 

(Also, in case it’s relevant, I don’t use any social media either, except for reddit.) 

What do you all think?

EDIT: I appreciate the insight. It’s pretty much what I expected. I would like to address 2 general points however. First, a lot of commenters think I’m judging these people for doing what they can to make rent and eat — I’m not. These are people making six figures in their mid-twenties without student debt. The world is their oyster but they are handing over their education and talent in exchange for prestige and money despite the thorny ethical implications. Which brings me to the second issue: Facebook alone has endured serious criticism for its rupture of USA Democracy, election rigging, facilitating genocide in Myanmar, and skyrocketing the rates of teen negative self-esteem, depression and suicide. I know I may sound like someone who has just watched too much Black Mirror but to me that’s Evil with a capital E.

bz4tjt	2019-06-10 23:15:36	Buck_slayer	AITA for telling my sister that I will not be willing to be guardian of her kids if she dies?	"So my sister is 35 and makes good money. She’s self employed so no work benefits and she’s a single mother. But she does like to spend her money too. Lots of shopping, designer clothes, new car every two years, kids wear nothing but naked brand clothes, etc..

So a few weeks ago we were talking about death and dying and our kids and I mentioned that I had just upped my life insurance after my third child was born. She told me she didn’t have any life insurance and didn’t “believe in it.” I asked her what about her two kids if she dies? (her kids are 5 and 8). She said “someone will take care of them and I won’t have to worry about it, I’ll be dead”

I was floored at how selfish and stupid this line of thinking was. I told her how my life insurance is dirt cheap, like $30 for half a million and I’m older than her.

Anyways fast forward to this weekend and she said that she’d been thinking about our conversation about death and kids and she thought it was the right time to make a will and asked if I’d be willing to be guardian of her two kids. I asked if she had reconsidered her position on the insurance and she said no she still wasn’t a believer. So I told her that I was not prepared to take on the financial responsibility of two more kids.

She went off! Started talking about how terrible I was for turning my back on family, etc..

Honestly, as I explained to her.... I have three kids and while I do make decent money I don’t feel I could comfortably absorb the additional cost of healthcare and general raising of two more young kids.

bz4su2	2019-06-10 23:13:47	Phenix7s	AITA for not understanding why I can't show my bf empathy when he's having a tough day?	"My bf and I (together abt 5 years) are Swiss but grew up in Tanzania speaking Swahili and Swiss German. My bf is currently working in Tanzania while I am finishing up Uni in Switzerland. He was telling me about another tough and long day of work over whatsapp, and has had a lot of tough days lately, so I said ""pole na kazi, (I empathise for the hard work), I'm glad you can finally get to bed."" ""Pole"" is one of my favorite words in Swahili and basically means ""I feel for you"". It can be used to express anything from joy (e.g. having a baby), to showing care when someone hurt themselves, to saying ""I feel for you"" for something shatteringly sad like a loved one dying. Way better than saying sorry as in most cases there's not much you could have done about the situation, and at the same time you're expressing care and empathy in just one simple word: ""pole"".

To that he replied with ""you all and your ""pole"", that's not gonna buy me anything, that's what everyone keeps saying and it's really getting on my nerves. It's nice of you but you don't have to say it all the time. Just take note of what I'm saying.""

That left me both perplexed and a little pissed off at the ""it won't buy me anything"" comment, as what the hell am supposed to do than show empathy and try to be encouraging? I get that it’s frustrating when people do a shit job and rather than say, ""ah man sorry my bad"" they say ""ah man bad luck"" even though it is their fault. In my opinion the context is completely different as I am not using “pole” to deflect but genuinely care that he had a hard and exhausting day. What am I supposed to do, just ignore him when he tells me about the tough day he had?

I replied with as much, and he responded ""that word doesn't belong in swiss german and it's just pissing me off so can't you just stop using it so much."" His first argument I find stupid, we're bloody third culture kids and I am not swiss nor am I tanzanian but something in between and the mix of both languages is part of what makes me me. The second part is the AITA part - I want to respect that it frustrates him, but how the hell am I supposed to use a word ""less"" that I have been using to express empathy with for over 27 years now? And what is ""less""? Only every other time? Once a month?

IATA for finding it unfair that I am not allowed to show empathy (he told me to just ""take note"" when he is complaining about a tough day (nehme es zur Kenntnis)? I am being supportive in the only way I can be from a million miles away over a messaging app, by listening and empathising. I don't understand why I have to change how I am as a person because of a word, which in my opinion the depends on the context and who is saying it. Even if I force myself to say ""I am sorry you had a bad day"" in swiss german instead of using “pole”, he would criticise me for saying sorry.

As I approached her, she was getting in line at a sandwich restaurant. There was no one behind her in line (this is important). We see each other, she acknowledges me, we hug and as we separate, I see there’s now a couple people behind us. I don’t really think anything of this and continue talking to my friend. The line goes by really fast and as my friend is about to order, I step in behind her since we’re ordering one at a time. At that moment, this woman (mid 40’s) brushes up against me and I step back at the contact, confused. This woman confronts me, looking pretty upset and says “I’m next!” 

As she says that, she quickly forces herself between my friend and I in line. And I look at her, dumbfounded. And I said, “what?” 

“You cut in line! I’m next! I was behind her when you showed up,” while pointing at my friend. 

I respond with “I’m so sorry, I didn’t notice you there. I was distracted with catching up my with friend. I didn’t mean to cut in front of you, I’m sorry for the misunderstanding.” 

My friend waved her ahead of her, also apologized to her. The angry woman stepped ahead of us and then proceeded to order while my friend and I just stare at each other, a little in shock/confused with what happened. 

Our immediate apology and letting her order ahead of us seemed to make her angrier. She proceeded to tell to person making her order about how rude we were and all her thoughts on line cutters. It was a little embarrassing to have her talking about us like we’re jerks, with others listening in. We said nothing more, just ordered/paid/left. 

That was the end of the confrontation... I’m still struggling to see how I cut in line, but perhaps I just didn’t notice her jump in line within a second of hugging my friend.

bz4r89	2019-06-10 23:09:46		AITA for swearing/talking loudly in front of a child at a restaurant?	"So to set the scene, I was recently at a restaurant with about 5 other people and when we walked in the it was near-deserted. I honestly thought we were the only people in the restaurant and it didn't register that there was an older woman and a child sitting maybe 15 meters away in a corner, facing the opposite direction of us.

So we've been sitting there for about 20 minute and naturally I started telling a story and so I've been talking for about 3-5 minutes and getting really into recounting this thing for the people I'm with. Admittedly, I have one of those voices that just ""carries"" and I go really over the top with story-telling with the aim to entertain and I always feel super guilty when I'm told I'm being too loud (this doesn't happen that often, but still). I don't really remember injecting any swears except for one instance when I was quoting someone else whilst telling the story, and even then I remember lowering my voice when saying the quote. But still, it's a near empty restaurant and the woman approached us right after I said this so I'm guessing it's what she heard.

So the woman approaches and very rudely (everyone I was with agreed she had a very rude attitude for the entire encounter) says, ""you need to keep it down.""

I of course become extremely apologetic, saying I'm sorry and I didn't realize she was there, I'll keep it down, etc. It was all very genuine. But she decided to keep going for roughly a minute and scolded me for my use of foul language in a public restaurant, saying that the 7 y/o she was with could hear (honestly this kid did not look like he gave a shit) and that it was inexcusable to use that language around her kid. Again, I just kept apologizing until she left to go back to her corner and I kept it down and barely talked after that because I felt guilty. But now I'm wondering if I really am the asshole in this situation? I don't know if I think her public shaming/scolding of me was really justified? Sure I was loud but when she approached me she was already hostile and didn't even try to be polite.

For context that may be relevant: Me (21F) and my friends (all college-aged M/F) and I live in the UK but we all have american accents, I'm guessing she got more angry as I was perpetuating the ""loud american teenager"" stereotype."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

29F no kids for reference. I was at the pool at my apartment complex today, enjoying a rare weekday afternoon off. I was laying on a chair about 15 feet from the pool reading a book. I am aware that the apartment complex is a shared space and can be noisy, and I’m ok with that. I’m also aware that if you sit by the edge of the pool or in the pool you will be splashed and I’m fine with that too.

A family with 4 kids, probably all 8-10 years old, came to the pool area and started filling up squirt guns to squirt each other. At first they were in the pool and that was fine. But a little after that they got out and started chasing each other around and squirting each other, and kept getting me and other people around me. They were aiming at times over my chair. The first couple times it happened I let go figuring it was an accident and they are just kids. I also assumed the parents would notice. But when it kept happening I started getting annoyed, especially  because they kept hitting my book and were screaming right in front of my chair.

I could tell the other people around me were annoyed, and the parents were watching and just didn’t care. I am a pretty direct person, and am usually willing to say things other people won’t,so the next time it happened I stood up, walked over to them and in a stern (not yelling) voice said: “can you please stop screaming and squirting each other over here? You are being incredibly rude and you need to watch the people around you. If you want to squirt each other, that’s fine but for the love of god will you do it in the pool?” About 3 seconds later the soccer mom came storming over and started yelling at me “how dare you talk to my kids! They will do whatever they want and you have no right to talk to my kids.” Then she yelled at her kids “do whatever you want you don’t have to listen to this “Barbie” (I’m brunette so technically I’d be Kelly, just saying.)

That made me mad so I said “listen lady, if you can’t control your kids maybe you shouldn’t take them out in public.” Not probably the most mature response but I didn’t appreciate her yelling at me so aggressively or making fun of how I look.

Afterword, the girl next to me thanked me for saying something, but I got a bunch of dirty looks from other parents. In hindsight I should have talked to the mom instead.

Update 1: On hindsight I could have talked to the mom, but I decided to address the kids because they were the ones misbehaving.  Plus, mom didn’t seem too concerned about it. I now feel like an asshole for yelling at the kids, but still think it was ultimately justified. Was that wrong of me?

Update 2: for those asking, I didn’t go to the office because you can get written up or fined for not following the pool rules (screaming, running, horseplay) and I didn’t think incident this warranted that response at the time.

Update 3: I stand corrected. I wouldn’t be “Kelly” I would be “Skipper.”"	Not the A-hole	0	0	139.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I was immediately flustered and apologetic but he bounced.

I’ve always wanted kids so this was very exciting for both my family and I. As soon as I told my sister that I was pregnant, she expressed that she wanted to throw me a gender reveal party. I don’t really care for gender reveal parties but I obliged because I saw how excited she was to throw me one. However, after a while when we went to the doctor we found out that it would be around August before we found out the gender. I told her and she has been trying to guilt me into getting the out of pocket blood test to find out the gender early so it fits better with her schedule since she has 2 kids of her own.

bz4o30	2019-06-10 23:01:40	horrormoviefan4648	AITA for not switching off a horror movie that was scaring my friend's GF?	"Okay so this is my newly made alt account for horror and food stuff so forgive me if I'm not fantastic at replying to comments and stuff.

This is basically exactly what the title says. My best friend has been going out with this girl for a little bit more than six months. Her behaviour is...well, I can't determine whether she's seriously possessive or just has massive FOMO, but she gets super pouty and kinda cranky if he does anything without her. Most of thr time I don't mind her tagging along to things, she can honestly be really good fun. There are two exceptions however: the first is nights out, because she always gets super obnoxiously drunk and usually ends up getting us kicked out of places/needing taken care of all evening. The second is movie night.

My friend and I have a longstanding tradition of getting together once a week and watching movies. Specifically, we love horror movies, the spookier the better. Generally we do this on a Sunday night, when his gf gets dinner and goes to a spin class with her sister. She's very much *not* into horror movies and actually watches almost exclusively kids movies, Disney and the like (nothing wrong with that but it is relevant here to mention). That's why we do it when she's busy; she won't be upset at being left out and we can watch the movies we enjoy. Last night, however, her sister was sick and her class was cancelled. She insisted on joining us for movie night. We had originally planned to watch a horror film called The Ritual which has been on our list for quite a while, and I asked what we were gonna watch instead. The gf insisted that we could still watch The Ritual, that she wasn't a pussy and ""come on it's a film how scary can it be."" 

Turns out, the answer is quite scary. The gf spent most it hiding behind her sweater and shrieking/screaming. Apparently, after they went home, she couldn't  sleep because she was so terrified and she actually cried out of fear several times throughout the night. She's pinning this as my fault and is really angry with me, insisting that I should've known she'd be scared (I did, that's why I asked if we were watching something else) and that I ought to have switched it off the second I noticed how frightened she was. My mate is on her side because duh, she's his GF. My counter to this is a) *she* insisted she'd be fine and we should still watch it, even after I offered to watch something else and b) my friend and I were thoroughly enjoying this movie we'd waited a long time to watch. I'm aware that the latter reason is rather selfish, but it is what it is. I do feel bad that she was so frightened, but I don't see how I'm responsible or how she's in anyway justified in being so pissed off at me.

bz4nll	2019-06-10 23:00:32	amsym	WIBTA for dating my dead husband's best friend?	"Pretty much what it says on the tin. My husband, Mark, died in a car accident almost 5 years ago. It was an incredibly difficult experience, and I really have only just now begun to get past it. His best friend, Edgar, was the best man at our wedding and they were friends for their entire adult lives. We really got through the grieving process together, I can't say that my loss was greater than Edgar's and we've really become closer through this ordeal. I always liked him before but never had more than a passing friendship with him while Mark was alive. But now I can honestly say that Edgar is one of my best friends. I had a few friends who were really pushy about me ""getting back out there"" in the first couple of years after Mark died. I really did become kind of a hermit and Edgar was really the only person who's been consistently there for me even in the times when I didn't feel like going out.

Edgar and I have talked about it and we both have romantic feelings for each other have decided to give dating a try. I have to say that Mark was the only person I ever dated before. We were childhood sweethearts and no matter what this would be an awkward situation for me. Edgar's been very supportive about taking it slow and has been pretty much the ideal partner for a couple of years before I ever looked at him in a romantic way.

Our mutual friends, mostly Mark and Edgar's friends from college, have been vocally opposed to the idea of us dating. Calling it ""incestuous"" and ""inappropriate"". One of my close friends has also said that she thinks Edgar's behaviour is predatory - I completely disagree with this. I don't think we're doing anything wrong, but I am bothered by the amount of opposition I have gotten from family and friends. Edgar's parents are also especially upset by the idea of us dating. I do really like Edgar, I comfortable with him and I feel safe with him - more than I probably could be with anyone else. On the other hand, I don't want to interfere with his relationships with his friends and his parents.

In the face of all this opposition, I have to wonder if I am making a really bad decision but I don't have the perspective to see it. Am I transgressing some unwritten social code? Is this something that would have upset my husband?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bz4n7w	2019-06-10 22:59:40	dookiebutt1234	AITA for choosing to not talk to my bi-polar and schizophrenic mother?	"Some background on my mom... She was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and paranoid schizophrenia when I was 13 years old (2000ish). My parents divorced when I was 2 and are no longer on speaking terms. She's been in and out of mental hospitals for a majority of my life. Nobody ever tried to fight for custody. Not my dad. Not my grandparents. Nobody. She called the cops on a regular enough basis they knew her by name. One night, she came into my room at 3 in the morning with a loaded shotgun and a phone and she told me to call and old friend of hers (at this point she couldn't trust the police) because she saw ""flashlights"" outside of our house. The trauma of living with that woman still effects me to this day. I have chronic anxiety and I live with clinical depression.

&#x200B;

When I was in my late teens, she found the right cocktail of medicines that made her a lot easier to deal with. We were staying with my grandparents. Everybody seemed to be getting along. However, when I was about to move into my first apartment (2010), mom flew straight off the deep end. She started adjusting her medication doses on her own. She wasn't sleeping because she had to ""stand guard"" every night to make sure nobody came to hurt me in my sleep. I'd catch her standing at the foot of my bed in the middle of the night staring at me while I slept. She would even go days where she would sleep in her car because the voices were telling her that if she got close to us, they'd kill us. Eventually we had to have the police pick her up and forcefully commit her to a mental ward because it was obvious she was going to do something dangerous to herself or others. As we were taking her to the hospital, I had to listen to my mother say the most vile, hate-filled, things to me. She was saying things like, ""I wish you were never born"" and ""Just let me die, I know it's what you want."" 

&#x200B;

After that day I haven't been able to look at her the same. She's getting better (sort of - i have had to call APS on her a few times), but I rarely talk to her. When I do, I usually have very short and to-the-point conversations. I can tell it's destroying her, but I cannot handle her sickness anymore. I had to grow up super fast because of her and I don't want to lose any more of my life worrying about whether or not she's ok.

&#x200B;

So now I have my family members telling me that I need to call my mom more and that I should visit more. I can hear the disappointment in their voices when they tell me that too. Thing is, I'm actually happier now. I'm married. I've found a group of friends that's better for me than my family has ever been. But I'm guilty for abandoning my mom. When I do talk to her, she always pines about how things used to be and how she was a powerful single woman and I was her little sidekick. She thinks that things are going to go back to the way they were 20 years ago.

&#x200B;

alright my dad has a bad temper. That's always been the case. He's known for beating up his siblings when they were kids. Now, my mom got pregnant and married him anyway because that's just how it is in our culture (this fucking drives me nuts everytime). 

&#x200B;

Last year, my mom got a new little starlet so that I could use it to pick her up from work everyday. She's too afraid to drive, so I obliged. I loved that car. It was so efficient, and I only spent $40 a week on fuel (I never had to ask my mom to pay for fuel). This year, my dad decided to show off to the boyz at work and sold the starlet. He got a nissan bluebird instead. Bear in mind that he already had 2 cars on finance (a bmw x3 and a mazda premacy) before getting the bluebird, which is also still on finance, btw. They all have big engines (at least 2.0). My mum and he had a deal that he's not allowed to use the bluebird to work. He's a really bad driver and he's already ruined the premacy. He never uses the BMW, he only uses it when there's a family gathering to fcking show off to our family friends and well family. 

So I've been using the bluebird for a while now, and now the fuel expenses on that car goes up to $80 so my mom also pays for the fuel. Heck, sometimes I even have to tell her 3 times that I need fuel money to pick her up. I pay my part of it, but I'm nothing but a poor uni student who depends on my part-time job pay. I only get $200 a week, but I have other expenses and I'm saving out to move out of this fucking shithole. 

&#x200B;

Today, he did not go to work and while I was making breakfast for myself (I am a bit of a health freak and I'm doing my best to get my shit together), I saw him take off using the bluebird. I just filled up the tank yesterday, and knowing him, he won't replace the fuel he used because he's fucking selfish but I tried anyway. I texted him, ""dad, could u pls replace the fuel that you'll be using today? I'm saving up for something. thnks."" 

He snapped real quick and called me and told me how he pays for it every week and all that. Now I'm looking up bikes online (which I should have done ages ago, btw), so that I won't have to deal with their shit anymore. 

I feel like I'm the only mature person in this house, tbh. They are both extremely inefficient and they make bad decisions all the time. They were also extremely abusive when I was a kid, so there's that too. The funny thing is that they talk shit about each other to us, their kids. I just can't anymore, tbh."

"As shitty as the title sounds, I liked him way before I knew she did; and didn't do anything while they were dating at all. They dated for maybe a few weeks and ended for a reason she never told me because we aren't that close. We're all in high school, if that helps at all.

I haven't said anything to her, as I'm not even sure where this is going with the ex. I feel really bad about it but they broke up several months ago and she seemed pretty over the relationship before the end of the year. She hasn't explicitly said she wouldn't want a friend dating her exes but I think that's probably a given.

A few days ago the ex started texting me, and was heavily flirting. I reciprocated, and not we're 'talking' so to say. I'm a lot less popular than both of them, so her hating me would have me lose a few of my friends along with her so I don't want to say anything to her about it. We haven't talked all summer so far, and I don't just want to be the person like ""Hey, do you mind if I date your ex?"" (I feel like I should mention the ex knows we are friends.)

bz4l6c	2019-06-10 22:54:39		AITA; post is for my aunt and uncle (details will clear confusion)	"My cousin and I have always been close and are actually more comfortable talking to each other about stuff than to others. I tell him about my sucky job and he tells me about his sucky school/home. I always harp on about reddit because it's one of the only good things about my current life and tell him about the communities (including this one) and he asked me to bring this matter to you. I told him he could make a throwaway but he said he didn't want to because he's more of an Instagram person (I know right). Anyway enough about that.

Background: My aunt and uncle live in a rental house, it's been so for as long as I can remember. But there's always been this problem: my uncle's job isn't financially strong and my aunt has stopped working (for stupid reasons but I won't get into that) and this causes problems, some major some minor.

Current situation: They move around (a **lot**) and their current landlord is an **asshole.** Apparently he was one of my uncle's old friends. It has been brought to my attention that he constantly makes death threats (not to my cousin's family but about tenants elsewhere) and he thinks himself some ""bad man."" I don't have much on the situation but so far it's not good. They're having constant arguments and I've been told sometimes it approaches violence.

Now here's why I think they're assholes. Because his job isn't financially strong and the owner knows this (I assume), it looks like he wants some understanding for the situation and expects that the man will understand that he can't always get his money on time or all at once. He (my uncle) gets mad about how he approaches him asking for the money (I'm told he knocked down their door at 7am and my uncle thinks he's trying to embarrass him?)

As for me, I think that regardless of whether or not he's being a bastard about it, he has every right to ask for his money and they have no right to argue with him about that because it's a legal agreement. I haven't given my cousin my opinion on the matter but what do you guys think; is the old guy TA for being ""unreasonable"" or are my aunt and uncle TA for expecting understanding in a legal agreement?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bz4k04	2019-06-10 22:51:53	Imnotabackupdate	AITA for being tired of reaching out to a friend?	"I started a new job at the beginning of the year. At first I had trouble getting along with everyone, but quickly started integrating with the workspace and everyone. One coworker made it a point that she wanted to be friends because of how similar our way of thinking is. At first I thought she was annoying but warmed up to her. We started hanging outside of work and being out having fun. I now consider her one of my best friends as she has made my move to a new town easier and more enjoyable. 

My troubles with her started recently. Whenever we had plans to go out she would either get drunk the night before and blow off our plans or text me that she wanted to go out with one of her flings instead. I should point out our relationship is strictly platonic. I acknowledge her as a sexual being and our friendship has been questioned a couple of times by our office but I just don’t see her in my life more than a friend and  she feels the same since whenever we’re out and are asked if we’re together she quickly shuts it down. I’m just bothered that she consistently thinks I will be at her calling when she needs me regardless of how many times she has wasted the time I had previously set apart for her. I feel uncomfortable that someone I’ve come to trust is able to hurt my feelings easily like this. I’ve talked to her already and told her I didn’t want to be her back up plan whenever someone decided not to spend their time with her.  Our most recent heated exchange was over me heading out for a date I had already scheduled instead of her spontaneous plan to go dancing because her date fell through. I felt that we worked through it but she recently left back to her hometown for a few weeks over some family issues she was having. I told her that if she needed anyone to talk to I’m just a phone call away, yet her social media’s have been flooded with her getting drunk every night doing questionable activities, and posting things she will regret. I’m worried about her and I’ve tried to reach out to see if she’s ok but our conversations go nowhere and just end with single word answers. 
A mutual friend was talking to me about this and said I shouldn’t be a second option for her and should focus on myself more. As he put it, she is more than capable of knowing that her actions will affect her relationships with others. If she needs any of our help she needs to acknowledge it first.

I can’t stand seeing her this way and no matter how hard I’ve reached out to her I can’t seem to get her to talk to me. I feel that although she may care about our friendship she doesn’t value it as much as I believe she had.

bz4hvl	2019-06-10 22:46:23		AITA for declining my mom's invitation?	"Short backstory: My mom went on a vacation from work with my stepdad to the beach 3 hours away (NC). She was to be gone from June 3-12 attending a country music festival while me and my 3 siblings stayed home to finish out the school year. In my case I started my summer class and my brother started his summer job. My dad notified us a few weeks ago that he would be at the outer banks from June 13-17 and told us to feel free to stop by for a day or two during that time.

Story: So a couple days ago my mom, whom I live with, invited us to visit her for a day and drive back home for the night; followed by a message that her room could make due to fit 4 to sleep in. We all declined. Fast forward to today, I wanted to see if any of my siblings wanted to visit my dad at a different beach the same distance away (3 hrs) since he normally lives in VA and we only get to see him once or twice a year. I could go on the 13th-14th since my class on the 13th ends at 10:30 am.

Obviously I had to see if mom was okay with it but she called us crying saying that we could go but it would be a dick move to drive the same distance to see dad but not visit her.

To be blunt I think she's an emotionally manipulative person and she's driven her kids away from her. Personally I would cut contact if I could because of personal reasons that I won't get into now.

bz4h9b	2019-06-10 22:44:59	Pseudo_9	AITA for saying I want to break up on the phone?	"So today, I’m on my way to my classes, and get a text from my significant other to the effect of “hey we need to talk about our relationship when you get home”. While reading the message, I get a  call from her saying that she can't wait the amount of time that I’m in classes - She wants to talk about it while I’m on the subway. I tell her this is a conversation that NEEDS to happen in person, not over the phone. She insists that it happen while we’re on the phone and asks if I want to break up - I say something along the lines of “Last time we had a conversation like this, I was the first to speak and that she should be the first to come forward. This time I told her that I could go either way and that she should decide. That I wouldn't hold any judgment for either choice. She was adamant that I go first, and so I thought -

We’re homeless, moving from airbnb to airbnb throughout NYC while I attend college. I’m a seven year Army veteran sinking all my GI Bill college money into our bills, securing us a new place every few weeks, and food. Meanwhile my significant other is currently unemployed. A couple days ago she said she’s low on funds so now I have to budget what little I have to further accommodate the student loans she has. 

She is vocal about about her health, and agrees that lifestyle change could help but whenever I invite her to exercise with me, she declines or becomes agitated during. I quit a ten-year smoking habit cold turkey one year ago at her request when she stated it bothered her and that my personal health was important to her.

Sometimes, if I mention that I’m stressed with everything on my plate, she reminds me about how she sacrificed everything to move in together. I feel like this is kind of an emotional blackmail but at the same time, don’t want to be inconsiderate of her struggles. She did indeed move from a couple states over and left a well paying job to do so. She said she wanted to get away from her stressful job, dramatic family, etc...

Recently there is the instance of her wanting to go to a park. I even looked up online when the sun was going to set even, because I wanted it to be as nice an experience for her as possible. Getting there, she’s agitated “hurry up, the faster we get there, the faster we can go back home” I told her how I feel like I shouldn't even try to make anything feel special for her anymore and how I feel my effort is consistently being taken for granted. I also mentioned how I think my self-worth deems me worthy of less of this emotional battering.

So back to the call - I decided that if I was going to be forced into a choice and am on the fence, I should choose to break up because the aggressive pushiness was not something I wanted in my life. I asked her about which she wants - “It doesn't matter now, bye” and hangs up. She soon after texts me that this is not a conversation we should have over the phone and that we should talk about it when I get back to the airbnb."	Not the A-hole	0	0	2.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
bz4gx9	2019-06-10 22:44:14		WIBTA if I asked my roommate to pay for cable, since he's the only one using it in his room, even if there's no additional cost for it?	"3 roommates split cable, and there are no TV's in the house.

New roommate moves in, brings a TV in his room, and asks if he can hook up cable. I find out it's included in the package. Great! But now he's enjoying all the cable he wants, privately, while we're all paying the same price for the whole package.

Out of principle, I believe we should skew the proportions so that he pays more. Would I be the asshole if I implemented this? I understand the side of ""it makes no difference to me"", but he's essentially getting double the value for the same cost. So I'm trying to get some outside perspectives.

"Me and my gf have a good thing going and on weekends that we stay in we usually partake in some of the devils lettuce while watching movies. On this particular night we decided to order some food. She doesn't eat as much as me so we usually just share something and I'll eat 70% to her 30%.

So we get this big ass burrito to share, I'm high as a kite and I proceeded to eat the whole thing without even a thought of sharing. I completely forgot we were sharing. I think its because burritos are so hand held. I just never put it down. 

As soon as I finish she proceeds to get super pissed at me. Obviously I definitely did make a mistake. The thing is she watched me down the whole thing and didn't say a word! If she had simply tapped me on the shoulder I would have ofcourse shared the burrito. She acknowledges that she saw me making the mistake but didn't say anything. Like it was some kind of test?

I did say sorry and I was willing to pay for more food for her. I thought we would laugh it off. However,  it was clear she wanted a huge heartfelt apology which I made clear I am not willing to give. My unwillingness to give said heartfelt apology is putting a strain on our relationship. I'm not sure if this is a hill worth dying on, but it seems so illogical for her to notice and not say anything while it was happening.

So here I am possibly about to lose a gf of 3 years over a burrito. AITA??"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bz4gll	2019-06-10 22:43:30	pleadingwiththenight	AITA? Boss left a scathing review for me and I bit back	"Been at this job for 6 months and I've enjoyed it. I've made a few mistakes as I've learned on the job, but I've taken steps to fix and prevent those mistakes from happening again. None of these mistakes has ever been something I couldn't fix or something that would place funds or information in jeopardy. 
My boss had been kind to me from the get go, but over time she has been more and more critical of me, to the point of being hurtful at times. My coworker and I (there are only the 3 of us in the office, manager included) both came to the conclusion that she was going to quit soon, and viola! This is her last week. 
Last Monday was the first week of her training our new manager. The day was super busy, so I didn't catch this document on our shared server until the very end of the day. It said NOTES ON PLEADINGWITHTHENIGHT. All caps. Not in any labelled folder. Twas a stray document in the middle of a bunch of folders.
So, I'm dumb, and clicked on the document and there was pros and cons about me in it... Four pros were listed, ten cons.... Some I could understand as I made those mistakes early on in my time there, but the rest didn't make any sense to me. Like it said that a committee didn't trust me with money although there hasn't been any incidents and no funds have ever been misplaced or lost, how the president didn't like me because I'm too friendly in my emails, how I ask too many questions when I'm unsure of something (Exact words in the document). I was soooooooo upset, mainly because those points were never said to me, but didn't want to bring it up at work. it was obvious the manager intended it to be seen by the new manager... At least I think. 
Anyways, today at the last five minutes of work my manager said that she wants to have a meeting with me about things I need to improve on before she leaves at the end of the week. We were doing nothing, so I asked her if now was a good time. Then she said no, she needed time to put her thoughts together and organize a document. And I said, Oh, but what about the NOTES ON PLEADINGWITHTHENIGHT doc? Wasn't that a good base to start on? Her face got really red and flustered and she said that she had something important to do immediately after work and left shortly thereafter.

Similarly, yesterday, my sister (who is learning to drive) asked me to take her driving and so we went out to drive around (after telling mom who was home) and on the drive we stop by and get ice cream (I paid for it, but my parents pay for my education/dorm/etc so I mean I'm not financially independent).

bz4f52	2019-06-10 22:40:04	parkapants	AITA For having sex with someone in a semi polyamorous relationship?	"Apologies for formatting and such, mobile user and first time poster here. 

Background, I (F) have a friend (M) who is poly, and is in a relationship with a really nice girl who is monogamous, however he believes because he is poly the relationship is even though his SO isn’t. 

I went in a night out with him and about 5 other friends, we were drinking, smoked some weed and I took MDMA for the first time. The plan was for me and a (F) friend to crash at his (he lives near where we were going out) so we ended up in his room. Myself and (M) friend end up alone and he makes moves on me while I’m still off my rocker so we end up having sex. I feel awful because he’s in a relationship and his SO isn’t poly.

Fast forward a few days and we’re on another night out with the same people and I go home this time and get in about 3:45, and get a call from him almost as soon as I get in, begging for me to go to his because he doesn’t want to be on his own. I refuse and he decides to come to mine, gets a taxi. I only have one place to sleep at my house so we share and he tried to put his hand down my pants multiple times, to which I just moved it away. He kisses me multiple times and I’m still drunk from the night out.

In the morning he’s cuddling me, and starts talking about how he feels he connects with me and really cares about me. His girlfriend calls, asking where he is because his snap-maps show he’s not at home, he says “oh I’m at (mine)” to which she starts to worry because she knows that he thinks it’s a poly relationship and acts that way. 

All through this, his girlfriend has gone home for the holidays so is across the country.

I just want to know, AITA for sleeping with him and any general advice about how to deal with the situation

Edit for info- I don’t want anything from him in a romantic or sexual sense, I see the situation as a huge mistake.
I also knew the situation with him and his girlfriend before the nights out and understood that the girlfriend didn’t see the relationship as poly (Neither do I, it’s only my (M) friend who does)."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	30.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

Z was a late child for my aunt. She is 10 years younger than her brother M. Since she is so much younger she's definitely been spoiled a little. Especially now that M has moved out of my aunt's house. 

So I went to spend Christmas with my aunt and Z. Some other cousins of ours were invited too. Our cousin L was 12 at this time. 
We  sit down to play a game, I team up with Z and L teams up with my aunt. Z and I are dominating this game. We win 8 rounds and everyone is having a good time. Since we're so far ahead when it's my turn to pick the next category I choose one I'm not very confident in so I can see what kind of questions there are. We lose that round. So the score is now 8-1 in our favor. 

Z can't handle the single loss and starts crying. Real tears. I kinda laugh because I can't believe she seriously doing this.  I'm like ""we can't lose one round? Really?"" My aunt tells her to be quiet because you can't win all the time. But now I'm giggling because it's so ridiculous and L is starting to laugh too. Then Z stands and says ""Why does this keep happening to me?!"" And runs out of the room.

So now I'm really laughing. Holding my stomach and everything. Then L's mom says we're bullying Z.  I disagree.

So I'd like your judgement guys AITA?

bz4c1j	2019-06-10 22:32:42	Wannabeastronomyemo	AITA for telling my friend about a medical emergency I had	"(Sorry if this does not exactly follow everything im very new to reddit)
      For background, ive had migraines for around 10 years now and I had something similar to a stroke back in march (facial drooping, stumbling, and stuttering over my words).  

     Around 2 weeks ago I was eating with my family and I suddenly got extremely dizzy. I stood to go outside the resturant and i fell over and it became so bad I could not drive home. My heartrate was fluxuating between 90 amd 140, I was incredibly confused, blurry vision, numbness, mood swings and I lost the ability to form words for a few seconds.   

    I called my best friend because I was terrified I was dying. Over the phone she brushed me off saying since I could still breathe it was not that serious, and that stung honestly. A few days later I texted her saying that really hurt and I never wanted a medical diagnosis, I just wanted to talk to my best friend.  

    She kind of blew up in response saying I only contact her to vent and we never talk about anything anymore and she is tired of taking on other people's emotional baggage. I was really shocked and confused. Looking at our conversations over the past few months I have not mentioned my mental illness (depression, anxiety, and newly diagnoses bpd) since I now have a therapist or really vented to her at all. Our last conversation was her wanting to design my first tattoo. Nonetheless, I really thought I was being a horrible friend, dispite me frequently telling her I won't be offended if she does not want to hear my problems and that I don't want her to fix me/be my therapist.  

     I explained that I care about her as a person and I tell her about my problems since I tell her literally everything along with expressing my confusion since our conversations do not match what she is telling me. She ghosted me for a few days then told me she has had friends who have used her and she needs to tell people the ""hard truth"", I'm just confused if I was in the wrong and warranted our friendship of 8 years to die like this. So, AITA in this situation?

bz4alz	2019-06-10 22:29:10	shifty33sloth	AITA for making fun of my GF’s brother about his money?	"Recently my GF (ashley)’s cousin got married so she invited me to go to her wedding with her. At the reception we were seated with Ashleys mom and dad, and her brother (steve) and his fiancee.

Basically to add info to the situation, my GF has a lot of student debt and works in a field that doesn’t pay super well. Her brother works in a blue collar job that is fairly manual but he gets paid really well, and recently got a promotion so he gets paid even more now. I make around a similar amount of money to him, but he constantly tries to make jabs about how his money is hard earned whereas I work in an office (and so does Ashley)

I want to also preface that I poke fun at Steve a lot, and typically its pretty well received by him, and he will toss jokes back and its typically all good fun. I don’t have an actual brother so he’s basically the closest thing to this type of relationship I have.

Well back to the situation, we were having a chat at the reception dinner at our table, and Steve asks Ashley how much she gave in her card. She says $200 (which honestly she doesn’t really have to just go handing out, so I covered half of that). So basically with this grin on his face Steve goes “heh well I put in $300” as if it even mattered how much each person gave. So me being supportive/protective of my GF, who is fairly sensitive to things like this, sarcastically say “hey everyone look at me, I’m a big manager now, look how much money I’ve got”.

While most people at the table laughed at this, Steve was very upset and called me an asshole and got up and left the table. Their parents assured me he was just being a baby and that he could “dish it but couldn’t take it”.

Steve didn’t really talk to me the rest of the night and I didn’t really make an effort to apologize. I felt like he was basically trying to make my GF feel bad that she can’t afford to give as much as he can. He does this stuff to me occasionally, or at least tries to but it doesn’t bother me because I make similar money, but my GF obviously isn’t comfortable. The incident didn’t affect the actual wedding but I kinda felt bad that I embarrassed him in front of his family, but at the same time whats there to be sensitive about when he’s the one flaunting how much he is making to someone he knows doesn’t make as much.

For memorial day, they ""borrowed"" a smoker that was originally theirs, but has been at my house for 8 - 10 yrs. This was after we spent money fixing it up and repainting it.

We asked if they were gonna bring it back, as we have several family get togethers in the next few weeks where we smoke butts and ribs for, the answer was, ""not for several months"".

I was livid, we were under the impression that it was ours after so long, they never wanted to use it in those years, just wanted to use it after it got fixed & that not it had ruined our plans. We weren't told before hand that we wouldn't be getting it back.

Since our family events are coming up soon, we had to spend quite a bit of money to get another one.

bz4880	2019-06-10 22:23:19	Worried_Context	AITA for disobeying HRs demand that I dress in more loose fitting clothes?	"Firstly, yes this is America 🙄

I'm a trainer for a big telecom company. I train engineers and I'm very respected and qualified in my field.

Now, since I was 14 or 15, I've been body shammed for having big boobs. By 16 I was a DD. Now at 31 I'm a triple D. Not to humble brag (this detail is important), but my waist is naturally pretty tiny. My measurements are, 33DDD-24-37 at 5'2"" 125lbs.

Now my job has me teaching groups of mainly male engineers at least for 1-3 weeks of the month. I travel a lot too.

Anyway, we aren't requested to dress to formally, in fact our company has a very lax dress code, especially during training. Lots of the guys wear t shirts. Most of the instructors wear polos, shirts and maybe a t-shirt on Fridays. We're casual too but not as casual as the guys we train.

Anyway, I don't dress casual. I wear mainly form fitting shirts and polos.

A problem I've had anyways with clothes is that because my boobs are so big, even though I'm technically a small or extra small in top, I'm forced to buy a medium or large. This means I'm forced to alter almost all my tops by taking them in additions around my waist.

If I don't, sure to my petite size, I look like a fat blocky person. It's not flattering and it really affects my confidence.

So apparently, I've got at least 3 complaints to HR that I'm accentuating my breasts to much and that I need to dress more conservatively by wearing less form fitting clothes.

This is so hypocritical of them. Firstly there are several other equally attractive (some far prettier than me) female  trainers who wear even tighter tops than I do. They just get away with it because they've got smaller breasts.

Secondly, a few of the make trainers here are into fitness and wear very very tight slim fit t-shirts and polos.

My clothes isn't even that tight honestlty, there's like 4-6 inches of room in my tops around my waist.

I wasn't told to comply, but they director of HR in my office said he STRONGLY recommends I try to dress more modestly.

I was 100% against it and told him I'd think about it, but that would require an entirely new wardrobe and it's not going to happen anytime soon. He said, he can give me some company t-shirts to help my transition.

I left the meeting really really upset. It reminds me so much of how as a teen my highschool teachers would single me out to wear less tight tops to school. It made me feel so ashamed of my large breasts.

Yesterday I read the opinions of many on that 15 year-old girl wearing a cheeky bathing suit to a communal pool at her grandparents. I fully thought OP was an asshole, but do many of you agreed that the circumstance and venue mattered.

It's been 3 weeks since I was warned and HR called me in 2 days ago to ask me why I'm not complying. I told them that I think it was stupid and body shaming I told them politely that I wouldn't be obeying.

I was just scrolling through my friends snapchat stories and came across a post that surprised me.  It was from a girl who I'm aquantences with, and she was always nice to me before. 

(Sadly I can't quote her original post because it expired but I'll try my best) The post said something along the lines of: 

OMG! These ugly white girls be wearing so much makeup they be lookin like clowns

(For reference, she's black, so that's probably why she said ""white girls""? Idk)

I was honestly taken back by this, as she has never come across as a person who would say that. I was debating on sending her a message saying ""hey that's a really toxic thing to say""... but I decided against it because I just thought it wasn't worth it. And here's were the problem starts, minutes later she posted her OnYOLO link (allows your followers to send you anonymous messages). I decided this was my chance to ""confront"" her without actually ""confronting"" her. 

I sent her an anonymous message saying ""I always thought you were kind and sweet but know you seem hella toxic and tbh I'm disappointed"" 

Now, I realized that this was somewhat a broad statement, and I probably should have been more specific, but it's what I was feeling at that time and I still stand by it. 

Later that night she posts this on her story... (THIS IS QUOTED 100% FROM HER STORY, IF I MUST I WILL SUPPLY SCREENSHOTS):

For the person who called me toxic, I just speak the truth, whatever’s on my mind, I say. Which is a thing called being blunt and if you think it’s toxic just leave me alone and get off my Snapchat. I’m honestly not toxic, I know when to be nice and know when to be rude, but I’m not gonna sit here and tell pretty white lies to make you guys feel better. So if I think you’re ugly, I’m gonna say something. If I don’t like you, I’m gonna say something. And if you have a problem with that just hit me up and we can solve it because I don’t get how you’re disappointed in me when I don’t even know you. And how are you disappointed in me when they're actual toxic people in *the city we live in*. Last time I checked toxic wasn’t what I was. I don’t get how I can be toxic when I literally don’t hang out with anyone, including my best friend, you see me outside every once in a blue moon because of people like you that wanna speak on something that doesn’t even concern them. So I’m asking you to kindly exit my life. 

(Be aware I had to add punctuation, because it was a whole lot more messy than what I have typed out.)

Now, I think this ""after-post"" just shows how extremely toxic she really is. But maybe I'm wrong? Maybe I really did step out of line by inserting myself when it was ""none of my concern""? Should I talk it out with her? Any and all advice is appreciated."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	330.0	25.0	0.0	0.0
bz459n	2019-06-10 22:16:21	TypicalAcadia	AITA; Me and my naked neighbours	" 

So, to preface this I want to say that I think that I might be the asshole here but it has been on my mind for a time and I feel a bit guilty so I want some perspective and/or confirmation from people other than my closest friends.

I recently moved into a new a one room apartment, nothing too exciting but it has a small balcony and a view of a neighbouring apartment block. The block is about twenty meters away, I think, and has very large windows. The insight you have of these apartments is enormous. I can see most things, from families eating breakfast, a drunk drinking on the balcony and an old man taking care of his wife. And I suppose they have the same kind of view into my life when I finally pull up the curtains.

The thing is that one of the apartments houses two roommates, two women, I don't know how old but somewhere in their twenties is my guess(?). One of their rooms houses a makeup mirror which I have a full almost birdeye's view into. They from time to time, do their makeup naked or at least topless. I sneak a peek every now and then, and it makes my day if they're there. But I do feel guilty, am I invading their privacy and being a creep here? I mean I walk around my apartment naked but only with the curtains down since I'm not comfortable enough in my own body nor willing to expose the rest of the world to that biohazard to do it with the curtains pulled up.

But that's where me and my neighbours differ, they just do their thing in the makeup room with their curtains pulled up"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
bz458o	2019-06-10 22:16:17	jtfan1	AITA for continuing to swim on the same team as my sister?	"I know that the title sounds odd, but I’ll explain. First, I’ll give some prior knowledge.

My sister and I have been competitively swimming since we were 6 years old. My sister is two years younger than me, therefore I started two years earlier.  We both are somewhat naturally gifted and have always been good. Since I’m a guy we have never been directly competitive but a lot of time comparison is always occurring. 

When I was ten and my sister was eight we started competing for the state wide swim team. The best way to describe the swim team is that it is tiered, one level is for the good swimmers where the other is invitation only and hard to get into. This invitation only team was very exclusive and they competed nationally in the Junior Olympics, Mid Atlantic Zones basically any meet that you could qualify for.

When my sister was 11 she was invited. At the time I had taken a year off and wasn’t really up for consideration, she was really excited and I was excited for her. I was still training but not as much and I didn’t see the team as an opportunity for me at all. About a year went on like this and all was well, I started to improve a lot over the winter and was actually starting to get more into it. 

Spring rolls around and I wanted to continue practice. I didn’t have the option to swim for a summer league like I normally would because of how my schedule with summer school (extra classes) worked out. My mom took it upon herself to email the coach of my sisters team and ask if I could practice with them. 

I guess they felt generous because they allowed me to practice with them and let me decide if I wanted to be a part of the team. After a week of practice I had to make the decision and I had really enjoyed my time on the team. When I mentioned that I wanted to be a more permanent member, my sister had a full on meltdown (she’s almost 13 at this point) crying about how much she didn’t want me to join the team and how she was hoping I would say no. She said that if my parents cared about her at all they would pull me out of it. We got into a bit of a fight over this and eventually she said it was because she felt like it was the one thing she had to herself and that she didn’t want me involved . 

Although I sympathized with this I decided to join the team anyway. Its not like we share a lane or anything but she still is bothered by it. I’ve been practicing for almost a month and she still brings it up. I’m still curious if I made the right decision."	Not the A-hole	0	0	103.0	144.0	0.0	0.0

bz44g1	2019-06-10 22:14:29		AITA For not paying rent	"This is situation occurred around 10 years ago when I was a student, but recently it came to light that my brother thinks I'm an asshole.

So in the first year of my post grad studies, with a stipend of about 15k a year, I started to pay my mom 50 a week in rent. At this point, my brother had been paying 100 a week in rent as he had a full time job. For the record, it was my mom who set the rent. I had previously had a well paying summer job and paid 75 euro a week. We weren't a well off family, but we had our little luxuries.

Fast forward to my second year, I moved out to live in digs which were closer to college, which was around 600 a month for the tiniest box room, and I visited home once a week. 6 months later, my grandmother had to go to a home, and her house was broken into. My mother and her siblings suggested I move into the house (rent free, yay!) as it was also close to home. This was on the condition I pay the bills and pay for any upkeep, maintain the garden etc. For me it was. A huge deal, I could start saving properly (I've always been an avid saver and on the frugal side).

So at this stage, I was spending 4 days a week there, and 3 weeks visiting my family and staying the night. During this time, my brother got a promotion as was earning 30k a year, living there full time, eating meals every day, having all his laundry done, using the electric shower once or twice a day, and basically having everything catered for at 400 a month. In contrast, I only stayed the night 3 nights a week, maybe had dinner one of those nights, and didn't shower there. I did my own laundry etc. My mother never asked me to start paying rent again.

So according to my brother I was an asshole for not paying rent like he had to, even though he spent considerably more time there, earned twice as much as I did (and admittedly wasted it, he still has no savings, which my mother used to get annoyed about because he complained about how much rent he paid and being broke despite leaving above his means constantly).

While I didn't pay rent, I did always spoil my mom. Whenever I went on holidays, I invited her and paid for everything. When she took me grocery shopping, I always told her to put hers with mine and I'd cover it. She used to give me a lot of lifts, so I'd often pay to fill the tank from time to time.

But my brother thinks I'm an asshole for not paying rent, even though my mom never mentioned it, I did contribute in some ways (such as buying groceries) but also maintained another house at the time, granted I was fortunate to not pay rent.

bz444u	2019-06-10 22:13:46		AITA for confronting my friends about their afair	"I have 2 friends with which I hang out in the same group. It’s not a group where we’d meet super often, but we still hang out once per 1-2 months. Let’s call them John and Judy. 

Me and John had a fling almost 3 years ago. I wanted a relationship, he didn’t. It was bad for me but I feel like I’ve been totally over it once 3-4 months after our fling happened (for the last 2 years). Rest of our group doesn’t know anything happened between me and John. 

Judy have been in the same relationship for the last 7-8 years and they have a house together. Her BF doesn’t hang with our group, she always comes by herself. But I’ve been to Judy’s house for dinner few times, know her BF and have hang out with them on separate occasions. I’m not close with her BF but still is someone I respect and see occasionally.  

I’ve been suspecting that John and Judy have something between them for over a year now. I can see them always trying to leave at the same time, I can see them texting each other, doing each other favors and in general their behavior. He is the one showing more emotions and I wasn’t sure if it’s just him liking her, while Judy loves the attention only and he’s in the friendzone. But it’s been going for way too long. One year ago, I asked John if something is going on between them and he told me that I’m crazy and should never mention that again because I am spreading rumors this way and if Judy’s BF hears about it, she’ll be in trouble for nothing. Assured me they are just friends. 

Few days ago again I was in situation where we all shared a taxi home and I could see John texting Judy while we were all in the taxi, asking her if she wants him to come back for her and pick her up once he leaves me at my place. I was irritated just because all of this is childish to me - they could’ve just told me they wanna spend time together and leave me first, then go together wherever they want to go. I’m also irritated, because I don’t want to witness any of this. This makes me feel extremely guilty to hang with Judy and especially her BF in the future. I think that John and Judy either should be together if they want it, or they shouldn’t go behind Judy’s BF back. I know nobody asked me to do anything, but I feel like they are treating me like an idiot and they are putting me in the middle of their drama. 

When we left Judy at her place and proceeded with the taxi I made a comment in front of John, saying that I know what’s going on and that they can save themselves some trouble and extra taxi rides by just admitting it. He denied it, said that I’m crazy and is now mad and doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. I can see him feeling guilt more than being mad, but I just feel stupid being put in this situation.

bz438j	2019-06-10 22:11:39	herkkokerkko	AITA for giving bad recommendations for a job seeker?	"While I was doing my PhD (around 2005), I worked in the same research group with this person, let's call him John. John was doing his bachelors, and really struggled with everything he did. Our boss had to micromanage with him, and still he failed to complete even basic tasks that his peers were able to handle easily. John is a nice guy and I did not have problems with him, besides feeling bad for my boss. At some time John asked if I could supervise his master's thesis, and then I snapped at him a bit and told him that he was supposed to get his bachelors thesis done in 6 months, and as he is still working on it after 3 years, I don't want anything to do with him work wise.

&#x200B;

He was able to eventually to get his master's degree, but I did not really interact with him much during that. He had gotten some short term jobs in other research groups, but I heard that he was struggling in those positions as well and they lasted only some months.

&#x200B;

I had become a quite prominent figure in my field in our city, including training a new generation of highly needed specialists, so people often came to me for advice about who to hire. When a colleague asked if she should hire John, I blunlty told her that I would definitely not hire him, and gave her my reasoning. This happened a couple of times with other colleagues as well. I thought that I was doing my colleagues a big favor, and John was just getting what he deserved.

&#x200B;

During the next couple of years when I occasionally bumbed into John, he told me that it has been a bit rough with him, he has mainly been working as a temp packaging stuff in a factory (nothing related to his education), and it has been really hard for him to get a job, and it is hard for him to understand why that is, as he has a MSc from a field where there is a huge demand of experts. He was struggling financially, and had a hard time providing for his family.

&#x200B;

I felt bad for him, and next time someone asked me if they should hire John, I just said, to be honest I would not hire him, but they should decide themselves as I don't really have any recent experience with him. They said that they would not then hire him. This then happened several times with other colleagues.

&#x200B;

Since 2006, I think I have now directly blocked John from at least 12 different positions (and probably indirectly from several more).

&#x200B;

I feel like I have held way too much power over his destiny, I genuinely feel bad for him, but I also don't want to mislead people who ask me if they should hire John.

&#x200B;

So AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just to clarify, I did have a chance to indirectly observe John's progress during his masters, and he was really struggling. For example in our uni if you failed an exam, you were usually able to take a re-exam once. John often failed the re-exams as well, so our boss (who was also professor on our field and really too nice of a guy), often allowed John to personally take re-re-exams just to allow him somehow pass the courses (against our uni regulations). He literally is the worst student I ever met on that study program. After John's graduation, and when he was able to get couple of those short term jobs, I occasionally spoke with some of his supervisors from those jobs, and they said that they were disappointed with his performance. 

&#x200B;

I want to also point out that there never was a malicious intent from my part, and as I said I regularly have people asking me for recruitment advice. It is really important to me that I am able to give honest answers to people who trust my opinion. I also often go out of my way to find good jobs for fresh graduates, I think this year alone I've successfully found jobs for at least four talented students, so the recommendations go both ways."

I ran the washing load, and set my timer for 20 minutes extra. When I went down the clothes were still in there. I took them out and put them on top of the dryer. 

Everyone does it. I’ve had it done to me. Didn’t think it was a big deal. As I was loading my stuff in, this man walked out and goes, “Jesus Christ. Who put that on there?” And I said, “Oh sorry, I did, I just needed to switch my wet sheets in.” He goes, “It hadn’t even been sitting there for 15 minutes. You leave your stuff down here for hours.” First of all, not even true. Simply not the case.  He was so angry and aggressive and I was so surprised, I just stood there for a second and said, “Well, I don’t know what you’re talking about because it wasn’t my clothes,” or something like that and left.

bz3z1v	2019-06-10 22:01:36	heartbrokendadthrow	AITA for stopping child support payments?	" 

I have been the primary parent of my DD most of her life. When DD was 12, her mother (M) got off drugs and asked for shared custody. M lives with her mother, and they have a nicer house and better school district, so though I was heartbroken, I let DD move in with M since she wanted to get to know her mom. Huge mistake.

I always paid more than what would be the required amount of child support (there is no court order), in addition to paying for most everything else since M is on disability (for specious reasons) and doesn’t work.

About a year ago, DD became fed up with M’s increasingly abusive behavior (I tried to intervene, but DD would not report on M to the police or court) and she moved in with me and my DW a month before our wedding. DD and DW adore each other and everyone was really happy.

A few months later, DW had to move four hours away for work (the only option with her specialized career). DW moved and visited me and DD on the weekends; this was the plan until DD graduated high school since DD was 16 and didn’t want to leave her friends.

But then M’s mom died and DD wanted to go back to live with M. We asked her not to go, but ultimately we had no choice (court order says DD lives where she wants—also a mistake). A few weeks later, we decided it made more sense for me to live with DW and visit DD on the weekends since we only got to see her on weekends now anyway. DD agreed to this until the day of the move when DD stopped speaking to me. For months, every day I messaged her “good morning, I love you,” tried to schedule visits to see her each weekend with no response until I was asked to stop by M.

Now, I find out that a few weeks ago, DD has freaking dropped out of high school and M supports this. DD says her anxiety is too bad to go, but it’s not as though she has gotten a doctors note saying as much or is even working on this in therapy (we had her in therapy to work through her issues with M when she lived with us, but M stopped taking her even though we sent money to cover the copay). I said that she has to go to school; or, if not, then she has get a job since there is no doctor’s approval for this or even a suggestion that they're working on actually dealing with this anxiety, I don't want to enable this kind of behavior.

Since then, I have withheld child support. I set up a separate bank account and deposit my child support payments there. I said as soon as she goes back to school, I’ll send all the money right away. We have no other recourse. I can’t force her to go to school legally and she said she would run away if we went to court and got custody.

TLDR: AITA for refusing to pay (not legally mandated) child support until DD goes back to school? It feels like the only tool I have to push her back to going to school. Though, it’s not worked over the last two months, so maybe it’s time to go back on this plan and start making payments again. IDK. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

So for the past week I’ve been taking my personal vehicle instead. When my boss came back he seemed irritated that I was taking my car.

He told me it wasn’t broken and not too bad. I attempted to apologize but he was very short and flustered with me and told me if he would’ve known he would’ve just scheduled someone else. 

I understand that it may be irritating because when I take my personal vehicle they have to reimburse me for gas instead of using the company card so maybe that’s why? But everytime the the work vehicle is getting serviced I’ve had to take my personal vehicle anyway so I don’t see how this is different.

oh and about the being rude thing, whenever they would just tell me ""you're just being salty because you dont have a boyfriend!"" and stuff like that I would scream at them, and I dont really regret it. I even stopped being friends with my best friend for a while because she got a new best friend.

I'm going to a new school next year with them, but all my friends I met at the end of the year arent going. I dont know if I should apologize or they should, but they've already made me apologize tons of times. 

but, I do plan on finding new friends when I switch schools at least.

and, I'm still friends with all of these people, and i dont hate them I just think that some of them are kinda being jerks.."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	2.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

bz3vri	2019-06-10 21:54:01	coursing_rain	AITA for being upset that someone is choosing to change schools?	"A little bit of backstory: me and a boy, let’s call him A, dated for a little over eight months. It was kept a secret from his mother so we didn’t go on a ton of dates or anything, but I *think* we were both pretty into each other. We broke up last Monday but agreed to be friends. Thus far, he has avoided me like the plague. 

I was trying to start a conversation with him (thru text) and he suddenly started responding. Eventually, the conversation got onto what we did this weekend; he went to prom at another school (not ours) and I stayed home, because I don’t have that many friends. I told him he was one of, if not my best friend. He then said something along the lines of, “uh, about that, I’m thinking of transferring to (the school he attended prom at)”. I immediately got upset, though I tried not to let him know. 

I don’t have a ton of friends I can hang out with mostly because my sister forbids me from hanging out with our shared friend group (we’re twins)

AITA for feeling upset? Am I being selfish for not wanting him to leave?

Edit: he never said why he wanted to change schools, but in the past he has said that he would have probably committed suicide if he continued to go there"	Asshole	0	0	141.0	3.0	0.0	0.0
bz3vr9	2019-06-10 21:53:59	TelevisionDinners	AITA for not allowing my sister to adopt any of my foster kittens?	"Well, step-sister. I[20F] have fostered some kittens and they’re currently six weeks old, so I’ve searching for potential owners that will provide the kitties with a good home. My step-sister[20] has taken interest in adoption.

The problem is, I believe she’s irresponsible. Her mum bought her a puppy a few years back and my sister really loved that puppy, up until she had to be responsible for it. Whenever her puppy peed indoors, she’d refuse to clean it up. She’d have her mum take the puppy out. She really only liked the puppy so she had something to put on Snapchat or Instagram. Beyond that, she didn’t really acknowledge that puppies are living creatures with needs of their own, and are more than a few cute pictures for social media. When the puppy had grown up, she become more irresponsible. It was almost as if the poor thing had lost its ‘baby’ charm, now being a dog. But when the dog died, my step-sister really went in on this emotional breakdown until everybody sympathised with her, vowing she could have another pet when she had recovered from the loss and was ready.

I’m guessing she has recovered from the loss, because she was all over me once she found out I was searching for kitty parents. She went so far as to schedule coming over to meet the kittens. So, I was teaching her how to syringe feed kittens (not that it would be relevant once they’re old enough to be adopted, but I thought it would be sweet to show her the process), she lost her patience and had to pass the kitten back. Then I told her about mashing up kitten food into a soft sludge so they don’t risk choking, and she began squealing when she got wet kitten food on her finger. The rest of the time she spent with the kittens was of course, instagramming and taking snapchats of them. 

When she left, she seemed upbeat and told me to let her know which kittens would be available once I’d began to find owners because she’d be happy to take a pair off my hands. The problem is... I don’t want them to go with her. When I told her this, her face crinkled into complete rage. She began angrily flailing and barking at me, drawing attention from the neighbours with her comically exaggerated rage. Some of her points regarding her puppy were that ‘cats aren’t as high maintenance’ and ‘don’t need as much attention’. I was so annoyed, I told her flat out I think she’s too irresponsible, and she stormed off. She has been ignoring me since.

I genuinely do not believe any of these kittens would be in a good home if they go with her. My step-dad (especially) and mum are trying to convince me otherwise and keep telling me, ‘she’s changed’, and if she hasn’t, ‘just take the kittens back and find another owner’. One kitten could be very high maintenance as they develop, and absolute nightmares when adopted as a pair. Take it from somebody who raises them in their spare time.

bz3tzz	2019-06-10 21:49:42		AITA for moving from Florida to Tokyo without telling my family?	"Backstory; within the last 4 months my boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me. I had to move back to my home state and experienced a unexpected culture shock of having to be reunited with my family that I have never been close to. My sister nearly died during birth. My father came out as gay. My brother in law was arrested for attempting to murder my other sister by strangulation. I begrudgingly went back to my former job as a performer/leader at one of the busiest tourist spots in the world (aka I am meeting/being hugged/touched/pulled by literally hundreds into the thousands of people using a fake character personality/mannerisms in heat all day every day; I was seasonal to extend my time with the company but when I needed to move back asap I had no option but to go back FT). I was diagnosed with depression/pstd from the loss of my stillborn son several years ago. I was being threatened and sexually harassed by one of my coworkers. I was adjusting to life on my own without my ex, who was my best friend and family and trying to figure out who I was on my own. It was too much change in too short of a time so when I was offered a relocation to another state I immediately took it. I needed to get away from it all but I backed out last moment when the cost of living was too high to be comfortable with; I then was offered a 14 month relocation to Tokyo that I couldn't pass up. 

My family has already swept everything above under the rug like none of it has happened, while I am still trying to process it all. I nearly lost both my sisters, and they themselves don't even seem affected by it? I called each family member individually and when I tried to tell them I was moving, I was cut off or not given a chance to get a word in by them all while they all depreciated and trashed talked one another until they suddenly had to go. I went to send a group message instead but I kept thinking how I didn't even get a hello/hug/""good to see you"" or ""how are you?"" from any of them after not seeing them for 1-2 years, it was just immediately them complaining about other family members/unloading all their personal issues so I didn't send the message. I just moved. Once I got all settled in here I did message them and while none of them care that I'll be across the world from them for the next 14 months they are saying I am being a ""manipulative ass"" to get attention by being so secretive about my life and that's why no one cares. My mother is saying I am selfish and need to move back to be with my ex, despite knowing he broke up with me and how much I've been struggling with losing that relationship/friendship.

Am I being self involved by wanting some acknowledgment from my family, about anything, and I'm not realizing it due to the amount that has happened in such a short amount of time or are they justified and right about them having no reason to care since I am such a private person compared to them? I've always thought the issue was them but now I'm not sure."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

About 7 months ago I moved for a long distance relationship, to another town about 6 hours north of where I used to live.  Since moving, life has been a struggle.  Work/life balance is totally whack.  I went from having four consecutive days off weekly, to now having two non-consecutive days off.  I moved in with my SO who has 6 kids total, 50/50 custody for most.  The area I live in has dramatically shortened hours during winter and also has very harsh winters overall—-thats been a major adjustment.  To sum it all up without boring you with other examples, I have just been STRUGGLING.  My SO and I reached out to a counselor and have been going regularly.  It’s been helping a lot although I still feel I have a ways to go to manage the anxiety and stress that now consumes me.  

Now, onto the real question/story.  

Two days ago I messaged a friend of mine to acknowledge that I have probably been absent the last several months, explained how bad I’ve been struggling but shared that I had just accepted a new job which should hopefully provide me with better work/life balance and should hopefully be the first step in the right direction for finding my happy place again.  Their response was that they were sorry I’ve been struggling and they were happy I was starting a new job and that they hoped it would provide me with the work/life balance I’m looking for.  I didn’t think anymore of it.  This morning they asked if I could chat, I said sure I’ve got 20 minutes before I have to clock in.  And the phone call went south quickly.  They expressed how they felt abandoned by me and that I hadn’t been there as a friend for all their emotional struggles over the last six months.  I once again offered an apology for them feeling that way and further explained that I truly just have had to dive into my own self and focus on my own struggles.  It just didn’t seem good enough.  We were looping and they were repeating themselves which had me constantly repeating the same lines.  When I tried to tell them that I’m sure all of my friends have probably noticed the difference, I did not single them out specifically to treat them this way and their response was “I don’t care about anybody else, this isn’t about them.  Other people have problems too.” So I ended the phone call shortly after so I could try and calm down before my work shift.  

So I just need to know, AITA for not being able to be the emotional pillar for my friend these last few months?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
bz3tkg	2019-06-10 21:48:39	leftovertattoo	AITA for changing my mind about getting a matching tattoo with my SO because she has a matching tattoo with her ex?	"Throwaway account because my SO knows my main account.

I [25M] have been with my girlfriend [25F] officially for almost a year but we have been best friends since the 7th grade. Our relationship became romantic a few years back but she moved to Florida for high school while I remained in New Jersey, and neither of us were really willing to invest in a long distance relationship while we were so young. 

She moved back up north for law school about 2 years ago so we gave it another crack at a relationship and it has been amazing. Fast forward to a few weeks ago. My girlfriend brought up the idea of getting matching tattoos, and even though I was a little skeptical because this was completely new to us (or so I thought) I agreed because I truly love her and she is my best friend. 

Today (2 weeks before our tattoo appointment) I mentioned to my girlfriend about how one of our mutual friends had her ex’s name tattooed (they recently broke up). She then proceeds to tell me that she has a matching tattoo with her ex but she was planning on getting it covered at some point. 

I also want to mention that this would be my second tattoo and her 8th or so. I am definitely not upset about the matching tattoo because what she did with her ex-husband is none of my business. 

I told her I was not comfortable getting a matching tattoo with her if she still has a matching tattoo with her ex on her body and she has not spoken to me since. Am I the asshole?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
bz3sk8	2019-06-10 21:46:21	importantbirdqueen	AITA for shushing loud people behind me at the theatre?	"Okay, so last week I went to see a musical with my mom. It was one of my favorite shows of all time, and I was so excited to be seeing it.  The show was lovely, but there was a row of women right behind me who would not stop talking. They would pause briefly between comments, and then just fire right back up again. 

I’m not talking whispering, which is easy to ignore, I’m talking distractingly loud at almost a normal talking volume. Even during dialogue. They commented on every single thing that happened. Other patrons were shooting them looks, no usher made any move to do anything about it. About an hour and a half into the show I turned around and shushed them. Just a quick “SHHH.” 

It was during a song so only the people in the general are would have heard. They stopped after that, but my mom thought I was kind of an asshole. It’s just rude in general to shush people. 

I would have liked to have been able to be a little more discreet but there was a row of empty chairs between us and I didn’t want to cause an even bigger distraction by also talking. And I’m not going to lie, I was kind of rude about it. It was super brief but I scowled and was pretty curt. 

I work in retail and am just generally pretty sick of people who have no regard for the fact that they are in a public space that they are sharing with other people. No one else in the entire theatre seemed to have a problem with being respectful of the other people in the room. But I’m (obviously) a chronic over-thinker and thought about how rude it is to snap at someone you literally don’t even know. 

Everyone there had come to see the show, not hear unsolicited commentary. If you’d like to watch something and talk at the same time, do it at home. It was a small theatre too, and we were only around 8 rows from the stage. The volume they were at, I’ll be the actors could hear them. 

I am posing the question to the denizens of reddit because I can see how this could be an ESH. But I genuinely don’t think that I’m the asshole in this scenario. But I suppose an asshole never thinks they’re an asshole. So give it to me straight, y’all. What are your thoughts? If I’m the asshole I’d at least like to know."

I live 2-3 hours away and often have to make the drive alone which is stressful enough. Last year I drove 2+ hours, was on time, and then sat in my car waiting for her to show up. She’s constantly late and her phone was dead (as always) so I had no way of finding out where she was or what I should do.

This year was supposed to be better. I was so pissed waiting around after a long drive last year that we didn’t talk until the spring. I apologized and realized I was being over the top. I promised to show up in high spirits. This time her desired location was 3 hours away and she asked me to stop by a different town to pick up her cake. No problem! I expected she would text me her exact address/location by the time I got the cake.

I pick up the cake and get a single text, from one of her friends, to meet at ""mount XYZ."" Ok, put that in my GPS...and it’s an extra 25 minute drive than the town she originally told me. On top of that this cake needs a refrigerator.

Turns out mount XYZ just leads to a dead end and we are now lost with no service. I get back down the mountain to get service and no messages from her or anybody. We’ve been in the car an extra hour with the cake on my lap. After 20 minutes she calls and doesn’t even say sorry - just blames her phone for the service issues. We joined them for 1 hour before she ended up leaving for a dinner plan.

AITA if I end this friendship over this? I’m done. This has happened so many times and it’s always her phones fault. she’s left me stranded in another country because she was so late she missed her flight to meet me, so this is common."	Not the A-hole	0	0	35.0	15.0	0.0	0.0
bz3s2s	2019-06-10 21:45:14	sollicitusmeraki	AITA for not paying a writer on time even when she delayed all her work?	"My friend, studying in Australia, was struggling with mental health for a while and had is final dissertation due. He asked me to find someone to write it for him, so I posted on this group I'm in for writers (freelance writers of all kinds) in early March. I found a writer here, and we agreed to hire her. She agreed on a set timeline that stated she would send work chapter by chapter, with the complete dissertation done by the 7th of April. Afterward, she failed to meet a SINGLE DEADLINE. She would not reply, she would not pick up, and she would send the work a week or two late. She was late in all her submissions, but I never blew up on her or said too much and always paid her in full. Granted, once I was late in payment because my bank is horrible and their online services were down for weeks, but I conveyed that to her, and she said it was okay. I did not think it was a huge deal because the writer was always late in submissions too. She was so late that she sent the final dissertation at the END OF MAY, my cousin had to get an extension. We've paid her everything now except for the last installment. My friend was reluctant to give it until the thesis got approved because the submission was so late. He told me he would send the money as soon as the thesis was approved, which sounded reasonable to me? But now the writer is being incredibly rude and demanding payment. She's demanding payment and accusing me of delaying it for no reason. I told her calmly that the submission is delayed because of her late submissions, and I pointed out that I always paid her in full even though she didn't hold up her end of the deal. She's ignoring all my talk about her late submissions but demanding that I get my friend to pay her this instant.   I'm shocked at her lack of gratitude towards the fact that we have paid her in full despite her sending work so late and her rude behavior? Had she submitted everything on time, I would have paid her right after submission as I did with all the installments. But her work ethic showed how unreliable she is, so I'm not going to pay her until the dissertation is approved. AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: When she delayed work we made it clear that the final installment would be after submission and acceptance of the work and she agreed. Now she's saying she did not expect it would take this long even though it's only been a week since she sent the work. 

EDIT: I know it's cheating. Fully acknowledged. I live in a poor country where this is common culture so I guess I didn't think twice about it.

I know this whole thing is going to sound horrible on my part. I'm not entitled to his money or anything but let me give you a little taste of the way he spends all his money on his leeching girlfriend and never bothers to help my mom with bills or anything eventhough he lives with us and makes all our lives hell. (Ask questions if you're curious)

So basically my brother lent me $30 to hold me up for the week until I get paid because my aunt and uncle are staying at my room for the meantime and that same money goes to my mom and she gives me half of what my aunt and uncle give to my mom. 

So a week goes on by and still I haven't received my money and I already used up some the money on my Rabbits food. My brother already forgot about the money because he usually takes medicine that males him space out for a good majoirty of the day. I mention that I can't pay him this week because i still haven't recieved the money  and so he didn't like what he heard and he started getting aggressive calling me manipulative and getting my boyfriends name into it which he knows turns me red. I'm not going to lie but I did say all kinds of horrible things to him because what he told me really twisted the knife in the cut he has created years ago. He gets even more mad and tell me that now i have to pay him $55 and i told him to go fuck himself that because he raised the price I'm not paying him shit for being such a dick and starting problems. 

Fast forward to today, he keeps messaging me through his girlfriends phone about the money and saying that he's going to travel and blah blah blah. I ignored it. Tell me in person not through text asshole. My mom sides with me because she said he started it all and shouldn't have been such a dick but she also said I should've just stayed quiet

They aren't the baked kind, they are the no bake where you basically have to mix a powder with milk. I bought pre-made crusts, so I didn't have to do that part. 

The core of my question here is that I didn't let my mom know I was doing this. She'll be home in around an hour. I did use her mixer and a bowl, but otherwise I didn't use anything I haven't used before or nothing she isn't use to me using. I cleaned everything, and put everything back, so the only thing that says I made the cheesecakes are the actual cheesecakes. 

The only reason I didn't tell her was because I wanted to do them myself. If I said I wanted to do them, she would take charge and make my cakes for me instead of watching me do them myself. I'm personally expecting an argument when she comes home, but know I wanted to do them to say I'm able to do it.

Ex. a rice cooker.

My roommate went on vacation for 2 weeks last month. When I asked for the utilities/rent today, he freaked out and said it wasn't fair for him to pay rent/utilities while he was on vacation. I said that isn't how leasing works, and you still have to pay for rent/utilities whether you are here or not. For reference, the utilities came out to be about $10 less than the same month last year.

I said he needs to pay up by Wednesday or we are going to have a problem (It was due on the 3rd).

She lives in Tennessee and we live in Maryland, so it's not going to be a short trip or anything. I normally wouldn't have a problem taking time off to go visit them since I didn't get to meet her son last month when we last visited family. But my MIL will be going and I can't mentally handle her. 

My MIL ruined my wedding by inviting people without telling me or my husband a week before the date and then flipped when we told her she could t do that. She told me I needed my head checked bc she has a psych degree and that since I was adopted I wouldn't understand that blood had a right to be there. She then told my husband I would leave him and he'd be alone bc his family wouldn't support him. Everytime we've gone to visit family she complains when we spend time with anyone else and tells my husband he doesn't love her bc he doesn't spend enough time with him. she hasn't even said a word to me since our wedding last year. 

I know she might feel like her son was taken away from her and I refused to even see her the last time we went to see family (I didn't force my husband not to and he spent time with her) so I can see why she doesn't like me. But I've spent every vacation since I got married and moved to visit family and I mentally can't handle not having an actual vacation.

Edit: Clarification on the last sentence, it's not that I need a vacation like a trip somewhere it's more like not using all my free time to visit family because it's stressful since they live across the country or multiple states away.

-would make out and sleep with strangers while on a date with my friend, sometimes he would drive her to their place.   
-he would want to go back to sleep at 3am cuz he has work the next day and she would make him wait to drive her back after she finishes making out with strangers.  
- would say to her friends she isn’t interested in my friend but would tell him privately she is and rationalizes that another of her friend/dates would be jealous.   
-is in her 30th and never had a job  
    
We all knew she was bad for him, each of us approached it differently. He had many “lectures” from his peers about her being bad and had asked me to be supportive.  
I told him you do you but do not spend money on her, she is already affecting your life in many ways and you have student dept and are on a student salary so control spending.    
    
6 months in, he spends around 5000$ on her for a week getaway, then calls us saying they are stranded and need money to come back. He then took money from his dad, me and 2 other friends totally 2000$.
Except he called each of us progressively during the hence he lied about being stranded and was actually vacationing on lent money.  
   
He comes back, guilt trips us for more money as his birthday is coming and he wants to hang out with her. We say no at first as he is already in dept and should live by his means. He said he will take out a loan, eventually we considered it his bday present and payed.   
Eventually he got a 30k loan and payed us back. That same day we had an intervention and told him no more, we do not want to hear of her nor his spendings on her. As it pisses is off how he is wasting his life.     

We used to play DnD and around that time he had convinced her to come, she came for one session, hated it and basically vetoed it. Instead of him telling us, he kept rescheduling and cancelling day of until we stopped asking. He is the DM so there is no game without him.   
     
In the meantime he has been absent and unfocused at work so his boss asked him to take a leave of absence.    
   
He didnt tell us and just upped and left for 3 months.
I ran into him and ber 3 weeks ago 3am at mcdonalds  and he said he was intending to take another 3 months. (He was getting payed but HR realized last week that he wasnt supposed to be payed, a friend from HR told me)  
  
So now that he has to come back to be payed, he sent me this bullshit text “hey sorry its been a while, been dealing with some shit, how are you doing❤️”  
  
WIBTA if i cut him out for many reasons:  
he isnt who i thought he was  
From him being subservient to her  
Having no self esteem  
Manipulating us into sending him money  
Ditching DnD without an honest “yeah its done”  
Disappearing for 3 months without so much as a good buy

Recently, I’ve decided to become Pescatarian for health reasons, and one of my friends told me that she has ‘no faith at all in me that I won’t eat meat’.

A couple of weeks ago, I brought up that I was thinking of applying and training to become cabin crew, the group laughed and said I wasn’t the right sort of person for it.

This kind of thing happens a lot, and they say it’s because they ‘know me better than anyone’ but to me that seems like a cop out excuse to be rude to me because they ‘know me’ .

I told them they’re the least supportive friends I have and they just laughed it off and said again it’s because they’ve known me for all my life.

So, me and this girl, we'll call Kayley, has been best friends since the 7th grade. Our friendship has ended once before, but we reconnected two years after the incident (story for another time). This story starts almost immediately after we reconnected. 

When we reconnected in 2016, Kayley was dating this guy. He was a real peice of work. Huge ass hat. It wasnt long before Kayley was basically begging me to help her gain the confidence to get out of that relationship. So I did. She'd come over every weekend and we'd go to the park near my house to smoke and talk about shit that was going on in our lives. It was almost always about her boyfriend. Most of that year was a never ending cycle of Kayley finally being convinced she doesn't need him, me taking her out to celebrate her freedom, then her running right back to him. 
When she was FINALLY done with him, she came over to my place and we went to our spot where she told me what finally got her to dump him. Or WHO got her to dump him. It wasn't because of my help apparantly. It was a guy she met online. What did he say to her? Oh only everything I've already told her, word for word. She'd listen to some rando online than her best friend. But atleast she's done with him. 

Fast forward to 2018. Very hard year. My grandfather was terminal with prostate cancer and my depression was at an all-time high. I just didn't have the energy to go out and do things. Kayley didn't understand why I didn't want to go out and would constantly call me a flake. 
Last September, I get a message on Facebook from her asking if she could stay with me for a while (I have screenshots if anyone's interested).
I asked my mom and she said no. You have absolutely no idea how bad I felt. I had told her that my mom would day yes, as she had always said yes to my sisters friends. When I told her the bad news all she had to say was ""it's not like this is the first time you flaked on me"".

A week later I find that she blocked me. A mutual friend of ours asked her why, and she said ""I'm sick of her using me as a doormat"".
It's been it's been about 10 months since that happened and I'm still finding myself wondering if I really was the problem here."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Today I woke up to the sound of a young boy in front of my house screaming extremely vulgar/disgusting insults directed towards my sister and family. I quickly rushed outside to see my sister on the porch crying, and 2 boys, one was my sister's age and the other I recognized from high school in the grade above me. The younger one was standing in my driveway yelling the insults while the older guy sat in the car and watched. Apparently these kids are friends with a girl my sister had problems with at school. Upon first hearing, I thought this was a grown man yelling at my younger sister so I ran outside seeing red. After I got out, the older kid got out of his car and started telling me to relax and that I was gonna get fucked in jail for trying to ""run up"" on a minor, meanwhile the younger kid hid behind him and started directing insults towards me. In the heat of the moment, I thought the older kid was trying to square up with me so I started throwing punches, being careful to avoid hitting the younger kid. I got a couple good shots before they managed to get in their car and leave.

So my GF and I were talking about her time she spent with her niece and nephew when she tells me that, “he did the funniest thing while I was using the bathroom!” Okay.. kids are funny so I listen, and she tells me that while she was on the porcelain, he pulled up a step stool and got in her face trying to be a cute kid. Then I asked if she was exposed, she said “Yes, it’s my nephew!” So i asked if he can see everything and then again she says “Yes!” She then stated “Everyone let’s him in the bathroom, because he will yell and scream until you open the door.” I’m thinking to myself why in the hell is she showing a child her fully exposed self. If I were to do the same thing to my 4 yr old niece I would be thrown behind bars faster than I could zip up. She acted as if I was the crazy one, and this is perfectly normal.

bz3e06	2019-06-10 21:12:04	GraceInAMug	AITA bc I don’t want to be a backup plan?	"Annie – One of the friends. Recently divorced; but separated a year ago. 
Bonnie – Single, no kids. The “follower.” Will go along with anything Annie says. She’s just easy going.
Me – Divorced.

In the history of our friendship, we usually go along with what Annie wants to do including activity, day of the week, and time of the day the activity happens. It got to be a bit much. For instance, she’d go home after work to nap before we would go out. But, would ask if one of us could go to the venue early to get a table because she wanted a table to sit when we weren’t dancing. It was ok a couple times, but it got old fast bc she was usually 45-60 mins late. Everything was dependent on her schedule and timeline.

Since she’s started dating, 9 months ago, the girls nights have turned into a guy meeting her out and her leaving the group of 3 to go have a drink with him, leave with him, or completely bail on girls night to go hang out with a guy. She’s admitted to making dating and “getting the D” a priority. 

I brought this to her attention a couple weeks ago and essentially told her I’m tired of being the backup plan to her dating life. She shot back saying she doesn’t care if I bring a guy (this has happened 2 times in 2 years, and one was a dance partner not a date) and it doesn’t make her feel abandoned. That conversation ended with me being frustrated that she was listening to respond versus listening to understand. 

Recently, we’re making plans to go out on Saturday and I specifically said I didn’t want to go to XYZ because I don’t get asked to dance there and it’s boring to sit there for 3-4 hours. I told her this on Friday and Saturday. She said she likes it because she gets asked to dance. Full disclosure: she gets asked to dance everywhere we go. On Saturday afternoon, she sends a group text and says, “My first choice is XYZ bc of the dancing. My friend said he would dance with my friends if we go. But we can change it up. And I’m still hoping to get laid tonight.” Bonnie immediately responds and says, “XYZ is fine with me.” A couple hours later, I decide to stay home since the two of them wanted to go to the same place. I responded with “I’m not going out tonight. Y’all have fun. :)” Annie responds with “What? Why” I said, “You know why. I told you yesterday and today.” This turned into her saying she disagreed with my decision to stay home.

Cut to last week. Girls night on Thursday. Annie invites a date to come out. I went back to the car because I wasn’t feeling well but told them not to rush. Bonnie gets frustrated bc she’s abandoned. They go out Friday and a date comes to meet Annie. Bonnie gets frustrated and ends up having the same conversation about not wanting to be a back up plan. 

Annie discusses this with me and I tell her that she’s not following through on her word when she invites other people out on girls night and abandons us. Are we the assholes for feeling this way?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	36.0	6.0	0.0	0.0
bz3dxk	2019-06-10 21:11:52		WIBTA for scheduling my upcoming wedding for the middle of the week?	"My girlfriend (I guess fiancee now) and I recently got engaged and are currently trying to set a date. 

Some background, about ten months before we became a couple, my fiancee gave birth to a daughter who unfortunately only lived for a little over two months due to various genetic disorders. This was by far the most impactful event of her life. In a sense of honoring her daughter as well as turning the date into more of a happy occasion, she wanted to get married on her daughter's birthday. I am 100% okay with this, in fact I support it completely, but the only issue is that this date doesn't fall on the weekend until 2024. We weren't looking to wait that long to get married. Currently we're looking at doing this next year, in fact. 

Her family members are almost completely local and are totally on board with the idea, but many members of mine live quite a ways away and have complained about taking off a significant amount of time from work. No one has been outright rude about it, but many family members have expressed serious disappointment and told me that they either probably couldn't come or they would despite it being a massive inconvenience for them. 

I don't really think a ""NTA"" ruling is an option here. I understand if people can't make it and don't hold it against them. But are my fiancee and I being assholes here for asking them to do this in the first place?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bz3dsp	2019-06-10 21:11:30		AITA for trolling a 13 year old who was taking advantage of a national tragedy to bum money off of people?	"So this happened a little less than a year ago right after or near the end of the California Wildfires. I was walking through a big-box store doing a normal shopping run when the below happened:

Suddenly this kid (probably 12 to 14 years old) comes up to me and says “Excuse me sir. My parents died in the California fires over in California. I’m trying to collect money so I can get out to California and help them with the funeral. So, can I get some money?” (I’m slightly paraphrasing, but it was basically like this) The entire time, he’s sitting there eating popcorn in front of me while asking for money.

Now this entire request seemed instantly fishy, like they were abusing a tragic situation to try to swindle people basically. Aside from that, though, I just generally didn’t appreciate being approached for money while I was inside the store doing my shopping. (if it's legit, they'll be outside at a table with an adult) As politely and nicely as I could muster, I told him I didn’t have any cash (I didn’t – who carries cash?) but also that he shouldn’t be walking up to random strangers inside the store trying to get money off of them.

He kind of rolls his eyes at me and he moves along going down another aisle. I continue on my shopping adventure, and a few aisles later I see this kid again talking to another random customer. This time, he has two other kids with him, possibly his younger brothers or something (both around 8 to 10 or so). I overhear them trying their spiel on this customer and I can visibly see the other customer isn’t buying their story and is annoyed too. He also seems to be setting a bad example for his younger brothers by doing this.

I find an employee at the store and tell them that these kids are walking around the store trying to hit people up for money. He says he’ll take care of it. I continue on my shopping adventure.

I’m near the tail end of my shopping and I see these kids again. They’ve just their money on a ton of new food from the concession food area up front: soda pop, more popcorn, pizza. They walk by me to another customer and start hitting them up with their spiel. I find another employee there (this one had a walkie, so they seemed more authoritative) and tell them that these kids are harassing people all over the store for money and I point to them. He says he’ll take care of it. He’s in the middle of something, though, so it takes him a few minutes to finish his current task.

I walk by to check out and leave, and I hear them trying to shake yet another customer down. I walk up to the kid and say “Excuse me, my parents recently died in a fire, could you help me with some money?” He looks at me in total shock from my trolling. Then I continue “I’ve told the management here what you’re doing, and they are going to kick you out for harassing people.” I walk away and check out.

On memorial day my grandma and my great uncle and aunt held party / bbq at their house, a bunch of family was invited and lots of us have dogs so we all brought our dogs along with us as well. Being completely honest, I was having a terrible day already, and I never get along with my great uncle. This info is important.

The party was going good, everyone was sitting and talking and there were 5 dogs running around playing with each other. My dog happened to be the biggest one, he is an 80 pound lab but he is well trained and wasn't bothering anyone, or so I thought. My great uncle ""Larry"" was carrying a plate full of meat to put on the grill and all of the dogs started following him as dogs do when they smell food. I'm watching from the sliding glass door to make sure my dog is behaving himself when to my surprise Larry kicks my dog three times, the last kick in his face. I'm immediately confused and pissed off so I yell from the sliding glass door, ""Do NOT kick my dog!"" I called my dog to come inside and took him into the bathroom with me so I could calm down a little bit and separate him from Larry for awhile. As I was walking to the bathroom Larry's wife asked what happened and I said ""Larry just kicked my dog in the face."" My dog and I sat in the bathroom for a minute and then Larry comes to the bathroom door demanding me to open it up. I open and he immediately starts pointing his finger in my face saying ""I did NOT kick your dog"" to which I replied ""Yes you did I literally watched you?"" He replied and said ""I did NOT kick your dog in the face!"" And then again I reiterated ""Um yes you did, I watched you, why are you lying?"" Larry was at this point yelling and told me not to call him a liar, and then I told him not to kick other people's dogs and he could kick his own dog if he wants but not mine. After this he said it was his house and he could do whatever he wanted and I just said fine then I won't be coming over, let alone bringing my dog over to play anymore. Larry's face was beat red and he stormed off and left the house completely, and I decided it was probably best I go as well and take the dog home.

I haven't talked to any of them since but my mom recently saw my grandma and my grandma told her that Larry is pissed at me and I need to apologize to him and it was disrespectful and out of line for a 19 year old to call a grown man a liar. I'm still really mad he kicked my dog but I can't help but feel like I was disrespectful to call him out in his own home, and maybe I should've just went home with my dog and not said anything. I can't decide so help me out reddit, AITA here?

Also, my dog is completely fine. It's not like Larry injured him but I am still frustrated."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Our lower neighbor has a hard time remembering who is who as my friend and I both have blonde hair so she always mixes us up and just always assumes me friend is me. It's been a joke that my friend just goes along with it and doesn't correct her. Normally this is easier than trying to explain to the neighbor that we are two different people. So this weekend while I was gone my roommate and my friend went downstairs acting like she was me and smoked weed with our neighbor.

Now I have nothing against weed or care who or who doesn't smoke but I personally don't so when I heard this I was upset because it doesn't make me comfortable lying about that and now everytime I come home I'm afraid to run into our neighbor because I don't want to have to keep up that lie but I also feel like I'm running my friends fun and am acting like I can't take a joke.

"I'm  20 years old right now trying to pay for university myself and living  with my mother (single mom, my father died when I was a baby) to save myself from a bit of debt. We're on housing benefits but aren't bad tenants or what most people assume (i.e. trashy)  when they think of Section 8. When I was younger I knew that we didn't have a lot but more recently I have been privy to how bad it actually is. Our income level is substantially below the FPL, about $9,000 a year  generously. My mother is still claiming me as a dependent. She works in media sales on commission, so I am always the one with a steady job. She has a lot of debt from college and raising me with no help, and I know that I'm responsible for helping with finances since I'm living here. I'm regularly paying for our Netflix, amazon prime, my wifi/phone bill, car fuel, and pet care costs when they come up. 

I usually work a lot of manual labor/minimum wage jobs (farms, landscaping) so I feel like my savings are hard earned but in four months putting away 15-25% of my pay I only managed to keep $250 in my savings because I had to front unexpected bills. Right now I'm earning is $400/month (about $200 biweekly) because where I'm working can't give the employees overtime or extra hours. If I get a second job, or whenever I earn a decent wage, our rent goes up and I feel the financial hit because I'm the only one with actual money (not credit) to put towards the bills.

All I keep hearing from her is that she just needs this one thing to pull through or if this circumstance changes we will be fine. I am tired of it. I have been hearing the same thing for years, and I'm trying my best not to be bitter because she did the best she could while I was growing up.

bz3b7r	2019-06-10 21:05:35		AITA for asking brother's gf to move (max char. Limit)	"This starts off July with my hub and I finding out I'm preg with our 2. BIL is dating a girl who has kids from prev relationships. My family has dogs and they have dogs.

When my hub shares our news to bro, bro let's him know that his gf is preg too, but he's freaking out.

There was a discussion and it was decided that bro and gf plus family are moving in rent free and no written agreement.

We live in a tri-level home with 3 bdrs on top with a bthr, mid level ktchn and dine area (turn to liv room), and low level 1 liv space with 1 bdr and bath. Hub and I have a room, bro and gf have a room, kids share a room, and shared baby room.

Before moving in, hub and I thought we established rules with them. A major 1 was not to have dogs in house because of how many people would be in the house. We also thought tensions might run high and we didn't want dogs to feed off anyone's negative energy.

Moving starts Nov.

Dogs were supposed have their own living space in our shed in our backyard. That plan changed 2 days before finishing moving in bro and gf because gf decided her dog wasn't going to sleep there. Dogs end up getting kennelled in the garage.

1st night living in the house, they bring their dogs in. Next day, my hub talks to bro reminds him about the house rules. Next night, gf comes in upset wakes up the kids. My daughter freaks out, ends up sleeping with us and from this point on refuses to sleep back in her bed.

The rest of the month is uneasy. They moved out their dogs and our still kennelled. 

Dec begins.

Hub and I try to figure out a solution. We decide to try to have the dogs in house, but take it easy. 2 week trial with having everyone in the house help take care of our dogs. Then if it goes well we will introduce their dogs next.

Week 1 passes, another adult discussion. During this discussion they are unhappy that their dogs are not in yet. And some really not so great comments were made from both parties. 

This part is about what went on in my head: I saw it as the gf creating the trouble because I lived with bro before and we were fine. She made it clear she was upset by side comments any time hub and I were around. My kid got to witness the neg side during all this time. Her kids weren't home when things got heated between the adults.

I had enough and made the announcement directly to the gf that she had 30 days to move out. She said fine and we thought it was the end of that.

Jan begins, there was no signs of anyone moving out. Tensions are high, we stay at a hotel, checked state laws and wrote up a notice to move or be taken to court. 2 weeks later no change. We attempt to move back in.

This part I know I wasn't in the right: I removed their baby stuff and moved it into their living space.

Of course this does create a very heated argument. We stay at a hotel again. 

Early Feb, we finally get a court order stating move out or meet you in court. Day before the court date they moved and haven't spoke to them again."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I've been in this chat for a while and this one member got a gf a few days ago and proceeded to add her to the chat. They only dated because they share one major interest and sat together at lunch. 

She only ever makes cringy comments to make herself seem cooler or quirky or something and I can't stand her. So I keep making jabs at them both after he basically added a 3rd party to the chat. 

What I'm worried about is if they break up, the rest of us have to deal with it because they're so public about it. 

The guy sent an image of flowers he got for her to all of us. Am I in the wrong for being so irritated?"	Asshole	0	0	43.0	11.0	0.0	0.0

My old roommate texted me the other day to let me know that a check came in the mail for me (not sure how that happened because I changed my mailing address far in advance). He said he would mail it out to my new address for me, which I thought was really nice. I assumed he meant he'd stick it in an envelope, put a 50 cent stamp on it, and put it in the mailbox, but today he sends me a receipt for a $7.95 charge from the post office. He took it to USPS, picked out a large envelope, and chose 2 day delivery. I'm really confused as to why he did that- it's just a small check and I didn't say that I needed it immediately or anything. I was considering paying him back for it, but now I think that I shouldn't have to because he should have told me that he was planning on sending it out through priority mail. WIBTA if I don't pay him for it? He hasn't explicitly asked me to, but I feel like he expects me to since he sent me the receipt.

&#x200B;

Edit: I know it's only $8 and I know this isn't a hill to die on. I'm simply wondering if I WBTA by not reimbursing him if he doesn't explicitly ask me to.

&#x200B;

Edit #2: I was planning on contacting the company later this week to send me a new check if it hadn't arrived yet, and he knew this. He insisted that it was no big deal to mail it out to me, which is why I assumed he would just stick it in his mailbox."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	325.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

Basically my housemates want to throw a housewarming party but they want to invite 2 people I have a bad history with. My ex and my ex best friend. Basically I had this best friend I told all my gf problems too and he pretended to be supportive. Because 2 weeks after I broke up with her, he admitted they were dating. And worst part was, he was also my roommate. Like she literally moved from my side of the room to his side of the room at night.

Just graduate Boot Camp not too long ago and the family is very proud of him shit I’m even very proud of him. Not easy what he is doing and I have respect for all military. I come home from work yesterday to see a big portrait of him in his graduation Uniform in the living room. I complemented it but then asked my wife if she was going to leave it in the living room? She said yes and I told her I didn’t want it there.  She got offended and called me an asshole that this is her brother and she wants to have a picture of him. I told her that’s fine to put the pic somewhere else but I don’t want a big picture of your brother with a mean mugging face in the living room when there’s literally only one picture of us. I told her the picture is totally fine but I don’t want it dead smack in the living room that’s awkward and then we got into a big fight. Explain to her that this is also my house and I don’t just want a picture of her brother I have five siblings and there’s not a single picture of them anywhere in our house or even my parents. I explained to her she’s not his mother it’s great to be proud of him but doesn’t need to flaunt it in our apartment.

bz32em	2019-06-10 20:45:26	dantreacyseyes	AITA for refusing to wear a bra to dinner?	"Backstory: Growing up, my mom (37F) would often tell me(21F) to wear longer shorts in the house when my brother or step dad were home and things of the like- this always made me hyper aware of my body in a negative way. I explained to her to that her comments grossed me out, and that if she thought I needed to cover myself because my male relatives were in the house, she probably had a few things she needed to sort out with herself. She always defended her argument with “I own you until you are 18.” This always ended in arguments. Ultimately, I would comply, but it left me feeling uncomfortable in my body for years. 

Last week, I visited my parents across the country. We were getting ready to head out for dinner together, and I wore a long sleeved shirt without a bra. I have a small chest, and bras have never been comfortable. The top I had on wasn’t sheer, and caused nothing other than a pronounced outline of my chest. When I stepped out to leave, my mother sees me and goes “NO.” She then yells at me that I wouldn’t be leaving the house dressed like a whore, and that I needed to realize the world doesn’t revolve around me. She said there might be families there and I shouldn’t go around children like that. 

I got emotional and told her there was nothing wrong with my outfit or body, and that I felt she was sexualizing me in a weird way. I don’t feel like the fact that I’m not wearing a bra is offensive or disrespectful to children and families. I also pointed out that I have been independent for years now, I pay all of my own bills and provide for myself. I reminded her that I am no longer her “property” and that she shouldn’t project her own opinions on body image onto me. She told me I made my sibling (17F) cry and that I ruined our limited time together. Sister later told me she cried because Mom was screaming. 

Ultimately I didn’t go to dinner because I was crying and I knew my mother would be hell to be around no matter what I wore. Step dad (36M) told me he understood my point of view but that I should just comply with my mom to make things easier. Mom is still mad at me and being very abrasive in her responses to me. 

Is he right? It does sound simple but after so many years of her messing with my body image and “owning” me, I don’t feel like I should cave. At the same time I love my parents dearly and I feel awful that one of the limited days I have with them a year was ruined. 

AITA?

EDIT: Yes, I’m now aware that I’m a part of a string of posts lately concerning similar issues. I didn’t know it when I posted it, and even if I did it wouldn’t make a difference. I felt tremendous guilt for wasting one of the few days a year I get to spend with my family. I have as much of a right to post as anyone. Thank you to everyone who gave me insightful responses - it’s more than I could’ve asked for and it’s been really helpful with figuring out how to deal with my family moving forward."

bz308r	2019-06-10 20:40:25		WIBTA if I refuse to make a 6 hour drive alone because my bf doesn't want to fly?	"About a month or so ago I bought tickets for a three day music festival in October that is happening in a city \~6 hours from where I live (with no traffic). When I bought these tickets, I assumed my bf and I would share the responsibility of driving, or we would just fly since it's a pretty long drive especially to do over a 3 day weekend. But then he got a DUI and will most likely have a suspended license at the time of the trip (we don't know for sure yet since his hearing isn't until August, but it's a definite possibility and I don't want to assume he'll be able to help me drive).

I told him that I still really want to go to this festival, but I would feel a lot more comfortable flying. He doesn't want to fly because it's more expensive than driving (but not significantly, maybe around $80 difference per person). This does not sit well with me. For context, I stopped driving about 3 years ago due to terrible driving anxiety and just recently started again (partially motivated by him getting the DUI and me realizing I would need to drive us places since we like to travel a lot, but also I was just ready to overcome my anxiety and had wanted to get a car again for awhile). I ended up getting a car about a month ago and have been feeling pretty comfortable driving, even on freeways and in busy traffic. However, I still don't know if I feel comfortable making the 6 hour drive without anyone else to help. The longest I've ever driven by myself is probably about 3 hours. I'm still having anxiety at times and I don't know if I'll be comfortable enough by October to make that long of a trip without another driver.

So reddit tell me, WIBTA if I refuse to drive and tell him that I only feel comfortable with flying, even though it's more expensive?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bz302q	2019-06-10 20:40:04	Upirupir	AITA for rescinding my sister's invite to my wedding?	"After months of trying to plan a wedding and realizing that it wasn't for me, my fiance and I decided we were just going to do a small ceremony with a handful of our closest friends and my little brother(no blood relation). We let our parents know and then I made a post on facebook letting friends and other family know. I want to clarify really quickly that the only member of either of our families coming is my little brother. My other older sister and my fiance's brother are both fine with not being invited. The reason my brother is invited is because he is my absolute best friend and is a brother I chose for myself about 12 years ago.

&#x200B;

Everyone was super supportive of this choice and I finally felt so much relief after spending the last 8+ months struggling to plan anything. My oldest sister messaged me to tell me she respected my decision and was happy for me. Then she followed it up asking if there was absolutely anyway she could come. She promised she wouldn't tell anyone. I initially said yes due to a feeling of immense guilt. However, that was why I had been struggling with planning an actual wedding in the first place, I had been feeling such guilt over who to invite. I knew immediately that I shouldn't have said yes. So after spending the night thinking about it, I decided to get back to my sister and tell her that I had to do what was right for me and told her she was no longer invited. I feel I was very respectful and and considerate in my message to her.

&#x200B;

My sister did not respond well to my message. She spent the next few hours throwing a temper tantrum and asking why and what she did wrong. She refused to accept that it had nothing to do with her specifically, that I just don't want it to be a big thing. When I talked to my other sister about it, she put it perfectly; if I invite my sister, then my mom will want to be invited. I invite my mom, then my fiance's mom will want to come, and etc. And I'd end up right back where I started. I don't want that.

&#x200B;

My sister and I got into it and it ended pretty poorly. She made the insinuation that my brother isn't my family and then told me my other sister being respectful of my choice shouldn't matter since I've only know her for about 6 months(long story). Both of these remarks really upset me and I told her I didn't want any of our ""garbage"" family there. She continued to be dramatic and I finally told her I loved her, but she was too much to handle and stopped responding.

&#x200B;

She did end up messaging me the next day and apologized for how she acted. I told her again that I loved her and left it at that. I know the situation is resolved, and I personally don't feel that I did anything wrong here, but I wanted to get some other opinions. Am I the asshole for uninviting my sister to my wedding?"

My mom goes to McDonald's every day to get a mocha frappe. Because I need hours, my mom lets me drive her there everyday she can. McDonald's is only 2 minutes away.

&#x200B;

So I decided to take a nap. Before I went under, I told my mom to wake me up so I could take her to McDonald's and she agreed. Cut to me being woken up saying she is ready to leave. I tell her to give me five more minutes. About five minutes later I wake up, get pants and a shirt on, and leave my bedroom to take her there. I walk out and see that there is a frappe on the counter. I then walk over to the garage and open the door to hear the \*tink tink\* sound a car makes after it has just been turned off. By this point I am sufficiently pissed off, its only been five minutes.

&#x200B;

So I walk over to my mother, who is outside for whatever reason, for an explanation. She said she just didn't feel like waiting and I should have gotten up faster. I check the time on my watch to confirm that, yes, only five minutes have gone by. I tell her its only been five minutes. She tells me to leave her alone and ""get out of her face."" She was completely unapologetic and rude. I go inside, feeling vindictive, but knowing I cant do anything about it. But then I notice her drink. I pour it down the sink.

&#x200B;

Mom comes back inside and rants to my father about how I was attacking her (never touched her) and that her son shouldn't control where and when she goes somewhere. She then realized her drink was missing. She came to my room pounding on the door but I didn't feel like it so I held it shut. Eventually she gave up."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

English isn't my second language so, sorry for mistakes

&#x200B;

A few months ago for my 23rd birthday my brother (30) got me as a present Red Ded Redemption 2 (the deluxe edition) as we're both big gaming enthusiasts. I was so happy because I was really looking forward to play this game and expected a true gem. I tried a few times to get into it (overall 2/3 hours) but I just couldn't get into it, I found the controls pretty slow and had trouble getting into the story. However the voice acting and the graphics are absolutely stunning. So I put the game away and focused on other games I was currently playing. I'm gonna get into RDR2 when I'm finished with my current game (AC Odyssey DLC's)

&#x200B;

Everytime my brother asked about how I was enjoying the game I told him the reasons stated above. Every single time he got upset and told me ""I spent 100€ on this gift for you and you don't play it, that's not nice at all"". It hurts as fuck to hear that because in my country (and in most of the countries i guess?) it's super rude to tell someone how much a gift cost LET ALONE using the cost of the gift to guilt trip someone. I wasn't the first time my brother used the price of a gift to guilt trip someone.

I tried to get some input from my family and unsurprisingly they just tell ""You also do bad things sometime so it's nothing to be angry about"".

I understand that it never feels nice to see someone not liking a present you gave them but it's really out of line to remind someone of the price of it. 

&#x200B;

So am i crying over spilled milk? AITA for telling my brother I didn't play the game he got me as a gift because I just didn't enjoy it (and who the hell can predict how much they will enjoy a game before playing it?)?

My wife and I live in a house with seven other people and we have two big dogs. If cps takes the kids they will either go to foster care or come to us. However, for us to even be able to take them we would have to move and prove that we could give the kids everything they needed. The things is I'm not sure we can. These kids are in desperate need of therapy and just general medical care. My wife and I have no money saved because we've been focused on paying off debt/student loans and would only be able to afford a 2 bedroom apartment and with big dogs apartments are hard to find. Because we can only afford a 2 bedroom we wouldn't be able to take all the kids. It would be the boys OR the girl. We would barely be able to cover their basic needs and can't afford the therapy at all. If they go into foster care they get free therapy, free medical care, and all their basic needs would be met. We would be allowed regular visitation and depending on how long they stay in foster care the state will pay for their college. I feel horrible even thinking about not taking them.

My parents have plenty of money for the community college. It costs like 7k for two years and my dad makes around 80k, so money isn’t an issue.

My question is, would I be the asshole for flat-out refusing to go to college? I’ve tried reasoning with them about it, but they insist on it. Of course, they can’t force me to go seeing as I’m an adult, but I don’t want to be a dick.

Any comment is helpful."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bz2ske	2019-06-10 20:22:08	elCapitan310	WIBTA if I don't go to a party of a close family friend who personally helped me out?	"Last summer I did an internship in a city far away from my home, so I had to sublet. My dad reached out to a close highschool friend to ask if I could sublet from him (he's very wealthy and lived close to city center). My dad's friend happily accepted, and told me that he would refuse to accept rent from me and would be offended if I tried to live in the city and pay rent. 

&#x200B;

This was a fantastic deal, but the living situation was very rough. He kept very strict hours (home by 8pm, lights out by 9, no guests and no phone calls). As I was trying to build a network and start a business (with assets overseas, meaning working hours started at 10pm), it was difficult to work around this. Since I wasn't paying rent, I figured I was lucky to live there and just dealt with it. 

&#x200B;

I think I was a good house-guest: I bought groceries, did all the cleaning, cooked dinner every day, didn't eat food from his house unless he offered, and tutored his daughter on the SATs (Which was tough because she thought doing practice problems was too much work, and in turn would complain to her dad who would reprimand me for overworking her). I made a point of abiding by all his rules and tried to go above and beyond what was expected of me (he never asked me to help with the housework and groceries).

&#x200B;

But as the summer progressed, he became more invasive: I would find my items rummaged through, my laptop/phone locked out by too many failed access attempts, and on numerous occasions he would ask me why I kept so much cash (meaning he looked through my wallet, I kept cash for tipping at company outings).

&#x200B;

I was very gracious about it and never said anything, but I hated living there. This weekend (i'm visiting home for a few days before I have to leave again), my parents got an invite to his summer home (in our city) for a party he's throwing. They said I am obligated to go as I lived at his place for free. I really don't want to as I felt very uncomfortable around him and living there, but he did me a massive favor.

bz2s7p	2019-06-10 20:21:15		AITA for not wanting to comfort my friend after her bf moves to another country?	"Kelly (20) and I (21) are great friends. Last September my bf introduced her to Josh, they’ve been dating since. They’re infatuated with each other. However Josh will be moving to another country in less than 2 months to travel. He’ll be gone for *at least* a year. We have all known this since Josh met Kelly. So far they have no plans to visit each other during this time, but plan to stay together. 

The last two months Kelly has been spending most of her time with Josh. In groups, she doesn’t talk to others or me, only Josh, unless someone directly asks her a question. Some have expressed that they find it rude/possessive. I brought this up, saying she and Josh act exclusive in group settings. She said that this is bc 1) they’re a new relationship, 2) have gotten closer lately 3) he’s leaving her soon. She said she’ll keep it in mind, isn’t purposely being rude but also doesn’t really care.

I probably won’t see her much the next two months leading up to Josh’s departure. I also suspect when he **does** leave, she’ll come crying to me since I was close to both of them. Though, I feel it’s unfair for her to come to me for support (and to have someone to hang out with) after all this.

WIBTA if I didn’t want to bounce right back with her when her boyfriend leaves? This would mean I wouldn’t be the greatest support and let her know how this all made me feel. An apology would be nice  too."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bz2rht	2019-06-10 20:19:36	TheUltimateShitTest	WIBTA for moving out of state and leaving my mother behind in the nursing home?	"My parents were pretty good parents who loved us growing up.  After we were grown and moved out they started taking trips by selling stuff they had, but also taking out a loan on their house.  They never planned for the future, and apparently lived as though they would always be healthy.

&#x200B;

My dad died in 2016.  My mom kept falling and going to the hospital and then rehab, so my wife and I took her in to live with us because there were no other viable options really.  It was contentious to say the least, as my mom was resentful about the situation she and dad put themselves in.  It also cause quite a strain in my marriage, and even though we did the right thing we both resented being put in the situation to begin with.

&#x200B;

Late last year she had some internal bowel issues that required surgery.  During the recovery time she went to a rehab facility, but was so weak she could barely sit up.  Her insurance discontinued rehab because she wasn’t making progress.  She has progressed some since then, but is wheelchair-bound and needs full-time care at this point.  I applied for help through the Medicaid program in my state, as well as getting her to sign over power of attorney, medical power of attorney, and sign a living will.  As of a few months ago everything is approved, and she will pay a portion of her Medicare to the facility for the rest of her life, with state Medicaid paying the rest.  So everything is taken care of.  She's 80 now.

&#x200B;

Except now I have an opportunity to take a job in another state making twice as much money as I do now.  This would really help us – while I do okay, this money would basically allow us to get completely out of debt within 5 years or less, including the house.  The problem is, if we move, what do we do with mom?  I have no guarantee that she will qualify for the same care in another state, and home care is SUPER expensive, beyond our ability to pay for.  My sisters are unwilling to help at all, they want nothing to do with mom for many reasons.  I just got done getting everything taken care of and don’t really want to have to start all over tbh.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I decided to move anyway and leave my mom in the facility she’s in, knowing she’s taken care of but also knowing she has no family or friends nearby except for the ones she’s made in the facility, and maybe a few people from church who would visit her every so often?  I would still call her and keep in contact, and we could video chat.  But I feel guilty, like I’m abandoning my mother when she’s old.  What do you think? I’m torn here."

bz2qup	2019-06-10 20:18:10	yano242	AITA for starting a league match?	"
I'm not a perfect guy in the least but I try my best. My girlfriend and I went skating a week ago where she fell and hurt hand/wrist. That was on a Sunday. I took off early from work 3 consecutive days to ensure she got to see a doctor etc. (Health care here sucks if you don't have big bucks.) She lives with her father 30mins away from where I live with my grandmother. I work with her dad when I'm in town so I use her car to get to and from since she doesn't work or rarely needs to leave home. (She just graduated uni.) We spend our days off at her place. I usually wake up early help my grandmother open her shop up etc. My girlfriend sleeps in most days until 12pm. Knowing this I shoot her a message saying and I quote 

""HMU when you get up so I can head over"". 

At 12 she calls me and tells me that's she's awake and that her hand and back hurts, generally she doesn't feel well. So I ask her if she still wants me to come over as usual she says yeah. I get dressed and head over. We typically play league of legends, watch Netflix together or go to the beach. So, I get there and she let's me in heads to the room and starts watching full house on Netflix. I hate full house, she knows this. So I sit at my computer and open league of legends assuming that she doesn't want to play because her hand hurts since that was the case yesterday. Immediately as the que pops and I accept it she jumps up and says to me 

""oh so you not even gonna ask if I want to play, you always do this sh*t you selfish asshole."" 

Now I admit I have jumped in games before without asking her if she had any intention of playing. I didnt make any excuse at this point, all I said was very calmly

"" oh my bad I'm sorry I assumed you didn't want to play cause of your hand, my bad."" 

She then proceeds to cuss me out to the point that her dad comes to see what's up and just stands at her door way watching as I sit there not saying a word because I can't get one in left or right. At the end of the cuss parade she tells me to pack up my computer and stuff and leave.

I wait a few minutes, then say to her

 "" I apologise for not asking her if she wanted to play but she also at no point indicated to me that she wanted to play either so we both failed to communicate. ""

She replies that it is in no way shape or form her fault and she is no wrong in any way because she shouldn't have to tell me she wants to play and that she shouldn't have to and that it's entirely my fault for not asking.

At this point I simply say ok, pack my stuff and leave in tears of fraustrstion.

bz2qtr	2019-06-10 20:18:05		AITA for refusing to speak to my boyfriend's roommate?	"So it's obvious this guy is an asshole, but I wonder if my stance here is too extreme and if AITA for that.

I've known my bf for 5 years. This guy, one of his current roommates and who I will call ""shitbag,"" is a friend of his from childhood. I never liked him because he seems like the sort of person who intentionally cultivates an aura of judgment and he’s generally a bit disrespectful towards my bf.

A year ago shitbag officially dumped his gf and kicked her out of their place so he could pursue something with a new girl that he met through my bf, and was sleeping with them both along with some other random girls. The now ex came over to my bfs place for my bday once not long after (shitbag wasn't there) and later ended up breaking down about the whole situation and showed us some of their recent texts which were horrifying. He insulted her, threatened to destroy her things, actively attempted to provoke a panic attack, and said some worse things I won't repeat. This apparently isn't isolated. I offered my perspective from having been able to get out of something like that, and we spent a few hours consoling/supporting her. I was 100% leading the convo but my bf and his third roommate were backing me up. I asked her if I could tell the new girl (a friend) about all this so she could know what she was getting involved in. She agreed.

Long story short both women continued to sleep with him, but they did both confront him separately and he lost his mind over us ""talking about him behind his back"" and started being very overtly hostile to my bf (but not the other roommate). He threatened him if he ""ever talked to either of them again” and for EIGHT MONTHS would actively antagonize my bf and try to make us as uncomfortable as possible if we were over. Third roommate, whose friendship with shitbag was largely unaffected on both ends, started to get fed up with the atmosphere and urged us to apologize to keep the peace. I refused, but once tried to get shitbag to confront me rather than antagonize my bf, since I’m the one who did all this, but he just scoffed and told me I was ""irrelevant.""

Shitbag eventually drunkenly apologized to my bf, but I still refuse to speak to him. His smug attitude is a bit ""triggering"" for me, especially knowing he's emotionally abusive. I also don’t hide my opinion of him to my bf/third roommate (also a friend of mine). Third roommate thinks I'm creating unnecessary drama by not just letting it be, but I can't begin to understand why he's still okay being friends with shitbag knowing who he is.

I think I should have the choice to not interact with abusers if I don't want to and that to act like nothing is wrong is tacitly encouraging his behavior and therefore morally wrong, even if it makes things ""difficult."" But ultimately this has nothing to do with me and the relationships involved (except new girl) predate me, so I wonder if I'm just being self-righteous. AITA and should I just chill/MMOB?"

bz2qmz	2019-06-10 20:17:37	carbon8edorangejuice	AITA for not wanting to bring my mom to the gym with me?	"I (26f) moved back in with my parents about a month ago. I’m in school and I just couldn’t afford rent anymore. I know that this is a big deal, and I really appreciate them allowing me to move back in, but it has been really difficult. I am really struggling with the lack of space and I do my best to get along with both of them. I often cook dinner, clean, and do laundry for them - not because they ask, but to show that I appreciate them. 

I have also been in a pretty unhealthy place for the past year or so. My eating habits have been terrible, and that’s part of the reason I’ve been cooking for all of us. I’ve gained about 30 pounds in the past year (120 to 150) and I’m really trying to get on track and begin a healthier lifestyle. My parents are both overweight as well but they seem to enjoy what I cook for them and really support me trying to create a healthier lifestyle for all of us. 

My mom in particular has seen me attempt this lifestyle change and wants to join me, I guess. I have JUST started (I’ve gone twice) to go to the gym at my University campus and I’ve been excited to go. She said to me today “I think you should take me to the gym”. I said that I’m struggling to go on my own, and I really don’t want to bring her along. She looked SO hurt and I feel like shit about it. I know she just wants to help motivate me and improve her health too. She doesn’t know how to use the equipment (I barely know what I’m doing myself). But bottom line, I just want to go alone. I need the space, and I need to figure this out solo. But now I feel like I’m getting in the way of her self-improvement because I know she won’t go without me. AITA?"

bz2p0h	2019-06-10 20:13:49	-_Mocha_-	AITA for throwing away all of my parent's sugary foods?	"Hello, 18 f here. I just went on a purge today of all of the candy and sweets in my house. I have been trying to recover from a food addiction for years which has been a large component in fueling my depression. I have gone up and down with my dieting over the years going from eating everything I see to almost developing anorexia. I still live with my parents and don't have a job yet.  (though I am getting ready to sign up for one very soon) My mother has a habit/hobby of dumpster diving. Sometimes amongst her other ""treasures"" that she finds she'll land to get some food. Granted its all unopened and was mostly just thrown out due to passing the expiration date. A lot of this is candy. We have so much of it that is very concerning. Her last haul of it consisted of 13 chocolate bars, 4 bags of hard candy, 12 packages of more ball shaped chocolates each containing 4 a piece, 5 containers of gum (like the cup shaped ones), a few lindor chocolates, 4 jars of marshmallow fluff,  a package of Swedish fish, and an entire bowl of taffy. She'll bring home a load like this about every couple weeks or so. Now, I am 5'3 and weigh in from 175lbs at my lowest to 190lbs at my highest. I have been told again and again by my doctors that I need to lose wight or I will develop diabetes in the near future, my mother being present for every one of those statements. she is 5'2 and 240lbs and she has asthma. I fear that she will one day she will die because of her wind pipes closing up because she refuses the idea of making it better by losing weight. I have told her time and time again that I want to go on a diet and that I would really benefit from her not bringing home junk food anymore. She has ignored my begging and continued with her actions. I have been trying to curve my weight for years now and this is the exact same cycle that has been going on since. I snapped a little today and while she and my step father were gone I went through the house finding whatever sweets and candy I could and threw it away in a fit of rage. Was that going too far or was it a nessicary step for my recovery? I've always been met with the point that I have no right to dictate what they can and cannot eat and that I didn't *have* to eat anything they brought home. But my logic is that that is like bringing a cooler of beer to a party hosted by a recovering alcoholic. everything I eat at the moment is provided by them and I don't really have a choice in the regard of my options. I have somewhat healthy things that I can eat but an overwhelming amount of the food in my home is just straight up sugary garbage (sometimes literally). I don't know how to fix this on going issue and I just did the first thing that came to mind. Was I wrong?
(Edit: my parents have been ignorant of my needs since I got into my teenage years and I sometimes think that mother is actively trying sabotage me into staying home longer. She won't help me in any way other than empty promises most of the time and when I ask to get help with getting a job so I could possibly buy my own food for myself which is what I have wanted, I get met with her changing the subject. I've also been denied medication and therapy for my depression which has cause me to go into a spiral with my mental health recently. I can't really help that I am reliant on them right now and I only turned 18 recently so I'm not really used to having any of my freedoms)"	Asshole	0	0	85.0	26.0	0.0	0.0

Yesterday I was helping out my aunt and uncle run a party for their daughter who just graduated high school. I was outside cleaning off the grill with my uncle when he got a phone call. He told me that he had to go pick something up and that he would be right back. He jumped on the brand new Harley-Davidson that he had just gotten a few days before and started to leave. A few moments later I heard him calling for me, and I saw that he was limping. It turns out that as he was trying to get out of the driveway, he hit a patch of mud, fell over, and the bike landed on top of his ankle. I helped him pick up the bike, pick the mud out of the bottom of it, and made it look like the fall didn't happen. He told me that my aunt couldn't find out because she went to worry too much and tell him to get rid of the bike. He explained to everyone that he slipped while running in the mud, and nobody was really the wiser.

Fast forward to today, 24 hours later. he has gone to the hospital and it turns out that he did actually break his leg near his ankle.

bz2n74	2019-06-10 20:09:30	its_the_green_che	AITA for complaining and not wanting to help out with my nephew	"I’m (17F) and out for the summer. I’m kind of an introvert and it’s known in my family. But I’ve wanted to make the summer going into my senior year count and make good memories. 

I also wanted to relax and spend time alone. Recently my older sister has gotten divorced and she’s switched from a part time job to a full time so she works during the morning. 

Every day.. Monday through Friday I have to wake up around 6ish am to start my day of caring for her child (2M). I take care of him from 6ish am to around 5 pm. Sometimes 6 pm.. depending on who come gets him and when. 

I think this is pretty unfair. I also wanted to get a job this summer to get some job experience but that plan was nipped in the bud. I love my nephew. And I don’t mind watching him occasionally. But I’m so tired of this. I’ve been doing this since I got out for the summer in May. 

I don’t want to do this anymore. And I’ve expressed it plenty of times but I get shut down every time by my parents because they say there’s no one else to do it. 

Apparently I’m an asshole for complaining and I get hit with the life isn’t fair. 

I’m not trying to be insensitive towards her and I know she’s having a hard time adjusting but fuck! 

I think I’m going to go crazy soon. My daily schedule consists of waking up at 6. Taking his clothes off. If he cries when he gets here I deal with it. I make his food and I feed him. And then I attempt to get him to go back to sleep. I change his diapers during these times and play with him. I make sure he goes outside at least a few times during the week. At some point he goes down for a nap and I continue to feed him. 

He can only eat finger food by himself. I’m not patient so I get frustrated having to feed him by hand. It takes so long. 

I also brush his teeth, wash his face, and do his hair. 

It sucks so much to be trapped with a toddler 5 days a week. At this point he’s seeing me more than he sees anyone else. I don’t have a child. I didn’t sign up for this. 

I just want to be irresponsible and sleep until 11 AM and play video games all day and chill with my friends. Maybe even work and make some money. I don’t want to be a mom. 

I’m a passive person. So dealing with tantrums and the crying is so hard. I keep getting told by the adults around me to be more sympathetic toward her and that this will pass. But no one has made any plans to send him to a daycare. 

So I’ve started complaining a lot and talking about how I want to do this in hopes of another arrangement being made but I get told to suck it up. 

Even before she got a divorce I’d get tricked into watching my nephew for hours. 

A lot of my friends work and the time that they have free is the time that I usually have to watch my nephew.

I (girl) have read thousands of aitas but never thought I would question this myself since I am usually have a good empathie and know when I fuck up something.
Till today.

My best friends (guy,) lives a 2 hours train ride 
away ( don't live in murica, is far away for me).
He knows me since nearly ten years and knows that I am struggling with depression since several years.
He never really was good at handling that. Always told me to just ""cheer up"" and see things positive. He also got to a point, where he was mad because I wasn't seeking help.
I am aware that I need some kind of therapy, but in my country this still has some stimga on it and it took me a while to finally contact one. I will start a therapy in July.

Soo now there is the fuck up. Sleeping somewhere else has become a huughe problem for me. I panic, feel uncomfortable and get really emotional.
So for my best friends birthday I wanted to visit him and sleep there for one night. I kind of wanted to challenge myself and didn't expect myself to go crazy.
But I did. In the middle of the train I felt trapped, because there was no chance to go home anymore which was frightening in my current state. So I wrote him I will drive back immediately after I met him at the train station.
I told him I was sorry, but I couldn't handle that right now.

When I arrived I was a wreck. I was crying and shaking and told him to give me a second to calm down.
I am aware that its his birthday, but I was hoping he would just let me have my 5 minutes.
But he got so mad at me, that I am making this about myself, I annoy him with that behaviour and why I could not just control myself for one day.
I tried to explain to him, that this is nothing I could just turn off. Also I don't like myself at that state of course. That's not who I am that's my sickness.
But he got even angrier, why it always has to be about me, I should seek help (he didn't believe me, that I found a therapist) and that I am a piece of shit. 
I tried to explain him several times, that I was feeling better and would like so spend the evening with him and his friends. But he just left the apartment with his friends, told me it was my decision of I still want to come and left. 
And of I left, because I had an ugly criing face and could not act like nothing happened while with his friends, and was really hurt by everything he has said to me. 

I am aware it's his birthday, but I would never ever say anything like that to an depressed person that just tried to do overcome a panic attack.

bz2lw3	2019-06-10 20:06:34	solidbedofcts	AITA for making a coworker cry?	"Hi all. 

I work for a big professional services firm. While I get along with everyone at my office, I am naturally an introvert so keep myself to myself and don't really get involved in the banter. 

There is a young lady at the office. Her name is Hailie and she is the assistant manager. She is 25, very talented and pretty, and we all know she has her eye on the managers job once our current manager Tara gets her promotion. 

Hailie took a disliking to me as soon as I joined the office. The fact is that I'm not only introverted but I'm also socially awkward and physically unattractive. She calls me a freak, says I'm probably plotting to blow up the building, says I've never been kissed (which is true, but I'm damned if I'll let her know that.) and tells people not to go near me as my ugliness is ''contagious''. She also somehow found out that I was gay and outed me to the whole office. I'm presuming it's from my instagram which was open at the time but idk. Everyone was very understanding but the point is that she shouldn't have taken that away from me. 

I get along with most of the older guys and girls in the office, but Hailie has a group of ladies who are around her age who absolutely hate my guts. The older folks keep insisting that I go talk to Tara, but the problem is that Hailie is higher up than me and also has more allies in the office. It will be more hassle to get rid of her than me, so if I grass her up I could be the one carrying my stuff out of the door. 

After the verbal abuse got worse over the last few weeks, I convinced my friends in the office to claim they had video recordings of her and her friends verbally abusing me. They didn't but it was enough to make Hailie paranoid. I then told her the videos were going to Tara. 

Hailie started crying and was begging me not to do it. In truth I felt a bit bad. I wanted to get her off my back, but I've never been the sort of person who enjoys making people break down in tears. I eventually relented and told her that there was no video, but she'd got herself into such as state that she left work early. 

I do think she deserved it, but I don't want to be that sort of person. I'm not sure if I should apologise to her tomorrow or?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bz2lde	2019-06-10 20:05:25		WIBTA For giving up on a relationship?	"Short prestory. For 3 years now I (m 29) are in a relationship with my gf (w 29). We know each other long before, but after my first deployment we came into contact again and started dating. It was a great loving, trusting and fun relationship so far. Both being strong characters there is some fighting from time to time but never serious. She went through a potentially dangerous heart sickness in the last 2 years but I always supported her and we made it through together. This january I returned from my second deployment and in that time she was wonderful. We talked a lot she sent awesome carepackages and stuff. When I returned I was the happiest man alive.

Now to the point. For the last 3 months I noticed that she somehow changed and wasn't as loving anymore. After a time I asked her about it and she said everything was fine. But it kept on. She distanced her from me and seemed not to enjoy my company. I of course tried to do positive things be better and nicer but I think I didn't improve anything I made it more awkward, also by asking a lot what was wrong.

3 weeks ago she waited at home for me crying. And told me that she was sorry that she acted weird in the last time because she wasn't sure if she wanted to be in a relationship, but she's sure now and everything is fine. Even though she doesn't seem the type of a cheater I asked if theres another man she said no.

This whole thing started a thought in me that I can't trust her anymore. And especially her going a spiritual way with meditation and stuff where she wants to be better to herself leads to her being mean to me. It seems she want to take more care about herself after her sickness but it feels like I am a huge disturbence to her “new“ lifestyle. Before she always talked about marriage and kids and lately she doesn't want that anymore. On some days shes still the loving person I love, but on most she cares more about herself then our relationship.

Will I be the asshole for not believing in the relationship anymore and splitting up just not to get hurt one day when she realizes that I don't fit to her anymore? Or am I just a blind dude who doesn't understand whats going on?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bz2i6f	2019-06-10 19:58:30	heyitsjakc	AITA for feeling aggravated that my mom calls me “son” when I told her I was considering transitioning (among other things)?	"This might be a long one so bear with me.

Basically, since I’ve started college and continuing until present day, I have slowly stopped identifying as a man and considered the possibility of being a trans woman. This is parallel to me developing severe depression and anxiety over the same time period— this factors into my mom’s treatment of me in general.

I kept my gender exploration a secret from my family, but told my friends who I trusted. I had kept my coming out as a gay man in high school a secret, and my parents found issue with that and ultimately dragged me out of the closet without my consent. We’ve established it wasn’t the best method but my mom says she had good reason to.

This time, I came out to her (accidentally) in the car, and she criticized the way I came out to her because I wasn’t saying things concisely, that I wasn’t being clear, and that talking about feeling weird in my body with friends who didn’t know was selfish and a shitty thing to do. The last point she mentioned didn’t had anything to do with my gender, I was being honest about my body in general— but I can see her point.

The main takeaway from her was that she’d support me, but that I didn’t HAVE to come out to her because I would be making it a Thing and a Big Deal when it didn’t need to be— she hates labels of all kinds and is one of those “why can’t we just be humans” folks. 

She then told my dad without asking me (he didn’t say anything, he’s libertarian and a fan of the “it’s none of my business unless you wanna talk about it” approach), has made it known to me that she doesn’t think I’m really questioning my gender but uncomfortable about my weight, that I don’t need to convince her that I’m really feeling either genderfluid or non-binary or trans. She also made it a point when I sneezed yesterday to say “Bless you, SON.” She never asked for my pronouns and placed that burden on me, but it still seems like a deliberate choice because she’s never used “son” in that way for me or my brother before.

I’m now out to my whole family, and I’m considering bringing up pronouns, because she/her makes me more comfortable. At the same time, I know she’s gonna mention how she still isn’t convinced cuz I never said anything during childhood about wanting to be a girl (even though I didn’t know you could even be gay until mid-high school, so how would I know about being trans???), and other things of that nature.

Am I being too sensitive and an Asshole for feeling this way? I haven’t said anything to her about it yet because this has all happened in the past week and I’m still dealing with her attitude about queer things in general."	Not the A-hole	0	0	102.0	42.0	0.0	0.0
bz2i25	2019-06-10 19:58:14	JustABabyEngineer	AITA for refusing to refund a girl who bought the wrong textbook from me	"So the title sums up the situation pretty well, I'm a university student and was selling some old textbooks on a textbook exchange fb group. This person buys one of them for 50$ and we both go on our merry ways.

&#x200B;

She then messages me a few days later saying that the one I sold her wasn't the version she needed for her class and asking if I could take it back and refund her. That's where I was in a difficult situation because I had already used that money to buy myself a textbook for my current course and as a student I'm obviously not rolling on stacks of cash.

&#x200B;

I ended up refusing to refund her because my reasoning is that she is just as capable as me of selling it to someone who needs it on the same fb group from which she bought it. I also didn't mislead her in any way, there was a picture of the cover of the textbook in my ad, she just neglected to check which specific textbook she needed for her class.

To be admitted to the exam you are supposed to have a minimum grade average (60%) in each of the 8-9 subjects that are taught in the kind of high school you are in. If you are below the 60% line, all of your professors meet to decide whether or not to admit you nonetheless to the exam. This happens shortly after the last day of class (4 days ago) and usually if you are not to be admitted you'll receive a call home from school to tell you the bad news.   
Not being admitted to the exam means that you have to retake the entire last year again.

I (23/m) have a brother (18) who's been ""waiting"" for the call from school for the past 4 days. He has been quickly picking up the landline phone every time someone calls, worried that it could be the school. He has not one but two subjects below the 60% line, hasn't been studying seriously the entire year browsing internet, Youtube and Netflix all the time. Even if he is admitted to the exam he risks not passing it because once again he's not studying for it. 

Today my brother was still sleeping at 10:00 am. I tried to wake him up half an hour before and he went back to sleep, so I called the landline from my cellphone to get him out of bed. He woke up, replied and I said, ""Go study dumbass"".

bz2euv	2019-06-10 19:50:43	AcidicFuqtard	AITA for bringing up my friends weight?	"TL;DR at bottom

So I've been friends with this girl since high school (about 8 years) and both of us have always been on the bigger side. Our weight has always been close to the same amount lb wise, but with totally different primary weight distribution areas. Her shape is more 'pear/apple' and mine more 'overstuffed hourglass' both of us are incredibly insecure of our problem areas and have talked in length about fixing them.

Since high school, both of us have married and have put on quite a bit of ""happy relationship weight"". After a few years of me developing a problematic belly pudge, I'm done with it. My husband and I have been dieting and working out along with our already physically demanding jobs over the last couple months and it's been going okay.

My friend (who I will now call M) and I have talked about working out and dieting for awhile now. We live an and hour+ away from each other, so it would just be holding each other accountable via food updates and workout plans. When I mentioned to M that my husband and I are trying to improve our general health and adopt a new lifestyle, she seemed supportive and interested in what changes we're making, again talking about how she wants to lose weight.

M's husband wants to work out with mine and have a good bromantic workout routine when we all get together. I thought I would extend the offer to M (since she always talks about losing weight) and I can tell I offended her. Last time I hung out with M I offered to cook a nice healthy meal for lunch (I LOVE to cook) and she told me all my ideas were gross and she didn't like the vegetables/sides I suggested and wanted frozen pizza or something instead. 

Later that night I told her I wanted to take my dogs for a long walk since it was so nice out. She didn't want to go for a walk since it's hard for her to go up and down inclines (I live in a hilly area), so I ended up just letting them outside long enough for them to potty and for her to have a smoke. 

I love M to death and she is absolutely one of my best friends but I am legitimately worried for her future. She's to the point of having major limitations due to her weight. She can't sit in booths at restaurants, she uses the handicap bathroom to fit better, she can only sit on high furniture because if it's too low she needs help up, etc. 

I don't wanna be an asshole and make her feel bad about her weight, but I feel like a bad friend if I don't offer to help. She constantly talks about weight loss and how she would do better with a workout buddy but her exact words when I offered was ""I come see you to hang out, not work out.""

AITA for bringing it up?

EDIT: I don't bring it up all the time, just when it's appropriate. Like when we're looking for food options, or it's a gym day and I'm really tired, etc.

EDIT 2: Want to establish again. I'm fat. I've been fat. I'm openly fat. People need to realize I'm not a judgement health nut lol

But when we were chatting about guests she gave me a list of family I was expected to invite. She wants me to invite my dads sisters and their children along with her sisters and children. 

My plan was to invite dads sisters but not their (grown) children as I haven’t seen them in about 15 years. 

There’s no animosity but I’ve moved away so don’t see them. But I do see my mums sisters and their (also grown kids). No hard feelings with anyone just the way things have worked out and I probably have more in common with my mums family. 

My mum has basically said if I don’t invite cousins on my dads side, I can’t invite cousins on my mums side. She has offered to pay the extra for the people she wants me to invite but for me it’s not about the money l, more that I only want people I’m close to my wedding. 

Am I the asshole for only wanting to invite people I know and see? Or should I just let it go as it won’t really be a big deal because it won’t cost us any extra.

Edit: my parents are planning on contributing but not paying for the whole thing. Roughly £5000 towards a £25-30000 wedding. If this makes any difference

I’m a part of this decently large friend group at college and we all went our separate ways over the summer. We still keep in touch all the time through a group chat. This one guy (I’ll call him Daniel) in the group chat has been acting out very frequently and being pretty rude to my other friends. He once acted needlessly accusatory to a friend who is a trans man that is scared to come out to his parents and that was just a fucking mess. Daniel was very challenging towards this friend and basically accused him of hoping that his parents find out on their own. He basically oversimplified the situation and tried to intrude into a situation that is a lot more complicated than he knows. He basically continued like this for a bit, being relatively aggravating in the group chat consistently. Throughout this, I talked to another friend in the group chat who he has been pretty consistently rude to in the past about the way Daniel has handled himself. One day recently, a friend posted a picture of her pet rats in the group chat just because they’re cute and she likes showing them off. Daniel, who had just complained about something unrelated before she posted the pic, was like,”What is that supposed to do for me?”. He really just acted like an asshole and he and another friend tried to explain it away by saying that it was just banter. Unfortunately, the girl he was rude towards didn’t exactly see it that way. So a few hours later, I get added to this different group chat with a couple other friends where he basically talks about he had a rough childhood and is tired of people judging him for acting rude to other friends without taking that into acct. He literally said,”Everyone just says Daniel is an asshole without asking why Daniel is such an asshole”. Everyone else in the group chat seemed sympathetic and acted understanding. I just couldn’t really get my head around it because it just seemed really lame and kind of a cop-out. From what I’ve seen, idk that he ever even apologized for any of the shit he did.

bz2a4u	2019-06-10 19:39:46	vintagetimetable	AITA for finding my friend's comments racist?	"I am a 15 year old Indian girl, and one of my best friends is Italian-American, and the same age. We both go to an international school in a different country, so all my friends are of a different ethnicity- but we all have American accents and speak fluent English.

&#x200B;

She makes comments that rub me the wrong way- she is very patriotic and proud of her Italian heritage, which is fine with me. But she keeps putting down my Indian heritage, shuts me down everytime I want to talk about my own roots. During an overnight camping trip, neither of us could sleep so we began to talk about our futures. I said I want to give my future daughter an Indian name- she grimaced and said 'Don't give your kid an Indian name, Indian kids get bullied.'  Later, I mentioned that she should visit India sometime because the food is good. She told me 'I would never want to visit India... I would be attacked.' Now, I understand where she is coming from (the media portrays India as unsafe, and i Imagine is worse for white girls) but it was rude.

&#x200B;

Her parents are so sweet and love hearing about my heritage, and they always invite me over to their house, feed me delicious Italian food and ask me about my roots. I love talking to them. But when I invite my friend to my house, she asks me if we 'have toilet paper' or 'have cleaned the house recently'. My mom is a neat-freak. She goes on to comment on the food- 'I don't like the smell of Indian food. It's too spicy for me.' She can have preferences, but she  doesn't even try.

&#x200B;

Another time, this white guy was hitting on me. He kept asking if I wanted to kiss him, show him my breasts and have sex with him. I told her, and she said 'um... I think you're taking it the wrong way. I don't think (guy) is into Indians... he likes white girls.' Now, I'm not going to lie, but I got prettttyyyy mad. I'm honestly quite pretty. It took me a while to find confidence in my tan skin, dark hair, the fact that my cheeks aren't rosey. But my facial features and body are quite beautiful, and I put on makeup very well and make good fashion choices. A lot of guys have fallen for me. My friend is, honestly, not that conventionally attractive (overweight, doesn't brush her teeth/shower often) but I don't comment or treat her any differently. She always makes comments that insinuate that I'm not 'good enough' to date white guys.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My friends say she doesn't know better. But I think that's BS-we've both been to international schools our whole lives, and I've never once been racist. But she openly disses my country. I spoke to her, saying her comments hurt me, but she started to cry and told me that she 'is only 15, she faces racism too.' I don't want to be presumptuous, but she has blonde hair, white skin, green eyes... she probably faces a lot of racism but not to the same extent I do. People literally call me 'Apu' in front of her.

So my bf’s dad is very religious and it’s been said from the beginning not to cuss around him so I don’t. This was said since cussing is in my regular vocabulary. My bf and his family all cuss except his dad so it’s usually said when he’s not around or where he can’t hear it. Yesterday I called my mom to ask a question and she wanted to stay on the phone talking for a long period of time. I ended up putting her on speaker for awhile so I could move around and eat some snack. It was a two and a half hour phone call so I got really hungry. I’m not sure if I cussed or if my mom did, but whoever cussed I didn’t notice since we both do it regularly. I was upstairs when this happened in our bedroom with the door closed. When the call ended my bf got angry at me and I pretty much got in trouble for cussing because his dad heard some of the words downstairs. We had a little argument because he was angry and being pretty rude about it and I said that his reaction wasn’t really fair to me since I took precautions to my phone conversation and I’m always respectful to not cuss around his father, that at that point I couldn’t have known or done much if he heard a few words he didn’t like through the vents during my PRIVATE conversation in another part of the house. This isn’t the first time my bf has scolded and lectured me for not basically whispering when I say a cuss word when his dad isn’t around and not the first time his parents have eavesdropped which has driven a big wedge between us as one of the big arguments we’ve had more than once, especially his parents eavesdropping on our arguments as well. I just really want to know if I’m the asshole here because I did take offense to the fact that I try my hardest to be respectful, but when my privacy and my space are being overridden constantly like this, I feel like I’m not even allowed to be myself and it did make me feel a bit emotional.

"So, some friends and I have wanted to take a trip to the beach since December, and we finalized plans for a trip from the 16th to the 19th of this month. My mom has known about this for a while and she gave me permission to go back in May.

When I asked for permission to go, I also asked if I’d be able to stay with one of my friends who’s also going on the trip, let’s call her Kate, on the 15th. My mom approved this and Kate told me that she’d pick me up early on the 15th so we could go have some fun since we haven’t seen each other for almost a month.

Yesterday, my mother told me that my family has been invited to a wedding on the 15th, and she cannot let me stay with Kate because she needs me to take care of my little brother, who is nine months old, for that night. I got upset because as I’ve mentioned, preparations for Kate’s and I’s plans on the 15th have already been made. Kate’s mother has bought tickets for us to go to the movie theater and Kate’s dad has spent hours cleaning out the hot tub for us to use. Even Kate’s sister has made plans to have a sleepover with a friend so we’d have the house to ourselves.

My mother and I argued for a while and she told me that she never gets free time anymore and the wedding is one of her only chances to take a break. She has two days off a week and since I have been home from boarding school, I’ve helped her with cooking and cleaning the house and taking care of the family dog.

Even though I had to give up some things in order to help out my mother, I don’t mind because I like spending time with my brother and I’m pretty reclusive anyway. I feel like since plans have already been made and there are ways to still go to the wedding and have a good time that she should let me go on the 15th.  She doesn’t even know the people who are getting married, she just knows one of the aunts of the bride, so it’s not like she’s particularly invested in the wedding. I feel bad cancelling on Kate after her and her family have already shifted things around for us, but I don’t like getting upset with my mother either. I cancelled on Kate and told my mother that I’m tired of her switching things up on me last second and she said that she had no idea about my plans with Kate on the 15th, even though I’ve told her numerous times and she gave me permission earlier on. She then continued acting like she was going to let me go by saying things with an attitude that clearly showed she was upset and she said that her friend has already agreed to take care of my brother for the night, even though she previously said that that friend was unavailable.

We got into another argument after she said that and I was pretty rude to her and now she’s skirting around me and not talking to me. I feel bad, but I also feel like me not wanting to cancel is justified since my plans were made almost a month in advance, so AITA?

Edit: I feel like I should clear up the fact that I’m still going for the four day beach trip, but I will no longer be seeing Kate on the 15th, per my mom."	Not the A-hole	0	0	11.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

And I don't necessarily blame them, most days there is literally no work for me so I either have to search for rainy day projects (aka M-F) or find a way to entertain myself. I've been job hunting for several months now. 

Last week, the attorney I support had me draft a response to a discovery request and go through the production all by myself while he went golfing. So here I am, choosing which photos to use, trying to understand easement agreements and figure out what to do with tax documents ALL BY MYSELF. He honestly expected me to submit it WITHOUT HIM LOOKING AT IT. Folks, I am not a paralegal, I'm a secretary.  Another attorney had to call opposing counsel and ask for an extension. 

Today I had a second interview with another firm.  At both this and the first interview, the new firm suggested they wanted me to start sooner than 2 weeks and maybe I don't need to give that much notice (no pressure, just conversationally).  It's making me feel super confident in my chances and frankly, I really want out asap.

Thing is I have pretty bad anxiety. I can't even go to family gatherings without it acting up. And it only happens if theres a LOT of people. And at this grad party a bunch of family members will be there along with some on my friends. Now im all for a small get together. Maybe my close family going out to eat for one and then going out with friends for the next day or something. 

Now let me say that by bad anxiety I tend to just compltely shut down a few hours (like 2 maybe 3 hours) into family events or big parties. And a few times I've ended up with panic attacks. I love my family and friends but I just can't handle big groups and loud enviroments (im working on it with a therapist). When I told my mom im not interested in this idea she got angry with me and said no matter what she's doing it and I'm gonna have to attend.

My wonderful mother is there every single day and in the last few monthd has started to neglect her own health and her house because of it. On my days off i will go out to her house and usually cook her meals for the week that she can reheat and do some general house cleaning for her, including her laundry, so she can relax. Fast forward to this weekend my girlfriend is at her best friends bachelorette party and everyone is coming in from out of town. They rented a cottage for a few nights starting Saturday, so friday when they got into town i offered to let them all stay at my apartment for the night. 

Now geneally we all get along and get togethers are always very chill and lots of fun. Everyone arrives while i was at work and my girlfriend let them into my apartment (she was given a key for this and does not live there with me) and all is going smoothly. They start getting ready to go out to the bars and i just finished a 12 hour shift so i told them i was going to bed, have fun, and to try and keep it down when they got back as i was getting up early saturday to go out to my mom's.

While they were getting ready i could hear them chit chatting and my girlfriend mentions how i cook and clean for my mom and how i even do her laundry. Instantly they all start calling me a creep and a pervert for wanting to touch my moms underwear and how inappropriate that is, how she should be so lazy and shouldnt rely on her adult son to do that for her. My girlfriends frantically trying to explain the situation and well i got up and ripped into them about what they said, we argue back and forth for a bit and eventually ive had enough. I tell them if they can't respect me in my own home over something like laundry they should find somewhere else to go tonight.

I go back to my room after taking my key back and telling them the door will be locked and to find a hotel. Sure enough at 3am they are pounding on my door, i ignore them and go back to bed.

bz247y	2019-06-10 19:26:05		AITA: My sister is pregnant, financially unstable, single and my family doesn’t want to face the reality of the situation and gets pissed at me when I try to bring it up.	"So my sister has never been able to organize or manage her finances that well because of mental health and a learning disability. She was dating a guy for like three months, they moved in together after two weeks and after two months of dating she was pregnant “by accident”. I say it that way because a month into their relationship she told me she had a pregnancy scare and then she was actually pregnant a bit later. She is very excited to be a mom. Here’s the thing, I think that she should have gotten an abortion(we’re in Canada) or should give the kid up for adoption because I do not think she can take care of a child. My sister cannot cook, cannot clean, she can’t even remember to do her own laundry until she needs clean clothes. She’s been this way our whole lives(she’s early twenties) and she cannot seem to figure it out. Also because of her mental health issues she’s prone to just break out crying if you say things to her, like even if your being just sarcastic it can make her cry. For all of these reasons(and the fact that her ex who got her pregnant is in a lot of debt and is a liar and deadbeat) I don’t think she’ll be a good mother and I think she should prioritize the kid and not what she wants. My parents don’t make a lot of money, we aren’t like really down on hard times but like they haven’t been able to help me with school at all and I’m relying on osap to be able to go. They told me that this year they would be able to send me 100 dollars a month to help me out because my dad got a raise so I don’t have to work as hard because I got sick last year from overworking myself. But now that my sister is pregnant all anyone talks about is the baby, my mom is buying stuff to decorate the baby’s room and hasn’t even started to buy the actual stuff she needs like a crib and bottles. Basically everything they said they would help me with they haven’t and I’ve had to purchase on my own while they are buying things I view as frivolous and unnecessary. Basically am I the asshole for being upset at them going back on their word to me? They do it a lot when my sister fucks up and they “appreciate that I never ask for anything” but it’s getting to a point now that I’m beginning to resent them all. Am I the asshole for trying to make them see the reality of the situation while not feeding into the “I’m gonna be an aunt!” hype? ( My dad agrees with me on a lot of this stuff but won’t say anything or isn’t told a lot)
Tldr; my sister is pregnant and unprepared, I think she will be a bad mother from her past life choices and my family is getting mad at me for not being excited and pointing out the flaws in what they’re doing."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Eight weeks later all the kittens have homes, but I've been struggling to find a home for momma. It wasn't a real big deal until the momma cat went after our cat with my step daughters in the middle, unprovoked. That's when momma kitty was moved outside. I fed her last night and shes been staying by the trailer. No big deal. Until the crazy cat lady knocks on my door, when she knows Im usually asleep at that time of morning. I open the door, and in jumps momma kitty out of ladyies arms, whos just spazing out about poor kitty. I explained what happend. Why she needs to be outside until I can get her a home, and so on. I made it real clear I was still claiming responsibility for this cat. She leaves, I feel we're all good, try to go back to sleep. About a half an hour later she's pounding on my door. She wants to leave cat food on my outside table or under it some place and she's bawling.  Mama cat is back in my trailer the second the door opened, and heads straight after my cat. I loose my patience at this point. No, I don't want cat food outside the trailer, to draw all the Toms over to beat my cat up. I tell her this and she starts crying harder and says she just doesn't no what to do and is waving and flailing. I'm not standardly a people person as it is, but i'm now sleep deprived and know I have to seperate a cat fight in my trailer again. I took the plate of food she was holding in my face, loudly stated that she should do nothing as it wasn't her problem and I slammed my door. AITAH about all of this?

As I am literally almost a foot away from the back tire making my way around, he abruptly moves his car backwards and waves at me to move around the front, which I do

He then proceeds to try to get out of my way even more, and smashes right into the car that was waiting behind him

I just kept walking because I was getting soaked, but I felt bad when I got home

Should I have stayed? Would me being there have helped the guy in anyway or is he pretty much completely at fault from reversing into a car because he didn't look behind him first?

"few days ago I had Maths first period, so I walked down the corridor and as usual, the tecaher was late so we walked in and got our things out. 5 minutes in and we are just thinking she was late. 15 minutes in and we were concerned. For the whole 50 minutes we didn't leave the classroom, because she never turned up. And we just went about our day as usual

During lunch she spotted me and my friend and asked us about it, we thought she would be apologetic for wasting our time. But she essentially blamed us (the class not just me and my friend) for her not turning up, she asks us why we bever went to an office or went looking for her. So we went and told people what she said and no-one was happy. 

Fast-forward to today and we have maths, she actually shows up this time and starts the lesson off the regular way, asks us to sit down and that we will be going through the exam (we had just done all our summer exams). But then she atarts berating us for HER not showing up. She singles out someone who was smirking (I had just told them a joke) and did the whole thing about 'do you think this is funny? I don't...' and she says that she is utterly disappointed in all of us and (worst of all) she made it personal. 

She said something along the lines of,""Is this the kind of people you are? You see someone being bullied and you just stand there? Allowing it to continue?"". So everyone was mad at her about that. And (as a cherry on top) she is writing our reports this week so we are all going to get destroyed in them.

I just wanted other people's opinion on this, I understand her side but expecting us to go looking for her when she didn't arrive or send for a cover teacher. She didn't even explain why she didn't turn up. If my entire class hadn't turned up, would i expect her to look for us? No, of course not, because it would be our fault for not turning up. She also said we were 'lucky' because we were ahead of the other classes and could afford to lose a lesson.

I'm super close with my sister M. When she found out she was pregnant, she invited me and my mom (and her husband J of course) to the ultrasound. I was obviously incredibly excited. But, when we were there, the doctor pulled M and J aside to speak privately. Later, M told me that the doctor had noted atypical sex characteristics and that there was a good possibility of the baby being intersex. She also told me that the doctor could use tests to help see which gender the baby was more likely to identify with as they got older, and she was planning to raise the baby as that gender and was maybe even considering surgery. However, because it's still pretty early on, they weren't 100% sure and needed more tests.

I was supportive, and I told her in the end it was her prerogative, but she should absolutely not do that. I'm not intersex, but I'm a very active member of the LGBTQIA+ community (bi, if anyone's curious), and I've met one or two individuals who very strongly identify as intersex and are extremely glad they did not have surgery when they were younger. I told M she should not ever do surgery (unless her grown kid wants it) and raise her child in a way that allows THEM to decide the binary gender they wish to identify with (if any).

M got super angry and basically stormed out of the room. I guess M must have told J, because after he called me and yelled at me, telling me I wasn't a doctor or therapist, and anyway, it wasn't any of my business.

I'm super hurt because I was just trying to be helpful and do what's best for the baby, but M and J seem convinced I'm TA. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So for some background, my brother and I are both teenagers, of course. Since I am a transgender male (FtM), my mother has sort of subconsciously treated me like the daughter of the family probably because she's not quite used to my identity change. This means that she treats me differently and is more strict with me.

My mom found out I've been having a secret relationship with a girl which wasn't a toxic one or anything, no nudes or sneaking out of the house or whatever. She got angry though, and we had an argument about that. I said that I thought she was treating me differently than my brother, because it's a known fact that he has girlfriends that he doesn't tell us about and keeps secret. My mom knows he does this but just acts like it's funny or whatever.

Anyway, I used this example in the argument and it didn't help much. My mom and I argue a lot though and I'm moving out for college soon anyway so it's not a huge deal, but I'm kind of wondering if I was the asshole for dragging my brother into a conversation and turning the subject around to him when I was initially the one in trouble, not him."

"A couple years ago I made friends with a guy and a girl who we'll call Sarah and Dan. We grew to be fairly good friends. We're all adults in our mid 20s and when we get together we get really into talking about our relationships.

It just so happens that Dan is gay, and he liked to actively participate in giving out advice when Sarah and I had relationship issues, and we could do the same for him. But after a while I noticed that he never actually gave me any advice when I had problems with my romantic relationships. When Sarah wanted to talk about her problems he was helpful and gave sound advice, but whenever I was seeking the same, his advice began and ended with ""you should dump your boyfriend and switch to girls.""

I thought it was a joke the first time but he kept saying it every time I went looking for advice from my friends. He never gave that advice to Sarah when she was having guy problems (even though she's bisexual and that advice would be more applicable to her, although I personally think it's a rude thing to say to anyone). I'm straight, and I have never implied otherwise. I've never even been bi-curious. For me, personally, the idea of myself being with a woman romantically makes me uncomfortable and I told that to Dan several times and asked him to stop. He said he would try. 

He didn't stop.  I started skipping meeting up with Dan and Sarah because his comments continued to make me uncomfortable, but several days ago I decided to meet them for brunch and we started talking romantic relationships. I was supportive as he described a few problems with his current boyfriend and Sarah and I offered a few suggestions to how he could solve those problems; overall it was a good chat.

I'm finally in a committed relationship with a man I adore and I was very excited to share my excitement about it. Along the way I mentioned just a couple pet peeves I had with my boyfriend (that aren't even a big issue) and Dan said it again. ""Well, time for you to dump him and switch to girls!""

I just snapped. I raised my voice (not quite a yell, but louder than usual) and asked, ""Dan, why don't *you* switch to girls?""

He acted like I slapped him. Started crying and demanding to know why I'd ever say something so horrible to him, then he grabbed his stuff and stormed out. Sarah told me how disgusted she was by me and also stormed out. (Side note: that left me to pay the entire bill for brunch when we agreed beforehand we were all only paying for ourselves, so that was awesome /s.)

A few days ago I got a text from Sarah that said she talked to Dan and both of them are disgusted by my behavior and have decided they can't interact with such a ""hateful, homophobic bitch"" anymore and both will be blocking my number and blocking me on all forms of social media.

I still feel pretty justified in what I said but it's started eating at me, especially because it made two different people decide I'm horrible enough to cease contact with altogether. AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	82.0	9.0	0.0	0.0

However, 6 years ago or so he married this woman who has to be one of the most racist people I have ever met. My sister has a mixed-race daughter, and that has always bothered her. My other sister's stepdaughter is dating an African-American, and she doesnt acknowledge him at family gatherings. If we watch MMA, she invariably roots for the white guy and mumbles slurs. She has choice names for the NBA. When we visit, we invariably have to tell our children after we leave that she is ignorant and that isn't how a person should act. 

I would understand people saying we should confront her about it, but it's been done. A few years ago, there was a commercial in the Super Bowl where they sang 'America The Beautiful' in a lot of different languages, and she freaked out. Absolutely freaked out. It was the final straw for me, and I blasted her about what I thought of her as a person, her intelligence, her propensity to post inspirational memes, how she acted as my father's wife, all of it. It nearly destroyed my father's and my relationship. He's 65, he comes from a family with heart problems and things that bring about a reduced life expectancy,  so I dont want to not speak to him for years and then miss that time. He's my Dad, I love him, and he knows she pisses all of us off.

Fast-forward to now: my 17 year old son has started talking to a girl he works with, and they're going on a date. She has a name that sounds ethnic, and possibly Latino. We wouldn't care what her background is, because my son always has good taste, and as long as she is a good person, we dont care. She is white, though, which is important to the story.

Yesterday, at a family gathering, my Dad asked her name, and when my son told him, his wife immediately asked what her last name was. I knew what she was getting at, and I dont like her motives, so I said 'Rodriguez, I think. Or Fernandez.' My whole intention, mature or not, was to irritate her, because i cant stand bigotry. 

My wife shot me a look, and immediately stopped me from going any further. Later, she asked again what her last name was, and I said ""It might be Hernandez or something.""

Reason 1: My little sisters boyfriend (B) recently adopted two cats. They broke up so my sister stole them.

Reason 2: Little sister and B are now both in a psychiatric hospital and we don’t know when they will get out. It could be a week it could be a month. This is what worries me that I’m the asshole.

Reason 3: The cats currently live in one room with poor ventilation. Yes the litter box is in there and it reeks of ammonia

Reason 4: My mom is terrified of cats. She doesn’t want a cat, we already have two dogs (not cat friendly) hence them staying in a single poorly ventilated room (sisters room)

Reason 5: Me and my boyfriend are insanely allergic to cats so I can’t take them in. I live in another state as well.

Although we have good reasons my sister is mentally ill. She has stated that those cats are her only reason for living. She only came to live at home again recently after her and her boyfriend were air bnb hopping and ran out of funds.

bz1wsy	2019-06-10 19:09:26	CummyCummyCummy	AITA for not helping my friend during her anxiety attack when I was very high?	"I love my friend with all my heart. She's been through alot of really horrible situations which I won't go into detail about, but she has to deal with alot of issues with PTSD/extreme anxiety pertaining to those situations. Normally when this happens; I'd drop everything I was doing and go help her out.

However, last night I accidentally got EXTREMELY high and was having a bad trip. I got into my head and was freaking out in my room for 2 hours listening to music and trying to calm down to the best of my ability, but I spent most of the night very tense and anxious to the point where I was pacing my room for half an hour trying to maintain control.

My friend calls me in the middle of this freakout (around 11pm) and says that she's having an anxiety attack and needs to see me in person immediately and that she'd drive over. I tell her about my current situation and say that I'd be willing to talk but that I'm really out of it and might not be able to help her very much because I was in a bad place myself.

I don't recall everything that was said but she basically spent five minutes saying that she's always been here for me no matter what and that it was inconsiderate that I wasn't willing to help her even when I was having a bad trip. I tried to explain my situation and she kinda just shut down and texted me a long message saying that she recognized that she was emotional but that she was still upset with me that I wasn't willing to help her. I tried to tell her that I was willing to help but that I wasn't sure my help would be all that great.

On one hand, I feel bad because she's one of my best friends and I feel like I brushed her off. On the other, I'm annoyed that she got upset with me when I told her I wasn't able to help her, like I was expected to have 100% empathy for her situation but not the other way around.

tl;dr: Friend is upset with me for not helping her through an anxiety attack when I was having a very bad trip.

She’s always had a weird “friend” thing with this guy and just recently he’s gotten a girlfriend. Anyway, when we got home she said “do you feel better about me hanging out with him now that he has a girlfriend?”

I was caught completely off guard by this and tried to keep the peace since we were both tipsy. Anyway, I’ve confronted her again about this explaining how it made me question her feelings towards him and us all together. She’s now told me how “deeply hurt she is” and “upset that I would question that” yet she’s the one who brought this whole situation up.

bz1s9z	2019-06-10 18:59:35	onebigjacobite	"AITA for being ""too"" honest about why I rejected a guy?"	"I'm gonna start this with two disclaimers: I've never used reddit before but I've heard this one is a good place to get opinions from strangers, so I figured what the hell. Also, I honestly feel like I'm going crazy with this situation because I really can't see how I'm in the wrong but so many people are telling me that I am that I feel like I must be somehow. 

Recently I  (21M) was introduced to a friend of a friend (19M). I'm gay and so is he. He's pretty cute I guess but in a very traditional blonde hair blue eyes clean cut kind of way, whereas I tend to prefer the more rough around the edges kinda gothy metalhead type. Still, when this guy told our mutual friend he was interested in me I was flattered and agreed to a date. 

On the date it became clear to me pretty quickly that we just weren't compatible. He's very ~~flamboyant, for want of a better word~~ since apparently the word flamboyant is inherently bad, I'll edit this to say dramatic. Just super loud, almost obnoxiously so, refers to everyone as ""queen"" or ""girlfriend"" or ""sister"", that kind of thing. He also went on a lengthy rant about how homophobic his old manager was and saying that he got fired ""basically just for being gay"", when I later found out he actually got fired for turning up baked to work too many times. He also kept calling me daddy, which made me a bit uncomfortable but he did stop when I asked him to. Overall, he seemed a nice enough person and he was certainly very sweet and complimentary to me all evening, we just have totally different personalities and I know from past experiences that dating guys like him doesn't work out for me.

The day after the date, I sent him a text thanking him for a nice time but saying I didn't see a future for us as a couple but I could definitely see us being friends. He immediately got upset and kept asking me why. I originally tried to shrug it off with the usual ""I'm just not ready for a relationship rn"" but he wasn't having it and kept asking. Eventually I told him basically what I said above. He got really shirty then, saying that he's sorry that he's ""too gay"" or ""the wrong kind of gay"" for me and that he hopes that I can work through my ""internalised homophobia"". A bunch of our mutual friends are telling me I'm a tosser for not letting him down gently, and also accusing me of internalised homophobia. I'm just baffled at what I did wrong here tbh. Am I a colossal dickhead and just too dumb to see it or have my friends just lost their goddamn minds??

EDIT: since a lot of people are asking here's the text about our personalities not working out copy and pasted: 

Honestly, i just dont feel like we'd work personality wise. you seem really nice and you're fit, I'm sure there's some lucky lad out there for you but tbh i just don't think he's me. as i said i think we could be really good mates, but your personality is just so big and full on and i just dk if i can forsee myself being in a relationship with a personality like yours long term, as I've more of a toned down vibe (sure you noticed haha). have you ever met (friends name omitted for privacy)? you might have more luck with him."

bz1ro1	2019-06-10 18:58:11	preggoeggo95	AITA for telling my mom she's overreacting over one weekend of not calling her?	"My husband is currently in the Army and I just found out that he's going to be having back surgery pretty soon. It's been a pretty hard situation since he couldn't pass boot camp over a leg injury and he's currently in a program that is rehabilitating him. I only get to talk to him 3 times a week for ten minutes at a time so the communication part sucks too. Plus, I'm 7 mos pregnant, full time school, so I'm stressed and emotional.

My mom knows this about my husband and I called her on Thursday to let her know about my husband having to get surgery. We had plans for dinner the next day but I did  not feel up to it due to the news. She said okay and the call ended.

Friday she calls me but I was pretty depressed the whole day so I kinda just let the call go to voicemail. I did not want to talk.

Saturday I had to volunteer and when I came home, I just slept and moped around.

Sunday, I woke up pretty late and went with my in laws to their family's house since the power went out. We were there until 9 pm. She called me at 5ish pm but I told her I'd call her later which I did. I got home and called her at 10 pm and she didn't pick up.

I thought, okay, I'll call her tomorrow after I hear from my husband.

Today, she called me during class and when I didn't pick up, she left a passive aggressive text about how I should be calling her once a week at least. I told her I called her the night before and she said that she was giving up on communicating with me.

Now, my mom and I communicate pretty regularly like 1 or maybe 2 times a week on the phone and hang out in person too. Last time I saw her in person was last Sunday when she came over for dinner with the in laws. Maybe the past week or so I've been more withdrawn but I've been very stressed with everything going on.

I've told her before that she overreacts and tends to act on her emotions a lot. She gets very offended if I don't call for a few days.

So I basically told her that she was overreacting and that we've talked about her tendency to do this. I called her self-centered and reminded her that I'm going through a shit time right now so I haven't been the best at communicating.

Now I'm 17 ( which means she'd be like 18-19 ) and recently my dad was out somewhere and ended up running into her and giving her my number despite the fact that he's not even really close friends with her dad anymore and I haven't spoken to her since I was like 10 

She almost immediately began texting me and after like a ten minute conversation she was already asking me if I'd like to hang out, if I had a car, etc... so after awhile I told her that I wasn't free to hang out anytime soon and that was the end of it for a time but then a few days later she's back to it and after awhile I just stopped responding

This all happened about a month ago and I'm still receiving texts from her occasionally, almost all of which are just asking me why I'm not responding and or something like ""DUDE"" 

I feel like I couldn't be sending the message any stronger than I already am without just outright telling her that I have no interest in hanging out but that just feels so harsh and dickish

bz1psk	2019-06-10 18:53:58	cassifrazz	AITA for not being cheery at work?	"I started work at a popular coffee chain a few weeks ago. I used to work there about 3 years ago, but it's still been a bit of an adjustment learning all the new products and relearning old procedures. 

I work about 95% with women of various ages (I'm 24f). My managers have generally been great, plus or minus a couple instances. But my younger coworkers don't seem to like me. I'm not the most happy and go lucky or talkative person, especially at work. Since I've been training, all they've seemed to do is snap at me. Two or three girls in particular who are definitely younger than me love to order me around, especially when I'm in the middle of another task. I try to comply with what they ask but I'm not always super enthusiastic about it. Sometimes I just say ""ok"" or ""sure"" and do it. Other times I try and say ""well I'm actually doing x right now..."" but that's usually met with annoyance or eye rolls. 

Today at the end of my shift I got pulled into the managers office with 3 supervisors. They said that some of the other girls had noticed an ""attitude problem"" and they were concerned. They weren't angry, they just seemed like they wanted to know what was happening. I told them that some of the girls are alot less than patient with me and I have been trying, but sometimes I get overwhelmed. They seemed to understand my explanation and assured me I wasn't in trouble, but I'm having a nagging feeling that maybe I'm in the wrong here.

EDIT: just to clarify, I'm always nice and smiley to customers. I haven't had a complaint yet. I'm only talking about my coworkers. And another thing I should mention is that nobody came and talked to me first before telling the supervisor that I was some kind of problem. I'm also pretty sure they like to gossip about me when I'm out of hearing range but that could just be paranoia."	Not the A-hole	0	0	96.0	53.0	0.0	0.0

"I share a small office with a coworker, and she has extremely crunchy snacks daily at her desk. Like whole carrots (not baby ones, big ones), snap peas, tortilla chips, crunchy crackers, etc. Our desks back on to each other and I can hear every. Single. Bite. It's not like she eats with her mouth open, it's just that these are loud foods by nature. Really loud. It goes on for 20-30 minutes in the morning, and sometimes afternoon too depending on when she decides to snack. When it first happened I just shrugged it off, but it has turned in to a daily thing. 
Maybe I'm oversensitive to the sound of the chewing but it drives me batty. I've made a couple comments in passing like ""oh wow that's some crunchy food you got there..."" to make it clear I can absolutely hear her chewing (we can't see each other over the desks) but she doesn't seem to catch on that it's loud, distracting and honestly kinda gross (the sound of people chewing makes my skin crawl). I don't want to be an ass who says she can't eat at her desk, but maybe choose quieter foods? Or save the snack for another time?? I can't put headphones in or play music, not allowed by company policy, to drown out the sound. I don't eat at my desk ever (I fast during the day so I don't eat period) but I don't want her to think this is about the eating.  It's just the loud, loud chewing. She has a muffin or bagel most mornings and I couldn't care less about that. 
So would I be the asshole if I asked her to either not eat the snacks in the office (go to the lunch room, etc.) or maybe consider quieter foods? Thanks in advance!"	Asshole	0	0	80.0	18.0	0.0	0.0

"Amidst significant family drama, my husband and I decided to elope and then host a 35 person garden-party wedding reception at our home. The reception was on the same date as our original wedding had been planned and tbh it cost just as much as a small wedding reception (approx 7k), had great food, black-tie servers/bartenders and an open bar. We noticed, though, that the majority of our guests did not bring a gift or card. Particularly, a few of my lifelong friends did not bring a gift or card. I get that it’s technically a guest’s discretion to bring a gift or not but come on! So I mentioned it I passing a few times that only one item was purchased off our registry and our card box was virtually empty. I also thanked “the few” who brought gifts for their generosity in my toast. My husband thinks that me mentioning this, and being upset about this was in poor taste (although he acknowledges that we spent the equivalent of $200/pp on the party). AITA for thinking ppl should bring a wedding gift to our wedding reception?

Edit: 
wow, apparently the internet feels very strongly about this lol. I guess IATA. 

Just to clarify a couple of things: 
our invitations were very clear it was a wedding reception. People did not know at the time we had eloped. 

Lots of you asked what the family drama was and suggested I was to blame for it. There was drama on both mine and my husband’s side actually. My husband’s dad and brother are alcoholics who have been sending him really abusive swear word-filled emails/texts for just over a year now after he stuck up for me at a family gathering.  They are both the type to do something ridiculous and cause a scene so we didn’t want them present when we said our vows.

My parents are split up and there was all sorts of unnecessary drama about me inviting my dad’s wife of 15 years as well as my mom. We just didn’t want anybody doing anything to ruin the ceremony so we opted to have it by ourselves without them. We can always kick someone out of the reception, but wanted our ceremony to be special and memorable."	Asshole	0	0	540.0	182.0	0.0	0.0

About three months ago my ex, who I will call J, broke up with me because I was an asshole and cheated on her. She was understandably pissed but we’ve slowly started talking again after I asked for her forgiveness. We have a mutual friend named F who has stayed both of our friends despite J and I breaking up. 

The other night I was at a party with F and we were hanging out. 

Quick side note: J had mentioned to me a week ago the she had made out with someone that I was  friends with but wouldn’t tell me who it was

F and I started to make out later on in the evening and I just had a feeling that she was the one who made out with J. I asked F if she made out with J and she said that she did twice. F  said she was planning on telling me but didn’t know how I would react to it, so she was waiting for the right moment. I get that and wasn’t mad at all. I know that F has no feelings for J and vice versa. F and I ended up hooking up just as friends later on. 

Because I still love J very much and want to try and work things out, I decided to let her know that I hooked up with F strictly as friends(i didn’t want that to be an issue later), and that I also know that she and F made out. When I told J she was very upset with F and I that we would hurt her in that way.J  is mad at F for telling me that they made out, J feels F betrayed her as a friend by hooking up with me, and J is mad at me because I hooked up with her good friend. I thought that was a double standard considering she made out with F first and I am also good friends with F, but J said that I don’t have the right to hook up with our friends because I was the one that cheated and she was the one that got hurt by me.

"To give a little background me and my partner travel the country and sell their product at craft shows. We had a show this past weekend that we had been to a few times before and knew that parking could be a real problem. We decided we would wake up at 5:30am to get to the our site around 6:30 which is a whole hour earlier than we normally would just so we could make sure we got a spot directly behind where our booth would be set up. The problem is if you dont get a spot right next to where you set up your booth you may potentially have to park multiple blocks away and carry all of your stuff to your assigned spots which is a real pain especially for what we sell. One other issue is the weather can be very unpredictable at this site because you are right along the water and you could have to pack up unexpectedly. 

     We got to our site around 6:30 as planned and started setting up our booth.  About an hour before the show is supposed to start I am getting the last few things out of our car when a lady approaches me. I have seen her at a few shows in the past and I know that she has a deformed arm (not sure of the proper term but it's where your arm is short and almost looks like a flipper). She starts off by saying ""can you help me."" I figured she wanted help carrying things to her booth which I gladly would do. She instead says she needs my parking spot which I reply ""I am sorry but I can't give you my spot, but I would gladly assist you in unloading your car and then watching your things while you go find a spot."" I explained how I got up early specifically so I could get a good spot etc. At this time in the morning all of the other spots in the area where taken so it wasn't like I could just move across the street. I would have been searching for a new spot for a good while.

  She proceeded to start getting angry with me saying how she is handicapped and how she couldn't believe that I could be so selfish etc. At this point I walked away but still left the offer on the table to help her unload her things if she wanted. 3 other people saw what happened and two agreed with my point of view and one did not agree with me and said that I was being rude. I really believe I was in the right with this situation but I would like your input.

AITA for not giving up my parking spot to a handicapped person?

There's a few residential streets about a 10-15 minute walk from where I work, so I park there. I try to park somewhere different every day, so I don't annoy any one person, and I do my best to find streets that have driveways so I know that the person has somewhere to park their own car. 
So today I park up and walk to work. I come back, and I've been blocked in, like someone right up my rear, cm from my boot.

I don't get a chance to open my mouth before this middle aged man starts shouting and swearing at me about how I've parked in front of his driveway ( I hadn't) and how he wants to come home from work and park outside his house (he has 3 cars always in his driveway so it's full, but he has a van which was parked on the road). 
He had plenty of room behind him, as the only person he would be obstructing is more of his own driveway, but he obviously wanted to come out and scream at a 22 year old girl in the pouring rain while I cried my eyes out and didn't manage to even say hello. 
I get that it's annoying and if I was going to be working at the hospital full time for the next unknown number of years I would try harder to get a permit, but I'm here less than a year.

Two years ago I worked a summer job and received a considerable amount in pay, just about €1600. Which my mom asked to borrow as it was necessary for the move. 

I am now a uni student and living away from home. Rent is high, but I pay for it all by myself. I got a good opportunity to move to a lower cost apartment, but I would need the money as buffer. 

I feel bad for asking, because she doesn't make much anyway, but she promised she would return me the money when she received a certain payment from a bank. This payment is anticipated to be soon. 

I don't have any proof of her promising me that though."	No A-holes here	0	0	9.0	18.0	0.0	0.0

In elementary school we were playing four square and I got in an argument with this blond kid over a spot in line. I got so pissed off after having been picked on for a long time that I went to go calm down and cry over how sad my life is. But Weirdo was all curious or something and decided to follow after me. He had been picking on me for a long time and kept telling me that I have no friends and that I’m gonna get beat up in high school, which I’m in now and I’m the one giving the beatings, hahaha! He also made creepy remarks about us being gay together and whenever anyone said the word “come”, he looked at me with big eyes like if they said “cum” and ruined that word for me. Though I had mixed feelings around him. But this really bothered me when he followed me to the hiding place I fled to. Behind him came another guy who was friends with both of us and I had had a hard time in the past with him when I was defending myself from accusations that I attacked someone and he yelled that I attacked them and I put up my middle finger and then we told on each other but we apologized afterwards.

Weirdo approached from the other side of the fence with the other dude on the same side as me. Dude seemed concerned but Weirdo was laughing and being a pesky little prick. I was already super pissed off after getting into the argument from earlier so I totally lost it when I heard Weirdo’s cherry voice say “What are ya doing in there?” with a big obnoxious smile complete with crooked teeth. If there wasn’t a fence between us I would have messed him up so bad. I gripped the fence with a demonically angry expression on my face and yelled at him to f**k off. I then noticed Dude who was looking really concerned and immediately apologized to him and said it was not directed at him. I ran home and my parents drove me back to the school and the principal said not to run home because it’s a safety concern because she’s a stuck up bitch.

I then had meetings in the office with the guy I got in the argument with and then with Weirdo. He did not snitch on me for yelling the F word at him but since I was asked why I had a problem with him, I snitched on him for following me around and making the remarks I mentioned earlier. Neither of us got in trouble. Is there something less asshole-ish I could have said? After all, he did not snitch on me."	Everyone Sucks	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

When we got back together I never mentioned that I was talking to other girls while separated since nothing really came out of it other then talking.

bz1e7s	2019-06-10 18:27:54		AITA for making my client pay me now?	"Heya, I'm sorry for my broken English/spelling mistakes!

So here's a little backstory; I'm a 19 year old student and self thought artist and I like to make charged album covers for clients in my free time to save up some money for myself. 

Now, I have had two clients (not related to each other in any way) I worked with before and they both paid me off nicely and on time. About two weeks ago, they messaged me around the same time asking for a new art piece, I obviously accepted their request because I could use some money and started working on the pieces. The pieces are finished and I've send it to them (watermarked all over) and they thanked me for it. Because they aren't from the same country as me, the time varies a lot. I replied to their ""thank you's"" a few hours later and brought up that I wanted the payment to be done through PayPal. They have ignored all of my messages up to now, and I see them regularly post pictures/stories on their Instagram. I have asked them nicely that I would appreciate it if they could reply and I kept my cool as much as possible, to no avail. 

Up untill today, one of the two clients replied and said something came up and basically told me they could pay me when they get. I haven't answered to this yet, but I am fuming. I am seriously so angry at the moment, as I made clear I needed the payment done by today. 

I really needed the money, and it dissapoints me that I am being ignored for almost two weeks now. I don't rely on the money they would pay me, but something came up and most of my money was used to pay some stuff off. Right now my patience has died, since they told me they would pay me the day the piece was finished. 

I acknowledge the fact that I should have done pre-payment, but I didn't think too much of it and I know that that's my fault. Right now I just need advice on what I can do, I don't want to lose them as my clients because I love working with them but I really need the money at the moment.

Him and his girlfriend (both ~28y.o) are really cool people and we get along well. When I got the invite, I don't know why I thought it would be a good idea to send it back all dirty and a bit burned and crumbled. I was thinking about making a 2-part joke with a follow up gift that would kind of give them a hilarious closure.

The wedding is in september, I have to send my RSVP within 2 weeks. Thing is, the RSVP carton looks a bit artistic-dirty, but I realise I have no idea what to do for the second part of the joke!

bz1dol	2019-06-10 18:26:40		AITA for not letting boyfriends brother be around our dog	"Quick background: My boyfriend and I have been together for about 3 years and adopted our dog 2 years ago. This dog is our world. His parents are currently separated and his brother, who has mental health and substance abuse issues, lives with their dad 3 weeks out of the month and their mom for the other one week. Boyfriend and his brother have a tumultuous relationship and his brother recently made explicit death threats against my boyfriend after an argument. He is very unstable and we are not sure how serious he was when he made these threats. Boyfriend's dad generally sides with his brother, despite continued lying and substance abuse, as well as manipulation of others in the family (stealing money, etc.). This has created a divide between my boyfriend and his dad as well. 

&#x200B;

The AITA situation: My boyfriend and I are leaving for a trip in about a week. We previously arranged for our dog to stay with his mom at her house while we were gone. His dad was upset about this and wanted to spend split time by taking care of our dog as well. I thought this was a little annoying because I didn't understand why he was so insistent on splitting taking care of our dog but decided to not argue as my boyfriend and his dad were working on repairing their relationship and I didn't want to come between that. Our only request from his dad is that the brother not be around our dog, as we are unsure how far he would go to hurt my boyfriend and felt as though he might possibly harm our dog. We offered for his dad to stay at our apartment if he really wanted to take care of our dog as a compromise. His dad originally agreed to this stipulation. However, he came over yesterday and told us that he did not agree with our request to keep our dog away from boyfriends brother and would be bringing him over to the apartment where boyfriend's brother will be. My boyfriend and I were both really upset that our wishes were not being respected and told his parents that he would not be staying with either of them as we did not trust his dad to not come over to his mom's house and take our dog to his own apartment (he still has a key and passcode). Our dog will now be staying with my dad, who lives an hour away (boyfriends parents both live in our same town). 

&#x200B;

My boyfriends dad is really pissed at us for not trusting his brother around our dog and also for not trusting him to take of our dog. AITA for contributing to further conflict in their family?

bz1crh	2019-06-10 18:24:51	aForgoneConclusion	AITA for not working for my mother?	"Me(18f) and my mom have a bit of a strained relationship. I stopped living with her at 16 due to the issues we had and things have been slowly getting better between us with that added distance. This seems like it's going to cause a rift between us.

My mother owns this little fish restaurant and I worked there from age 13-17. I absolutely hated it. It suited me terribly, it made my anxiety worse and it was generally shit for my mental health. Thanks to getting overwhelmed a lot while working, I wasn't particularly good at it either. The added bonus of smelling like fish and frying oil all the time made me miserable. When I finally managed to quit, I promised myself I'd never, ever work there again.

At the moment, things aren't going great with the restaurant. A lot of her staff have quit or been fired for various reasons, I know from my time there that the staff very much disliked my mother as a boss and my mom didn't like most of the staff. She just called me to say that she'll be understaffed in july and wants me to come and work for two weeks. I've told her many times that I'm not going to work there again and even when she offered me a job as a manager and said she'd pay me 50% more than what I'm getting now, I refused. 

So, I told her I would not come and work for her again, and she got angry with me. She said that I'm family and should help out, she also tried to guilt trip me by saying that she'll be forced to have my grandparents working, and they're old and have health issues. She said I was being selfish and that she's very hurt. 

Thing is, I've got a job that I love as a barista and I work every day except Sunday. I'm also taking an online course from MIT that cost a bit of money and it takes up 16 additional hours a week. I tried telling her this and she said she'd only make me work in the evenings (my coffeeshop closes at 6). She said that I should be able to do this for her. 

I told her to look at any other option she has and if I'm the only one who can do this, she can call me again. At that point she just started to say ""No, whatever, I'll just find someone else. It's clear that you can't even do this for me. I'll just work full time there, and your grandparents too."" and other things like that. I've been trying to enforce boundaries with her so I did my best not to budge but I'm not sure if I'm in the right. 

My mental health has improved a lot in the year and a half since I stopped working for her and I think I probably could handle it anxiety wise, but the thought of going back there again still fills me with dread. On the other hand, I don't want my grandparents working there, my grandma can barely walk some days and my grandpa gets confused a lot.

I was at my friend's cabin on the weekend and we were in the hot tub. It was me and 2 of my friends in the hot tub.

I had my phone sitting on the edge of the hot tub behind me because I was messaging with it, as the phone can handle a bit of water on the screen and what not and I am always careful to not drop my own phone. We were chilling when my friend I will call Frank drunkingly threw a golf club in the air which was deflected by my other friend Terry and hit my cellphone knocking it into the hot tub. My phones screen turned off and hasn't come back on. 

At first I thought my friend threw a club which knocked my phone into water so he should pay for it, after talking about it I agreed that I shouldnt have had my phone by the hot tub. I then suggested that he should pay for 50% of it because I think we both made mistakes, but he isn't really willing to.

 Nobody can fix this phone yet because it is too new to get many replacement parts, so I looked into getting a new phone which is $900 where I live.

bz1b6g	2019-06-10 18:21:15	aytiehl	AITA for cutting off a friendship because she doesn't text me back?	"Hi Redditors!

I'm just curious if I should cut this person off, or if there's some issue with myself that I need to fix.

I moved to this city a year ago and made a couple friends pretty fast. One of them is a woman I met off a friendship app named Ali and we met at a bar and hit it off. Since then, we've hung out almost 1-2 times a week. We got along so well that I thought we were good friends. We told each other so much, cried together when sharing traumatic events in the past, celebrated birthdays together, went out together with friends, and played rec sports together.

10 months into our friendship, Ali ghosted me. I honestly did not know what I did wrong, but I tried to reach out to her a couple times. I'm not exactly the type to make someone answer me and push myself to demand answers unless that person is family, or it's my SO. I straight up asked her, ""hey I have not heard from you in awhile. I just want to know you're okay, checking up on you."" Apparently, one of my other friends reached out to her as well, but Ali answered her in a day but didn't answer me. It did make me extremely upset about it, because I've spent a lot of time and care being friends with her and the ghosting either showed she didn't care enough or she had a personal problem with me and never addressed it to me. It's been two months and the last thing on our text convo is still me asking her if she was ok.

So I stopped hanging out with her and some of our mutual friends (the friends are much closer to her than to me anyways). I still see her active on our group chat, and it bugs me to even see a text from her. Due to something completely unrelated (moving to a house closer to my parents now because they're getting much older), I'm moving out of state and deciding just to not tell her. AITA for cutting off all contact and avoiding her, or should I be the bigger person and tell her how I really feel? I'm wondering if anyone else here went through the same thing, and if getting closure helped them.

Personally, I think this is extremely stupid but literally all my friends on our group chat are calling me the asshole so I just want to know if I should stand my ground or not.

Basically, a friend and I ordered some stuff internationally and it arrived today. My friend ordered stuff worth about £370 with the intent to resell while I ordered stuff worth about £60. The main reason i ordered with her was because there was free shipping for stuff over £100 and she was completely okay with me joining her order. It arrived today and apparently we have to pay a customs fee worth £63 which we had no clue about. She said we should split it evenly. I told her there is no way in hell I’m shelling out £30 unplanned when my stuff was a tiny fraction of the overall cost. 

I told her i could pay £10 which i think is fair enough and the way she reacted you’d think I fucking murdered her dog. She then brought up the fact that i’d have paid shipping of £20 if i ordered on my own (which is true but i wouldn’t have fucking ordered shite if i was gonna pay shipping) so i should just add the £20 to the £10 i was offering and give her £30. I told her there’s no way that’s happening so we’re currently at an impasse. She told our group of friends about it and they’re all calling me the asshole and tbh my resolve is weakening and i might just give in and pay the fucking money but i guess i wanna hear it from you guys first.

bz18vm	2019-06-10 18:16:02	Beezleboss6666	AITA for just wanting to be friends?	"Last Friday I made plans with a girl that I met on Bumble to meet up and go kayaking as a first time hangout. There wasn't much prior discussion as to what either person was interested in or looking for out of the meetup. It's worth noting that both her profile and mine indicated the ""Don't know yet"" category as to why we were on the app. 

So we get around to hanging out and get on the water. Everything is good, things are very flirty but also fun. It certainly all felt normal, natural and cool. We made references to a show we both knew quite a bit of and initially bonded over when chatting through the app. 

Eventually, it starts to get dark and we decide to head back to land. As we're headed back over, the topic of ""well what are you looking for?"" finally rears its gnarly head out. She talks about how she had just gotten back on ""dating apps"" and realistically wasn't all that sure. I explain how I'm still relatively new to the area (like a year) and don't see my current situation as anything permanent. This goes over fine and just about offers to introduce me to her friends in the area. 

As we get back on land and begin to load up the kayaks on her car, the conversation comes back to being friends. She nearly blurts out ""what about friends with benefits?"" to which I indicate that I'm not opposed but wouldn't want it to conflict with anything further. Things get the awkward, first time meeting question of whether or not to kiss the other person. We share a clumsy kiss leading to a second.

After that, we head our separate ways and I get back. The discussion shifts into a bit more of a hookup or certainly a fwb status. We exchange a nude each to which the response turns into how we should have gone home with one another that evening. Come the next morning, I play it cool but talk about trying to make plans to hangout again. She gets back to me a bit later in the day and proceeds to say ""I don't want to be friends, and I don't want to hook up, I think I want a relationship"". 

Naturally, my instincts go to think that I've messed something up and so I ask if there's anything I've done wrong or the like. She tells me no and proceeds to say that everything that transpired was a way of her past that she was over and trying to move past. OK, I get that. I tell her that its cool but I don't understand why friends move off the table, after she explicitly said that ""it's always good to add more friends"". 

Now, I should mention that meeting up with this girl was like striking gold. She was cool, genuine (or so I thought) and we had a lot of good stuff in common. So, while I wasn't fully open to the idea initially of dating, I extend the olive branch because I was genuinely wowed by her (for this, I'm sure I'm the A-hole). I get a ""lemme think about it"" which ultimately led to ""I don't want to pursue anything"".

That time, my mom had nothing, didn’t finish college, was a housewife. When she found out,she loaned out to finish college so she can land a job. I saw how hard it was for her, dealing with a heartbreak while being a mom and student

After college, she found it hard to land a job, so eventually had to go overseas for better opportunities.she left us with her friend.Said friend was great, treated us like one of hers, but my mom wasnt earning enough and cant send money

My dad learned about this and took us back, left us with our grandma, and tbh, they didn’t care about us. I was 14,was given the task to look after my younger sister,6 y/o. I absolutely love her and I’d do everything for her, but I was also a teenager and teenage angst tends to make things worse.The responsibility of taking care of my sibling felt heavy for me at the time, I had no idea what to do. At the same time, I envied the life my friends had. They have parents to cook for them, attend family parties, etc, while I had to do that all by myself for my sister.

That went on until I graduated from uni. I had to move on with my life and start my career. It broke my heart to be separated from my sister and she was crying nonstop because she had to live with my dad’s new family.

a year later, I was already up for promotion in my career,my mom took custody of my sister because she just couldnt live with my dad’s new family. But school costs a fortune and my mom couldnt afford it. She asked me to quit my job and try my luck in that country because salary is better. I was hesitant at first. Eventually, since it’s for my sister, I followed her advice.

Now, my mom has financial issues. Money was one of the reasons they broke up. She overused her three credit cards and can’t pay. I shrugged it off at first and was keen to helping her out. 

Unfortunately, I’m unemployed for a year and havent found a job that would accept me. Its depressing.I understand that my mom needs me and I absolutely dont want my sister to go back to what she described as hell but at the same time, I can feel that I’m losing my life.

We had an argument this morning, and I told my mom that she shouldn’t be subjecting me to this pressure and responsibility, that she is the reason why I dont envision myself having kids ever, that she shouldnt oblige me to help just because I’m her daughter, that before she married, she should have graduated first so we won’t have money issues that is already costing a great deal of my career. I also confronted her why she has so many debt

Her reply was because when my dad left us, she had to borrow money to finance her education, so she can land a decent job. now, that debt is due and she had to pay back with another loan. It goes on and on and she said that she didnt plan any of it.

I regret my approach,and throughout those years when she was handling that break up, she did her best to make it up to us.

At 2am wife comes running in to the bedroom and says he vomited and she needs help. I hold the boy and calm him down (every time he vomits he cried a bunch). After she cleaned up the couch and lays back down, I hand him over to her and head back to attempt to sleep again.

At 5:50am I hear him screaming and crying because he's vomited again. I come out to the living room to help out, get him settled down and clean up some vomit. At this point, I decide I will be no use to my job being this tired and I'd rather stay home to look after the boy and get some rest. 

(Now for some backstory)
Normally my wife and I alternate rest days on the weekends, she gets to sleep in Saturdays (I'll handle the boy and the dogs) and she can sleep in as long as she needs. Sunday is my day to do the same. Well, she was feeling extra crampy from her period so I had to take over both days with no rest.

(Back to main story)
So after the latest incident at 5:50am, I tell her I've already set it up to take a sick day and she seemed relieved. I head back to bed to try and sleep.

I'm finally woken up just before 11am as they both come into the bedroom, and the boy seems fine now, wife is visibly exhausted. She says he hasn't vomited since about  7am and he seems better. She says that I should maybe head out and get some Pedialyte. She then says she is gonna go heat up a waffle for him. As she is leaving the room I ask if she already called the doctor's office to get their opinion on his condition, she says ""no, I'll do that now"".

It was here that I made the decision to go take a shower, so after her feeding him the waffle and the phone call to the doctor I would be ready to head out the door to get whatever supplies. As I am just jumping in the shower she comes in and starts yelling about me getting in the shower. She calls me the most inconsiderate person she knows and says I'm just a huge asshole. I stopped the shower and asked if she wanted to take one, and I was confused why she was upset.

From what I understood, I was on a mission to get some Pedialyte and other supplies, so I was moving toward that goal. Apparently I'm just an assuming asshole.

bz0zcp	2019-06-10 17:54:46	krutticus	AITA for feeling like my future in-laws are using our house like a hotel?	"About 15 months ago, my fiance and I got engaged after dating for 3 years.  We crunched the numbers and found that purchasing a house before the wedding was going to save my family $20k over the year leading up to our wedding.  My only hesitation at the time was that this house was in my hometown and her family lives \~700 miles away.  I realized how big of a dynamic it was going to be for us to put down roots so far from her family.  We decided together to get a 4 bedroom house as we wanted somewhere for her entire family to be able to stay when they came to visit.

&#x200B;

Her parents were very happy that we thought about them when house shopping.  About a month after we moved in, they called and asked if we would mind taking care of her grandmother while they went on their dream vacation to Europe.  I was hesitant as her grandmother is getting up there in age and I knew she had a heart condition, but there was no way I was going to say no to their first request, let alone one that they'd truly appreciate.  The day before they left, her mother confided in me that they had met with the doctor prior to traveling and received the news that her grandmother's heart was devastatingly weak and her surgery a few months out was recommended to be pulled forward, directly in the middle of their vacation.  They opted to delay the surgery until they got back to to financials, which while I understand, they essentially dropped off a frail mid 90s y/o woman with a bad heart condition into my lap then left for Europe for 2 weeks.  When they returned, they decided they wanted to stay another 3 days to split up the travel.

&#x200B;

Reason's for visiting kept arising: her mother's brother is sick, her cousin's wedding is in the next state over, her grandmother decided to sell her house, my fiances bridal shower, etc.  Each time, they've had a legitimate reason for visiting, and so I've said nothing.  Finally after this last visit, my fiance mentioned that they've been staying with us way too much, and it was a relief to hear.

&#x200B;

What makes this situation worse in my opinion, is they refuse to fly.  What should be a 2 hour flight is rather a 10 hour road trip, which turns into 15 hours because they can't leave her grandmother alone and need to make frequent stops along the way.  I come to find that her father who also had heart problems a few years ago, is also starting to feel like his heart condition has come back.  So now whenever her mother travels, she no longer feels safe to leave either of them alone.  I've offered to buy their plane tickets, or at least subsidize the difference in the cost of flying and driving, but they've refuse as the frequency would be too expensive.

&#x200B;

They're here currently and decided they want to stay another 3 days.  I went back and counted the days they've stayed since we took the house.  It's just over 30%.  In the meantime, I'm going to continue biting my tongue."	No A-holes here	0	0	44.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

Title pretty much says it all but I’m scared for the kid. She vapes on her juul almost constantly and from what I can tell she goes through like a pack of pods in a week. I’m no scientist or health expert but from what I do understand vaping is a good alternative to smoking but not healthy even for adults, it can’t have very good effects on a child. She’s younger than me and the father is younger than her, god knows why he hasn’t said anything yet. Or if he even has (which is where my question here comes into play). She’s really far into the pregnancy now, I know it’s not my place to tell her what’s good for her kid/her body. Would I be overstepping my bounds as her friend? Would I be disrespecting their relationship? I know this is going to end poorly in terms of our relationship as friends, but I find what she’s doing to be really morally objectionable as the child has no say."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

He once cried over cleaning the toilet, even with wearing gloves. 

Now, I think a really great way to teach him would be to make him clean up every bit of food he throws in there with his bare hands, because I think it would be enough for him to think about not doing it anymore.

bz0wh9	2019-06-10 17:48:12	DarthMaren	WIBTA if I disappeared to live my life, in turn ruining my mothers life.	"Disclaimer: I am crossposting this because I feel it would do better here.

Im 18. I live with my mom 4 cats and 1 dog. The house is a mess clutter everywhere she likes to hoard food. I tried to clean it in the past but in a day she has already put back the clutter and the cat hair is back. We used to have a cleaning lady who would come 3 times a week and even that didn't help. Not only that I am trans and I want to transition. My biggest fear is rejection and that is why I don't want to come out to her. If she rejected me I don't know what I would do. I don't have any friends and im not really close to any of my other family. Im tired of living a lie and I just want my actual life to start. I feel so dead inside even when I do things I like I feel like a robot programmed to like the stuff im doing.

If I leave my mom's life will be ruined. Where we live you're required to have a child with you (I've been here since I was 7 so it's fine that im 18.) Then my mom finally got a job for the first time in 10 years this January. She makes good money but she has a lot of debt to pay off (over 30k) Plus her job is in LA so it would be pretty hard to find cheap housing like we have at our current place. My sister lives in a packed house with her boyfriend in the desert so that's out of the question. Then her mom and my brother both live up north. How she would get all her stuff up there idk. She's also trying to get enough credit's to transfer to an actual college to get a bachelors in drug and alcohol counseling. If I leave all of that would be put to an end. She also have depression that she takes meds for. If I left im sure she would be in a state of complete depression if I left. I'd be a terrible person if I left. But I want to focus on my life.

So my plan is to go get a u-haul, then when she leaves for work at night get an uber get back to the u-haul, drive it back, load up my stuff, wait till an okay storage place opens up put all my stuff in, then go to LA, turn in my U-haul, then walk to the a LA LGBT center. They have a homeless program that I could join I called to get more info on it but all I got was a voice message.I would also get a temporary phone with a different number and just keeping my old phone off until I can change the number. Im going to see my therapist about all of this later this week so im hoping to sort this with her as well. This would ruin my moms life, would I be an asshole for wanting to live my life?

Edit: I stopped seeing my therapist about 2 weeks ago as she wanted me find a therapist closer to me. I contacted her this weekend about seeing her again and just right now she said if we met it would just to find a new therapist. Great I didn't want to deal with all of the shit i've been going through anyways thank you VERY FUCKING MUCH.

Edit 2: I forgot to say that my mom says transhobic stuff all the time. Just in the last half hour she was happy when she saw an artical stating that neo nazis stopped a pride parade. I dont think she would kill me if I came out but I really dont want to come out to her. Im going to enact my plan thursday night thanks for all the advice.

bz0ugq	2019-06-10 17:43:52	Sausage_and_broccoli	WIBTA if I refused to let my mother hold my newborn until she quits smoking?	"My mother [60F] has been a smoker for the majority of my life. I recall one time when she had quit, but it clearly didn't last. I've been begging her to quit for years - offering to pay for nicotine patches, helping find a support, even hiding or destroying her cigarettes. She keeps saying she'd like to, and keeps making no effort for it. I've tried to reason with her about it, saying things like I want her to quit so she'll be around to be with her grandchildren. Asked her to do it to save money. Asked for it as a birthday or Christmas gift.

The cigarettes she smokes smell awful - they cling to everything. Clothing, furniture, cars. If she gets into my car, it'll smell for a while afterwards. If she's in my house, I have to air it out. If I go to her house, my clothes smell like smoke until I wash them.

My wife [30F] and I [31M] are expecting our first baby in a couple months. It will be the first on her family's side, and the second on mine. Naturally, there's a lot of excitement. My mother loves babies and was over the moon when she found out she would have another grandkid.

About a year ago, I mentioned to her I didn't want her holding my kids if she was still smoking. I reminded her of it when I got married (""you know, Wife and I will be having a kid soon, so you should work on quitting""). I reminded her again when we got pregnant (""7 months to go. How are you with quitting?""). We're in the home stretch now, counting the weeks. She's made no progress towards quitting.

I know it will crush her to not hold her grandkid. I know she's addicted to smoking. I know she's had trouble quitting. But I can't stand the thought of picking up my baby and having him smell like smoke. What will that do to an infant? She won't smoke around the baby, but she's certainly going to bring some of that toxic shit to him. I can't shield him from everything, but that doesn't mean everything should get a free pass.

Recently (after thinking about it for some time), I've decided I want to go through with getting my first tattoo. I went and picked a design and put my deposit down. It was great! I'm supposed to be getting it tomorrow. I decided to tell my parents beforehand because I'm coming home for Father’s Day so no surprises. 

Now my family comes into the story like this. We're first generation immigrants here in the US. My dad went to high school elsewhere, but that’s about it. Mom has an associate’s degree from here, but for the most part they are sheltered people who don't know much outside stuff of our family minus some extended family and the news. They've made it this far which is awesome and I'm proud of them, but they are very close-minded people. We try to be honest with each other, but fail to do so sometimes. I don't live at home and haven't for many years). I've never fought with my parents until I told them I was getting a tattoo. 

My mom was open to it, but doesn't want it to be visible. My dad lost his shit and told me ""he's failed as a father, I shouldn't come home for Father’s Day if I get the tat and that I'm going to become some 4th class citizen. Everyone's going to look down on you and your supervisors going to hate it, don't fuck your life up. I'm just telling you what I know"". Just very against it when he doesn't actually know anything about tattoos, what the process is, but he lives in this old middle east mindset. He told me he wouldn't talk to or even look in my direction if I go through with this and he's never lied to me so far. 

In my head, I'm doing something I want to do with my own god damn body and it's my choice, my money, my LIFE. I really want to go through with it, but I also don't want to go through with it, then look at it and remember it caused this huge drift with my dad.

"A few months ago I started working a job at a software company that is very well known in my area for paying really well, having great culture, benefits, etc. Naturally it’s a job everybody wants and a company everybody wants to be with. So I’ve had several people come up to me out of the blue and ask to be references. I generally do a case by case basis depending on my relationship with them. 

A couple weeks after I started I get a message from my cousin out of the blue. She says that she’s been trying to work for the company for months and applied for the same position I had gotten. She then asked me to go over her resume and help her with her application and answer some questions she had. I was happy to help. Since I’ve started there in April she has applied for 4 different positions with the company and keeps putting my name down as reference. She’s asked me to go to my manager and put in a good word and write her a letter of recommendation. 

My issue with this is that she really wants to work for the company, but she keeps applying to different departments that she’s not qualified for and has just been all over the place. I’m not even sure if she realizes what she’s applying for. I’ve also only been there for a couple of months so I don’t really want to stake my relationship with the company on my flaky cousin.

We were going to do a paint night, and I reserved our spot. I paid the $38 per person, and admittedly knew that the cancellation process meant no refund. 

I get a text from her on Thursday, saying she is slammed at work. She offers to pay for her half of the painting. I say no worries, and ask if she wants to reschedule. We go on texting a bit more.

I text her over the weekend, and I'm clearly getting the feeling I'm getting ghosted. Ok, it happens. I'm not all that plussed by it. But that also does mean I'm out $76, for a reservation I had to cancel. I'm probably more annoyed by that, than the actual ghosting. 

My question is, would I be an asshole for sending her a text saying, ""I understand if you don't want to meet, but can you pay me for the half of paint night for cancelling?""

bz0q2x	2019-06-10 17:34:04		AITA for leaving a company and when they asked why I basically said I’m better than them and that?	Long story short. I worked for a company for like ... maybe I think 2 months. When I first started it was cool, but after awhile, like every company you start to notice things. Literally everyone in that company talks shit about each other. Literally. I had a morning shift once, and the manager said in front of EVERYBODY how one of our other managers doesn’t like her yada yada. At that point, I basically thought what am I doing with these kind of people. Yes it’s a job, but come on, do they not have lives outside the workplace so they got to bring drama within? It also made me uncomfortable, because then what is being said about me? And a lot of them are snitches. Now before anyone says how it’s like this in almost every job, I’ve had 5 jobs before that, and maybe I just lucked out, but I’ve never had that type of toxic environment before. So when I gave in my notice (not really a notice, I just quit on the spot when I found another job) I just said my peace, said I was better than all of that and that I was dumbing myself down being there, and all that. Honestly , am I the asshole? Maybe I shouldn’t of said all that, but it really pissed me off. 2 other co workers also tried starting drama with me, and I never even talked to them. I also don’t need them on my resume, as I said I got another job and got other jobs on my resume anyway.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We made a pact about 8 years ago that we'd be each other's best man at our weddings. He got married in 2012, I was the best man. I got married in 2017 and he was 1 of my best men (I had 2). The other best man is who I consider my BEST friend. He lives in another state (friends since elementary) but we keep in constant contact, I visit his mom, etc. Same goes for the other friend who I've been close with his family since I was shitting myself. The last 6-7 years we've drifted but stayed in regular contact.

Since I've been with my wife, things have grown distant, no issues between my wife and them - we've hung out plenty of times. Just when my wife and I moved in together a year after we started dating - we constantly invited them over for months and they never came over. Forward to when we got engaged and I didn't tell him I was proposing since he never replied or called back. He called within 15 minutes of my FB post and asked we go to breakfast the next morning. We went and he immediately brought up the best man promise so I gave in wanting to be the ""better"" friend. 

We found out were were pregnant in January. Made a rule that we wouldn't post anything online. We'd tell people in person. She's 24 weeks and we haven't heard from this friend at all. Normally when we do, it every once and again and it's the same ""we should hang out sometime"" conversation so I'm not expecting an out of the blue meet up.

Also, I'm the ""Godfather"" to this his son. Last year around his birthday, I text him to see if his father (minister) is able to officiate a wedding, didn't quite get to that part of the conversation. The next day, I get a text saying my godson's party was that day (3hrs from the text) and he and his wife thought each of them were going to invite us personally....they didn't and we weren't able to make it since I had already had booked for a couple weeks to get my wife pampered. I wondered then and still do that if I didn't text him, would I have even known about it?

A week later I dropped off a present and a card for him at his family's house. Never heard from them, not a thank you or acknowledgment of the present even after sending a text about it.

My wife is done with this friendship, she says he hasn't done anything to reach out and then acts like everything is fine if we run into them. 2 of his sisters are pregnant at the same time (I was at the weddings) - we were never told. His younger daughter had her 2nd birthday party - we were never told or invited. 

WIBTA for not telling him or his family that we are expecting and have them find out once we make a public announcement after he's born? Or at this point, it doesn't matter since things have drifted so far apart? It's a 25 year relationship. Maybe I'm being too sentimental about it?"	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bz0p3p	2019-06-10 17:31:54		AITA for wanting to give up on a relationship with my brother an sister-in-law	"I (M26) come from a family with 3 older brothers (ages 38, 31, & 28). The oldest brother, who we will call Joey is married to his wife of 10 years and has two daughters (ages 4 and 7). I talk to at least one of my family members daily, normally calling when I am commuting to/from work (I spend 1.5 hours a day in the car). 

&#x200B;

Joey is by far the family member I communicate with the least. I will try and call him 2-4 times a week and he maybe will answer 10% of the time. I never get a call back and when I do, it's normally me on speaker phone with his whole family on the line just making small talk to me while they are cooking dinner. No real catching up actually gets done. When we do speak it typically lasts no more than 5 minutes.

&#x200B;

It was my niece's birthday over the weekend and I tried to call to wish her a happy bday. No answer. I got a generic ""sorry we missed your earlier"" text message that evening after the kids had likely been put to bed. Turns out I am the only brother they didn't call back and it hurts knowing Joey and his family can't find a few minutes is their day to simply return a call. 

&#x200B;

I am at the point, where I am getting fed up with making an effort. AITA for wanting to ending my efforts in reaching out to him?

&#x200B;

I have a tiny family only my mother, my grandma and my sister (61, 89 and 29). 

&#x200B;

My mother and grandmother are very conservative but in the good way,they have always taught us to put family first. 

&#x200B;

4-5 years ago in my country Argentina the feminism movement started to rise A LOT and i completely agree wit them so first i encouraged my sister to take a part in that so she stops  being the ""good wife/sister/daughter"" she always had been.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 2 years ago

&#x200B;

My grandmother broke her hip and at such age she needed a lot of help, from taking her med to wipe her ass until the hip fixes... one night when my sister had to take care of a 86 years Senile lady she went out with her friends instead. and that night she fell and broke her hip again.

&#x200B;

My sister at that time told us that she had a life and cant do whatever we told her to do.. here is when the conflict started.. like that old lady raised you while her daughter (out mother) had 3 jobs and studied at night and received as a lawyer in 3 years while providing the family. Our mother effort made our grandmother a second mom since 80% of our childhood memories are ""mom working, raised by grandma"". I CANT JUST CANT accept such behavior on my sister, she did not wanted to do it OK but tell something so we can plan ahead.

&#x200B;

3 months passed from that incident, my sister stopped helping our family or interacting at all. Barely stayed in our house and talked to us. My grand mother condition grew bigger, at that age and with those interventions the doctors said that its normal.

&#x200B;

One day my grandmother falls again and the only person near to help her or do something was my sister. She not only did nothing, but told me that we were not more family anymore, that if she ever needs she wont be seeking it from US (not me, the problem was the family now). So my grandmother stayed in the ground with a broken hip for 4 hours until my mother could go back home. 

&#x200B;

I have closed a door to my sister. I gave her opportunities to amend her mistakes, but still she wont change her mindset where she only cares for what she cares and fuck everything else.

&#x200B;

In 7 days is my birthday and i told my mother and grandmother that i would love to take such awesome ladies to dinner while they invited my sister and current boyfriend where i said to them to DO NOT. We argued a lot and they told me that my sister is suffering from depression, she has financial problems, she ""miss me"", she wants to change but cant and yada yada.. so i told my lovely ladies that they have to tell her that SHE is not invited after all and they expect ME to do so.

&#x200B;

And told my family that like i stopped loving my sister, they would get the same if they dont stop taking me for granted and start taking in account what i want, past my sisters needs.

The last day of school is on Thursday and she sent an email out today that she is giving all of her students a gift card to a really popular ice cream shop and invited all of her students to come on Friday. Now my son told me she was doing this and he was SOOO excited and asked if he could go. I said, ""We have to see what time it is. I have to take you to work with me on Friday. I'm sure it's later in the day since people work, so it shouldn't be a problem."" Right, shouldn't be a problem?? People work. NOPE, wrong. Her email says 11 AM. Like what? Do they assume everyone is a stay at home mom and can do every field trip (which I just took off last week to do one), every school activity?? Maybe I'm just in a shit mood today; but I don't think that having it later in the day is an unreasonable thing/assumption to have. So, would I be the asshole if I replied to the email and said something. I obviously wouldn't be a complete bitch and word it nicer.

&#x200B;

\*\*Additional Info\*\* I have thought about asking one of the moms who I know stays home with her kids, however they would have to keep my son all day. I work 45 min - an hour away with traffic and would feel bad to ask one of the other moms to take him all day. So, no I don't have to be there, but an adult obviously has to drive him there as it isn't a school event and school is over. I don't want her to change her schedule for me. I just want her to be more aware that parents work and their kids look forward to things like this.

&#x200B;

\*\*Wasn't asking her to change the time. Just want her to be more mindful of working parents for the future classes. Not sure why everyone thought I was asking her to change the time for me and me alone.

&#x200B;

\*\*So apparently I'm an asshole. I did not email her even though all I was going to state was that my son was looking forward to going and it's unfortunate that parents who work a regular 9-5 job can't bring their kids. Also, there is another mom that will be taking him and I am going to be a couple hours late to work so she can pick him up before the event."	Asshole	0	0	4.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

How am I supposed to trust this cop with serving the public, if the only service he's good for is fucking over marriages? (Granted it's her fault).

Reason why I was going to email everyone is that police departments have a track record of sweeping shit under the rug, so I figured I'd stir the pot. I was going to include in the email the following as well in case they decide to not do much:
""If my grievance is not addressed in a timely manner, I will forward this email to the board of the commissioners of the county.""

I got out the shower and enter my room to see my brother blasting this new game he recently got. It’s been hot in my area and we have no means of air conditioning so I kicked him out of my room for sake of keeping the room as cool as possible. He huffs and I push him off the bed, and he takes his new “AC” he bought and also bringing the ps4 with him.

bz0fc9	2019-06-10 17:10:07	LavenderCake19	AITA for charging more than half the rent to my new roommate?	"New account for anonymity -  I live in a major city near a university. I've been renting the same two-bedroom apartment since I was a student at said university 15 years ago. After graduating I found a job near by and stayed. My apartment has rent control, it's large, and in a good neighborhood.   


I've had a few roommates over the years, and have always charged exactly half the rent. From 2013-2018 my boyfriend and I were living here together, but his job sent him abroad for 3 years on assignment so I'm ""holding down the fort"" til he gets back. Luckily being so close to the university it's easy to find short-term, serious roommates thankful for the cheap rent. Or so I thought.  


Last year when I advertised my room, it was so cheap in comparison to what's on the market right now I received, I kid you not, over 150 inquiries. Wading through all of that stressed me out - I did not have the time to adequately read, reply to, and interview potential roommates. Then the person I ended up choosing turned out to be unreliable with paying rent and utilities, even though it was so cheap.   


This time, I've decided to charge closer to market rate for the second bedroom. It's still one of the cheapest listings out there, but the replies I'm getting are more serious and the process is going much more smoothly. I have not mentioned (nor do I plan to) that they are paying so much more than half, but their rent will include all utilities, they'll get the larger bedroom, and I will take care of all shared items like toilet paper, paper towels, dish soap, etc. I will probably still make a ""profit"" in the spring/fall when we aren't using heating or air conditioning as much, and have been toying around with the idea of putting the extra in with their security deposit so they can still get it back at the end of their stay.  


I was mulling all this over to a friend of mine and she thought it was really sneaky and backhanded to charge my new roommate more than half the rent on the sly. Even though she knows the problems I had with my last roommate, she still thinks I could be doing some poor graduate student or visiting scholar a huge favor by giving them such a cheap rent.   


A part of me does feel shitty for it, I'm not going to lie, but on the other hand I'm still trying to make this as equitable as I can. I didn't set the amount in order to make a profit, I set it to make it easier to find a reliable roommate. And it's still one of the cheapest options on apartment listing sites right now. So I thought I'd bring my dilemma here for judgement. AITA for charging more than half the rent to my new roommate?

EDIT:

There seems to be some debate about the laws regarding subletting and where I'm from. I live in D.C., and as far as I can tell as long as I'm not charging more than I am charged (for the whole apartment) it's OK:

https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/can-a-renter-charge-sublessees-different-rates-for-1600719.html 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2015/02/06/ask-the-advocate-subletting-in-d-c/?utm_term=.c3f5e96b4dc8

If someone has a link or info that says otherwise, I'll gladly reduce the rent to half again. I don't want to list the exact amount just in case someone is able to search on CL for me, but let's say the apartment is $1500/mo, I'm charging $900 for one room rather than $750. It's really not a huge difference, but even that little bit is doing a lot for my peace of mind. I'm not out there to make money on this deal, I just don't want to be stuck with a bum roommate again and the higher advertised rent is doing its job in weeding out the more undesirable applicants."

My friend had a cape on made of a neckband that he had tied several long pieces of mesh fabric to, in a rainbow pattern. The wind was up, so the cape was whipping around pretty dramatically.

At one point I was sitting on the curb, talking to another member of my group, when his cape drifted into my face. I looked up and I saw that he was doing it deliberately. We laughed, I pushed the cape away, and we carried on.

Then he did it again. I laughed politely, and moved away. Then, a few minutes later, he did it again. You can see where this is going. As this continued, my reactions progessed:

* ""Hahaha.""
* ""Yeah, Ha. Okay.""
* ""Dude. Please stop.""
* ""Goddammit, what's your problem?""
* ""What the fuck?""

The final time he wafted his cape into my face, I grabbed a length of it, doubled it in my hand, and then cut all the pieces of fabric with my pocket knife. As you can imagine, my friend was pissed.

The reaction from our group seemed to be mixed. One woman said that she didn't know I was ""so violent."" The couple of people I was talking to kind of agreed that our friend had pushed the joke well past where it was funny.

I answered it honestly, and BF could not disagree more. He was telling me how I was wrong, how it would be considered cheating and that I always let SO get away with way too much, I should not let him do those things etc. He was honestly disgusted.

I told him there was no right or wrong, and that it's just whatever a couple decides fits them the most, and this would be my choice.

We continue the conversation about the topic, healthy debate-style, and I ask BF if he ever did -the thing I would allow- while single. He said yes and told me the story, mentioned a few of the guys names who also did that, and conveniently did not mention my SO's name. I asked him if he knew if my SO did the same thing, and he claimed he didn't know. I said it would be okay if he did, because it would have happened when we didn't even know eachother yet, and even if, I would be totally fine with it and he would tell me when I got home and asked him anyways. (truth. my SO is deadhonest about these things and does not care.) BF kept playing dumb.

&#x200B;

I get home, obviously tell my SO the story and ask him if he ever did those things. he says yes. together with BF, and some of the guys they went to do this.

The next morning, I text BF saying I find it very two-faced, he talks sh\*t about SO daily, yet keeps something that meaningless from me and lies to my face. I get you don't tell on people, but this would not have caused any sort of drama, and he doesn't shy away from spilling things that can cause drama. He calls ""bro code"", I call bullsh\*t. To me it feels like he left me wondering, so I would go home and possibly have an arguement with my SO. BF is known to stir the pot.

&#x200B;

I asked him and I quote: ""So you are literally favoring him over me, and are lying to my face, because SO has a d\*ck?"" , and he said ""yes.""

My parents are good parents aswell as people but there is one thing that makes them bad in general,

How they handle there spirits they are both as bad and i have had many a night were ive had to be the adult and look after them because how they have been, my moms drink is vodka and although nowadays she is just bad near christmas and family death aniversaries my dad is another question... to put things short me and him have had the same argument for the past 6 months that ends up ruining my saturdays and its because of the whiskey it wouldnt be to bad par from the fact that they both get to forget everything everytime something like that argument happens i dont have that luxuary.

My main point is i want to be able to  get drunk and have fun on my birthday and not worry about them.

I also told them that i wont talk to them if they do drink spirits and ive made it clear that its just the spirits and that they are more than welcome to drink anything else but now im feeling bad about whole idea so i come to the internet AITA"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Me and my friend are on a very competitive dragon boat team where we take things very seriously!
Along with that team we are on our high schools team as well who really don’t care at all (I have a bunch of story’s about that team and if you care you can find them on r/dragonboat) So this was the second day of our regatta (dragon boat festival) and we are racing only with the high school team today. Now we are on the line up for our 200m (important information for those who don’t know, during a race you go AS HARD AS YOU CAN UNTIL THE COACH SAYS TO LET IT RUN!!!)


Sit up,

Paddles up,

GO!

We are maybe 50 meters from the finish line and some people decided that they are done and STOP PADDING! A. BIG. NO!
So my friend who is sitting behind the people who stopped yelled something along the lines of:

“What the f*** guys?! Keep padding!”


The race finishes and people are PISSED at my friend for what he said (he admits that it was a bit far but it was a bit of adrenaline and a lot of anger)
Later the coach pulls him aside to talk to him, our teammates hate him and even the head coach of the team tells the team at a meeting later (to the entire club of over 100 people) that “you can not coach your teammates and if if you don’t like what they are doing to suck it up”

Now I would like to say we came 3rd in that race but it was so close that if everyone kept going we would have gotten first 


Now me and my dragon boat mom are COMPLETELY on his side,  it a lot of people are giving him hate 


Is he the asshole?

bz0bd4	2019-06-10 17:01:11		AITA for telling my 16 y/o sister that if she needs someone to buy her Plan B, don’t come to me?	"So this is going to require some backstory, and I apologize in advance.

I'm 20M for reference. 8 months ago she texts me she had to tell me something. When I saw her next I asked what it was, she cried and said she couldn't tell me. I eventually guessed it, and told her to get in my car and I'll take her to get her Plan B. She had the money but I guess she was too scared to go buy it herself.

Afterwards I continued talking for awhile (into ~4am) to make sure she was okay before I went to bed. I told her that my gf and I have needed it, she's not alone, she's not a bad person, etc. A couple days later, my gf approached my sister in private to tell her nice things and comfort her. My girlfriend asked for my permission to do this, but it was completely unprompted and just a super nice thing to do, since they had never spoken much before. After this we were both on really good terms with my sister.

So 1 month ago, I tell my parents the date I'm leaving college (5 hours away) for summer break. My sister texts me asking me to leave ~5 hours earlier so that I can drive her to visit our mom who may be visiting. I said I already have established plans and I'm not changing them. She says i’m selfish, inconsiderate, not willing to put family first, etc. I stand my ground and she tells me to ""fuck off"" and blocks me on all social media. She does this whenever she's mad at me, which is usually when I can't/won't do her a favor. A couple hours later my girlfriend realizes she's blocked too, not sure why.


Here's the AITA part

A week later I’m home and one of the first things she says (in a casual, laughing, not mad tone) is ""how did (gf) react to me blocking her?"". I tell her that it was rude, that my girlfriend was hurt, and she needs to learn better conflict-resolving skills instead of cutting people off at the slightest provocation. She crosses the line by telling me ""well maybe you should't date a freaking twelve year old"" (because my girlfriend is really short and my sister thinks she looks really young) before heading to her room. Keep in mind that my girlfriend has been NOTHING but incredibly nice to my sister. A couple minutes later I text her:

The next time you have something to say about me or (gf), remember who you came crying to asking for Plan B at 16 years old. Because the next time it happens, it won't be me.

She expectedly told me to fuck myself and said she's ""never associating with me again"". On one hand what I said was harsh, but I'm so done with her taking advantage of me (or my girlfriend) for favors, and completely throwing people away when they can't do them. Furthermore, she's sixteen years old. IMO that's old enough to face consequences of your own words.

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I are nothing but supportive to my sister, who acts entitled to favors at her disposal. Made a personal attack about my girlfriend, told her to not come crying to me anymore."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bz0ao9	2019-06-10 16:59:45	Universe7891	WIBTA If i go on vacation 2 weeks AFTER my mom had surgery	"Not a long story here, basically the title says it all. My mom is going to get surgery and i want to go on vacation with my friends 2 weeks after that. She told me that she is very disappointed in me and no other son/daughter would do that but i dont see a issue here. Iam 19 years old and not living at my mom´s place anymore if that matters. I will visit her in hospital and try to help her the following 2 weeks until i go on vacation. To be noticed she is not happy with the way the vacation is planned, because i will drive a long time alone for the first time. I think that is the real reason she doesnt want me to go. She often tries to get what she wants by letting me feel guilty. So am i the asshole here? Iam asking here and not my friends because my mom doesnt want to let anyone know that she has to get surgery. Thanks in advance for your opinion.

&#x200B;

EDIT: For the people asking: My Vacation would be about 10 days. Its surgery to remove some breast tissue because a very early stage of breast cancer was found with the mammography screening and to make sure, that everything is taken away they will remove some breast tissue. The breast will hurt after that and she ll probably need help with carrying things as example buying food and stuff, but i can help her buying that so it´s enough for the ten days iam away. English is not my native language so apologies for awkward spelling, grammar, etc. She is living alone but there are people she could ask, i just dont know if she will do that because she doesnt want anyone to know as i said."

bz0a9o	2019-06-10 16:58:49	pennysaurusrekt	AITA: Roommate trouble	"Hey Reddit,

AITA? My roommate moved in in January to get out of a bad situation with her parents. My roommate is 25 years old. We're good friends. She suffers from pretty crippling depression and spends most of her time in her room either sleeping or crying (she's still trying to get over the ex-fiance that cheated on her a month or two before the wedding. This happened last year). Now, she has little habits that bug me that I've told her about. For example, I've asked her not to put big pots/pans in the bottom rack of the dishwasher, otherwise, the dishes on the top don't get cleaned. She continues to do so. I've asked her not to use the clothes washer as a laundry bin. She just tosses her dirty clothes in there as though it were a hamper instead of using the actual hamper in her room, meaning I have to pull out all of her dirty clothes if I decide I need to do laundry. She continues to do so. The biggest issue I have is her inability to lock the front door. I work afternoon-night shifts and when I come home, the front door will be unlocked and she'll be passed out cold in her room. We live in a dicey neighborhood and I've told her a dozen or so times now to double and triple check behind her that the door is locked. There are shootings on my block every month or two and it's not safe. Even in a good neighborhood, it's not safe. AITA for asking her to move out if I find the door unlocked one more time? I don't feel like I can trust her, and it's not like I'm asking anything outrageous of her. JUST LOCK THE DOOR. DON'T PUT POTS AND PANS IN THE DISHWASHER. DON'T USE THE CLOTHES WASHER AS A HAMPER SO I HAVE TO ROOT OUT YOUR DIRTY CLOTHES TO WASH MINE."	Not the A-hole	0	0	17.0	5.0	0.0	0.0
bz09ft	2019-06-10 16:56:47	BSLMK_52621	AITA? Puppy ate my Louboutins	"This morning I was rushing to get out of the house because I had to get an Uber to the express bus to work since I left my (30F) live in boyfriend (31M) use my car because he was working overnight and his car is in the shop.

Over the weekend we had a wedding and I wore a very beautiful pair of expensive shoes (700$) that he had gotten for me this past Christmas, and to be transparent, I never said I wanted these but it was a very thoughtful gift and I love them and wear them any chance I get, even when it kills my feet!

In my haste to get myself ready for work, feed and walk our 4 month old puppy and manage to get out of the house without him following, I left the shoes in a bag on our kitchen table (I was not aware I had left them at this point). I was commuting into work and got a very nasty text from my BF with more than a few choice words because our puppy had somehow gotten to the shoes, and in his words, destroyed them. I am very upset about this and of course understand why he is upset, but it was an accident. I feel terrible but don't think cussing me out on my way into work was a warranted reaction or needed to be quite that aggressive or harsh, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	13.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
bz08v3	2019-06-10 16:55:34	Negative_Brick	AITA for bailing on a (former?) friend's wedding?	"""Jenny"" and I met in 5th grade. We're both 30 now. And as life goes, friends go down different paths and grow apart. I get that. 

&#x200B;

So Jenny and I were quite close in high school and college. Then during grad school, she basically ghosted me. Which, hey, I get it -- you're busy, life's busy, you don't have much time to hang out. No judgement there. 

&#x200B;

But it reached a point where I would reach out, try to get together, try to invite her to things, etc and she'd just....ignore me. So finally I called her out on her bullshit and got a woe-is-me story about how she'd just been so busy and gotten so depressed that answering a text here or acknowledging an invite there was too much to handle. And honestly, I understand depression makes these kinds of things tough (and idk if she was ever actually diagnosed with depression or if that was just an excuse) but all the while, I'd watch her post on social media and spend time with other friends, so I felt her failing to simply acknowledge me, even if it was to decline my invitations, was pretty a-holish on her part. So I stopped trying.

&#x200B;

And four years or so went by. No contact, occasionally she'd tag me in something but no real conversations, no hanging out, no nothing and my life was fine for it. 

&#x200B;

So then out of the blue a month or so ago, she texted me asking if I'd be her maid of honor. The wedding's next fall. And I accepted, partially after my SO and mine and Jenny's mutual friend said it'd be the right thing to do, I could repair our friendship that way, clearly I'm important to her if she's asking me to be her maid of honor. So I accepted, and I was kind of excited about it, and I even said she should come see my new place and meet my new dog sometime. She said she'd get back to me and to this day, hasn't. 

&#x200B;

And now I find myself dreading the wedding. I thought I'd get excited for it but I really just can't. It's not till the fall and it's gonna be a commitment -- 3 hrs away, gotta stay over/board the dog/spend money etc and I kinda feel like dropping that kind of cash on a wedding I don't care about isn't a good idea. But I told her I would be her maid of honor.  


So thanks for bearing with me. AITA for dropping out of maid of honor duties now? I don't know if I'd drop down to just regular guest level or not go at all, tbh I kinda don't wanna go, my job makes weekends off rare and the thought of wasting a free weekend on a long-ass drive for a wedding I'm not into is making me cringe."

Safe to say I have enough on my own plate to deal with but I always try to be as supportive as I can of my family. 

To make a long story short my parents have always had problems as any normal marriage but ever since me and my older brother became adults their marriage problems have become magnified and more out in the open. They constantly yell at each other about nothing but stress when my dad gets out of work, and always seem to have something to get upset about whether it’s finances, blaming each other for stress, etc.

This past week was my parents 15th anniversary and they were planning a trip to MA together. I guess they got into an argument along the way and my mom said she didn’t want to go and to leave her behind. My mom then called me to pick her up, and even though I really didn’t want to I felt like it was still my obligation since she’s my mom I’m living under her roof etc. As soon as she’s picked up she starts complaining to me about how my dad is such a child, and how she can’t believe how him etc and I straight up tell my mom that I know how it is and I don’t want to hear about it. She tells me that she can’t believe I’m taking his side, and I say that it’s not a matter of that but that I love you both and whatever marriage problems you guys have you need to deal with on her own and she says whatever.

bz05rk	2019-06-10 16:48:36	sadmomanon	AITA for wanting distance from my husbands family due to my anger and jealousy?	"A few years ago my husbands family member was babysitting for us. A tragic accident happened and my child passed away. The cops intended to charge that family member with child endangerment/child neglect but let us decide. My husband was supportive with whatever I wanted but in the end I decided not to go through with it because 1. I know this family member loved my child and didn't mean to have this happen 2. I feel like I wouldn’t be able to go through the trial. I blamed them but also myself for not being there.

&#x200B;

I told this family member I forgave them but I wish I never did. I just wanted to make them not feel as bad as I do. Now nobody talks about it and it really feels like they don’t feel bad. I see that family member 1-2 times a month but I still have a lot of anger in me. I am always very polite but when I get home I get upset. I am pregnant again and am really emotional. I see my oldest and know the little one won’t have as close of a relationship due to the age gap where my other baby should be. I never know how to say how many kids I have or their ages.

&#x200B;

Now this family member and their bf/gf are pregnant. I am just so angry and honestly jealous. Why do they get to have their child and be happy? Why do they get to just move on like nothing happened? My husband tried to explain how that family member had talked about not wanting kids because of how sad they were and it’s like really? That pisses me off more because obviously they weren’t that sad and scared if they are about to have a baby just a year later. I always knew this would happen but I thought I’d have at least another 5/10 years.

&#x200B;

I feel like such a jerk always being friendly and now deciding I don't want to be involved. I feel so conflicted because as family I love them, I guess I’m just sad for myself. I feel like I’d be the bad guy for bringing sadness and pain into what should be a happy time for both of us. When I make this decision known, I feel like my husbands family will be supportive of them and we would basically be cut out. Especially because we already have kids and it's our choice to not be around them but it will be their first and they aren't as well off financially nor are they close to the bf/gfs family. The kids could have been so close and now I don’t want to see them ever again. I know I’ll have to but I’d prefer to keep it to Thanksgiving or Christmas only. We used to be really close to them and actually had them live with us for a bit so this would be a huge change. I feel like I’m making my husband choose though and I know that’s not fair but I just can’t forgive them. I told my husband not to talk to me about them but that I want them to have a relationship if he wants, just don’t involve me.

We also see each other a couple times a week. We live about five minutes away from each other. I love her very much and overall, she has been a good mom to me. To understand fully why I don't want her there I need to give some background information. I feel as though she hasn't been there for me the past two years. In 2017 I found out I was pregnant. I was considered high risk and at one point was put on modified bedrest. I was living with my best friend at the time but decided to move in with my parents temporarily for extra help. They have a downstairs bedroom which was perfect for me. While I was on bedrest the doctor told me, I needed to avoid the stairs. Well after a few weeks my dad’s friend moved in. My parents gave him the downstairs bedroom and made me move upstairs. Even after I stressed to them what the doctor had said. I didn’t argue because it’s my parents house.   I ended up having my son five weeks early by c-section. I asked my mom if she would be in the delivery room with me and she told me no. I understood. I also asked her if she would stay up at the hospital while I gave birth. She said no to that too. Again, I understood. My best friend was there for my delivery and visited me and my son every day after I gave birth. One thing you guys should know is my parents run an in-home business. My mom says it’s too hard for her to get away. When my son was 6 weeks old, I was in an accident. I broke my back, had internal bleeding, pancreatitis, and my stomach and intestines stopped working. I was in the hospital for over a week. My mom visited me a couple times. My best friend visited me several times and was very active in my care and recovery. The following month I had my spinal fusion surgery to fix my back. I asked my mom if she would take me. She said no. My best friend volunteered to take me. She stayed before, during, and after the surgery until I was placed in a room. I stayed in the hospital for four days that time. My mom didn’t visit me once during that hospital stay. She said the drive was too far. Fast forward to last month. I find out I have a certain protein in my blood that indicates cancer. Last week I had a bone marrow biopsy done. I asked my mom if she could take me to the biopsy. She said no. She scheduled a doctor’s appointment for the same time. My best friend took me. Well the other day my mom called me. She told me she wanted to be there for the biopsy results. I’m feeling very conflicted about this. I wanted my best friend there with me. I could have both with me but I don’t think I want my mom there. I don’t know if I’m valid feeling this way though. My mom is able to leave her home during the day when it’s convenient for her. She just pays someone to cover her. So, would I be the asshole if I told my mom I didn’t want her to go?	Not the A-hole	0	0	27.0	12.0	0.0	0.0

bz035l	2019-06-10 16:42:30		AITA for contacting my old roommate's family for outstanding bills?	"I used to live in a house with 2 other roommates and we split the bills evenly.  
I moved 5 months ago but I just kept the gas bill and venmo charged them.

RA = Roommate A

RB = Roommate B

&#x200B;

RA stopped paying the bills to both me and RB starting last fall. She abruptly quit her job and told us that she was going to only focus on her schoolwork, which was fine. Both RB and I were working while also in school so we weren't in a tight spot to cover the bills.

Fast forward to today, it's June and our lease ends next month. She hasn't paid any of her share of the bills for over 7 months and ignores and denies our venmo requests to do so. She doesn't pick up her phone or reply to our texts. Both RB and I are 8+ hours away so we cannot get in contact with her. We talked to our landlord but he does not care.

So I messaged her parents on facebook messenger something like this:

""Hi Mrs.1234, I was one of RA's roommates in school and we have been having some problems paying the electric and gas bills because RA has not been paying her share.She currently owes me $xx for the semester and owes RB over $xx. I’m sorry to message you over this but she hasn’t responded to our Venmo or texts requesting she pay her share. ""

&#x200B;

Neither of her parents replied. Okay, they may not know how to receive messages from people they don't know.

&#x200B;

So I commented on one of RA's mom's pictures on facebook.

""Hi, I've messaged both you and your husband about your daughter's outstanding bills and I have not gotten a reply yet. In case you did not see the message, RA owes me and our other roommate approximately $xx for gas and electricity bills. She has repeatedly ignored our requests to pay us back. Please get in contact with me soon""

Her mom deleted the comment an hour later

&#x200B;

Lastly I commented on the picture

""Hi, I've messaged both you and your husband regarding bills your daughter hasn't paid yet. Please message me back as this is an urgent matter.

For some context, I have a chair in my living room that I kept a hoodie on. She decided to sit on the chair and I guess she wasn't aware that her period started, so she bled on my hoodie. The affected area was maybe the size of a bank note.

She was embarrassed but I told her it's no big deal, lets just go to the laundry room together to get it washed. While I'm at it, why not bring a couple other pieces of clothing that could be washed.

She looked at me blankly and said ""I'm not washing this, it was an accident"", and it was, but at the very least she could accompany me to the laundry room and we could both load a machine. Time is of the essence when blood on clothing is involved, so I'd rather not wait until she left to get it in there, and I'm not leaving a date in my apartment alone. I didn't have to wait long because she left minutes later with some choice words for me.

Was I the asshole here? She isn't returning my texts. I honestly don't care anymore; we had a fun time and I'd like a second date, but I guess this isn't going to happen."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bz01gl	2019-06-10 16:38:30	DesignerCricket	AITA for “Using” My Father for Money?	"Ok so for reference I’m a young adult. Basically, I have a very strenuous relationship with my Dad. A few years ago, my older brother found out that my Dad had been cheating on my Mom for a long time with many different people. My Mom tried to make it work and give him a chance to earn forgiveness, but he continued his actions. Now in 2008, my Dad lost his job after the economy tanked. Prior to that he had been the primary provider, but after that my Mom became the main income source for our family because she had assets from her family. Long story short my parents get divorced, and my Dad gets half of my Mom’s money. For context, I love my Mom more than anything, and she is an amazing woman, so obviously the way my Dad hurt her impacted me a lot too. I don’t wanna go into full detail here, but he’s done a lot of really crappy shit. 

&#x200B;

Now as part of the divorce agreement, since my mom had significantly more assets than my Dad, my Mom is covering the entirety of both mine and my Brother’s University. Anyways the way the agreement is set up, expenses up to a certain value (lets say $100 for arguments sake) are covered by my Mom (so technically $50 of that would be from my Dad, despite my Mom paying all of it). Now the issue comes when expenses exceed that. My father seems entirely unwilling to discuss anything with my Mom. Anytime she tries to talk to him, he says “I’m not covering anything over the amount agreed in the settlement, you can pay for it or he can get more jobs”. So basically, my mom ends up spending a lot more than my Dad because I choose to live with her when I’m home from university, and she also has to pay any expenses exceeding the amount agreed upon. 

&#x200B;

Now my brother has basically cut himself off from my Dad, and chooses to have almost no contact with him. I have taken a much different approach. I feel like my father has basically emotionally fucked up my brother, Mom, and I, and then left with half of my mom’s family money and refuses to pay for a lot of the stuff my brother and I are used to. All of our necessities are covered (I know that I am incredibly lucky, and maybe come off as a spoiled brat here), but things outside of that either my Mom pays for or we pay ourselves. 

&#x200B;

Now here’s the kicker. By keeping a relationship with my Dad (not an amazing one, we see each other probably about once a month) he will just randomly give me money, and sometimes I can get him to pay for things, as long as my Mom isn’t involved. On the one hand, I feel like I’m using him, but on the other hand I feel like he took advantage of my Mom for years, and don’t really feel bad about using him somewhat as well. I know I’m not entitled to his money, but given he took most of it from my Mom, who would have spent it on us, I feel its kind of insane how he wants to keep it all to himself.

bz01e8	2019-06-10 16:38:20		AITA for being upset with my parents about their house rules despite living off of their dime?	"I’m 18 and moved overseas. I was there for several months and I left knowing my dad’s health was not in tip top shape, however he had not been diagnosed with cancer.

I’m from a rural area. Maybe 600 year round. Incredibly small and my city (yes city) is probably only the size of a college campus, and then it’s farmland for hundreds of miles.

I moved back home while living overseas on a whim because my parents were diagnosed with cancer. Both of them at the same time. I was an immigrant so that means I had to uproot and stop all of my incoming benefits and the benefits I would’ve gotten when I enlisted, which was the original plan. Now that I moved back I also have to go to Chicago and tell a representative of the army that I have to have an exemption and soon I will be considered a runaway of the army if I don’t go. Chicago is where the consulate is to speak to someone about my service.

I am home taking care of them. Taking them to appointments, making them meals, going shopping, all on their dime. I also am taking care of my siblings, who are two adults that have low functioning autism. That means I am taking care of four people whom I drive around, feed, not to mention my sisters take a lot more supervision and care than my parents do. I am also cleaning the house, doing all the laundry, and all other home chores. All of course for free but I am also eating their food and living in their home completely free. I am also able to borrow a car since neither of my parents work and there are two cars.

I’m resentful of moving back and helping because now I don’t have any free time and I am burned out. Technically I have plenty of free time at night: anytime past 6:00pm more or less. For example, last week on Sunday, I really wanted to go to my friend’s house at around 7:30. Everything in the house was done and my sisters and parents were practically getting ready for bed. I asked if I could take the car and go and my dad said no because “7:30 is really late for a Sunday and you’re by yourself, so no.”

I got into an argument with my mom about it yesterday.  I asked her why me, an 18 year old, cannot go out by herself. I understand it is her house and her rules, but it isn’t like we live in an area where crime exists. My city is literally the type of city to prosecute you for jay-walking. I could’ve understood better if we lived in a place like downtown Detroit but we don’t. All my mom said was to not argue with her and if I “don’t like it I can leave and (mom) can always find someone else to help (her)”. 

She let me move to the Middle East all by myself, intending on joining combative military, but God forbid I go out at 7:30 pm on a Sunday night. AITA for being upset and questioning my mom about it?

I also smoke weed almost daily for the last year, and I smoked weed for the first time 2 years ago.  And I've been smoking/vaping weed on my commute for the last 8 months.  

So far I feel like I'm a very safe driver, with a pretty clean driving record, only a few speeding tickets over the least 15 or so years.   The traffic speeds reach anywhere from 80 mph to stop and go, it just depends. And I do feel like weed does make me a little bit worse driver, but at the same time its been safe for 8 months, and I'm not spacy or distracted.  I stay in my lane, have okay reaction times, maintain distance between cars and generally don't drive recklessly.  I used to rally and do motocross in my teens, so I feel like I have some experience with driving.  And I have no experience with alcohol or other drugs, so I don't really know how impaired I am compared to other types of DUIs.

byzyvt	2019-06-10 16:32:32		AITA for giving up on our friendship?	"So my roommate and I have been friends for a very long time. We're in our late twenties and she started dating this guy 6 months ago. This is her **FIRST** bf ever. Anyway, this guy is kinda shitty. He seems extremely neurotic and kinda insensitive. A few months we had a game night at our place where he shared with everyone he didn’t understand why women got to keep 50% of funds after divorce when statistically men make more money... This rubbed a few people the wrong way, but my friend always makes excuses for him: “he’s just used to being right” and “growing up he was in a very traditional family”.

I finally had it when I saw that after she had surgery on her foot this dude was having HER wash dishes while hopping on one foot while he sat and talked to people. On top of that I've also seen him tell her to be quiet when she was **hiccuping**.. He also strikes me as manipulative. For ex: she decided not to wear a bikini to a family gathering because she’s afraid it might catch the attention of one of her bf's BROTHERS and possibly trigger him into anger. Unless I’m reading this wrong.. that is *control*. I DID openly share my feelings with my friend and tell her all this- how I felt about this guy, why I thought he wouldn’t be good for her long term- and while she acknowledged where I was coming from she also felt he was “the one” and continued to date him.

Recently we had a massive fight because I got her a job interview through a connection and she bailed (the day of) twice!  I confronted her about this explaining it made me look terrible and she straight up told me she thought I was selfish and that she felt she did nothing wrong. I also made her cry during this exchange- she's sensitive and I was super direct in my delivery. I later found out she told her friends about this fight & that she and her bf thought I was a ""toxic"" person. (I never told her I knew this) Since then we sorta made up but our relationship is so awkward and distant it’s like two strangers talking. 

 I recognize I may have overstepped boundaries by expressing my dislike for him and advising her against the relationship. I know she's a good person but I just kinda don't care anymore. I have now been putting 0 effort into our relationship and never initiate contact even though we live together. AITA in this scenerio?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byzxls	2019-06-10 16:29:39	Tautogram	AITA for discussing off-topic things in a Facebook event without RSVPing to the event (yet)?	"So this just happened, and while this is relatively minor, I'm also at a point where I both 

a) am tired of passive-aggressive comments by people, because they stress me the fuck out and 

b) sometimes need a reality check

&#x200B;

So a friend invites me to an event about a month away. The event says to RSVP on the 25th of this month at the latest. My job being the way it is, I usually have trouble knowing whether I have vacation or time off when I want. I can't just straight up say yes/no at any time to things, because I need time to plan and check if I will have time (and energy, because a long day at work may not leave me with much left for after-work activities). 

&#x200B;

An acquaintance replied to the event a week ago saying she didn't know when she would be there, because she was attending another event (big workshop thing) prior, and didn't know when she got off. She used the name of the event which, while it gave a hint about what the event/workshop was about, still left a lot to the imagination. Curious, I asked what the event/workshop was about. I got a reply, and replied in turn that I thought it sounded cool. Nothing more happened.

&#x200B;

Cut to today. I've been meaning to reply to the event (still well in advance of the RSVP deadline) for the past day or so, but I've been ill and honestly, it hasn't been on my mind. Granted, the person hosting the event couldn't know that, but still. Said person replied today to the other comment, with my name, publicly so everyone could see it, saying it was rude of me to reply to an off-topic comment about a workshop without ""bothering"" to RSVP to ""the birthday event"". Now, I want to make clear here that the event nowhere said it was a birthday event, and I had no idea this was her birthday (maybe that makes me a shit friend, I don't know, I'm horrible with birthdays). 

&#x200B;

I was of the opinion that since the RSVP date hasn't passed, I was under no obligation to respond either yes, no, or maybe (which I've gotten crap for doing before, from the same person, ergo, I didn't want to do that). I suppose I could have commented saying I was waiting for info from work, but since the deadline hadn't passed, I honestly didn't even think about it.

"I told my roommate the other day that he’s on his own emotionally for the next time he and his gf fight, breakup, etc. I’ve told him I cannot deal with his shit again. And now he’s ignoring me.

Here’s some back story as to why. My roommate and I have been friends for over a decade, so he knows very well that I don’t sugar coat important things. And when he needed a roommate after his abusive ex of 6 years left I said sure. Shortly before I moved in he started seeing this new girl as fwb sort of thing (it was really dating without calling it as such). But since the start of 2019 it started to go south and in the last month or so its gotten even worse fast. Because she want to sleep with anyone and everyone she wants but throws the biggest jealous hissy fit when he’s chatting with someone in a way that can be seen as flirting she even ruined a couple of his friendships with her sleeping around, the one person he asked her not do sleep with she did (and of course it was an “accident”). She’s very big into the calling him abusive and changing small details of the arguments they’ve had when talking to mental health professionals or her friends and even tried it with me to get people on her side. I’ve seen her texts to him (he lets me read them when he’s unsure if he’s actually in the wrong or not, or just needs someone to actually see what’s being said between them) and anyone that can or has read them can see she’s trying to manipulate him.
So now any time she (she forces it)comes over there’s at least one shouting match between them, someone being called an ass/idiot or a fake anxiety attack from her end the fight she’s started, her anxiety apparently just makes her cry but every time she’s ever cried there’s been no tears. He’s constantly is emotional distress because of her and missed almost two weeks of work for mental health in the past month and a half (after every fight he’s so distraught he needs to take the day off).
He won’t throw her out of his life because he “loves” her but I can’t keep comforting him and trying to help him every time he’s upset (he asks) it’s effecting my depression and anxiety. His behaviour is self destructive and everyone has actually said the same thing that he needs to end it.

Since the day she was born I have had issues with both sets essentially ignoring all of my requests when it comes to parenting her, and I think they have officially pushed me over the edge. 


A little bit of backstory: I grew up with a pretty awful diet. I was allowed to just eat whenever I was hungry, and since my pops has a massive sweet tooth there was always shit food in the house. I obviously grew up with no concept of how to properly eat and ended up overweight, pre-diabetic and with insanely high blood pressure. I lost 100lbs, taught myself how to eat and exercise properly and have been pretty good about keeping the weight off. The eating habits I was taught as a kid still haunt me to this day though, it's a demon I face every single day. I consider myself the lucky one, because everyone on my dads side (him included) are diabetic. 

My biggest request for my kid has always been to not fill her full of shit food and help me teach her how to eat properly so she isn't stuck facing the same issues I have had as an adult. This has gone completely ignored, and I have had enough. 

Saturday night she stayed with my parents, and when she got home she said her tummy hurt and she didn't feel well because she didn't sleep hardly at all. Come to find out, for dinner she basically had a couple full size donuts, a giant ice cream cone and then snacked on candy until bed time. I was livid. 

Then fast forward to Sunday dinner, I show up and she's drinking soda, which she is not allowed to do because it's literally one of the worst things you can get a kid hooked on. I was then lectured by my MIL that my mom feeds her garbage, so why can't anyone else?

WIBTA if I stopped letting my kid hang out with her grandparents unsupervised? She's supposed to go stay with my inlaws for a week sometime soon, and I am seriously considering cancelling the trip because I know she will just be loaded to the gills with sugar all week.

He has a fear of talking over the phone. Since we met online, we have never called. 
We have planned to meet since a few months in about one month.Since we both speak different languages and communicate in english, I thought it would be a good idea to call at least 2-3 times to get used to each other's accent before we actually meet. I gave him this proposition about 2 months ago, told him that if he accepted he'd have to mentally prepare himself and he agreed. 
I proposed him a few times to call during the last 2 months and he would always said he wasn't ready and promised we would call a few times before actually meeting. Quote: ""I promise we'll have a few talks before you come here but I am just not ready yet..."". Which I accepted. 
We're now barely one month away from meeting. The occasion showed up again. He said it's not gonna happen because he's way too scared, that he already told me by the past he didn't like talking on the phone and said we'd call once we met. 

So now, I am certainly not the one who would want to make him feel uneasy. But I told him I didn't understand why he would promise something he knew he wouldn't do. To which he responded: 
""[My name], please just fucking drop it. I don't want to talk about this anymore. Maybe I did promise something, but my thoughts can change. [My name], it's time you face reality and realize the fact that not every promise can always be fulfilled because people's mindset about something can change.""

I don't know what to do or think. I thought promises were that one thing you have to hold above anything else. I don't know what to think. Maybe he felt pressured into doing it and didn't want to hurt my feelings? But even then, I let him the choice. And he usually isn't someone who hides what he thinks just to make others feel better.
This was on top of a ton of stuff he told me he would and kept post-poning/decided not to do in the end. 
I never asked him to promise things, I only proposed him stuff that he made seem like he was sure he would do (outside of unexpected events). Am I just crazy? Do I lack social norms and live in a fantasy world? I'm actually sad, this happened so many times. 
I feel like I can't trust him even though I want to and I'm just blinding myself, but maybe I'm the one who's wrong and I need to grow up."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Cory is a genuine guy and we get along great but he tends to be a little rude sometimes. He doesn't get on amazingly with his mother (I understand some people just don't bond with their parents, and vice versa) and is frequently blunt and lid of rude with her when he's on the phone with her. Same with his dad, and sometimes with us too.

We were having lunch today in school and I was pretty nervous about a certain exam, my friends knew this as we discussee it earlier. One of the girls asked me to explain something to her regarding the exam, so I was talking to her then. Cory decides to ask me something (can't remember what it was, but I don't think it was related to the exam) and I ignored him because I was talking to someone else.

"My ex-wife and I divorced almost two years ago and don't co-parent great-mostly just try to ignore one another unless necessary for us to interact (not mature, I know, but my attempts to change that were not met kindly). We have three children together and the youngest, Evan (8), has been struggling the most with the divorce. The past few months he’s been having meltdowns when he doesn't get his way- if we go to a restaurant he likes but that one of his brothers picked, or if he is made to clean his room instead of playing video games. He will yell that we're all mean, he doesn't like us and call his mom to come get him. She does, and then an hour or so later he gets dropped back off. I've asked her to not come get him, that it’s my parenting time and he has to learn that he can't run away whenever he doesn't get his way, but she basically told me to f- off.

So I picked the kids up Friday and told Evan that if he called his mom to come get him that he had to stay with her all weekend and I would see him again the next day I had custody (I have him two days a week and three weekends a month). He got mad Saturday morning over multiple things and called his mom to come get him. When she showed up, I reiterated the new rule to him and told her that if she took him she was keeping him all weekend. She basically blew me off and they left. A couple hours later when I was out with the other two, she called to see where I was because Evan had cooled down and was ready to come back and she had ""things to do."" I reminded her that I told both of them if he left that he was with her all weekend. She blew up my phone all day angry because she had plans and couldn't find a sitter, Evan called upset a couple times but I held my ground. He called Sunday and was apologetic and asked if he could come to church with us and I told him yes and kept him the rest of the day and he was much better behaved. My ex says I am an asshole, which I’m used to, but then when I told my mom and sister, they also said I was too harsh and should've let him come back Saturday and I find a different way to handle the behavior issues. I was feeling pretty proud of myself until I talked to them. Should I drop this new rule or just ignore their opinion?

&#x200B;

Update: Wow, thanks for all the responses. I got a lot of really good advise and things to think about. I have made an appointment with my attorney to discuss getting Evan into therapy that she can not interfere with and also to find out my best course of action for when/if she shows up in the future. Wanted to jump on and answer a couple questions, though. A lot of people asked how Evan was contacting his mom- she got him a phone for Christmas. He is not supposed to bring it to my house bc I once took it away when he and his brothers were bickering all day (they all go their phones taken away). Evan told his mom and she told me I had no right to take his phone away since she paid for it. So I told her that the phone stays at her house when he is with me but half the time he hides it and I don't know he has it. He will also call/text her by getting one of his brother's phones. Once he even went in my office and Facetimed her on my iPad. I usually don't know he's doing this because the things he decides he is going to call her about are random and often benign. Once, he called her because he didn't want to go to Lowes. He whined about going, I told him he couldn't stay home by  himself so he had to go and proceeded to finish cleaning up the kitchen. Less than 10 minutes later and his mom is at the door to get him. He hadn't thrown a tantrum or anything-just normal whining that my other boys did at that age. Later that afternoon when all the boring errands were done and I was about to take the older boys to a movie he got dropped back off. Mostly when he calls her he is not emotional and crying- he just isn't getting his way and is frustrated. The older two got the same way at his age (heck they get frustrated now if they are told no) but they didn't have the option at his age to have someone come get them so they go their way."

byzo2b	2019-06-10 16:07:52	Ghiurret	AITA to keep inviting my sister’s ex-boyfriend to our house even tho it makes her uncomfortable?	"Im 16M and my sister is 18F. Her ex is also 18M. 

They dated for a year and broke up last month. Before he started dating my sister he was my math tutor first and we became good friends because we liked the same sort of stuff. Then we were in the same clubs (science and math Olympiad) and he was kind of like a big brother to me and helped me a ton with figuring out the kind of subjects I want to go into one day.

They broke up because my sister wanted to go to the same university as him but didn’t get in, so she wanted him to go to her school instead and he said no. She said he broke her heart and she thinks he broke up with her. 

I still invite him and some of our other friends over when we’re getting ready for competitions or just hanging out. He doesn’t go through the main house and just slips in through a side door directly into the basement where we all hang. My sister never even sees him but gets really upset when she sees his car in the street. 

My mom is also really upset and says I’m putting this guy over my own sister. She says I’m nothing without family and I need to rethink my decisions. My dad is indifferent. AITA to keep bringing this guy over for hangouts and things?

**edit:**the reason I keep inviting him over recently is because we’re preparing for a state engineering competition. My dad is helping to sponsor the costs (materials and things) so all the stuff is at our house and no one else on our team has a large basement to work out of. 

But obviously since we’re all friends we still laugh and goof around now and then. My sister lurks around and if she hears us laugh she tells our mom that we’re not working and to kick us out."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

and this time i want to go back (i go to church sometimes, there are one near my campus) for doing that job as bassist (and taking some rest ofc, it's kinda painful doing  job shipping groceries to customer without any tools, and i hate this job), and my parents are forcing me to stay by saying my dad needs to visit doctor (since his heart attack some years ago he visits them sometimes like once in 2 months, but he never does it anyway) and no one will do the shipping since everyone works at the store are off.. and they said i need to rest at home, not there

then i simply reply the man that asks me ""sorry, but i suddenly have some trouble within my family"" because i can't attend the rehearsal, am i the asshole here?

My issue is that I (25F) seem to be the only way my two estranged (51 F) and (62M) parents communicate. 

Some context, growing up all I saw them do was argue with each other for the most part. Neither were really happy being married, they pretended , but I could hear them scream and rage throughout the house at night. Admittedly, they're both selfish, and have their own various addictions.

More context: My grandfather was a good business man, and through his hard work and investments he provided a large inheritance for his family when he died. After his death,the family split and sued over what they thought was deserved. Grandma and Aunt vs Uncle and Dad. After the settlement,they agreed to never speak again.

Cue my mom and 4 year old me some 10 odd years later. Through a letter she wrote, she reunited my dad with his mother for the sake of her youngest grandchild that she had never met (me).

Then,Grandma got sick twice and went to the hospital , Aunt and male cousins came up both times to take furniture and other items out of her house that they believed they would inherit one day (contrary to what Grandma's will read out).When I was 18 and Grandma was put in a nursing home,I was charged with caring for her house, and making sure no one removed items. 

For 5 years I paid bills, fixed things on my own , and kept people out until the estate sale took place. The will was fair, and we used our money to buy certain items we wanted.

Most of us didn't go overboard,and had money left over. However,my dad BOUGHT EVERYTHING ELSE.
This meant that my mom ,and her mom (Memaw) cleaned up the trash ,and put the good items in storage units so the house could be sold .That was 7 dumpsters hauled away, and 5 storage units (my dad has hoarded too much in his own home to fit more stuff). I had since moved across country(for health reasons),or I would've been there to help.
The past 2 years my parents have fought over every detail of the sale.This means it sat on the market for 2 years and depreciated, the lawn went overgrown, the roof leaked, the house became dusty and overwhelmed with cobwebs and as such, it sold for way less than wanted and they're now pissed and blaming the other. 

Today: we have until Friday to get the last miscellaneous items off the property, AND we only found out due to someone calling my mom and I because they saw movers . My mom is across country with me now, and neither of us have money to fly out.She wants ""get what she worked for""and to argue. He will do the same. They can't have a phone conversation for starts.
 I know neither will listen to me , they will yell at each other and I will be the one with liquid intestines and tears as a result.

I set it 3 weeks in advance and let everyone know, even made a post on the event before the party so everyone would be reminded.

Well, only 2 people showed up.

Some people messages me and apologized and gave me a whole slew of reasons  (I was tired, busy, something came up, etc) and some have been offering me gifts.  I just told them that it's not about the gift at all and that I don't want to know who they are anymore.

edit: I'd like to add that I spent 150 dollars on food and drink before the party

edit2: A lot of people are missing the point. It's not about people not showing up. It's about people saying that they are going to come and then not coming, without letting me know.  People who couldn't make it, or had to cancel are fine in my book. It's literally just the people ghosting.

This happens maybe over a year ago when I went to a group gathering and there were some new people there. It was fun meeting new people and all but there was this one guy, who kept staring at me when we were there. We all exchanged information and he of course had my Facebook. He messaged me a few times. Didn’t really mind at first but it got annoying as his messages came more and more often. He would talk about things I wasn’t that interested in but just said it anyway to initiate a conversation, and since I didn’t want to be rude, I replied. I even thought he was stalking my profile for a while as he keeps on commenting my posts (the older ones of course) and added my irl friends too. Maybe I was just overreacting, or so I thought. So I tried not to mind at first. That one time when I was absolutely pissed was when he asked his friend to message me and ask for my information. When I confronted him about it he straight up denied it. Did he really think I was that dumb??? And that’s where I set my boundaries, no one gets to me by lying to my face, okay?! I replied to his message less and less but they just kept coming to the point that I straight up ignored the guy (yeah, sounds kinda douchey on my part).
But he just kept being creepier. He would message my friends, talking about how much he liked me and asking information about me that I wouldn’t ever give to strangers, so much that it annoyed them as well, I felt so embarrassed. He gave me a lot of gifts as well but I denied it every time. That one time I completely lost it was when he stalked me directly to my home and acted like nothing. Not being able to stand this any more, I confronted him about how uninterested I was and would appreciate it a lot if he would just leave me and my friends alone. And you guess what? He didn’t take that much of a hint and just kept being like so. So I blocked him on every social media I had and avoided him as often as possible. 
My friends guilt tripped me about how I was being a bitch to him and how he was so nice when he gave me that many gifts or how he was being so loyal chasing me for so long.

byzgbt	2019-06-10 15:49:46		WIBTA for abandoning my parents?	"So I'm (22M) an only son in a Muslim household in the UK. I'm pretty much agnostic though I still keep up the image for my parent's sake. They're not hardcore muslims but they are still muslim. They're not abusive (Though to be honest my dad does have a temper which flares up about once or twice a year) but more just stifling.

I want to move out and get my own place. The mortgage for my parent's house will be paid off in about a year so I figured I'd move out then.

A couple problems though:

1. My parents come from the middle east where it's the norm for kids to live with their parents for life. I remember when I was younger both my parents telling me through tears that I should never move out and forever live with them. The one time I mentioned it as a joke just to test the waters, they got extremely mad at me (Not yelling, just a sharp tone) and told me not to even joke about it.
2. Even if I were to leave anyway, the issue is that they don't have any savings. My dad's been a Taxi Driver for the last 20 years and my mum's never worked. When I say they don't have any savings, I mean they literally do not have any savings. At the end of each month, some of my money goes towards paying off the bills. I accept it as my way of paying rent so whatever. But even when their mortgage is paid off, they're going to struggle a bit. And what about when my dad stops working due to old age (Which honestly is going to happen in the next few years)? They'd have no money to pay for even groceries.

I could send them some money every month though I'd be stretching myself thin but I'd be happy to do that though I'm not sure if I'd have enough to spare.

The thing I worry about is when they're old and have trouble moving around. My mum doesn't speak a lick of English so she herself is already pretty limited in what she can do. What if she was at the shops and she collapsed? Who's going to translate for her? I know it's long term but I don't think I'd ever be able to afford a carer to look after them full time.

My reasons for wanting to move out seem petty even to myself. I want to be able to eat bacon and drink in the comfort of my own home. I want to be able to not lie about going out clubbing. I want to be able to actually be with the non-muslim girl I'm currently seeing rather than sneaking around. We've only been going out two months and I'm not sure if she's ""The One"" but I know my parents wouldn't approve. My mum went more or less catatonic for a whole day when she found out her favourite niece was seeing a black guy and my dad got into a physical alteration with his brother when he married the girl he was secretly seeing."

I was annoyed at him and did not respond to his comments. I did not talk or acknowledge him the whole night unless he directly said something to me, and I would give 1 or 2 word responses. I wasn’t rude, but I wasn’t exactly welcoming him with open arms.

I have never really had any opportunities to make any money in a traditional sense. In my family chores have never been about money they have been about helping the family (Which I do agree with). In the past my sole ability to get any money was to wait for birthday cash of maybe $50-$100 and possibly Christmas money.

This leads me into what the subject matter is, my summer ""work"". For about 3-4 summers I have spent some amount of time going and helping around at my fathers job (Roofing). In previous years I was able to do cleanup of materials around the work site. However in the last 2 years I have been able to do less and less and my father still pays me around $100 a day as if I was still doing the same amount of work (cleaning up from around 8AM to 8PM) from before. As I am writing this I'm at the work area and cannot do anything as it looks bad on thr companies reputation to have a teenager working on the site.

 Currently I have some desired things to purchase such as a better computer or a good phone, however I dont know if accepting money for this ""work"" I am doing is justified.

byzdhk	2019-06-10 15:43:08	apelkey1	AITA for not meeting the group at a midpoint for our roadtrip?	"I have been planning a hiking trip in Colorado with a group of 8 people for several months. Two hikers (partner and I) are in Eastern NE, and the other 6 live about 200 miles north in SD. Communication has been rough to date.  Bob (from SD) and I have done almost all of the planning with little input from the rest of the group.  

The group was to leave Friday evening, drive 9-10 hours through the night, and be in Colorado on Saturday morning. Bob and I had discussed meeting at a midpoint in central NE because the group lives in two different areas. No midpoint city had been determined and confirmed. My partner and I both happen to have off from work the Friday we are supposed to leave, so we considered leaving Friday morning and meeting the group in Colorado on Saturday. Once my partner and I decided that we wanted to leave earlier on Friday, we informed the group of our intent to do so. This notice is 10 days before we are supposed to be in Colorado to start our trip. The next day after informing the group that we (partner and I) will be meeting the group in Colorado and not at a midpoint in central NE, Sally (Bob's partner) texted me to express his/her disappointment that we (partner and I) wouldn't be riding with them. Sally says that there wasn't enough notice, that they had been counting on using our vehicle, and now their trip will be really tight with 6 people and gear. This makes no sense to me because they were going to have to get 6 people and gear to our city 200 miles south of them, or a midpoint anyway.

I've apologized to the group members who expressed their disappointment, but I don't feel as though I've actually done anything wrong. We had never confirmed a midpoint location, and I gave them 10 days notice to figure out how to get 6 people to Colorado without meeting us somewhere in the middle. I keep stewing on what transpired because I don't feel like I did anything that justifies them being upset.

I'm looking forward to insight from this sub. I'm open to finding that my actions were unfair.

byzd7j	2019-06-10 15:42:24	xnattie	AITA for showing my best friend her bf’s tinder profile?	"One of my best friends and her bf were in a long term monogamous relationship. We’re all in the same circle of friends, but I’m a lot closer to her than her boyfriend though. 

I was on tinder and I came across his profile, which came as a total shock to me. I was kind of at a loss for what I should do. On one hand I didn’t feel like it was right for me to keep it in the dark, because I had information that my best friend deserved to know, but on the other hand I felt bad for meddling in their relationship. I also had the dilemma of figuring out how to approach this if I were to tell them about what I found. 

Ultimately I decided I shouldn’t keep quiet about it and decided to tell my best friend first. After all we’re a lot closer and if I had to choose between the two of them I felt more loyalty towards her. I thought about whether I should confront the bf first and give him a chance to explain but I thought he would just lie or try to convince me to keep it a secret. I didn’t want to be put in that position where he could potentially plead for me not to tell. 

Anyways I sent screenshots of the tinder profile to my friend and asked her if she knew about it. She did not and was absolutely livid. We started talking about how this could happen and I tried to offer some reasoning, like perhaps someone stole his pictures and made a fake catfish profile, but she said it seems unlikely because some of the photos that were used were private photos they’d never posted anywhere on social media before. The profile also said he and I had a handful of mutual Facebook friends, which makes the fake profile theory even less plausible. And to top it off, my friend confided in me that they were currently on a break as of a few days ago. 

So about 20 mins after we talked, her bf ended up calling me and he started yelling at me. I was being totally calm and trying to level with him, stating all these facts that seemed highly suspicious but he just kept saying it’s a fake profile, I’ve never had a tinder before. I really didn’t know what to believe. 

In the end, they worked it out and got back together. I still don’t know what the truth of the situation was but I didn’t feel like bringing it up again. AITA for starting this drama?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	28.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

Awhile back, my oldest and what used to be my closest friend growing up got married. He had a small wedding and the wedding party plus the bride/groom all stayed in the same house that was rented for the event. None of us really know her that well. For the most part her family and her friends all peaced out and left after the brief reception. His friends all stayed and that night we proceeded to celebrate fairly hard. After all, we were basically the only ones to actually set things up, prepare for the reception, and then clean up after. 

Things went well until that night. The new bride proceeded to lock herself in her bedroom and kick out her new husband to sleep on the couch. That morning we found out that we were no longer welcome in this rental house (which was several hours away from home) and were instructed to leave immediately. The reasoning was apparently because we all proceeded to party and not really include her. Tbh we all thought they were having their own celebration the way a newly married couple would be. 

Needless to say, we all felt hurt and a bit betrayed. And none of us have really spoken to her since then. We eventually aired this out and he did his best to defend the situation and claim that it wasn’t her that was mad, but him. Which was a lie. 

Now I am getting married and we are all a tight group. None of us - and I mean none of us - want her there because it will be a smaller wedding and it’s just awkward. So AITA for inviting only him to this wedding?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I have spoken to my managers boss multiple times in the last week trying to make myself more visible and asked for advice from a VP in the marketing department (I'm in training) who said that he would help me prepare for the interview and give me a recommendation if I wanted it. 

&#x200B;

A part of me feels bad for not giving him any information I find out about the job such as where it is posted (to be clear he has not asked me for this information I just found it on my own by going out and asking around for where to find the job listing) and other information I find along my search but he has not taken any initiative to hunt down this job which makes me feel like I am just putting my best foot forward while he is waiting for the job to fall into his lap. It is not that I am taking opportunities away from him I am just not throwing him a bone to make it competitive.

So I just graduated in May. I had this big graduation party and I invite all the people I care about, including one of my closest friends of 5 years. He of course says yes.

So it's the day of the party, and he is still coming. Then he tells me he'll be late. So I wait. About two hours into the party, he texts me that his underage friend (17), who was his ride, was drinking. I told him to sit tight, and make her sober up. He says okay. I wait another hour or so, and then he texts that he can't make it.

I later learn that instead of sobering her up, he drank with her, then got high (for the record, he is also underage). He talked about how he was sorry he missed it, but that he didn't trust her to drive.

I want to make this clear, I'm not angry he didn't let someone drunk drive. I told him not to let a drunk driver take him. And I wouldn't be angry if he would just acknowledge his mistake and apologize for his part, but that's not what he's doing. He's blaming it on his friend, when he could have very well just told her to wait until after the party. 

I texted him a heartfelt message yesterday about wanting to put this all in the past, but that he needed to acknowledge his part in all of this, but he ignored it and just changed the subject without any acknowledgement. I just feel so hurt. He's been a close friend for a long time, but this isn't him.

byz9mn	2019-06-10 15:33:53	bipolarexpr3ss	AITA for accusing a girl of using her mental health as a crutch to justify her shitty behaviour?	"Sorry if the title of this is wank, I didn't know how else to sunmarise. Also, new to reddit so sorry if I'm wank at that too. 

The ""girl"" in question here is my close friend's girlfriend of the past 18 months, let's call her Ruth. I've never particularly cared for Ruth; she's got a real superiority complex because her parents are ridiculously loaded and she treats anyone she deems lesser with this really condescending, snotty attitude and I honestly just have no time for people like that. 

Ruth is incredibly overbearing and jealous with my friend. Like, she won't allow him to follow other girls,  even lifelong friends, on Instagram and she routinely goes through his other social media to check he isn't friends with/following any girls she deems ""too pretty"" (which ends up being most girls) kindof jealous. She blames all of this on her bipolar, saying it causes her to be insecure, and if confronted about it, gets upset and tells people she can't help it and they're being insensitive to the mentally ill. 

Here's the thing. I'm bipolar too, quite severely so. I've been to hell and back with it, but have really gotten myself back on track in the past couple of years and am keeping myself relatively stable with meds and therapy. I get the insecurity thing, really I do, but I honestly think Ruth takes it too far and hate how she uses her disorder to deflect. A week or so ago, my car was due to go in for its MOT the same day I had therapy and my friend offered to give me a lift to my appointment. Ruth asked why I was in therapy and I told her it was for my bipolar. She commented that she didn't know I had bipolar too, and I said ""yeah some of us don't lean on it as a crutch to justify acting like a knobhead"". 

Ruth was quite upset with this. She told me I need to understand that everyone's experience is different and she can't help how jealous and insecure she is. I told her that's as may be, but it's on her to recognise that her actions aren't okay and to learn healthy outlets/fixes for her jealousy and insecurity and that trying to control my friend's social life isn't one of them. She's currently super pissed off at me, and is calling me an insensitive wanker and telling me to keep out of their relationship. I kinda feel bad because I know my friend is definitely getting ranted at about how awful I am. I can see I was maybe too blunt in how I worded it but I'm standing by what I said.

byz8qt	2019-06-10 15:31:40	MessyChelsea	AITA for snapping at my ex-best friend and cutting him off for 9 months?	"*New to the whole reddit thing, been a lurker for quite some time, but I just wanted an opinion. Didn’t know there was a character limit, will answer questions tho!*

A year ago, my ex-best friend, let’s call him C, and I went to my prom as friends. It was great but after we got back to my house, I tried kissing him on the cheek as a thank you & C kissed me on accident by turning his head the last second. After that, we started talking every single day & hanging out every day as well. By the end of the month, people assumed we were dating since we acted like it. 

At the end of the month, C also switched up his behavior & started ignoring me. Soon figured out C was upset with me leaving the state to go to school in Texas (UTA), & we soon resolved it by talking it out. After that we went back to normal & everything was fine, we even decided to start officially dating, till C left for band camp. C didn’t talk to me at all during those 2 weeks & I know C had time b/c I attended band camp for 4 years & we always have time to just hang around. C was responding to everyone else talking to him & was active on snapchat. I just assumed he didn't wanna talk to me so I stopped trying to contact him during camp. At the end of band camp, C finally talked to me & I asked him if C still wanted to be together, C said yes & told me to not worry b/c he wants to, so I believed him. Everything was good for another month til we went on another date & after C stopped talking to me completely. I texted him after a week of being ignored & asked C what his problem was. Turns out C didn’t wanna date anymore & his reason was the same, upset about me leaving, when I told him I already wasn’t going to go, C made up another excuse when I said that. I got upset & stopped texting him. 3 weeks later, C’s with someone else. 

I find out, send C a lengthy text showing my displeasure & betrayal, pretty much calling him a crappy person and how he could have told me the truth. C apologizes & explains how C was “in love with me” the whole time we were in high school together & didn’t wanna hurt me. I didn’t believe C since he was w/ someone who has always liked him & they are super close as well. I stand by what I say & don’t talk to C for 2 months. I see C in public 2 months later & express I can’t talk to him till I feel better about the situation, C said okay. 7 months pass (due to school, work, and handling my mental health) & I shoot C a text deeply apologizing for how I was back then, since I was hurt, & express that I miss having my best friend. C accepted my apology, said he missed me too, but said we couldn’t be friends anymore b/c I was an asshole to him for how I reacted. 

I was hurt and didn’t know how to handle my emotions, and I understand it took super long for me to get my crap together, he was my best friend and it hurt being lied into thinking it’d work out but AITA for snapping at him and cutting C off for leading me on to thinking we had something?"

byz7uq	2019-06-10 15:29:35	rennypen	"AITA for assuming a friend would honour a voucher for her business after it had ""expired""??"	"Ok this has been bugging me so I'd appreciate some outside opinions...My husband's best mate (Jason) has a gf (Cindy) who is known to be quite self absorbed and difficult but we try out best to get along with her for Jason's sake.

Last year Cindy moved into Jason's house and a few months later decided to quit her job and start a massage business (non sexual of course) from the front room of the house.  This caused some tension between them as she was not contributing financially and after a couple of months she had virtually no customers nor made any real effort to get any.

To try and ease the situation my husband purchased a $100 gift voucher from her so I could get a massage and help her out with her business. I was pregnant at the time though and had very bad morning sickness so I couldn't use it right away, then as I became heavily pregnant I didn't feel that comfortable getting a massage.

Fast forward to a couple of months after my baby is born (about 10 months after the voucher was purchased) I contact Cindy to ask if I could book the massage in. She said no problem but she is studying for her advanced massage therapy and could only do appointments on a Thursday. Unfortunately this didn't work for me as I had newborn and my MIL (my only babysitter at the time) was only available on Wednesdays and Fridays (husband worked during the day). So I said I'd leave it for now as I was still breast feeding and preferred to wait until that was over (for reasons other mums will get but probably TMI here).

I finally contact Cindy again 14 months after the voucher was purchased and she tells me that it had unfortunately expired (12 month validity apparently)... when I pointed out that I couldn't book the appointment as she was only available Thursdays she (very reluctantly) relented and said that since I was a friend she would be willing to allow me to use the voucher ""as a good will gesture this time"".

Now I know she did finally agree to still honour the voucher but she really made it feel like she was treating me like a random customer and doing me a massive favour. We would never have bought the voucher if it weren't to try and help her in the first place. So I told her to forget it and threw out the voucher... and now she isn't speaking to me as she thinks I threw her gesture in her face and was not supportive of her business and my husband is annoyed that I wasted $100.

So AITA here?  Should I have just said thanks and booked the massage?

&#x200B;

\*\*EDIT - sorry I forgot to add an important part to the post. There was NO expiry date on the voucher, it was typed up in Word and had about 2 lines on it.

I would have not had so much of an issue if this was a professionally run business but it was anything but. It has since closed and Jason tells us she had approx 6 customers (apart from her brother) in the 18 months since she started it.  They've had numerous arguments as he feels she set it up so she could quit working.

Edit 2:  Maybe I didn’t communicate this properly but I didn’t have a “tantrum” or were rude to her about it at all.  She was very reluctant to honour the voucher so I said just don’t worry about it and left it at that.  
Massage is a very personal service and I didn’t feel comfortable having her do this when she clearly thinks I’m “taking advantage” of her... I’m just annoyed that I was one of her only customers and she made a big deal out of it saying I was rude to even ask.

** I appreciate everyone’s comments, thank you. I think given the feedback that maybe I do have an underlying negative view of her from incidents before this which clouded things for me here too. To be honest I don’t care about the voucher, just wish we’d never bought it.  Live & learn I guess..."	Asshole	0	0	108.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My SILs are starting to ask if they can use our room to breastfeed/pump, which would turn into letting their kids chill out there as well. 

The 4 non-parent adults want the space to remain adults only, and maintain the expectation that there may at any time be R-rated things going on (sex, drunk assholes, adult games, etc). My husband has no backbone for his family and is nicer than me, so he'll probably let these women chill here.

WIBTA if I maintain the expectation and decline to care if a child happens to see adult things if they go into our rooms? Honestly our friends are... passionate enough that it's very common to walk in on them preoccupied even announced, let alone unannounced.

I brought this up with a few coworkers and they were appalled.

"There is a parking lot that's notoriously short on spaces and the alternative is to go into a 5 leveled parking garage, and its quite an increased distance from the lunch spot i was going to. The parking lot has two entrances, one entrance was really close to the open parking space, and the other was the one i entered. I was driving around looking for a space and i saw one and headed towards it. I was on the way to the space when another person pulled into the lot on the side closer to the space, so i sped up a bit and cut into the space while the other driver was still a couple car lengths away. I clearly reached the space first, and again, was headed for it before the other car was even on the lot, but did have to gas it a little to get there. The other driver moves on, no obscenities, no horn honking, no arm flapping, thats it, and the last I see of them. 

I hop out and head towards the restaurant to pick up my lunch, and while walking along the drive, on the opposite side of the drive walking parallel to me is a early 20's couple of an art damaged girl and her bf.
Shes mouthing off really loud about ""WHAT AN ASSHOLE"". and some other words i wasnt paying attention to at first, but by the second and third time i heard her, it started to sink in that she was talking about me. By now her bf was telling her to keep her voice down to which she replied ""whats he going to do..whats he going to do? he needs to know what an asshole he is!!"" and i cut a look over my shoulder and mutter 'fuck off whore', or something along those lines..which i doubt she even heard..  and that was it, they go into the parking garage and i'm mildly annoyed while eating my lunch.

She says she has social anxiety and thats why she can't get a job or go to school or talk to anyone. The problem though, is that shes never really been diagnosed by a doctor, she just self diagnosed herself. 

For as long as I can remember, she hasnt wanted to do anything with her life. She wanted to be an actress but her so called social anxiety is stopping her. She even tried Youtube but her contents trash and shes not exciting.  

Shes lived at my house almost her whole life, staying in her room on her computer all day. There was a whole year when she was nocturnal. She slept at 10am and woke up at 6pm. But she moved in with my grandparents for a couple months before going back to my house. 

Its not like any chance we get we tell her she is worthless and wont amount to anything, but I just get so frustrated with her immature tantrums and whining and under the breath statements. She gets mad over the stupidest things. Once I ate a chocolate chip cookie she made without her permission and as ""punishment""  she held me down and tried to shove a very, almost black, burnt cookie down my throat. The thing was so sharp it cut my face in three places when she missed. 

What im trying to say is having her at our house all the time is really inconveniant because ahes sleeping in the living room so whenever I go into my own living room she gets mad at me for being in her ""room"". She dowant have a job and doesnt go to school and my whole family is fed up with it. 

A couple of days ago she mentioned to her friend on the phone that my parents and I were emotionally abusing her because my dad often says that shell never to anything with her lifw and that she has no authority and should get married and leave us, and I often pitch in. I know its mean but trust me if you lived with her youd be frustrated and desperate for her to leave, too.

But AITA for telling her that shell never do anything with her life and that shes dissapointing her family? Maybe 22 isnt as old as I think it is, and maybe she really does have social anxiety, but i think she should at least be doing something.

Edit: weve tried taking her to therapists and weve tried encouraging her to do something, we only started talking down on her when she turned 21 and still had no intention of getting a job or going to school 

Edit 2: Also my dad will lose his job in a few weeks. My sister knows this and it would help a lot of she got a job to help support us, especially if she lives in our house rent free, but I dont think she has intention of getting a job amytime soon"	Asshole	0	0	9.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

He talks to me more and it’s insanely obvious that Alex is into him too, but Ben doesn’t think so. I keep telling him to go for it. later into the night he ends up getting into a FT call with her, and after a few minutes they admit they like each other and end up getting together. 

I had absolutely no idea this would happen the way it did, I didn’t know if Red would like this or not, but Ben was in a really rough spot and I thought he could use the extra self esteem boost. They’re still together and they’re really happy with each other. 

After a bit of agreeing to keeping quiet about everything, Red finds out, and she’s fucking furious. Now I understand being upset, and I definitely expected it. However, I’ve started a fucking load of fights over the past few months between them, Red has left our GC on Snapchat (Ben and Alex are both in the GC too) and I feel like I got her kicked out of her own friend group.

So a little back story, my dad works very hard. 2 jobs and a lot of hours and I admire him for that. My mom was a stay at home mom for 10 years until she found a job she really liked and went full force into it. She got so involved with her job that she became program manager and eventually a live in. (It was a job working with disabled adults). I admire her for her dedication to her job but some issues came up with it. I have 2 younger siblings and at the time she got the job, I was 10, brother 8 and sister 5. Now because they were both working full time, I was pit in charge of my siblings. When I got home from school it was always them first. I helped them with homework and made sure chores and dinner was done for them. That lasted about 4 years until my mom quit her job and found a new one.

Having to pretty much raise my siblings for those 4 years caused a lot of problems at school because I would never have my homework done and I was really having a hard time mental health wise because I went from seeing my dad occasionally and my mom everyday to not seeing them both for days at a time. I didnt have a social life and I wasnt able to hang out with people at all. 

Now that my mom doesnt work as much anymore she is home more but there are issues with it. I am still the one doing 90% of the chores around the house and it's like they are just naturally expected of me now. I dont mind having chores but I just finished my first year of highschool and it's kind of difficult to make dinner, keep up on laundry, make sure dishes are done and get all homework done before I need to go to sleep to repeat it all again tomorrow. My mom just sleeps while I'm trying to juggle all of these things myself. I get yelled at constantly by both parents about how I am lazy and dont do enough when it's literally just me doing it and it's very irritating because all my mom does is sleeps and watches TV while I am expected to do all of this. I even do the grocery shopping and cook all meals just because my mom doesnt want to. 

AITA for wishing they wouldnt expect so much out of me? I just want to be a normal kid being able to hang out with friends but it's hard because I have all these things to do and if they dont get done I am not able to do anything and I get yelled at on top of it.

Update: I continued to write what I did down and decided to show someone different (a friend of our familiy) and they said it was pretty ridiculous and basically what you guys said in the comments. She offered to talk to my mom and despite how much I didnt want her to, I agreed and my mom came up and said so what did you actually do today? And I told her that I did my chores plus everyone elses today and her reaction was ""that's all?""

My dad raised me until I was 13, we were always very close. I basically picked up all of his good habits/qualities. When I was 10 he developed a drug addiction and by 13 he was a the top of the line for opiates in the surrounding tricounty area and our house was constantly filled with strangers, with or without him.. My mom came and picked me up one day, he was arrested a few weeks later. 

Until I was 13 mom brought me to visit as often as she could do a 4 hour trip one way. She also kept money on his books. (They've hated each other since I was 2.) He got arrested again when i was 22 and i found out because i hadn't heard from him in weeks and it was a long mess. Multiple trips bringing him states away and finding out he was bringing meth with him. I kept money on his books and he never even said thanks. 

I'm 24 now. I've told him I know what he does, I dont like it but I dont judge him and accept him for who/what he is. I've just ask that he not block me out. Not to treat me like another member of the family that thinks hes scum, because I dont. He taught me so many great things, even in his faults. 

I dont call him anymore, but I still message him and plan out ""phone dates"". I tell him i miss him and would love to hear from him. Every time that comes around he never calls. He never answers my calls. He kind of just ignores me. I honestly dont think he knows how much this all hurts me. He feels like I dont ""need"" him anymore.

Honestly, her and my dad's marriage never went well: it was pretty rushed and my dad eventually realized she wasn't who he thought she was, but that's beside the point. I dont rly consider myself 'part' of that family since I've moved out as soon as I could.

Anyways, from my understanding, anytime he would bring up divorce, she would bring up christian faith to talk him out of it (on top of flailing around crying and begging). So once they had a child together, she decided to name him ""Jeson"", coming from ""Jesus"". My other step brother and I don't even get along well, but we both agreed that that name will bring nothing good for him in the future. In fact, even after these years, the only person who calls my little brother by that name is his mother. Everyone else opted from nicknames such as 'honey', 'sweetheart', etc.

I did jokingly mention it to my dad when he originally told me about it, but he just laughed it off. Honestly, it doesn't matter really, because it's still his name and it's not going to change (unless he decides to change it himself once he grows up) but I still can't take that name seriously to this day, not matter how much I love him.. I just want to know what the reddit community thinks of the name.

Whenever I mention having a little brother called ""Jeson"", everyone's response is, ""wait, what's his name?""

I've also tried mispronouncing his name and calling him ""Jayson"" instead, but a certain someone insists on ""Jeeson"", so I guess its gonna be remain ""Honey"" for the time being.

&#x200B;

Edit: I guess I misused the word ""mispronouncing"" since it offended some people. It really is just people reading ""Jeson"" as ""Jayson"", which became a nickname for a short while."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byz0oy	2019-06-10 15:12:24	misswrenbird	AITA? I was called as a reference for a bitchy coworker and I gave her a glowing recommendation so I wouldn’t have to work with her anymore.	"Title says most of it.  

This coworker is a totally nightmare. She spreads gossip, is completely rude, talks shit about everyone, and is late constantly. When she is here she tries to avoid answering calls and spends her time doing her makeup and watching YouTube videos. I dread days that we work together because she treats me like garbage (for example I’m training for a new position and she yells at me constantly that I’m too slow answering her questions and that I should just know what she’s talking about automatically even though I’ve only been doing this new job for three weeks).  I was honestly surprised she even listed be as a reference seeing she’s called me an idiot multiple times.   

Last week I got a call that she applied for a job at a local bank and wanted to know about her work ethic and if she worked well as part of a team.

I basically told them she was an excellent worker and an asset to the team and they would be lucky to have her. She makes my life miserable and I just want her gone. I had tried going to my manager before but it went no where and I saw this as my chance to get rid of her. 

Today she came in and gave her two weeks notice so excited she got the job and immediately began insulting us saying she was going to make SO much more money while we were stuck here.

When I told my friend what I did she told me I was an asshole for screwing the other company over. Honestly I don’t regret it at all, but I wanted to know AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	321.0	67.0	0.0	0.0

byyxr5	2019-06-10 15:05:14	But-ThenThatMeans	AITA for declining to show a boarding pass at the airport when buying water?	"So, in the UK at least, at the airport when you buy something the person on the till usually asks for your boarding pass. My understanding is that you do not have to show your boarding pass, and it is something that the companies use to avoid paying more tax. In the past when travelling alone, I have always politely declined to show my boarding pass without any trouble. 

Last week I was at the airport, and was with my partner was buying a bottle of water as I stood nearby. My partner was asked for their boarding card, and turned to me (because I had both of our boarding cards) and before going into my bag I said basically ""ah, you don't need to show it"". 

But the person on the till seemed kind of insistent, so my partner just wanted to show it to them. This wasn't a long drawn out thing, at second ask I immediately pulled out the boarding pass. Afterwards I said it's only so the company can pay less tax, and I personally would rather them pay that tax than keep it themselves. Whilst my partner agrees with that, they say it's kind of an asshole move because the people on the till aren't taking the money, they are just doing what they are told, and might even have quotas to meet. 

I don't care about it THAT much. When i'm on my own, I will politely refuse, but obviously would never make a big fuss about it (especially when my partner was paying, they can do what they want), the only reason I didn't initially hand it over was because I didn't want to rummage into my bag for our boarding passes when you don't need to show it, and also would broadly prefer not to. 

So, AITA in this scenario, and more generally AITA for refusing to show my boarding pass? I didn't think that it may have an impact on the till staff, and if it does, would show it in the future."	No A-holes here	0	0	635.0	87.0	0.0	0.0

i proceeded to call 15 other people just so I could try and find someone to help me with the project, i'm so mad she left me this was her idea in the first place.

byyv4h	2019-06-10 14:59:10	sexinmydrawer	AITA for not wanting to watch a marathon of the extended edition LOTR?	"My boyfriend and I live together and have been together for about two years so far. We are by no means movie-goers. We have never been to a theater together. The last movies I watched in theater were Argo and the first Hobbit movie. We watch a TV series at home here and there, but I prefer watching no more than one hour at a time. 

I’ve seen all of the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) movies with the exception of the Return of the Rings in theater. I didn’t really particularly care for them. I felt like they were too long - in general I don’t like movies because of the length, but I felt like there were some very extensive landscape and fighting scenes in LOTR. 

Lately my boyfriend has been trying to get me to watch all the LOTR movies in one day - the extended edition. He has seen them all multiple times before. I told him I wasn’t interested but he could feel free to have friends over and watch them. He got really upset and said that he wants to watch them with me. I told him that I really don’t want to watch nearly 12 hours of movies in one day, especially ones that I have already seen and don’t really like. He continues to press, so I offer to watch the theatrical versions with him. He always gets upset with this compromise. 

Last night, we were with friends at a bar and he brings this up again, in front of them. I tell the guys that they are welcome to come over and watch them! My boyfriend says, no, I want you to watch them. I remind him I’m not interested and don’t really like them but I would compromise with the theatrical version. He then gets so upset, says I never do anything for him, and that I’m selfish. He pretty much ignored me for the rest of the hangout.  

I find the comment that I am selfish and never do anything for him insulting since I do a lot. I also don’t ask him to watch movies or shows he’s not interested in. We will attend events with each other, but I think an at-home movie is drawing the line.

byyuwq	2019-06-10 14:58:38		AITA For cutting out my best friends from childhood?	"I come from a small town in rural England and have a very close group of friends. About 6 of us in total and we’ve been friends our whole lives and have been through everything together. I love them all like they’re my family.

To cut a long story short, I unexpectedly met the love of my life while visiting America and 6 months later we were getting married in Vegas and I was moving to California (3 years later and we just had our first kid! Things worked out - hurray!). Most of my friends were really happy for me, it was a sudden departure, but we are getting into our 20’s at this point and starting to do other things. I was starting to get restless anyway, living with my parents at 24 years old and going to smoke weed at my friends house every night was losing it’s appeal (if thats your thing then go for it, I mean no judgement I just wasn’t happy anymore). 

I noticed pretty quick that my friends just seemed a little different, well like 3 out of 6 of them, the others were and have remained awesome and just stoked we’re happy. I found that texting them became kind of awkward and we didn’t know what to say, I’d try and FaceTime with them and there’d be nothing - only to see online they’d all been together having a bbq or something. I dont meant to sound petty or immature but it happened enough times that I resented them seeing my call coming in and clearly ignoring it. Anyway, as our friendships drifted my life here got better. I finally got a good job, we found an apartment we loved, my wife got pregnant, life just started going well but I really missed my friends. I really fucking missed them. So once day I call one of them and just lay it out and ask what the issue is and why they dont seem to ever want to talk to me. And he’s like, well you have your better life now so why are you so worried about us here? The whole thing was so immature and dumb, he basically made out that I thought I was better than them because I found a nice life in California. 

Anyway, I told him to grow up and this is all caused me too much stress and im done with them. Haven’t spoken to any of them in about 3 months when another of my friends asks me why I was so harsh and why I think I can just say things like that to my friends after such a long time. I haven’t responded, I feel like this is totally unfair and I’m caught in some teenage girl drama when I have other things to prioritize."	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Each graduate is given 2 tickets automatically, and allowed to apply for up to 6 extra tickets which are not guaranteed. They didn’t give out the extra tickets until a few days ago. 

My girlfriend had expressed awhile ago really wanting to come to my graduation. Of course I want her there, but I told her that I only get two guaranteed tickets, but if I got any extras that I would definitely want her to be there. She understood, and said she hoped she could come, but otherwise she’d just watch the live feed they have of it.

My dad also has expressed that he wanted to invite my grandmother down from across the country if we got extra tickets. We only get to see her once a year at Christmas, so it would be really nice to have her come. 

A few weeks passed and my GF’s mom ended up booking her oral surgery on the same day as my graduation. She asked me about the extra tickets, as she didn’t want to move the appointment if she couldn’t come, and I told her that I wouldn’t know until the beginning of June. She moved it anyways, and had to move it to a few months later since they were booked solid. She said she moved it just in case she does get a ticket, and that even if she didn’t, she wanted to come when we went out for dinner afterwards. 

Extra tickets came out and I was able to get one, but only one unfortunately. I talked with my dad about it, and he said it’s up to me what to do with the extra ticket. I decided to give it to GF since I’m closest with her and really want her to be there, and she even moved her appointment to come. Plus we did not invite my grandma yet or even tell her about it, so it’s not like she’s going to be disappointed like my GF would. 

I told my GF about the ticket, and she seemed happy, but asked if I was sure that I didn’t want to give it to my grandma and that she would understand, but I insisted that I wanted her there. 

Now my dad seems upset with me. He said that he understands my decision, but is disappointed that his mother can’t come. He said that was probably the right choice since my GF did move her surgery for it. He’s mostly upset that we weren’t able to get more tickets than just the one extra. I feel kind of bad about the whole thing, and I don’t know if I made the wrong choice since my dad is clearly disappointed and my GF said she would be ok either way. AITA?"

Upon giving the gift on her birthday she couldn't hide her disappointment. Later in the evening she called it ugly and was giving me a hard time for not giving her what she had asked for. Saying I had ruined her birthday.

"Ok I realize the post title makes no sense, but I'm not really sure what, if anything, I did wrong.  I have a pool and a large fenced back yard.  In the summer I have an open invitation to anyone who wants to come and hang out, cook, etc whenever they want.  Pets are welcome as well.  I've gotten along well with my future daughter-in-law (FDIL) for the last 2 years up until this point.  Yesterday it was a beautiful sunny day and I was expecting a bunch of people to come over/show up, along with my son, FDIL and their dog who they adopted about 8 months ago.  He is a 2 year old large, breed dog, who is they suspect - is other dog aggressive.  Well around 12:30 the first people show up, some friends of mine that have also brought their dog.  I did not know they were coming, nor that they were going to bring their dog who is a big, friendly, energetic, happy dog.  I have no problem with this, but I was thinking ahead to my son & FDIL's dog coming over and how this may be a problem.  So I texted them both to say that ""Rex"" was there already.  She responded back, ""I will stay home with ""Fido"" then.  And I responded back ""Aw"" with a frown emoji.  Maybe I should have said more?  Then she texted that ""We thought Fido had priority over other dogs. I'm working 6 days this week.  It's not fair for him to be by himself today since he will be the rest of the week.""  I said, ""I didn't know they were bringing Rex.  Hang on.""  Then I proceeded to ask my friends if they would be upset if I asked them to take their dog home so that Fido could come over.  They said no problem and proceeded to bring their dog home.  I told my FDIL that they would bring their dog home so that she and her dog could come over.  My son texts me that ""He'll be over soon."" And I asked him if my FDIL and doggo were coming since the other dog was being brought home.  He replied, ""I dunno. We were all set to go and I guess she got upset when she heard Rex was over. She just took Fido for a walk and I'm waiting for her to get back.""  I apologized again and told him the dog was being brought home.  Then he texts that, ""I guess she's mad at me now"".  I apologized again and told him Rex wasn't there anymore.  Then she sent me a text that said, ""Fido and I aren't coming over.  We don't feel welcome.""  I said to her, Please come over - you know you're always welcome here.  I didn't know they were bringing their dog.  And he's gone now.  She never responded back.  When my son came over he said that she went to her Mom's with the dog and left her phone at home.  I texted her later that ""I missed you today."" and still haven't heard anything back.  I'm not sure what I did wrong if anything.  My son said she does this once in a while - throws little temper tantrums and nothing he says ever calms her down.  I've never seen this side of her before.  Someone commented that maybe she's getting her period, which I really hate that comment, but my son said she actually was so maybe that's why??

I went to my dad’s every weekend until I was 13 when he got remarried (I wanted to hang out with my friends more than him and my step mom which he understood) but he and I had a big falling out (my mother never hide the fact that she hated my dad and wanted me to have nothing to do with him) and we just kinda saw each other when we saw each other and didn’t really go out of our ways to see or talk to each other, until last year when we started to rekindle a relationship after my grandma passed, things have been pretty good since. My mom and I always had a very physical relationship growing up. She would fist fight me over any and everything, like putting a shirt in the dryer on accident or getting a ‘c’ on a test or quiz. Super bad environment, super toxic relationship. I moved out with my boyfriend like 3 months after I turned 18 and thought that the relationship was getting better because there was separation and I could be my own person.

&#x200B;

The last few weeks have been really difficult for me as far as my mental health goes and eventually ended with an ER visit and being referred to a new therapist. My boss called my mom, she came, started crying about how she wishes she got me help when I was younger and how much she loves me. I thanked her for being there, because sometimes you just need your mom, and was released to her “care” I went home with my boyfriend that night and took the rest of the week off work. The past week, I asked my dad if I could borrow $50 or $60 to be able to pay for my medicine and part of my doctors visits, he of course said yes and invited me to hang out for the day. While I was there, my mom called him, asked if I was there, I told him to say no because I was curious as to why she was calling him and she started telling him EVERYTHING about what has been going on in my life since I moved out. How my boyfriend and I are pot heads, he has an $80 a week habit, how much of a POS he is because all I do is take care of him, how she’s had to pay my rent multiple times, how we’re always broke, etc etc etc. Edit: NONE of which is even remotely true. 

&#x200B;

Since then, she’s tried calling and texting me but I just haven’t been bothered to respond because my feelings are hurt. She tried calling me last Friday, I let it go to voicemail, and then I get a text from my 12 year old sister saying that I’m no longer invitied on her birthday trip (Billie Eilish concert in Atlanta) because my mom thinks I’m mad at her. I guess I’m not mad, just more hurt than anything. I told my dad what I felt was all he needed to know, given that he’s been out of my life for so long and barely knows who I am as a person, and now any privacy I thought I had is now gone because of her running her mouth.

On Saturday I went to a concert with a friend of mine. It was a big concert hall (20k people) and we had paid a lot for golden circle tickets (standing within 15m of the scene).  The venue had been generous with the amount of tickets in sale, and the area we were standing in was PACKED. 
We've been waiting for the warm up band to start for about 30 minutes when I notice that there's a rather large space completely empty to the left of it. It probably could fit around 5-6 people, so I grab my friend and go there to get a bit more space.
 When we get there there's a guy in a wheelchair with no concert staff/special marking whatsoever, so my friend and I stand in bit in front of him. He starts saying excuse me, and when I turn around, he asks me to move because I'm blocked his view. I'm a short girl, around 160cm (5'2), so usually not the biggest buzzkill for people around me when it comes to.
 I apologize but tell him that the area is packed and if he wants a better view, he should have booked tickets at the sitting areas. He starts yelling, telling me I'm discriminating him for being in a wheelchair. I've never been one for confrontation, so I turn around and ignore him. Throughout the concert he's angrily telling me to move, calling me a cunt etc.

As I was catching up with her in the baggage claim area, a handler with a trolley cart appears and without any word starts loading our bags. We think nothing of it. He starts doing small-talk with us as we head to the exit. 

Once outside, two minutes later, he bluntly asks for $5 as payment. I adamantly refuse, citing that he did not inform us that the service was not free. I also told him that he did not ask for permission before loading our stuff. Finally, he didn't wear anything resembling an employee of the airport would wear. That made me think that he wasn't legit.  

Later on, I recounted this story to a friend. She said that I was the asshole for doing that. She said that I should have tipped him. 

In retrospect, I agree that I should have tipped him. However, a few things prevented me from doing so. First, because I have little experience flying, I did not know that baggage handlers existed and that it is common practice to tip them. Second, the handler didn't ask for a tip - he straight up asked for $5. In the spur of the moment, I thought that he was trying to take advantage of a pair of foreigners going to the US for the first time (as he didn't look like an airport employee). 

If I could relive this situation, I would obviously reject his unsolicited offer. The fact that we let him help us is definitely on us. Lesson learned.

byyj18	2019-06-10 14:30:13		AITA if I turn down a job offer I've already accepted?	"Pretty self explanatory here. My current company is in the midst of imploding. We've lost half the team and almost all of our high level executives, and everyone who's still here is waiting for some kind of acquisition, which seems imminent.

So, obviously, I've been interviewing. And due to the urgency, I interviewed at multiple places. One company that is a pretty well-regarded firm has been very enthusiastic throughout the interview process (Company A). They seem like a great place to work for, and by all accounts, it looks like they'll IPO in the next year or so. They made me a job offer that's a bit lower than my current salary, but I accepted anyway (after attempting to negotiate but not getting much), because of how much I think I'll enjoy working there.

THEN, after signing my offer letter today, I let Company B know that I was removing myself from their process due to this offer from A. I honestly didn't even think Company B liked me that much. But they now seem devastated, and are begging me to come in and talk tomorrow, and are making it seem like they will make an offer that will be a very significant bump *up* from my current salary. Company B is the dominant employer in my city, and it is well known that they have lots and lots of money to throw around. I'm pretty sure I'll stay firm in my decision because it's the right thing to do and I hate burning bridges, but I also feel like I'd be stupid to turn down the kind of money I think Company B is about to offer me tomorrow.

So I guess the question is, is that even an option? Could I conceivably accept this huge monster offer without completely burning professional bridges with everyone at Company A, or would I be an asshole no matter what?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byyiys	2019-06-10 14:30:01	throwaawayeh	WIBTA For outing my brother to my mom?	"My brother (30) has not had a happy life.  Very self destructive as a teen. Depression, anxiety, drugs and alcohol.  About two years ago, he phoned me up drunk and swore me to secrecy and told me he was gay. He told me I couldn't tell anyone but someone had to know why he would never be happy, get married, have children and would die alone.  I told him I didn't care, I would always love him, before I could say more he hung up.  I was hopeful that this would be the start of him opening up but, then he refused to talk about it.

Not much has changed in the passed two years, I would say things have actually been getting worse.   For the passed year he has been unemployed, because his anxiety and alcohol use is too bad. Recently there was an incident (I don't want to get into details).  But it led to my mother and I discussing what we do and how can we help. Whenever anything happens he refuses to talk about it and avoids us.  While we were talking my mom confided in me that she thinks my brother might be gay.  I did my best to keep a straight face and not let on that I knew it to be true.  Now it is the next morning and I am debating telling her the truth.  Not that it matters but I am also wondering if he swore her to secrecy too and she was testing to see if I knew.

My brother is slowly spiraling and I worry he will soon be homeless.  I think I am willing to risk being the asshole and having him never talk to me again (he barely talks to me anyway) to tell my mom.  It is so difficult to watch him struggle but not have him talk about it.  I don't want to push him to come out of the closet but feel that maybe it would be helpful to at least talk to someone?  I worry what will happen if I do nothing, I worry what will happen if I say something. But I primarily worry that my brother would never forgive me. WIBTA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone for weighing in.  Reading the responses it feels obvious that I would be the asshole. I just so badly want to help and fix and want him to see that we love and support him no matter what.  I really needed to gain back some perspective.

&#x200B;

I'm in high school still but I do people's makeup, especially around prom season. I charge anywhere from $5 to $25, depending on how long it will take to do and if they bring their own makeup.

&#x200B;

My family got invited to a wedding, so I was in my room practicing what I planned to do for the wedding. My sister saw me and asked if I would do her makeup for the wedding, and I said of course, and was willing to do something simple for free. She said she wanted what I had on, and I said that she'd have to pay me $5 to do it because it took a lot of time, plus it would be all my makeup since she doesn't have her own. (Normally I'd charge $20 for what she wanted done, so I was giving her a big discount). She agreed.

&#x200B;

Later, she told my mom that I was doing her makeup for the wedding. My mom was happy until my sister said that she had to give my $5 for it. My mom was furious, and said that I shouldn't charge anything because we're related. I mentioned that I offered to do a simple style for free, and that my sister agreed to pay, but she wasn't having it. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	143.0	24.0	0.0	0.0
byyh4r	2019-06-10 14:25:15	jade-blade	AITA for choosing my cat over my brother?	"Sounds insane I know. Please hear me out. 

So about 7 months ago I adopted the most ADORABLE kitten from my university’s local pet shelter rescue program. They were at capacity and had to get these kittens adopted ASAP, and since I have an apartment I share with dad, I thought, why not? 

My dad and I LOVE this kitten. He’s quite at home in the apartment and since he was feral, he only trusts us and a handful of other people. 

My parents are divorced, live in different states. Used to live w mom when I was young, currently crashing at dad’s because he’s close to my uni. my younger brother still lives with our mother. My dad and I “share” the cat, but it’s clear he’s mine because I feed him and clean up after him, etc.

Well, when my mother heard about the cat, she flipped. My brother occasionally comes to visit, but is highly allergic to cats, same as her. The thing is, before I adopted the cat, my brother made it explicitly clear that he never wanted to visit my father again. (We have a really rough and abusive past with him but that’s irrelevant here. I’m trying to patch things up because he’s helping pay for my college, my bro wants to cut him off completely.) she keeps telling me to get rid of my cat!

So when our mother freaked out, I explained what brother had said. She said that was no excuse and that he “had to see his father”. I told her he should be able to do what he wants, and that made her angrier. Several months later (now) he actually wants to come visit bc “daddy has money” so my mom is once again pressuring me to get rid of MY cat, so my brother can stay with us for a weekend. 

I’m telling her to just give him lots of Zyrtec or other allergy meds. We are planning on getting out of the house, a little camping trip or something, while my brother is in town so he’s exposed to the cat minimally. Since he doesn’t live here, I feel like that’s fair. He’s my cat, who’s very attached to me. If my brother were moving in, it would be a different situation. 

My mom is very angry, claiming I’m “choosing a cat over my brother”.

So, AITA for not wanting to get rid of my cat?

EDIT- so I saw a lot of stuff calling me TA for “using my father for money.” I actually don’t ask that much of him and he’s not fully paying for my school. I’m trying to be the “better person”, my mom’s words, not mine, and be nice to him even though he was horrible to me in the past. (He actually wants to spend time with me now. He happens to live close to my school. It is convenient) My brother is clearly using our dad for money but I can’t stop him. My mom constantly encourages us to patch things up with him, she never badmouths him. His behavior speaks for itself, unfortunately. Since we aren’t any serious physical danger, she can force my brother to visit since he’s young. Also, my brother’s “severe” allergies are like, a lot of sneezing, watery/itchy eyes, and at the absolute worst a minor cough. He’s never had trouble breathing or anything. He has a hypoallergenic cat at our mom’s place and it’s helping him build some tolerance to cats. I know allergies suck, but we can go elsewhere for the weekend, probably. Hopefully that clears things up.

My wife (newly weds) comes home and we are all hanging out chilling watching doctor who. She tells me her hands are getting hurt at work (on going problem as she has a latex allergy and their sanitizer is pretty nasty. She has like chemical burns and what not on her hands.) So we are talking and her dad is a judge and i told her i dunno if he had to be a lawyer first or not (because i dont know that process) and as im saying this both my brother and wife cut me off by talking over me (this has been a thing that is happening for a few weeks. When i try to talk they get excited i guess and try to finish my thoughts for me. And no i dont talk like a sloth either.) So out of frustration i said shut the fuck up to both of them. Admittedly i shouldnt speak to my wife that way at all. So my brother chimes in trying to tell me right from wrong. So i told him chiming in wasnt need and wasnt warranted.  I can tell whats wrong from right. So he got mad and kicked a chair across the living room before telling me i was a 'rude ass mother fucker' and storming off to his room slamming his door. 

Thing is i told him before he even moved in with me not to chime in on anything concerning me and my wife, that even if he heard it it was private  and would be handled in private and that he wasnt to chime in on it.

My son is going to university which is downtown, around the same area where my sister's husband owns several apartment buildings. I asked them if they were willing to let him stay for a year since other landlords in the area are charging lots of rent. My sister told me my son could have an apartment but he would have to pay full price. This means my son would have to borrow even more money than he already has. I got mad at my sister for this because she clearly doesn't need the money, as she moved into a luxurious mansion last year. This seems like greed to me because she knows if my son takes loans, she will get $2500 in rent guaranteed every month, and she's too greedy to give that up.	Asshole	0	0	113.0	67.0	0.0	0.0

My husband loves music, plays in a band and is very passionate about what he does. He gigs every month or so in local bars and seems to be quite popular locally.

&#x200B;

I have not been going to his gigs for a while now and I cringe whenever I'm at them. Let me explain why.  


I am a woman in my 30s. My husband is in his 30s.. and the band that he plays in is full on screamo music. I get tossed around in the mosh pit, I spend 3 hours listening to grown men scream until veins pop in their foreheads and for some reason these people love throwing beer - resulting in me going home drenched in beer.  


I hate it. I get it - to each their own, but oh my god I want to drop kick throat punch whoever introduced my husband to this music.   


My girlfriends think I'm not supportive and I am the only one of the ""band wives"" that doesn't go. My husband has never said anything, but I'm feeling a bit bad.

byydv1	2019-06-10 14:17:06	Aly_from_Funky	WIBTA if I didn’t do anything special for my mother’s birthday because she threw a fit?	"This is a lot of petty, messy bullshit. I’m probably TA, but I just want to be sure. 

Alright, so it all starts with the way my mother reacted to my sister and I taking our father out for a birthday dinner.  We went out last weekend (5/31) for his birthday. It wasn’t anything special. No gifts or cards. Just dinner. When she heard about it, she threw a massive fit saying  “you never do anything for MY birthday” and her go-to “you always put him before me even though I raised you”. Wasn’t there when it happened, but my sister lives with her and told me all about it on the way up to our dad’s. 

I couldn’t help but laugh because we literally spend all of our time with this lady and even work around her weird schedule (2pm - 3am Mon - Fri/Sat) so she’s able to actually enjoy the activities we plan without being tired. We see him maybe once a month if we’re lucky and only really spend one major holiday with him(Xmas). She’s mad because we did something nice for him and that made her feel like we cared about him more, I guess? Not like we weren’t going to do anything for her birthday, which is still two months away.

Another thing about all of this that got ME bothered is I’ve always done something for her birthday even when she wasn’t being the most pleasant person, but she only really started doing things for me last year (my 26th).  Every year before that, she would assume I was doing something with my partner. 

Her reason for that is because for my 21st, we got into a huge fight over money (she was off driving and basically left me to provide for my sister who was still in school and needed to be driven to another city and didn’t want to reimburse me). She decided the week of that she didn’t want to celebrate with me, BUT she and my sisters would still go on with the day as planned doing what I wanted to do: batting cage, manicures, and then my “first” drink. The night of my bday, my bf took me out to make up for the day she tried to ruin. She changed her mind last minute and wanted to spend the rest of the night celebrating with me, but I declined because I was already out.

So, no birthdays from (16)/21 to 25. I know this makes me sound like a huge pissbaby. It’s not so much about the birthdays and what comes with it so much as wanting to be treated the way my sisters are, which is far better imo.

Because of that, I really don’t even feel like doing anything special this year. She doesn’t appreciate what we have done for her. My partner supports my decision, but my sister is torn between agreeing and thinking we’d be assholes if we didn’t at least match what we did last year. 

So, WIBTA if I didn’t try to do something extra nice for my mother’s birthday?

TL;DR 

Mom got mad at sibling and I for taking dad out for birthday dinner. Feels like we favor him over her even tho we prioritize her over him. I’m bitter and considering not doing anything for her upcoming birthday."	Not the A-hole	0	0	116.0	11.0	0.0	0.0

byyb58	2019-06-10 14:10:04		AITA for being upset at something my mother said to me?	"Sorry the the long post.

Ok so I (24f) live 3 hours away from my parents house. In 2009 we got a cat who I'll call Belle. Being a cat lover I instantly fell in love with her and her me. She is my best friend in the world and I would take her with me in a heart beat if I didn't live in student housing.

So here's my predicament. Tonight my mum, me and family friend and I were talking and the family friend asks how old Belle is (she's 12). Now I have accepted that she is getting old and may pass away soon and of course I'll be devastated but I can't deny it will happen. Not two years ago our 14 year old dog passed away so I know what to expect. 

So mum is telling the family friend how old she is and then turns to me and says with no emotion in her voice, 

""Now if she gets sick and has to be put down and you're not here visiting I'm not waiting for you to come down I'm getting her put down straight away"" 

When she said that it was like a knife to the chest, it hurt. Her tone and what she said was so devoid of empathy or consideration for my feelings, just so cold. 

I was obviously a bit taken aback and finally managed to say, 
""Well obviously if she is in a big amount of pain and is suffering I understand not waiting for me to come down that's obviously the best thing to do. But if she is sick you need to ask the vet if it's a situation where there's enough time for me to come and say goodbye or not."" 

She didn't even answer me, she turned back to the family friend and tried to change the subject. I interjected and told her you need to promise me you will ask the vet if this situation arises. I had to ask her three times and I finally got a mumbled ""ok"" from her. But I don't believe it. 

At this point I was nearly in tears because she didn't seem to care at all. Fearing that I would start crying I dropped the subject and went elsewhere. 

Now it's hours later and I'm actually crying  and emotional (which I'm sure it's obvious from my writing) cause I'm scared that my mum is gonna put down my cat even if I have a chance to come say good bye and also about how heartless my mum was. I'm hoping to god that when Belle does pass away it's quietly in her sleep. 

What also makes it worse is that she did exactly this when our (previously mentioned) dog passed away two years ago. Except I WAS visiting home, my father and I were both 10 minutes away from the vets and she didn't even bother to call us to let us come say goodbye.

I'm thinking about telling her how I feel tomorrow because if she did this with Belle I would never speak to her again and I intend on telling her that too. 

I'm a little emotional right now and I just want to know if I'm justified in my feelings or am I overreacting?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We didn't ask for help from anybody beyond what they were willing to do, if any. Its 2 weeks before and I message my cousin to see if she was free for the rehearsal and her husband messages me back. They share a FB so I wasn't surprised. He asks what would happen if someone had to work on that day and they wanted to come. I gave him the obvious answer of they'd have to ask off since I can't change the date. It goes back and forth and he tells me I don't care about anybody and I've made it difficult for his wife. So I call her to see what's going on and she's seen the texts and agrees with him. She doesn't like having to choose to go to the wedding or her kid's field trip, so I tell her she needs to decide and let me know. 

Next day she texts me and says we need to talk like ""grown ass women"" and continues to rant that I don't care about her or her family and I never took my guests into account when planning the date. After going on and on I decide to make the choice for her since she can't and tell her to do what she needs to do and I'll miss her.

I recently switched jobs; I’m responsible for managing a lot of people. One of my employees was recently unreachable for six days straight. I was really concerned because he and I had gotten relatively close in my first few weeks of me being at the job and he was a top-performing employee, so I was texting and calling and emailing, but got no replies from him. 

Then, on the sixth day, he sent a text and apologized for being unreachable. He had gotten pulled over and arrested for a DUI (driving under the influence of alcohol). He crashed his car and seriously injured two people. He had been in jail for the past six days. His car was totaled and he lost his license as a result.

My company doesn’t have a policy for this sort of thing, and this employee doesn’t need to use a car to do his job. Nevertheless, I made the decision to let him go. He had missed five shifts. He has a family, so perhaps his SO could’ve called out for him? They didn’t need to explain the situation, just that he was dealing with an emergency and would be out for a week.

We got very close, very fast. She is a personal trainer and I paid for her services for about six weeks totaling about $600. During that time, we spent a lot of time outside of the gym together and were constantly texting and making plans.

Two weeks ago, I told her that I wasn't able to afford onsite services anymore and wanted to go to distance training. Following that discussion, she went radio silent for five days before I texted her asking if I was only interesting when I was paying her. It was a little aggressive, I'll admit, but it certainly seemed like that was the case and I was truly confused.

It's become obvious to me now that she's ghosted me completely. She blocked me on Instagram and Facebook, I believe has blocked my phone number given that she hasn't answered my texts or single call, and didn't answer my email when I messaged her. I don't want to be friends with her anymore but I would really like answer as to why.

Some pertinent information: about three months ago, someone broke into my house while I was home. It was big news in my hometown and I'm obviously still recovering from that slowly but surely. I have a hard time trusting people to begin with but even more so, so for me to trust her enough to let her into my home and become friends with me was a huge deal and I am deeply hurt to have that trust betrayed. Being ghosted is a huge source of anxiety for me to the point that I haven't slept well the last few days because I'm so upset over it. I understand that it's a new friendship and I should just let it go, and normally I would, but I'm not in an emotional place to be able to reconcile that right now.

Quick background.  On Deviantart, artists often hold auctions where you can bid to buy one or more pieces of art. I've participated in a few and have hidden bids a couple times, which I'm  told is an asshole move.



I don't see the issue as long as you're not hiding an autobuy, since autobuy will cause other paying customers to move on. I mean, I understand the disappointment,  but in that case hold a set price sale and don't gamble with an auction.



From my perspective,  it's like being in a store: you may decide you don't want to buy a product after all. This is a risk artists should be aware of, especially when auctions run anywhere from 1 to 7 days!



And in case anyone is curious...no, I wouldn't be upset if it happened to me as long as it wasn't an autobuy. If someone did it all the time, I might block them but I feel you can't just tell someone no retracting bids in this environment.

A family member told me a few times over the last year that she would give me $1000 when I graduated from university. Today is my graduation and in the card she gave me was $50. I am a little upset because she had mentioned several times how much she would give me in the past. I did not say anything to her because it was a gift and she was not obligated to give me anything at all. I would not even be bothered by this normally, but because she had mentioned it several times it feels like I got my hopes just to be disappointed.	Not the A-hole	0	0	1245.0	65.0	0.0	0.0

I’ve been friends with this guy for over two years, and our friendship has been filled with teasing. I’m a really gullible person and he uses this to his advantage. We are also both big fans of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. 

So this friend texts me a photo of sea salt ice cream claiming it’s from a restaurant in my hometown. I don’t believe him right away and just reply with “really? Gotta try it next time I’m in town then.” But I look up the menu from the restaurant and it’s not listed. So I’m thinking “good thing I didn’t really believe him, I wonder if that photo is attached to a recipe so I can make my own?” I do a reverse image search of the photo and find it’s from a random persons Twitter from when she went to the Square Enix cafe in Tokyo. 

I screenshot the tweet and text him poking fun at how gullible I am. He replies with that that was his friends Twitter (later saying he didn’t know she had one) and questioned how I found it. I still think he’s teasing me by saying that was his friend, but I tell him I did a reverse image search. But I didn’t tell him about me looking for a recipe. 
He then goes on to tell me that what I did was really creepy. And that if I should have just looked up the menu. I was really thrown off by his response, because whenever I’ve called him out before he just kinda laughed it off, I didn’t tell him that I did. I tell him that I don’t know if he’s being serious or not and he replies “I can’t deal with this kind of behaviour. When I mess with people it’s in an unbelievable sort of way. Not like this.”  He then insults my maturity, and says I’m acting like a stalker. He was mad at me for not instantly believing him despite all the teasing he’s done before. 

Now we aren’t talking to each other and I don’t know what the truth is... am I the asshole here?

byxzvy	2019-06-10 13:41:23	averagejane4	WIBTA for telling my husband I didn't want his sister to live with us?	"My husband (26M) and his sister (18F) have been very close since she was born. Being 8 years older than her, he basically helped raise her. They are the oldest and youngest of 4 children. Within the past 3 years all but his youngest sister have graduated and moved to different states for their careers. This has been very hard on his sister as his parents can be a bit high strong. They went from having 4 children to boss around to just one.

Recently his sister started dating what I classify as a control freak. He reads through all of her text messages and needs to know where she is at all times. He also convinced her to quit her part time job because it was causing them too much time apart. To my knowledge there is no physical abuse happening. However I am nervous for her. This is not normal behavior.

After a fight with her mother, his sister decided to take all of her things and move in with the boyfriend. She stopped going to school much, though I have been told she did graduate this past week. When my husband found out a few weeks ago, he was ready to jump on a plane home to beat the crap out of this guy and bring his sister to stay with us. The only thing holding him back was that I was due to have a baby any day. 

His parents came out to visit right after the baby was born and told us that they bought a one way ticket for his sister to visit us this summer. She thought it was just a vacation and didn't realize that this wouldn't be a round trip. His parents hoped she would enroll in school out here to be away from the boyfriend. The dad even planned on bribing her to stay by buying her a new car. They basically just decided she was going to move in with us. 

Now I love his sister. But now I have a newborn and I don't want some psycho boyfriend to show up at my house. The idea of an abusive man is very frightening to me and I am scared that he would take his anger out on me and my husband for ""taking"" the sister away from him. My husband is in the military and sometimes has to leave for months at a time. During those times it will only be me, my daughter, and his sister. 

Am I the asshole here? I don't want his sister in an abusive relationship but I also want to protect my daughter from being exposed to this. If I bring it up to my husband I know it would upset him as he's already very protective of his newborn daughter but also loves his sister.


Edit: I have brought up to my husband my concerns regarding the BF. He has the same concerns and had plans to talk to his sister about the bf and what a healthy relationship should look like."	Not the A-hole	0	0	31.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
byxzsf	2019-06-10 13:41:10	NoPrint9	AITA for making my SIL cry at her baby shower by suggesting we should stop exchanging gifts in the future?	"I come from a fairly well off family, and my husband and I do well  (although we both work high demand jobs for it). We’ve always been very generous to his side of the family. Gifts are very much both my husband and my “love language” and in my culture (Chinese), elaborate gifts to inlaws are very socially acceptable as a way to show they are held in high esteem. It also helps with some of our guilt for being super busy and not always around. Additionally, my side of the family exchanges generous gifts. One concern of mine originally was to treat my husband’s family the same as my family, i.e. by not spending way more on my family than his.

Last Christmas, we had some weirdness over Christmas day present opening. I had purchased a lovely cashmere throw for SIL (husband’s brother’s wife). She googled the brand and price then and there (which kind of annoyed me) and later I overheard her make some joke about how she could pay “half a mortgage payment.”  Several hours later during brunch, someone asked her what was wrong (she seemed upset) and she confessed that our presents always make her feel bad, she’s tired of us “throwing our money” in her and her husband’s face, and Christmas has become really stressful with pressure over gift giving. Husband and I apologized profusely, and did some self reflection afterwards on the unintentional effects of elaborate gift giving and decided to go more low key in the future. Although a little part of it has always sat poorly with me since. 

This past Saturday, I attended a baby shower for the same SIL. It’s the first gift giving occasion since Christmas and I really wanted to do it carefully. I asked a coworker who recently had a baby what range is typically appropriate (she said she mostly got gifts between $30-$50) and so I decided on three little things from the registry totaling just over $30. Anyways, at the shower it becomes clear that while certainly most gifts were in the $30-50 range, all attendees who were family members seemed to give more like $100 gifts. Near the end of the event, MIL pulled me aside and said that SIL felt like I was being spiteful to her for  Christmas. I again apologized and as a cover, said that husband and I had written a check for the little one’s college fund as well but didn’t feel it was appropriate to hand to her during the present opening. Then I scurried off to the bathroom and wrote a check for $100. When I found SIL by herself for a second I handed her the check and explained that we wanted to give her this earlier but present opening seemed like a bad time. She looked at the check and kind of bitchily said, “We don’t need your money.”

I kind of snapped and told her bluntly (and not like yelling, but not like in hushed tones either - people nearby apparently definitely overheard) that her that I was tired of her shit and if it made her feel better, we could just stop exchanging presents in the future. She started crying and I immediately left. I’ve been getting my texts from everyone in the family and her best friend about how I ruined the baby shower ever since.

(ETA for additional  context - My husband and his family are American and we live in the US. We are in our early/mid 30s, my BIL is 28 and SIL is 24 or 25.)

(ETA2 - I realized her comment might have made the xmas gift sound way more than it was. The throw was 320 pounds, which isn’t quite half a mortgage payment, but not cheap either. I purchased it for her during an business trip to Scotland last year. It is not fancy looking or flashy at all (light grey)  and not a obvious “ designer” brand, just an old Scottish maker. It was intended to be good quality and last many years. If she hadn’t looked it up I don’t think it would have been an obviously expensive gift.)"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

byxz3g	2019-06-10 13:39:23		AITA for not mending a ruined 6-year friendship because someone is transitioning?	"I (24F) went to high school with Kim (26F). 98% of the time, Kim is the person you want in your corner, but there were times where she would wrong someone and shrug it off like it was nothing.

There was one occasion when she pulled a stunt like that on me, but we were both dumbass teenagers, so I let it slide. The older I got, the more I called her out on how she'd wrong people and deal with it by cutting them out of her life, and she'd acknowledge it but it never actually stopped.

Our blowup occurred when she offered to buy my younger brother's(14M) Xbox ONE. I went to my mom and ran it through her and we agreed to Kim's terms; in 4 months, when she had the money, she would pay X amount and get the console. My brother removed his online ads and waited; he really liked Kim (they shared gaming and football) and he was excited he was getting his money and helping someone he regarded as a friend. Kim and my mom also had a really good relationship.

2 weeks before Kim was supposed to pay, she told me a better option had come up, and ""If I was her friend I would understand."" I got pissed, not for myself, but because she had made a commitment to both my mom and my brother, and my brother had turned down other offers to accommodate her. She turned it around on me and said she couldn't believe I was fighting her over a material thing and she needed a break. She blocked me on almost everything, and that was that. For like 2+ years, radio silence.

Now, people are telling me she is starting to transition (FtoM) and many have reached out to me to check on her (her friends live very far away from us), not realising we no longer speak. They said she's in a bad mental space. I ended up going through every app, in search of one I'm not blocked on, and sent her a message checking in. It wasn't overly friendly, but it was an olive branch that she blue ticked.

Now, these same people are saying I should forgive her and makeup because these last few years have sucked for her and she acted the way she did because she was pre-trans and depressed. I honestly don't see the point in making amends with someone that is incapable of apologising. I forgave her before, but I think she'll burn me again if it's in her best interest. Her friends are telling me I can't compare an Xbox to transitioning, and they can't physically be here for her but I can, and they know how close we used to be. I don't want to be her support when she was happy to cut me out for 2+ years. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I'm not antagonistic but I don't try to hide it either.

byxyic	2019-06-10 13:37:55		WIBTA if I asked for help from my father given his situation?	"My father was recently diagnosed with a lung tumor. They don't know yet if it is cancer, but he had cancer before and he smoked his fair share (plus, he didn't stop smoking after having the first cancer - although his first cancer was kidney cancer). While I would like to say that I'm devastated about it, I'm really not. I'm not happy about it - I'm no psychopath -, but my father and I are not close and we had our fair share of fallouts. I don't want to make this a unnecessary long post or use the past shitty situation to justify the present potential-shitty situation, but let's just say that he never had my best interests in mind. He was not abusive in any way, but he provided no help to me when I needed (depression) and even went as far as to say that my mother cheated on him and tried to kill him. I was 14 at the time - yes, my mother cheated on him. But he forgot to mention the fact that he had been cheating on her for more than 10 years. Obviously, my mother didn't try to kill him (he had a car accident, and he implied to me that she paid someone to cause it - I know, fucking ridiculous).

Back to the present. I don't live in the same country as my parents, and I'm in the process of moving to another country. I'm close to finish my degree, and I'll start my first job in September. While I have some savings, it isn't a lot. It will cover my moving, maybe some basic furniture for the new house, but that will be it. My mother already promised to help me - even though she makes a bit more than the minimum salary. She has some savings, and that's what she will use to help me.

I don't think this is fair. My mother pretty much raised me on her own and made plenty of sacrifices. She payed pretty much all by herself the money required for my therapy when I was depressed. Therefore, I was thinking about asking for my father's help too (with no guarantees that he will). I get he is in a difficult situation, but - to be honest - I think he has a lot more money than he says he has (holidays to exotic places, nice car, two houses, owns a small company, his girlfriend is an accountant, etc). Because I know that he won't help me if I say that my mother will give me some money, I was thinking about lying and say that I really need help with the moving. I know, I'm probably taking advantage of his situation, but I honestly don't think that the diagnose changes things that much, given that he has access to free(ish) healthcare in my country of origin (although it is possible that he is seeking private treatment - his choice though).

So the issue is that BIL(26M) is bit “sensitive” (his parents words). When my wife and I were engaged he complained to his mom that he and his gf had to put their life on hold, such as getting engaged, bc we would be mad if they stole our thunder.y wife and I were very clear that we would not feel any type of way and to please to what they felt was right for them. Bc the reality is by the time they get engaged well probably be pregnant and we’re not putting that on hold for other people. Anyway, point is BIL can be dramatic - not even mentioning all the drama he created *at* the wedding. 

So last month BIL and his gf got engaged. They are not party planners or natural hosts and they both sort of dread having to plan a wedding. They pretty much don’t want to do it and their indecisiveness doesn’t help. 

Last night MIL told my wife and I they were thinking about using our wedding venue. Internally, I hated the idea and was sort of angry. They want to put 0 effort into this, and actually chastised us for having a big wedding, and are now taking our venue. The minimum number of guests for the place is 100 and they only plan on inviting 65 people. It’s confusing why they would even want to pay for 45+ empty seats.. 

A part of me also hates it bc now the place is going to be known as where everyone got married rather than “mscardeno and spouse’s” wedding. Idk maybe I’m being dramatic.Either way, I didn’t say that. MIL asked if we were okay with it. My wife said sure, they can use whatever place they would like but it is strange. I agreed and said that it is a little strange and they should just put in the effort. MIL then said we were being unreasonable, even though we even said that we wouldn’t get mad if they did choose the venue. She then went on about well if they want to do it, we should talk to them and she hated being in the middle.

"I had been planning my wedding for 2 years, the date had been set for almost a year which was on a Friday, so it was cheaper and it was in the afternoon. My bridal party was small, only 3 bridesmaids one of which was my cousin. She's 5 years older than me and we were basically raised as sisters so I really look up to her. 

2 weeks before the wedding I send a fb text to see if she was available for the rehearsal and I get a response from her husband. (They share a FB) and he asks what happens when someone has to work on the day of the wedding. I say they're gonna have to get off if they wanna come, I can't change the date. So he goes on to tell me that I don't care about anybody and I'm a b*tch and I have been making his wife's life hell. 

I am so confused because I haven't asked her to do anything besides be in the wedding, and I say if it was such an inconvenience then she could've said no. And he goes on and on and then starts saying if I didn't have her then I would have ""abominations"" before God. That was a diss to my other bridesmaid and groomsmen who are married lesbians. So I tell him I'm glad he's not coming if he's gonna act like that. So I call her to see what is going on and she has read all the messages and has taken his side. I tell her she needs to choose what she wants and let me know and I'm fine with whatever. 

She hangs up in anger and the next day she texts me she wants to meet and talk. I don't have time to meet since I have a huge list of things to get done so I tell her to get on with it. She proceeds to tell me that I'm throwing everything out of proportion and I don't care about her or her kids and I was rude to her husband and I've been a heartless b*tch since day 1. At this point I'm done arguing and tell her since she's having such a difficult time choosing I'll do it for her. ""You do what you need to do that day, you'll be missed at the wedding. Have a blessed day."" 

Immediately she says I'm a psycho b*tch and that she's gonna find me and ""whoop"" my ass since my Dad didn't do it when I was little. I have torn the family apart and I hope I'm happy with myself and I've broken her heart.

It's been 4 months and I'm being told to apologize and move past this cause it's ""family"" she isn't blocked and hasn't tried to call or text and the last family get together, she pretended I didnt exist. AITA for kicking her out and cutting her away from me? Should I apologize so try to reconcile?

Basically I have 2 living biological kids 8yo and 4yo,  both of whom I almost lost during pregnancy due to health issues.  I have also lost 6 in early pregnancy before 12 weeks,  1 late miscarriage at 16 weeks and 1 stillborn. 

Now,  we have been trying for 4 years since our youngests due date,  last miscarriage was may 2017. Against my wishes my husband posted a pic of the test on Facebook and got all of his family excited as they know we've been trying.  3 weeks later I miscarry and everyone is heart broken. 

Now I'm on new fertility meds and have had eggs frozen for the future if I can't conceive naturally.  I told my friend that if it takes I don't want to tell my husband until 14 weeks just in case (he doesn't deal with it well and has told me he doesn't want to know if we have another miscarriage) and only our parents at 24 weeks,  no one else until birth. 
He called me selfish and a complete control freak for this,  then asked how my husband felt about it (he agrees with me after last time)  
Apparently I have him under my thumb according to my friend and all I'll be doing is hurting the family even worse. He then went on a rant about all the kids in care and how we're selfish for wanting biological kids when we can adopt. 

We're already fostering 3 kids working towards adoption, he knows this,   we were just hoping to have one more biological child before we focus on primarily fostering and adoption. 

So AITA for wanting to do this?

byxsko	2019-06-10 13:22:42	babymussscles	AITA for not wanting to wear a bra around my husband's family?	"My husband never actually called me an asshole, but we did disagree on the answer, and I was curious about whether or not others thought I was in the wrong.

My husband and I have been married for about a year and a half now, and we're very close with his family, but they live a few states away so we only see them 3-4 times a year. Because of that, the times when we see them are the times when we take multi-day trips to stay with them. 

During these trips, there will be times when I'll wake up early to get some coffee, hang around the house with everyone, or just relax and watch a movie for a few hours. During these times, it's my preference not to wear a bra. It's just not comfortable, especially because I have some chronic pain issues, and I don't like having pressure on/around my torso if I can help it. I also just don't feel like it's necessary. His family is very laid-back, and none of them have ever seemed uncomfortable with it. There are definitely times when his mother will be walking around without a bra, but admittedly my breasts are a little more ""out there"" than hers. (Also, any time extended family is visiting the house or we're leaving to do something, I do always wear a bra. I'm solely talking about around the house with his immediate family present.)

However, my husband thinks it's akin to him walking around without boxers ""with his dick obviously showing."" I told him I didn't think it was fair to compare genitals to breasts; after all, it's not like I have my vagina hanging out. He said he just doesn't think it's appropriate. 

Since then, I have started wearing a bra whenever I am around his family, even though it's a pain in the ass, but AITA for thinking it's unnecessary and not wanting to do it?

EDIT: Thanks for the advice! Just to clarify, my husband has never asked me to wear a bra around his family. He just gave his honest opinion when asked and then left it at that, but I made the choice on my own to start wearing a bra around them so he wouldn't feel uncomfortable. My husband is very understanding of my pain issues and would definitely put my physical comfort over his family's weirdness about some titties."	Not the A-hole	0	0	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

My sister (17yrs/F) was out drinking this weekend and I (22yrs/M)  was working the next day. It was not really because I needed sleep because I started pretty late the next day. But the thing with my sister is she has been a real pain the last few months. She's being a bitch to everyone, including my parents and my stepdad. Even to me.

So anyway. She asked me if she could sleep at my apartment and I said no. This is because I have recently moved to my own place after moving away from my ex and I've had a lot of turmoil and anxeity about all this.

So now she's pretty pissed at me and I don't really care about that because she's always pissed at everybody.

He is still going to help with the kids a little but as for rent I’m going to need extra money. My son and is gf are paying almost standard for this area so I feel that it would be unfair to raise their rent so I said they have to move into the room with the other two kids so I can rent out the extra room. This shouldn’t be a problem IMO because my son and his gf and share one bed and my kids share a bunk bed. Son and GF complained that it’s not fair for me to basically strip away all privacy from everyone. son also pulled me aside and said gf has anxiety needs a ””””safe space”””” or whatever but I disagree on both statements. The bathroom can be used for changing cloths and can also be used as a “safe space” if you REALLY need it that badly (which I doubt). Their only other argument was basically how are we going to fit 4 people’s stuff in one tiny room and I just said you can either get rid of some stuff or rent a storage space. in the end I don’t have a choice but to either force them to move rooms or raise their rent which I they won’t be happy with either.

So I (20M) have been watching a show my girlfriend (20F) strongly recommended me, and I'm glad she recommended it because it's been a blast. The thing is, for weeks she teased me about a certain reveal that was yet to come, she teased it so much that I was expecting something really grandiose, I was really really hyped for it. Then yesterday the episode is out (she read the source material that's how she knew about it), she is as excited as I am, if not more about it, and when it's time for the reveal I can see in the corner of my eye that she keep looking at me expecting some sort of reaction.

As soon as the episode ends she ask me expectantly ""So?"", I try to be honest with her and say something like ""I thought it was good, but frankly I feel like you oversold it"", it was then that I felt like I fucked up, because she looked really hurt, she just answered ""Oh, ok then, sorry about that"", and we didn't talk about the episode after, she didn't ask for my theories like she always do and while she was not mad at me I could see that she was still a bit hurt. Today she seems totally back to normal but we still didn't talk about the show, even in situations where we totally would.

I know this seems dumb compared to the rest of the stories I read here, but I kind of feel like an asshole, so I thought I would ask if I'm indeed one.

TL;DR: My girlfriend told me for weeks that an episode would be mindblowing, I was not impressed and told her she oversold it, gf is hurt."	No A-holes here	0	0	27.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

This was the first year I was going to be able to go but some health issues came up and I said I told them I couldn’t go due to them. 

My brothers are investing in a very expensive business venture in Europe that would help build our money and family fortunes in the future. It would be a very lucrative business and they want me to invest and be apart of it. 

My brother offered to pay my entire trip to Europe including hotel/flight and I would just need to bring a little bit of spending money. 

I told my boyfriend this and he was highly upset I even considered due to my health and telling me it’s an ultimate betrayal.

byxiti	2019-06-10 12:56:37	Childish_Ansari	AITA for being mad that my friends didn't care that our mutual-friend catfished my boyfriend?	"Okay, I admit that the ""didn't care"" part of the title must be qualified, but I'll explain:

Everyone in my friend group is in their early 20s. We all have a mutual best friend, E, who (tried? I don't know if it has to be successful to count) to catfish my boyfriend. E, a male, made up a female persona and messaged my boyfriend from a disguised number (as my bf has E's real number) and tried to get him to agree to meet up with ""her."" E then sent nudes (some random girls nudes I guess) to my bf.

While this was happening, E was texting our mutual friends without my knowledge, explaining to them that he had caught my bf trying to cheat on me. My friends repeatedly asked E to tell me, which he didn't for weeks. Finally one of my friends had to message me explaining what they knew. I was livid at both E and my bf--E for betraying my trust and being generally a major creep and my bf for potentially trying to cheat on me/keeping it a secret. That was until my bf had receipts.

My bf showed me that their conversation was entirely one-sided, with E trying to get my bf to meet up/cheat and my bf declining. When E sent nudes, my bf blocked him/the fake number.

Now I am a generally calm person. I don't like drama and I stay on good terms with everyone. But damn, I saw red. I immediately told my friends what really happened and they were shocked. E had nothing to say about it apparently, as he ignored my messages and refused to talk to anyone. That's fine, I cut him out and blocked him on everything. I am no longer harboring any anger towards him, as once I move on from someone that's it. My mental and emotionally health comes first. I don't have strong feelings towards him either way anymore.

My friends expressed shock at the whole event, denounced all his actions as horrible and agreed it was a betrayal (to them for lying/manipulating them, and for me/my bf for all the reasons above). They then proceeded to hang out with E a few days later as if nothing happened. They said they tried to convince him to write an apology letter to me, but he never did (it's been a few months). Not gonna lie, this bothered me. I don't expect anyone to not be friends with someone on my behalf, but them being seemingly unbothered by it all feels wrong to me.

So, AITA for being mad at my friends for not caring/taking no action regarding this situation?

byxiho	2019-06-10 12:55:43	itrainsonme	AITA for trying to (gently) encourage a stranger young mom to make better choices for her baby?	"I’m using a throwaway because my story involves personal details I’d rather not have on my main. 

I am a 37 year old mom, except I don’t have any children. My beautiful, beautiful 9 year old (at the time) passed away 6 years ago due a terrible freak accident that occurred at school. 

As you can imagine, my life has been turned completely upside down and if I didn’t have my husband who is undoubtedly my rock, I would have succumbed to my demons a long time ago. My boy was a ridiculous little ball of happiness and I can always hear him in my mind telling me to keep going and to smile. I am trying to live my best life in tribute to him. 

I was in Walmart with my husband waiting to pick up some meds in the pharmacy area where I saw a beautiful young lady, couldn’t be older than 17, with a gorgeous baby that in my guess was between 10-11 months old. Huge blue eyes, rosy cheeks, he was beautiful. I smiled at her and she responded, and I commented he was a healthy lovely size. She laughed and said yeah, he is. She asked if I wanted to hold him, and of course I said yes and just gathered up this sweetheart in my arms. At that moment, I noticed his bottle laying on the side of his pram, full of what appeared suspiciously to be cola. I didn’t say anything, but not two seconds later a very blustery sort of woman who was clearly the young girls mom came stomping over giving me angry looks, I assume because I’m a stranger. Baby wasn’t fussing at all, but the older lady (perhaps my age) snapped at the younger girl to give the baby ‘his cola bottle’ and so looking rather deflated and meek, she did. 

I didn’t at all acknowledge the older woman, but I said to the young mom as gently as I could ‘hey, baby doesn’t need anything other than milk at his age’ and the young lady’s mother blew up at me telling me to get the fuck away from her grandkid and daughter. 

I gave baby straight back, smiled at the young girl who looked at me very sadly, and then backed out of the situation. My husband later on gave me the biggest cuddle and kisses and told me he loved me, but also very measuredly told me he didn’t think it was appropriate for me to make any comments about what baby was being fed as it wasn’t my place. 

My husband is a very fair man and I appreciate his input more than I can say. I told him I didn’t think I’d done anything wrong, and said because of our loss it’s emboldened me to try and right some wrongs when I see them in our d2d lives. Out of curiosity we both decided I’d write this on here to see what you good people think.

byxhf3	2019-06-10 12:52:35	NoMoreUncle	AITA for telling my sister about my uncle falling for me	"Throwaway account because.... Well, you can tell why.

I'm 26, male. The middle one from a big family. 3 brothers, 3 sisters. We're all ranging from the ages of 38-18, the youngest being my twin brothers.

We're a close family. I was very close with my mums brother (We will call him P). 

As i was growing up, i was more into computers and technology than the rest of my family. P is a software engineer, so naturally i was around him a lot as i found everything he did amazing and interesting. P would often take me to cyber events and computer exhibitions. P was married to a woman but with no children. 

When i was in my late teens, i would often go round to P's house 2-3 times a week to play games and learn how to build computers properly. Me and P would have in-jokes, play games together, watch tv shows, he became like a father figure to me. On my 17th birthday party, I came out to my family as gay. They were all shocked as i don't give off the ""gay vibe"", but they were all really supportive and respected me. P was even more ecstatic than my mum was (was strange at the time, but makes sense now) and we celebrated heavily.

\---

A few weeks ago on my 26th Birthday, i wanted a night out with my mates and i invited P to come as well. Unfortunately it didn't happen on my birthday, tried to reschedule it but everyone was busy, in the end it was just me and P, we decided to go out anyway. We had a very good time, i'd not seen my uncle this happy since before his divorce. We both got very very drunk. I ended up staying at P's house that night and i woke up the next morning to P spooning me. I was still clothed. I went for a shower, while i was in the shower, i heard the door unlock and P came into the bathroom naked. I asked him what he was doing and he asked if he could join me. I told him thats a bit weird. He just said ""please can i join you"". I told him no and asked him to leave. 

I hadn't seen him for a few weeks as it just got weird. It was my sisters birthday over the weekend and everyone was over, including P. I was civil and pretended nothing had happened between us and we were still very good close friends. At the end of the night, it was just me, P and my older sister playing the Xbox in the games room. My sister got bored of losing so she went away. P just started crying out of the blue. I asked him what was wrong and he just said he loved me and wants me. I was speechless, how are you meant to answer that? He then went to touch my crotch and i stopped him and said i think he should leave. He tried to grab my hand and put it on his. I just walked out the room.

The next morning, i told my older sister what had happened as i didn't know what to do. She was disgusted. I asked her not to tell anyone but to help me with it. She immediately went and told our mum. It has caused chaos and mum is exiling P from our family. I feel extremely bad for saying something, i should have just spoke to him about it when he was sober, hes clearly having problems. AITA????"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byxhc8	2019-06-10 12:52:22	IDontCareAtThisPoint	AITA for not visiting my sister in laws and brothers in the hospital after they have their babies?	"Weird worded title, sorry.

I have brothers who are both significantly older than me. It's no secret that I don't really have that much of a relationship with them because they moved out and got married and had kids while I was still in puberty. I have no ill will against them, and I do love them as family but  I'm not that close with them.

Anyway, all together they've had 3 children so I'm an uncle to 3. Each time a baby was born my parents went to the hospital and saw the baby, talked with them, brought them stuff, etc whereas I never went. My parents say I'm being apathetic but honestly in their place I wouldn't want people to come to the hospital after such a stressful time. They're still recovering physically and mentally from the whole experience and they've got a newborn to look after, and I feel like I'd just be sort of intrusive. At most I sent them a congratulations text and talked to them the next time I saw them and the baby for a family gathering (we do them fairly often).

For the first pregnancy I watched my oldest brothers dogs and house while they were in the hospital, and decided to make sure everything was tended to and leave before they got home.

byxgqx	2019-06-10 12:50:44		AITA for making a big deal out of my brother refusing to get off my bed?	"I am 19 and my brother is 18. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to sit on my bed (it's where I almost always sit in the room), but he was sitting on it. I asked him nicely to get off my bed. He didn't. I asked with a neutral tone again, and he replied ""I want to stay here."" I said ""sit on here (a different bed)"", yet he said ""I want to sit HERE."" I kept asking him to get off, but he ignored me. I yelled, but this time, I added a few insults. My brother is usually an ass. He thinks that he can do whatever he wants just because he's the eldest son. He thinks nobody can stop him from doing anything he wants. To provide a bit of context, I live in a 3rd world country, and this mentality is quite common here. People also don't care as much about privacy and personal property. I absolutely hate this. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, my brother smiled and said ""I am going to stay here. What are you going to do about it?"" I told him that I am going to sit. I sat and pushed him a bit in the process. He began threatening to get physical. I said that I don't care. I screamed (he is physically stronger than me and kicked me) and my mom came in. She begged me to leave him on my bed and go sit somewhere else. I did so just for her sake, but I was extremely furious and pissed. I retaliated by kicking him off the house's WiFi (he was on his phone on my bed), and so he went to my mom and kept making threats. He said things like ""I could kill her"" and ""If she doesn't fix this (the locked WiFi), I will slam her head repeatedly against the wall until her stupid bed gets soaked in blood."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I refused to allow him to access the WiFi and stipulated that if he wants WiFi, he'll have to get off my bed. My mom eventually convinced him to get off my bed and I allowed him to access the WiFi again. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Am I an asshole? Did I fixate on a trivial issue? Am I being immature or inconsiderate (to my mom (not my brother\*) since she went through a lot as a result of this)? 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Note: my brother's default mode is asshole. Although my mom is a great mother and she certainly didn't deserve this, I am pretty sure my brother did. He is a shallow, hypocritical, annoying piece of shit, most of the time. He is a bully. I actively try to avoid him wherever he goes, but it has gotten to the point where I feel that I am being chased by him. He always accuses me of being cold, awkward, weird, autistic, or crazy. He won't leave me alone. Yesterday, he was outside my room, but when he saw that I am going to my room, he barged in and my mom intervened yet another time so that he could leave. I believe I am right in ruling that he deserves this. I am not sure however if I should’ve ignored him or fought him, as fighting him caused a lot of trouble to others as well.

byxfnn	2019-06-10 12:47:39	FMural	AITA for yelling at my wife?	"A little background information before we get started: she's a high-functioning autistic, so periods of rage aren't uncommon for her. They typically don't get this bad, and she's pretty sweet outside these contexts.

We were going out the other day for some fast food. I'd just recently moved in with her, and so wasn't familiar with the area, so we went up together so she could give me the necessary directions. The trip up went pretty well, all things considered. We'd already ordered in advance (with a system I was unfamiliar with), and so it just fell to me to go inside and pick it up.

The problem was, they were *really* busy that day. It took them a good solid twenty minutes to finally bring our food out, and even then, it turned out the system had somehow dropped a few items, so I had to re-order them at the counter, which added another ten minutes to the total time I was in the building (and during which my wife, who does not mix well with rooms of crowded, short-tempered fast food patrons, was out in the car, alone, in the Georgia heat).

So when I got back, what ensued was a firestorm. The very first words that came out of her mouth when I returned were, at about a hundred decibels were ""ARE YOU STUPID?! IT DOES *NOT* TAKE THAT LONG TO GET FOOD!""

(Heat + Autism + A long enough time to simmer = lots of distress, so I don't blame her for this. A lot had gone wrong that day, and due to my unfamiliarity with the system and the pervasive customer service policy in this restaurant of ""never tell the customer they're doing it wrong"", it's entirely possible I *did* do something wrong which extended the clock. That's not the AITA part, or any implicit ISTA, for that matter.)

So then I get back into the car, start it up, and get ready to drive off, her still venting in the back seat. Okay, I can work with this. I remembered the way we came in, so if I just left the same route...

Turns out, that was the long way. Which did not sit well with my already-raging wife. Her yelling and fussing intensified threefold, and all this time I was trying to drive the car with a very angry distraction three feet behind me, until I couldn't take it: ""SHUT THE *FUCK* UP!""

...I don't talk to my wife that way, and I'm still not certain I should have. It bought us a few minutes of quiet while we pulled into a parking lot to let us both calm down, but I still wonder... Did I do the right thing? She can't help these rages. Should I have stayed by until she could calm down first? Should I have just gritted my teeth and born it for a few more minutes between there and home? Could I have quieted her down more gently? Am I The Asshole?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	3044.0	147.0	0.0	0.0

I've lost count how many times these girls stand around and talk, and my manager has said absolutely nothing to them. Meanwhile I've been told to not stand around even though I'm almost always keeping myself busy. I understand that maybe I'm not the brightest guy or that maybe my manager enjoys the company of the other employees, but I feel like I'm being treated unfairly. My manager also gets irritated when I ask her questions, so I no longer feel comfortable asking her questions.

I've talked to my other ""original"" siblings about this and 2 of them matched my level of anger. I would also add that my dad hasn't taken us to a vacation in another country (live in Denmark) since my mom and dad were divorced.

&#x200B;

So during their holiday I called my father and said that it was pretty uncool of them to do this, I could hear that he was sad about this too. And that he considered it a bit that this might've affected us, but not much. I thought about this a lot last week about what would happen when they got home.

&#x200B;

They came home late Friday and Saturday my dad picked us up from my mom, I expressed my anger cleary through body language the whole of Saturday and my dad didn't even address this problem before yesterday evening. Where he said that he has been an idiot, but that my stepmom's parents only wanted to go on holiday with my half-brother. I said that he should've either said something because or family is a package deal and not something where you can pick the family members you want with. And putting their foot down was my stepmom and dad's responsibility, my dad didn't agree. Today my family went to the zoo and I said I didn't wanna go to continue my expression of disapproval. He said that I should just ""Get over it"" this has not made anything better for me. But I'm wondering if I'm being an asshole here or not?

&#x200B;

I would also add that I haven't said a word to my stepmom, and she hasn't said a word to me."	Not the A-hole	0	0	841.0	164.0	0.0	0.0

It is an extremely small wedding, only 40 people, in my parents' country backyard. This girl, we'll call her Angela, was supposed to be one of my bridesmaids. I had asked her back in October and she was beyond excited to be a part of the wedding. We met working in the same company, we both worked at a gym. Fast forward to about two months ago. She quit her job at our gym, and she moved about 20 minutes away. After moving she COMPLETELY stops texting, Instagram messaging, etc. I texted her at LEAST four separate times throughout these two months asking if she was still interested in being a bridesmaid or even attending the wedding as a guest. Not a word. Throughout these two months I could see she was still posting on all of her social media accounts.

&#x200B;

About a week ago at nearly 11 pm, I got a text saying ""BABE! So sorry, my phone hasn't been working!"" That's it. No comment on the wedding or anything. I don't think she even remembers the date. I did not reply as at this point, the wedding was a week and a half away and I had heard absolutely nothing from her for months. Yesterday, she sent me a Snapchat of a selfie saying ""I fucking hate (\*insert Gym Company Name here\*)"" Again, I didn't reply. I haven't heard anything since. 

&#x200B;

Am I an asshole for deciding to ghost her and not include her in the wedding anymore?

"So I have a friend that is transitioning to male and he is on testosterone who we will refer to as J,if you didn’t know testosterone makes you kinda an asshole. As of late he has been more of an ass than usual, I made the horrible decision to bring my beautiful real wolf tail that was very soft and made me less anxious when I pet it. Everyone thought it was really cool and I wore it all day, I walked in to 6th hour and put it on my desk. Just before the bell rang my friends N and J. N is pretty awesome and chill. Any way J walk over next to me and HIT ME WITH THE TAIL. Every time I let some one touch it I would say it was fragile and to be careful. Half of the tail fell off and I was so sad. I was quiet all of class,and didn’t hangout after school like usual, J didn’t even say sorry even when I asked him to he, kept on saying it wasn’t his fault that it was fragile. I feel like shit for wanting compensation for the tail. Am I the asshole?

Edit: yes it was a real wolves tail, yes I do understand that it is cruel to just kill an animal for the hide I did not understand at the time I brought it because I was younger.

So, I've got this one cousin who I've never talked to, he sometimes shows up on family events but even that's a rare occurance. He's somewhere in his mid-30s, I am 19. 

Basically, he's been addicted to drugs and homeless for the longest time, I've as I said not once talked to him, I barely know his name and I definately wouldn't recognize him if I saw him on the street. So yesterday my parents, my brother and I were talking about him during dinner and I mentioned how I don't think of him as my cousin / as family, because I don't really know him, have never talked to him and thus imo he's not part of my family. 

I know he's legally related to me but that's about it.

 My mom and her boyfriend called me in the room, and I walked in and they asked me, “Jerkchickenfoot is there any requests  you wanna make once we move in together? Do not be unreasonable.” 

I said, “C (moms boyfriend), you know I am not a fan of you, but since we are moving in together, I’ll just have to be nice now, but I. Want rules. When we move in you are not allowed in my room, unless it’s important, or unless if I ask, you can peak your head in my door to ask me 4 questions.  Those 4 questions should be important, but the questions I accept, ‘Could you clean your room and/or an other room in the house?’ ‘What would you like to eat.’ ‘Do you need anything?’ ‘Did you finish your homework?’ Or any other questions like how is school? and how was practice? 

“ The next rule is, you and my mom work different hours, and different days, I need you to pick me up from volleyball practice. Because I am not fond of the morning bus, and if you want to, it would be nice if you could drop me off to school, in the morning. But you don’t have to do that.”

“Final Rule, is we need a spare key for the house, and a lock on my room door.” 

My mom started getting an attitude with me, saying my rules are unreasonable like him not being allowed coming into my room whenever he wants. And limiting him to questions, and I’m not the boss. I argued “ you literally asked me requests, and I wanted rules, so I can be comfortable in a new house hold with a third party, these also don’t even apply to you.” My May-be stepdad said he’ll do his best with these rules. My mom didn’t like them.

bywxmv	2019-06-10 11:55:04		AITA for confronting my work friend about how her behaviour affects me when I know she has severe mental health problems?	"I’m worried I’m being selfish, having not experienced depression myself.   

I have a work friend who periodically becomes very ornery with another colleague and myself specifically, while being excessively friendly with everyone else in our office. The first time this happened I assumed she disliked us and tried to shrug it off, but after a few weeks she apologised for “being a bitch” to us (her words) and went back to normal. 

This exact situation has repeated itself 5+ times since she started working at our company six months ago. During one of her apologies she confided in me that she knows she can be nasty to my colleague and me and that she has serious depression and anxiety. I tried to be very understanding and said I was here if she ever needed to talk. However every time she has one of these episodes, it causes me a lot of stress and anxiety because it seems so targeted at me and my colleague, when she has the energy to be cheerful with everyone else. 

For the past couple weeks she has been very irritable with us again and more or less ignoring me completely. This time around I ended up confronting her (via Skype, in response to a message she sent me cancelling three upcoming social events we had planned together) by saying that I understand something is obviously going on with her but it really hurts my feelings when she blanks me and cancels our plans with no explanation. She got very shirty with me and hasn’t spoken to me since (this was over a week ago). This obviously makes work very awkward and tense when she ignores me when I say good morning to her or try to make small talk. I think she is being immature and unprofessional, but I acknowledge that I’m aware of these serious mental health problems she has and perhaps was not being sympathetic to her situation.

bywsg8	2019-06-10 11:38:30		AITA for being mad at my brother choosing a wedding date before mine, after getting engaged after me?	"Context: My brother and his fiancee as well as my parents live in the midwest, my fiance and I live on the East Coast.

  
My fiance proposed in the beginning of this year, and being the very-organized duo that we are, quickly set a wedding date for this August. We'd already scoped out some wedding venues, and when he met with my parents to ask their permission, they were thrilled to say yes and immediately jumped into wedding planning with him! About two weeks after our engagement, my younger brother proposed to his girlfriend/now fiancee.

I admittedly was slightly hurt that he proposed so soon to my proposal date, as I wanted to have some time to celebrate this moment without feeling like I had to share it with my younger brother. However my fiance told me that my brother had actually asked him about proposal dates as he was planning to propose in January also, and didn't want to compete, so I respected how considerate he was for that.

So we set our wedding date for early August, and let our families know so they could save the date (before any official announcement). A month later, my brother tells me that he and his fiancee are setting their wedding date for the end of June. Five weeks before our wedding. My parents called with a lot of surprise, having no idea that he was planning on getting married so soon, and worried about supporting two weddings in a five-week span.

I feel hurt that he would pick a date before our wedding, even when I had selected our wedding date first. It may not be rational, but I feel as though he's stealing my thunder, and feel sad that I have to share this wedding season with my younger brother. I feel annoyed that he and his fiancee didn't talk to my parents about this, as they continue to passive-aggressively complain to me and my fiance about how random and unplanned this seems. To add salt onto the wound, his fiancee isn't attending our reception because she has to take a flight that night (they're doing a stint working abroad for a year) - I'm assuming they're getting married so quickly so that they can have that legally set prior to working abroad, but flying out on the night of our reception feels inconsiderate.

Then she called me wanting to clear her name or whatever but she really half assed it like she just wanted me to forgive her for not telling me, but she didn’t want to help me when I asked her to clear up the story for me (they both had different versions) and she never asked if I was ok or needed anything (as I would do for her and you just do that for friends anyway when they get cheated on?) so when I got a moment to reflect on that I realized I was pretty upset with her for how she handled this situation with only herself in mind.

bywph1	2019-06-10 11:28:54	Kamekko	AITA for asking for my dog to be walked over the weekend as I'm essentially asked to not be home for the weekend?	"So my sister has been away as shes in Cyprus since end March on tour (shes in the army), she's coming back Wednesday for 2 weeks leave and we share a room while she is home and we both still live at home with mom and step-dad. She has asked me if she can basically have the room for her friends to stop this weekend, they're going on to a rave and whatnot the Saturday and her friends are travelling down on the Friday, I've said that's fine but my only condition is my dog gets walked. She said she can Friday before her friends arrive but basically cant promise anything for Saturday and she MIGHT on Sunday depending on how hungover she is, though her original answer was no because she knew she'd be hungover.

&#x200B;

I also said I'd check with my brother and his fiance and they're working the weekend, my mom and step dad have said they dont mind doing it Saturday if my sister absolutely cant. I've asked her what days she'd actually be able to walk him as brother and fiance are working the weekend.

&#x200B;

Me: "" What days are you actually able to walk Griffin this weekend because Becky is working Saturday and Aiden told me hes working all weekend""

&#x200B;

Her: "" Why is this becoming a massive deal I already said I can walk him Friday and I’m out all day Saturday and what your back Sunday night or something or I could walk him Sunday night.. depending how much I’m hanging out.. I’ve been working for the last 3 months and want to have some freedom in the weekend the worse case scenario he doesn’t get walked Saturday or Sunday but I’m there pretty much all week so he will get walked everyday. So chill your bean lol ""

&#x200B;

Can't say I appreciate the reply but feel like maybe I should just put up and shut up since she's assured me he will get walked everyday in the week. I work 8:30-5pm Mon-Fri. We have people home pretty much all the time with my brother and his fiance working shifts. Like I'm appreciative my mom/step-dad/brother and his fiance are now offering to help but I'm quite upset that it's the only thing I've asked in return to basically not be at home. My dog I do not believe is overweight but since his last vet visit he has gained weight and his breed is VERY prone to health problems so the vet has advised to be cautious which I guess has made me much more concerned on his exercise front to the point where I do walk him when I get back from work regardless of if he was walked during the day or not by someone else and I try and walk him twice a day on weekends. (I'm 24 and she's 22 if that helps)

&#x200B;

EDIT: this was my response to her because I really don't want this to turn into something, I'll make different arrangements if need be but it doesn't change that I was upset by her attitude to this request

&#x200B;

Me: "" This is not an issue but you are asking me not to be at home to give you that freedom, I understand you want to let your hair down. But you have to understand I have a dog and it is not fair if he is not walked all weekend, I'm not turning this into something but since his last vets visit I am far more concerned about his exercise/weight then I used to be.

bywoh7	2019-06-10 11:25:43	Humbud	AITA for ignoring family traditions?	"My son was baptized yesterday, and our families are in from out of town.

&#x200B;

The first grievance I made against my father was when I took my wife's name when we got married. It took my family some time to get over that and when they arrived for the weekend, they were all wearing custom ""Team Last Name"" t-shirts and hats. We were able to joke about that.

&#x200B;

The thorn of the issue is the baptism gown. My sister mailed me the gown her youngest was baptized in and it was made by our great aunt. This gown was supposed to replace the 100 yo gown her other kids were baptized in (I was oblivious to this fact up to this point, but I knew the dress was homemade). We also received a gown my SIL baptized her son in and a store bought one provided by MIL. I did a baby fashion show the morning of and sent everyone pictures of baby in their gown. The one my sister sent was a little too big and had big bows all over it, he honestly looked like a cute little girl in it. We chose a simple one without really giving it a second thought. I met my family out front and corralled them in and showed them where we were sitting while baby was having a snack with Mom in another pew.

&#x200B;

The sacrament of baptism is important to us and we chose my wife’s sister as Godmother because she is priest. My family sat in the third row, we sat with the Godparents in the second row, the rest of her family just filled in.

&#x200B;

I didn't notice when they left. I assumed they went out to smoke because the service can be long. I was heartbroken and tried to shrug it off when everyone asked me where they went. Nobody would take my calls or answer my texts.

&#x200B;

I come to learn my sister was upset about the gown and was making a big deal about it. She called me and I tore into her. It takes a lot to work me up and I was so angry they left without saying anything. I was angry and hurt. I told her she was petty, and I didn't know anything about the gown being important to her, and that I couldn't believe my parents condones her behavior.

&#x200B;

Hours of radio silence from my family follow. We had a BBQ planned with family and friends afterward and I did my best to keep a straight face. My mom finally texts me that she loves and misses me. She doesn't want my dad to know she's writing me and that she's going to turn her phone off and wait for my response. I did not respond. She finally texts that if I don't answer then it means they don't matter to me. I texted my mom back: I didn't know the gown was important to you and I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt anyone. 

&#x200B;

My mom is saying she hopes my Dad and I can have a one on one chat today. I'm so sick to my stomach I don't even want to see them today. They are all due to fly home in 12 hours and I don't know if I want to bother hashing it out. It seems like every time I'm with them there is some drummed up drama and I just don't want to be a part of it.

I had a good upbringing, my father worked away from home a lot so it was usually just me and my mum. My father had a drink problem but I was pretty sheltered from it. 
My mother was always home with me and my sister and was very loving and supportive of us. 

My mother was diagnosed with cancer 3 years ago. 

This is where things go weird. 

2 years after her diagnosis, I find out that her and my father are getting divorced. My father sat me down and told me that my mother had met a woman and that she was moving out to be with her. My father was very hurt by this and cried to me daily. 

I guess my mother thought she was dying and (I only know this now) realised that her whole life, shed held herself back because she was scared of people's judgment. 
She says she was always bisexual and had relationships with girls when she was younger but came from a very homophobic family. 

I spoke to my mum and she told me and my sister how much she loved us but that nearly dying put things into perspective and that now we were older, she felt she could start living her life again. 

She told me that my father had met another woman too, years ago but that they never did anything because they didn't want to test the family up but that now were older and independent, he can move on with another woman and she can, too. 

She said she hopes I understand and that my parents are happy now and love us as much as ever. I told my mum I think she's selfish and that she lied to us for years and now I don't trust her. I told her I feel decieved and that our whole uprbinging was a lie and falsified. 

My father now lives with his girlfriend and I know how humiliated he feels having to tell people my mum is now living with a woman and was gay the whole time. I feel like my mother used my father and us and now she doesn't need him, has just moved on. 

My sister says it's still our mum and that marriages don't always work and that it shouldn't change our relationship with her. I wrote a letter to my mum telling her I wish to not speak to her and that I hope she's well but that I don't agree with what she's done and that I want to focus on me and my father maintaining a great relationship. Sister says I'm selfish and I've broke my mother's heart. Mother keeps contacting me so I changed my number.

Anyway bf (25) and I (27) recently broke up. He’s an alcoholic. Drunk him is awful. Sober him is fucking great. Made this a tough decision really but it was for my mental health (lots of ptsd related to awful alcoholics).

During the relationship, every time I tried to bring up an issue I had with him or if he hurt my feelings, I got one of three responses: “you just need to chill”, “something something you have anxiety” or “I just say stupid shit when I’m drunk”. I handle my anxiety pretty well and I kept telling him it was the ptsd, but it took months to get him to stop saying anxiety. He’s called me crazy (memorably once, “you’re a unicorn babe. wait no I take that back, you’re a 7 on the crazy scale”. I’m sure most of you know which video he was referencing). At Christmas he drunkenly peed on the Christmas tree and when I showed him the pee-soaked gift I’d gotten his mom he poked it and told me it was completely dry and he smelled nothing. Lots of me proving he was an ass and him denying it like that. Mixes it up with sincere contrition tho, never know what I’m gonna get. He’s told me my thoughts and motivations (always very manipulative and shitty) and when I’ve said no, that’s not what was in my head at all, he’s argued very patronizingly and mocked me when I got angry and cried.

now I avoid talking to him about it, esp drunk, though we’ve scheduled a real talk about it soon. He keeps trying to push me into it earlier tho and I’ll get mad. I need time to prepare. If he says “what have I done that’s so bad” or something I have less than a breath to start speaking and I have ADD out the ASS and organizing my thoughts AND controlling ptsd on the spot in a stressful situation is like trying to herd invisible cats. so I have to rehearse when he’s asleep, but this means muttering to myself which looks SO shitty and passive aggressive (apparently he listens even if I don’t hear a peep for hours) but I can’t think of a different way to do it. Just thinking quietly about shit like this makes the same single thought circle forever and he reads my fucking notebooks anyway so that’ll be the same result. He tells me this stuff makes me the asshole and I’ve been told by others I respect a lot that I’m being just as toxic as he is. But I feel uncomfortable with that idea? AITA?"

From the moment I turned 18, I've been a big fan of non-committal sexting and sending nudes. It makes me feel good, it gets me off, the same to the other party, you know. I'm safe and I don't have any issues.

However, sometimes the guys I do this with get attached. I'm very honest and clear from the get-go that I'm only interested in sex, but it doesn't stop them catching feelings. When this happens, I start to feel guilty about various lies I've told. 

These include my name, my experience, and my gender identity; I'm genetically female, but don't identify as such. When I'm online, I take on a female persona. Sometimes I've tried being honest, but it always spirals into socio-political arguments or them just no longer being attracted to me.

I've never lied about my appearance, nor have I ever started a romantic or emotional connection under false pretense. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bywbov	2019-06-10 10:42:45		AITA for telling my ex-gf her wife cannot be involved in our daughters upbringing?	"I was with my ex-gf for 3 years. The pregnancy was a shock to us both but we took it in our stride. 

I was 24 and she (we will call her Claire) was 22. 

I was a stupid young lad and made some substantial mistakes that led to me being sent to prison when Claire was 6 months pregnant. I was sentenced to 12 years in prison. 

Claire was upfront and said she wouldn't be waiting for me, that she felt I was inherently selfish to make those mistakes knowing we were having a baby soon. She did promise to bring the baby to visit me every other week and that we would sort visitation once I got out. 
It was tense at first but we grew to be close friends and she's an amazing mother to my child, I cannot be grateful enough for what she's done and I know how hard it must have been to go through the pregnancy and birth alone. 

Claire met Laura when our son was 1 year old. I still got to see our son every two weeks but he lived at home with Claire and after 2 years of their relationship, Laura moved in. I wasn't comfortable with two women raising my son and could only imagine how confusing it is for him to be raised by two women and then years later, have his dad reintroduced. 

Laura and Claire got married and my son was the best man and ring bearer. I was shown pictures. 

I was released after 9 years and I've been trying to get involved in my son's life. I entered their house and they play proper family. He even calls Laura ""mum""!!!! 
I tried to make it work but Laura thinks I can't complain about the lack of acknowledgement from my son because I made the choice to mess up and Claire sides with Laura every time. 
They won't let me have my son alone, I'm only allowed meals with them at theirs and days out with them until our son is ""more familiar"" with me. But he's my son! 
I feel totally pushed out. They go on family holidays and Laura is left alone with my son when Claire is at work. 

I've sat with Claire and told her she needs to lay down boundaries and stop our son calling Laura mum and to establish who his parents are. I also told her that i don't want Laura living with them and i definitely don't want Laura being left alone with our son and to be the one caring for him when she is NOT his parent. Ex says I'm being bitter and don't have a leg to stand on. 

AITA? 

**TL;Dr** ex gf now married to a woman, they play happy families with my son. I returned home and feel shut out of the family. I asked that Laura (Ex gf wife) backs off."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So this is moot since they already ditched me and found a new roommate but i just joined reddit and was wondering. So im in college and my mom has been threatening to pull me out if my grades arent up to par, this was after i signed a lease with these 3 guys(i am friends with one of em). So i tell them the situation that I might not actually be around the next yr, and they got a little worried about being with a random. One dude kept being a dick about it, even calling me selfish at one point(even though i was trying my best to look for a solution that worked for both sides). Once i could tell they might jump ship, i told my mom about the situation and she said i shouldnt have told them in the first place, that i didnt owe them that info and it could only come back to bite me if i did(which it kinda did lol). So would i have been an asshole not to tell them? Or should i have done the selfish thing and done whats best for me?	Asshole	0	0	56.0	6.0	0.0	0.0

byw46b	2019-06-10 10:16:50	AegeaonHeights	AITA for feeling jealous that my sister is getting more attention for her illness than I am for mine?	"About 5-6 months ago, I (18f) started having problems with my ears turning red and getting a lil warm. I scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist bc initially I thought it was allergies. Turns out it had to do with the cartilage in my ears rather than the skin. I was referred to a rheumatologist, for whom I had to go make another appointment for, but I couldn’t get in to see her for 3 weeks.

While I waited, my ears got worse. To the point where I can no longer leave my room anymore. I have to sit in my room all day, in the dark, in front of a fan, with ice packs strapped to my head because it’s that bad. The burning is excruciating and constant. I can numb it with ice packs, but only until they melt.

ALSO during this time, my sister (23f) began to experience lots of issues with cramps and pain in her abdomen. It turns out she has an ovarian cyst which is causing her pain whenever she has her period. I by no means discount that fact that she is in a lot of pain. She is very very vocal about how much it hurts. Here’s where I’m frustrated, however.

Once I finally get to the rheumatologist, she basically sits down and tells me that I have relapsing polychondritis. Which is a rare genetic autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the cartilage in the body. Since it’s so rare, they don’t know what triggers it, and treatment is mostly trial and error. They worry about long term because cartilage is everywhere in your body, including the heart and windpipe. If my body started to attack either of those, it could spell disaster. Basically, it could flare up in the wrong place at the wrong time and I could die at a young age because of it. The possibility of a flare up in my heart is a major concern, and I just learned all of this on Wednesday.

Meanwhile my sister is having issues with her cyst again, and is wailing and crying. For sure she is hurting, but also I just learned that I could die at any point. My parents have elected to skirt around that fact, and haven’t offered me a bit of comfort about it, instead focusing on my sister. I am forced (through pure necessity) to sit alone in my room all day long, every day, and have been for the last few weeks. I am extremely lonely. My parents make minimal effort to check on me. At most it’s a brief four sentence conversation and then they go right back upstairs to take care of my sister. Nobody comes to talk to me, nobody comes to see me, nobody sits with me.

Tonight I made it it upstairs to get some food, and I saw my mom in my sister’s room, lying on the bed with her, rubbing her back and comforting her. And seeing how much my mom was caring for my sister while also forgetting me made me feel jealous. I don’t doubt for a second that my sister is in a lot of pain. I’m just jealous that I’ve been forgotten about while I’ve learned that I could die young & that I have an autoimmune disorder that I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life.

&#x200B;

The reason why i did this was because we got in to an argument about my little brother (14M) not leaving me alone when asked and making snide remarks about my life (the way i dress, talk, the guys i like, my career plans and friends), he also makes fun of my friends (particularly making fun of my FtoM friend).

&#x200B;

As a result of this argument my dad cornered me, calling me a bitch and saying nobody likes me because i'm a horrible person and that he's the only person in the world that likes me, he also threatened to smash my project for my art exam which contributes partially to 60% of my final grade.  In the past he's also refused to make me a doctors appointment for when i had a UTI by saying it would pass and i don't need to go to the doctor, as a result it lasted 2 weeks and needed a penicillin based antibiotic to fix after the original antibiotics didn't work. He has a temper and has a habit of getting angry , shouting and cornering me if things don't go his way or if he is to blame.

byvz15	2019-06-10 09:59:20	airpoddude	AITA for putting my AirPods in while someone was trying to talk to me?	"Throwaway account

I used to date/hookup with this girl and things ended civil but escalated and we are now not on friendly terms. 

We hadn’t been speaking for weeks since there was some hostility between us and she came into work one day and asked if we could talk (we work the same job on campus so she was allowed to be there). I didn’t really want to because she had been annoying me and I was glad that we hadn’t been speaking and her coming in as I was about to start my shift annoyed me again. Words were exchanged and things were said but she had to go start her shift (different place on campus) and she left heated/flustered? And I was just pissed off and now in a bad mood. I guess she got off work early because she came by again, and started saying how “it was unfair that I was placing all the blame on her” and not giving her a chance to hear her out. I asked if we could do this while I wasn’t working and she said okay, so she waited till I finished my shift.

I ended my shift, left the building, started walking, and said “if you want to talk, you better start walking” so I just started heading home. I think I threw her off because she started stuttering and grew flustered and was saying stuff about “how I lead her on, can we just sit down and talk about this” etc. but quite frankly, I was extremely irritated and didn’t want to listen or hear her talk and had told her before that I didn’t want to meet up and talk. In the middle of her talking, she said something I didn’t like so I just pulled out my AirPods and put them in and started playing music because I was fed up with her. She kept following me until we reached my house (5 min walk from where I work) trying to get me to listen, and at one point tried to take my AirPods out of my ears herself even after I told her to leave me alone after I put them in.

Some of my friends are saying I was an asshole but I see it as I don’t owe anything to her and didn’t want to talk to her but she kept trying to talk to me.

So, AITA?


Edit: More info-when she first approached me and asked if we could talk, I said that I had nothing to say to her which then led her to say that it was unfair that I “led her on” and blaming the hostility between us all on her (I still believe it is her fault and which is why I had nothing to say to her) to which I responded “I didn’t” and more negative things were exchanged between us which is why we were both left heated

Edit 2: I originally didn’t add what happened first between us because I thought it was too long to add to the story. I’ll just add the reason why it became hostile: I was uncomfortable with her because I ran into her twice over spring break while we were both visiting Hawaii separately and I felt creeped out because I don’t think it was a coincidence so I told her friend when we came back which is what prompted her to end our already nonexistent friendship with me. 
If you guys want more backstory then let me know.

Edit 3: posted in comments but - We used to date/talk (not official) and I ended it as winter break came. However when we got back, we still liked each other and continued as fwb? (With feelings I guess)  but I specifically told her I didn’t want a relationship. I found her looking through my texts between me and my ex that I still talk to, which of course made me angry and I lost feelings for her there. She did apologize and I decided to forgive her and we were just friends at that point. We would work on homework together still however, she grew more annoying and has a lot of mutual friends with me so I never said anything and just put up with it. Then the spring break thing happened 

I guess to be fair, I was talking to my ex romantically also but my business is my business and we weren’t exclusive just fwb. I told her I didn’t want to be in a relationship but she still acted as if how we used to be last semester"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byvys0	2019-06-10 09:58:28	JustAMice	"AITA for telling my gay best friend ""maybe?"""	"She and I met 8 months ago, during our first year at university. We ended up hanging out accidentally a few months after we met, and quickly developed a very close friendship. What I did not know at this time was that she had begun to fall in love with me.

&#x200B;

Our friendship has always been rooted in complete honesty (to the point of sharing pretty much every passing thought), and so she ended up writing a letter to me, telling me about how she felt and apologizing for it, because she knew that despite the fact that I am an intense LGBTQ+ ally and advocate, I am both Christian and straight. After reading the letter, we met up talked about it for hours. I essentially told her I considered being with her romantically, but at the moment, I genuinely couldn't see myself in a relationship with her, because 

1. I wouldn't want to ruin the friendship
2. I wasn't sure if I wanted to date a girl
3. the family/cultural/religious stuff would make it hard for me to not feel guilty in that relationship, which would be unfair to her. 

She was just genuinely shocked I'd thought about it in any capacity whatsoever—and even more so that I didn't give her an outright no. However, because I left it so open, that made it difficult (read: impossible) for her to get over me.

&#x200B;

We became closer after this, and we currently function almost more as a non-romantic couple than as friends. We went on a trip together and it was phenomenal. We text and talk and think about each other all the time, and I can say that we genuinely love each other. The problem is, I am happy just having her in my life this way, but for her, it's like getting so intensely close to something she desperately wants (which is essentially a life together), but just missing the mark. It's hard for both of us: It might be easier on her if I shut down the idea of a romantic relationship entirely so that she can move on, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't deeply considering an actual relationship. Meanwhile, me being confusing and indecisive hurts her, because she's hanging on to a thread of hope that may or may not come into fruition. She also has opportunities to date other people, but doesn't want to—she says that she can't imagine liking someone that isn't me (which I think will change because people always say their crush/bf/gf/so is ""the one"" and that they'll ""never love again"", but she disagrees). Fundamentally, I desperately don't want to lead her on in any way, but I also don't want to lie and say either yes or no if I'm not sure. I care about her more than anything and want to be the best friend for her that I can be until I manage to make up my mind one way or the other.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: AITA for being unsure of my feelings towards my closest friend, and in that uncertainty, stringing her along for something that might or might not happen?

byvy8k	2019-06-10 09:56:35	NorthVilla	AITA for saying no when my roommate's girlfriend asked me to be quiet?	"Hello all! 

So I live in a house with a few roommates, and my space is relatively close to another roommate. The walls are unfortunately very thin.

I'm rustling about sometimes on weeknights, let's say around 11 or 12 o'clock. Perhaps just straightening things, watching videos on my laptop with laptop speakers not fully turned up, etc. Nothing serious. 

Many times, my roommate's girlfriend (who does not live here, mind) knocks on my door and asks me to be quiet. From my perspective, she is quite a noise sensitive person, because I am not playing music or doing anything particularly loud. 

Now my roommate has never once told me the noise was an issue for him. I asked him if he had noise issues and said ""no I don't have any issues, and I sleep like a rock, but my girlfriend has issues so I guess you should talk to her.""

Now I was fine with this for a while, but one time I am literally watching a video on my Macbook Pro speakers on half volume in my own room with the door closed at 11 PM, and she knocks on the door and asks me to be quiet. 

Usually, I've been cooperative with her, but this time, I didn't accept it. My roommate didn't mind any noise, my speakers were not loud nor had any bass, and I'm in my own room with the door closed so I feel I have the right to watch my video. 

I told her that I would continue to play the video at this volume in my own home because I didn't think it was unreasonable, and that if she has issues with it she should talk to my roommate about it. 

Well my roommate doesn't care about the noise. After she went back to his room, I could hear them having a mild argument about it, with it eventually ending (I think) inconclusively. 

If my roommate was really bothered, I would act differently. But I have talked to him and he is not bothered, and it's just his girlfriend, **a person who does not live in my house, only a frequent guest, and does not (in my opinion) really get a say on what happens in it.**

By that I mean he tends to be socially awkward and make people slightly uncomfortable, and you can't always tell if it's on purpose or not. Plus he seems to hold quite traditional opinions despite the fact that we're convinced he's gay (avoids any mention of relationships, makes references to his male ""best friend"" that he lives and vacations with, has some stereotypical mannerism etc).

Couple of us were talking about the pride month over the lunch break, or more specifically the pride parade and the flags put up in our town. This co-worker argued that sexuality should be a private thing and not flaunted in a provocative way. He also said something along the lines of, the pride parade promotes more inequality and social division. Others looked uncomfortable by his opinions, especially one girl from the office who's bisexual, so I had a brief argument with the guy on this topic. I'm straight but I personally believe you should speak out on this.

Essentially we had a short back and forth where I insisted on why pride was still important, while he argued the opposite. Now I wonder if, regardless of the topic of the conversation (not interested in who's politically right or wrong here) I'm an asshole or at least insensitive for confronting someone who's likely gay on this subject?"

"I’m part of a color guard in a HS marching band so I know the situation isn’t super high stakes, but it still makes me super mad.  This year I ran for leadership and was given the title of section leader which is just under coach in the power structure. I’ve had issues with my coach before and felt like she would respect me more if I was in a leadership position plus I am very passionate about guard. 

The previous season I had many really horrible interactions with her and the other members of the guard. An example would be we had a week of super intense long practices leading up to a competition, I also wasn’t getting a lot of sleep because I had to stay up late doing homework. She cancelled the Friday practice on Friday morning but unknown to me uncanceled it during the school day (I don’t check my phone at school) so as I was walking to the bus one of my team mates asked me if I was going to practice. I was annoyed at the fact she had canceled and then uncanceled and that I was planning on making up on all the homework I had gotten behind on during the week. I went to practice and ended up having an anxiety attack which was intensified when my coach started yelling at me about having a bad attitude and not telling her why I was acting like this. I have a hard time communicating while I’m panicking which only caused her to get angrier. This was one of the most stressful and horrible experiences in my life. 

Now she has given the solo away to a girl who has told me to my face that she can’t take me seriously and won’t respect me as a leader. She has also talked about how she doesn’t care about guard and actually quit before someone convinced her to rejoin. I feel like the solo should be a reward to someone who works hard and shows excellence in their work. My idea was to give it to the person who worked the hardest during band camp but my idea was rejected. Also she gave it away before she met any of the new freshman or before the season even started.

"My partner  (both 38) lovely mother died in an accident 6 years ago. We both went to counselling at the time and he has remained there and finds it helpful. His family and him are at the point where they talk about her fondly and have her pics up. 

They split her things amongst the siblings and the things we got were put in the garage. There is a LOT  and I have only gently suggested going through them. I thought he would when he was ready. 

I go in there to clean occasionally but it is a garage damp and dusty. My partner knows but doesn't seem to care.  He is messy in every other area of his life and I do 100% of the housework (I've tried everything) and his car looks like carbage, his office neckbeard nests. When I clean them up, he just throws stuff on the floor anyway and accuses me of caring more about 'society's expectations' than people. He is very successful in his field and I work very hard as well. 

Our area has fires frequently and we all know to be prepared. Both of our families have lost homes to fires.

Discussing making plans for this season, I asked my partner what he would take. He said he would just throw things in his car. 

I said that I had packed my emergency bag and would take my laptop, clothes, etc in my little car.

He said 'no, you will be taking my mother's things' I explained that if he picked what was most precious and put them in a box then yes, I would be honoured, but I wasn't going to throw random things in my car. 

He said it was 'all valuable' and that I was an unfeeling monster who 'didn't care about family' because I had grown up in foster care. 

I told him that if it was so valuable how come he hadn't cleaned out his car, to make sure he could take it, and he said that asking him to clean his car was 'controlling' him and that it was about the principle. 

He's right, I was in foster care, I don't know how families operate. I accept judgement.  AITA?

As I was doing college besides work and the job was offering the flexibility I needed, I was pissed. Additionally I had only worked there for 1.5 years, so 1.5 months worth of salary wasn't that great of a severance package either. Trying to negotiate only got me to 2 months worth of salary.

&#x200B;

My boss felt bad for us employees and explained to us, why we were let go and that he couldn't do anything about it, while sharing some of the more questionable details about the decision. The guy was nice, cared for us and obviously felt terrible for having to do what management demanded, can't say anything bad about him.

&#x200B;

As one of my colleagues was sick that day, he sent her what he unofficially said to us via email. I got my hands on that email and used it as hard evidence to file a lawsuit for unjust termination against the company. I got 6 months worth of salary, plus bonus, plus stock options and a pay-out for the payed vacation days I hadn't taken yet out of that settlement, because they would've had to reemploy me otherwise.

&#x200B;

My former boss got fired for his mistake and received nothing at all because his behavior was considered breach of confidentiality. He still hasn't found a new job 4 months later and has a family to feed and I'm not sure how I feel about it."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Her and her bf work first together and they have a small child and she has boys in high school. She asked me to wait to go to first til she can sign for a different area so she doesn't get bumped. I said I would and this was in February. Well she finially was awarded another spot but she declined it. Now she can't get a new spot for 6 months. I think I have waited more than long enough for her to get a new spot. It's summer and I want to get on first.

I've been friends with D for about 5 years. She has always been a great friend to me, and I think she is awesome in general. D holds parties every few months as a get together for her group of friends as she's usually busy with work/life so she doesn't get a chance to hang out with people often. I only missed one of these parties a couple months ago due to car issues (I moved to a new city a couple years ago). 

I've never had any issues at her parties, I get along with everyone there and have a good time. When they found out how I live about a year ago (generally eating the same thing every day for lunch/supper) it's become somewhat of an inside joke/meme. I have no issues with this at all, I know that if they make a joke about it, it's in good fun and spirit and not malicious. D and her fiance usually fill people in on it before they meet me, and the first few minutes of me getting there is just joking about it, and me reaffirming my life decisions.

However, the one I went to this weekend was just sorta... meh. I didn't really feel like I belonged there anymore, just based on the stage of life everyone was on. I've done the same thing for the last 2 years (Work, home, gaming, eat the same meal as yesterday, sleep, repeat) and that's made me generally pretty happy. When I was at this party, people were mostly cuddled up with their SO and we were just playing stuff on jackbox. I didn't really join in on any conversation, as I didn't have anything to add. The only two times I could actually contribute to a conversation was about how awful Anthem was, and about building a new PC. Although the latter was more of me defending my choice to build a new PC for ~6k (including peripherals).

So now with most people moving forward with their lives, being in long term relationships and moving in with their SO, I just don't really feel like I should be going to these often, if at all. I just want to tell her ""thanks for having me over these last few years, they were really fun, but I don't think I'll be attending as much anymore"". WIBTA if I stopped attending her parties? It's pretty much the only time I see her or really talk to her, and I think she would be hurt if I didn't attend.

I have tried to talk with others while I'm there, but usually they're pulled away by their SO to go talk in ""bigger"" groups and I'm just sorta standing there."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byvnsg	2019-06-10 09:17:18	shusithanh	AITA for not wanting to travel around Europe with my mother?	"TLDR:I'm studying abroad in Germany and my mother is visiting me. My summer holidays has already started and I'm excited to go home, I've also already made plans with my friends but she wants me to travel Europe with her and is calling me ungrateful for deciding not to travel with her and went as far as saying I'm ""choosing"" my friends over her.

Some background; Obligatory have to say that we're Southeast Asian, where respect to the elders is *literally* the most important thing. Living in a third world country, I'm fortunate enough to say that we're an  above middle-classed family and this is NOT the only time she's been to Germany and/or any foreign country. In fact, she's been to Germany multiple times, has also been to France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, other European countries and travels very often. We've been to Singapore so much that we even bought a house there to stay in. She knows the fact that I hate travelling. I absolutely hate it or atleast what my mother has taught me to be what ""travelling"" is. I hate sightseeing, hate travelling to tourist attractions, meeting new people, etc. and would rather stay in the hotel. Also, I get to go back home ca. every 6 months.

Months before she came, I've already told her multiple times that I will fly home as soon as I'm done with graduation, moving out, etc. Every time she reponds a different way, either that she'll travel with her friends and that I can just go home or that she'll fly home with me too.
I didn't really think about it. 

Months past and she finally comes to Germany. We've fought multiple times about this very same problem and it always end up the same. With her calling me ungrateful and that I'm choosing my friends over her. Sometimes she even played the ""crocodile tears"" card. Her reasoning for wanting to travel is that she's growing old and soon won't be able to travel any more (she's turning 57 in December) and tells me this multiple times to make me feel guilty.
But it never changed my mind. She has also stated that she'll travel with her friends and my aunt. Am I the asshole for not wanting to travel with my mom?

P/S: Every single time we've travelled together, I've told her that I hate it and only tolerate it because she enjoys it so much. Not being an ungrateful pos that doesn't appreciate that my family even have such opportunities presented to us, given the fact that we come from a developing country.

Edit: She's been in Germany for 2 months and has spent majority of this time with me."	Not the A-hole	0	0	2.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Now one guy said he had a crush on a certain girl, who he was really good friends with, so everyone teased him a bit to send a message her way just to meet up with her! What's the worst that could happen, right?

So he tells me to get us off his back, ""you just message her to meet up then!""
While being in a kind of buzzed mood i agreed, and sent a message to her on fb along the lines of ""yo hey what's going on, haven't spoken in some time! Was wondering if we could ever meet up!"" Note: i was 2 years in the same class as her and she was nice, this message was not a joke in any way. I would actually go to meet up.

So a few hours pass, no reply, everyone forgets about it. Next morning I wake up, i got a message request from someone I don't know on Instagram:
 
""Greetings focalanemone

I heard you wanted to meet up with my girlfriend. I would strongly advise against it, and do not recommend to meet up with her

Regards

Jon"" 

So I just woke up, saw this message, reread the message i sent her to make sure I didn't send anything weird. I did realize after it looked like a date request, but hey if she was  uncomfortable with that she could have just said no to me herself, not immediately send a boyfriend to me who I didn't know existed. And how else would I ask someone I thought was nice to meet up? So I Thought he was being kind of a possesive boyfriend, replied ""lmao"" to him and blocked him.

Now she, her mutual friends, my friends, and I still live in the same hometown. I would always greet them when I saw them, but now she and some mutual friends started ignoring me. Just walk past me and my friends like we are ghosts.

byvir7	2019-06-10 08:57:48	shacklackety	WIBTA for not giving my roommate a moving-out heads-up?	"I live with three roommates (Let’s call them One, Two, and Three) in a pretty cool house on a year-long lease. I love the space, and roommate One is an awesome roommate, but Two and Three have revealed themselves to be very passive agressive and generally unpleasant to live with. I can afford my own place, so I’ve decided to just move out when the lease is up in autumn. Legally, I only need to notify our landlord (LL) in writing of my intentions to move out 30 days prior to end of lease, and then I can go. I don’t have to say squat to the other three roommates.

The way the lease is written, any/all tenants on the lease are responsible for the total sum of rent due each month. We have divided it up based on our room size/amenities, but ultimately all our lease cares about is that the total gets paid. So if I leave (once lease is up and automatically converts from year-long to month-to-month), the other three will have to cover the cost of my rent until they (1) find a new tenant for my old room or (2) submit their notice and move out. They would have to cough up several hundred bucks extra EACH to cover my lost rent each month. Based on their living needs and respective situations, I don’t think any of them wants/plans to move out come autumn, so this extra cost would be a real pain for them. (One hates Two and Three as well, but doesn’t want to move out). At this point, I’ve made no indication to any of them that I intend to move out.

Communication between LL and us is pretty minimal, so I don’t think LL would let the others know I was leaving—probably assume I’d tell them myself. LL also leaves the task of replacing tenants to the current residents of house, so my roommates would be responsible for advertising and vetting a newcomer, which takes time— and therefore costs them more money. I don’t care about screwing over Two and Three; honestly, it would bring me sweet, petty joy to know they have to deal with the financial and logistical headache of replacing me without lead time to find an immediate replacement. But I consider One a friend, and I don’t feel 100% great about hanging One out to dry.

WIBTA if I stuck to my plan to do a stealth move-out, only notifying my landlord? Or should I give One a heads up so they can at least be aware of what’s coming?"	Asshole	0	0	32.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

"My brother met and fell in love with his longtime crush Sue (not her real name) five years ago and they decided to get married soon after. Three years before they met, Sue had divorced her abusive husband and they have a daughter together from their short marriage.

A few weeks before the wedding, one day my good friend Gemma (not her real name) rang me up and she told me that she needed to see me because there was something really important that she needed to tell me. So we met at a coffee shop and she told me the truth about Sue. Years before Sue and my brother met, Gemma’s brother was on a business trip in another city and there he ran into Sue, who was working as a prostitute at the time. They had sex and grew really close and Sue revealed to him that she went into prostitution because she had no choice. She just got divorced and was in a financial crisis and needed money to support her daughter. Gemma’s brother felt sorry for her and he continually supported her financially for a year until she finally got a job and was able to support herself and her daughter.

Gemma thought that I needed to know about Sue’s past since she was going to be a part of our big family. She said it was up to me what to do about it since it was my brother that Sue was going to marry. I felt really conflicted whether I should tell my brother or not. My family is a well-respected family in town and such a scandal would definitely ruin our good reputation. But after considering it for a while, I decided not to tell him about it. Because I believed everyone has a past they want to forget and leave behind. Who am I to judge her? I tried to justify her going into prostitution because she was going through a very difficult phase in her life and was ‘lost’ not knowing what to do.

Weeks ago, my brother finally figured it out on his own about his wife’s past, and he is now really hurt and devastated. He wants to divorce her but they have 3 little kids who would be greatly affected by it. What hurts him the most is the fact that she had kept her past a secret from him for many years. He does not know what to do now. He feels betrayed. He left their house and is currently staying at my parents’. To make things worse, after my brother told our parents about his wife, my father had a nervous breakdown and went into depression for days and had to be hospitalized for days.

I still haven’t told anyone that I have known about Sue’s past for years. And now I am feeling so guilty for this predicament that is going on in my family. I think if I had told them about it before the wedding years ago, this would have never happened. Am I The Asshole?

INFO :

My brother found out about her past from his co-worker who had ever been involved with her years ago. It's how he found out about it and that she had kept it from him that hurt him the most.

INFO 2 :

My brother did not leave their house as in abandoning her to take care of their kids on her own. He's just in a very bad place now and can't look at her. My dad is very old and weak and has had some serious complications in the past so it's all too much for him to digest. Thanks to everyone who calls him a drama queen. 

My brother on the other hand is more hurt because SIL has lied to him. She told him that after she divorced her first husband, she went back to live with a friend in another city and started working there for a while. I have asked him, if he had known the truth, would he have been okay with it still and married her anyway? 
He told me he doesn't know. He could have accepted her for who she really was or broken up with her immediately. Either, he loves her so much and it hurts him that she has lied to him."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"Title about sums it up.  I told her days ago that the cup was on the line tonight, and this was a game I cannot miss. She didn't accept my offer to watch together, which we do sometimes but she's not crazy about hockey, so she planned to stay home tonight and do her thing. This is very normal for us, sometimes she joins me for the game sometimes she passes.  This is the first time in our relationship I that I've made it clear I will not be willing to do other things during the game.  She was understanding, as hockey is by far my biggest hobby.  So just to get ahead of you reddit relationship experts, don't even start with the ""SHE HATES HOCKEY YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS BAD YOU ARE BAD"".

She calls me crying during the second period.  She took mushrooms that her shithead father gave her and was puking and tripping.  I immediately asked if she was okay, does she need an ambulance.  She said no she's just worried. I googled symptoms and she appeared to just be having a mild overdose.  

While I was furious, I didn't want her to die or anything. I don't know much about mushrooms but in any OD situation it's a concern, so I wanted to be sure she's okay while also trying to put aside the fact that she did some dumbass shit and was now expecting me to bail her out.

So I left her on speakerphone and just let her tell me her thoughts, which she requested, just stay on the line with her.  I honestly didn't listen to a word she said, i'd just check in with her if she stopped talking.  I finished the game, had dinner, called her back later.

She was mad at ME for not going over because she ""needed"" me.  I told her multiple times on the long phone conversation we just had that I didn't go because her plan, which she told me while ODing, was to never tell me that she even took the mushrooms.  She only told me because she was ODing.

I'm mad that she did it.  I'm mad that she wanted to break up with ME (she has since taken it back, admitted she was wrong) because I didn't go to her when she ""needed me"".  Fuck that.  I am 29, she is 25.  She wanted to do drugs, she did her drugs and got her side effect.  I saw the Blues blow game 6 and I didn't enjoy one second of it.

I replied saying it was pitiful and embarrassing that her mom would try to take advantage of him like that. I refused to go. 

Somehow the script was flipped on me and they tried to make it out like I just didn't want to go because I didn't want to spend time with them. I feel like I can't explain it in full without making things worse.

Her mom isn't particularly a bad person but I would say she's the type to steal the cash before returning the wallet if you get what I mean. She encourages my girlfriend's little brother to do shit like shit like steal margarita glasses from restaurants, cut lines at amusement parks, mess with the neighbor's property when they piss her off, go back for a 2nd free refill on popcorn after she got the first.... you get the point, small stuff but says a lot about character to me atleast.

byvap0	2019-06-10 08:24:14		AITA for not going to my brothers anniversary party?	"So my brother and his wife have an anniversary party coming up. My wife and I were invited, but I do not plan to attend. My wife is supporting me in whatever I want to do, so I don't have any pressure from that side.

&#x200B;

We got the invite for the anniversary party, and I RSVP'd as a ""No"". My mom and extended family immediately reached out to me and told me the whole family should attend, and encouraged me to change my RSVP.

For context, I have a brother & a sister. We were all extensively abused physically and psychologically by our father after our parents divorced. My brother struck out independently at the age of 16 and left me (two years younger) and my sister (two years younger than me) to live with our father.

&#x200B;

During that time I bore the brunt of the abuse from our father. I don't want to recount every instance, but this included being locked in the unfinished basement & forced to dig out the addition for 16+ hours at a time. Being beat physically with bare hands, belts, and shoes. Being forced to help with the renovation of the new houses he bought to flip, including being beat with power tools and cut with tools such as box cutters and drywall knives, or ""wrestled"" during fixture installs, such as being choked with faucets, etc.

After this whole ordeal I split from myfamily, not officially, but I didn't speak with them much. My whole family kept their distance from me and I became a bit of a black sheep. I moved on with my life, got married, started a career, bought a house, etc.

&#x200B;

Last year. My brother gets married to his fiancee. She is already pregnant, and neither of them have good jobs, but they are living in a house owned by her parents, and not in a bad situation in that regard. They decide to get married, which I support, but they decide to get married on my birthday. Not like ""On the same weekend"", but literally the exact same date as my birthday.

&#x200B;

My brother asked me to join his wedding party when they were married, and did not recall that my birthday was the specific date they had chosen. I had to remind him that the specific date he had picked was my birthday. He was surprised, but didn't see an issue, and when I told him I was busy that day because it was my birthday he admonished me for not making time for his wedding. (I had already booked a trip for my birthday)

&#x200B;

I didn't make the wedding, and generally forgot about the issue. I heard from my brother recently for the anniversary of their wedding, and I rejected the invite, because of my general resentment towards my brother and family. Shortly thereafter I got a ton of push-back from my family for rejecting the invite for their anniversary, which literally occurs on my birthday, and presumably will continue to be on my birthday for the rest of their marriage. My mother is telling me I'm an asshole, my sister and cousins are telling me I need to swallow my pride and just show up for their anniversary.

&#x200B;

So tell me, am I the asshole?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

13 years ago, I had a hookup. We were able to keep in touch as we had a few mutual friends. Days later, I find out from another friend that she is pregnant so I got worried and tried to get in touch with her. I was terrified, I was nervous, the girl I was with was very religious so she was entirely against the idea of getting an abortion. I decided to just stick with her and try my best to be a dad. But when the baby came, I just couldn't bring myself to actually be a father. I was 18 and I was barely able to get a job for myself, I didn't know how I was gonna really help the kid at all. Once it hit me that I would have to actually take on the responsibilities and shit, I freaked out and tried to get away. I ghosted the woman I hooked up with and basically cut off any ties. My parents understood and let me move with my older brother, who was 28 and in need of a new roommate at the time. 
 

Recently I came back to visit my parents for 2 weeks. As I was walking around the corner to get to CVS, I saw the same women I left years ago, walking towards my direction. She stopped me and we talked for a while, then she started yelling at me and got mad at me for leaving. She told me how much of a piece of shit I was and how fucked up it was for me to leave, which I agree a whole lot. Then she told me how she even lied to our daughter and told her that another man was her father. And how her ""dad"" basically abused the kid. 

     
I can't stop thinking about how I left her behind. I feel insanely guilty for what I did and how I left them. I know that I fucked up but I just want to make things right by her. I've grown more financially stable, I have grown more used to kids, I feel like I am ready to be a real father. 


The only issue is that I don't know how I am going to present the idea to her mother about meeting our daughter. I also don't even know what I would say to her. All I know is that I just want to be there for her and give her the dad that she never had. 
        

Tldr: 13 years, I ditched this girl that I got pregnant. I stuck with her through the pregnancy but left after the birth. I ran into her and now I feel guilty and sick of myself. Her mother told me that she was abused by her fake dad (her mom said another man was her father). I matured since then and want to be a father to her"		0	0	2.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

I(27F) and my mom (57F) don’t have the best relationship possible. During my childhood and early teenage years my mom was a heavy alcoholic that was triggered by her divorce. My mom was left to take care of us but quickly turned to drinking to cope with her divorce. She left me, her 2nd oldest child, to take care of her, my other siblings. And to do the house work that consisted of cleaning, cooking 3 meals a day for everyone, and to make sure she was well looked after when I was 8 to 13 years old.

This all ended when my dad, who moved away when the divorce happened, finally came back into our lives and saw what was happening. He told my mom that is she didn’t get sober and go into rehab that he was going to press charges of child neglect meaning she wouldn’t see us anymore. This worked and she went into rehab and got sober.

I suffered extreme PTSD that resulted in me getting panic attacks and start hysterical crying every time she drank again after the events in my childhood. This carried on until my early 20’s when I decided to start seeing a therapist.

Today I have major trust issues and can not get emotionally close to her since then. I also can not look or drink alcohol because it causes to much anxiety and fear. Recently my older sibling and so called friends have told me to get over it because it’s not a big deal. They also told me that I should be close to her because she is my mother.

So AITA for not forgiving my mother because of the mental trauma she gave me because she abandoned me when I was a child because she was to consumed by her drinking."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Cast :
Me = me, duh;

Background info :
My mom and brother were baking in the kitchen I was there to help clean the bowls and other stuff. I don't know how exactly the conversation went but at one time my brother said (something like that) 
And fyi I'm still 17, so I'm underage 
...

B : Yeah, I think if one of us (siblings) is going to be pregnant in the future it would be Soleina

Me : I don't think so. I don't want to have children.

B : I know, but someone will probably get you drunk and then you'll have a one night stand with the guy and you'll get pregnant

Me : what the fuck? Why would you say something like that to me?
(little information; I never get really drunk and I find anything that has to do with something sexual disgusting)

B : why are you getting mad?

Me : You just called me indirectly a whore and stupid?!

M : No he did not!

M : Yes he did! He said that I'll have a one night stand, because I'm drunk and then that I'll be too stupid to use protection!

B : No I didn't say it like that

M : You're just overreacting again. Always hearing only the negative side of things.

Me : Okay, so if I say that B is going to be an alcoholic later with a broken marriage and so he'll rob a bank and die in prison its okay?! 

M : Now you're just insulting him?

Me : Why? As you said he's only hearing the negative things.

B : This is completely different!

Me : No its not! You just can't say something like that to your underage sister!

I stormed off and went to my room, because I was starting to cry.(They say that I was hurt) 
A few minutes later I get a text from my mother saying that I'm just overreacting and that I want to fight with my family, because I can only hear the negative things in their sentences.

byv081	2019-06-10 07:43:04		AITA for wanting to reach out to someone who might be my sister...?	"I’m on mobile and just found all of this out last night. 

Once upon a time twenty years ago, my dad cheated on his second wife with another woman who was also in a relationship about three years before he met my mom and married her.

One thing led to another and a daughter was conceived but her boyfriend’s name was on the birth certificate. No paternity test was ever performed and eventually her father got custody of her but her mother claims that my dad is her father when it’s convenient for her.

My mom is pissed that I found out through one of my relatives because she wanted to be the one to tell me but now I’m full of curiosity and want to know this possible sister. Apparently the other girl doesn’t even know about the possibility of her dad not being her biological dad.

My mom reached out to her dad and he got really defensive about it and basically said straight up that I want to know if she’s my sister or not. I have also seen pictures of her and she is the spitting image of my father.

I feel like this could all be solved if she’d just take a DNA test.

Growing up as an only child, I have wanted nothing more than to have a sibling. So is it wrong of me to want to reach out to her when I am eighteen (a few months from now) and ask her to take a DNA test with me? I don’t want to effect her relationship with her dad or make her hate her mom (her mom already isn’t in her life due to other things) but I feel like I have missed out on so much by not knowing about her for the past seventeen years when she was always three hours away from me. I would feel so selfish if I did reach out and she ended up being my sister and I 1) effect her relationship with her dad and 2) made her feel abandoned by my dad. No matter what, her dad is still her father because he raised her and loved her and was the man she deserved in her life and I acknowledge and respect that.

So, am I the asshole for wanting a relationship with someone who might be my sister? Also, where do I go from here?

- My dad is dead

Couple of weeks ago, my sister (S) came into town to attend my graduation.  I wasn't aware of this because she wanted it to be a surprise, however she needed transportation because she also wanted to meet up with old friends while she was back in her hometown.  
So, my mom agrees to lend her my car without my consent or even my knowledge.  I did not use the car for two weeks as a result.
By doing this, I argued with them that my mom disrespected the ownership of my things.  My sister basically said that I was complaining for no reason and that I don't own the car because I did not buy it nor do I pay for it's insurance or gas.  But neither did my mom, the car was entirely paid by my dad along with the insurance and most, if not all, of its maintenance so I'd argue that my mom doesn't own the car either and has no right to lend it out.  The car was a gift from my dad, therefore I should have ownership, right?

Funny thing about all this was that I would've been okay with my sister using my car if my mom just asked me first.  AITA


If anybody needs clarifications or info, ask.  I'm terrible at writing cohesively.

"My best friend Christina and I have known each other since elementary school and she and I have been there and supported each other through the hardest times in our lives. When we were in high school, we were both in a club with this one guy Conner for a few years. Christina and I always agreed that Conner was attractive and in general just a great person to be around. 

Throughout high school he dated another girl in the same club, Serena, so we never flirted with him or gave any indication that we liked him. After Conner’s gf graduated last year, she broke things off with him and he dated a girl for a short time this year. 

Meanwhile, Christina and I keep in touch with Conner when we visit home from school. Usually in a small group setting, but then he hit on me and we started talking more and getting closer. I’m a pretty shy and socially anxious person, so I can be kind of hesitant in romantic interaction. 

Today I had a conversation with Christina to try and feel out her thoughts, and it went like this:

“Hey Christina i know I’m breaking my own rule of dating inside the friend group, but Conner is pretty cute lol”

“YEAH i kind of want to go out with him sometime i think”

*Awkward silence*

*laughs in anxiety* “wouldn’t that be kinda weird tho? If we both went out with him? I’d feel weird about it.”

“I liked him a long time before you tho. Remember? I said it when he and Serena broke up?”

I remember. She told me said that Conner was really cute and i agreed...more than a year ago. I dropped it after that because i didn’t want to argue, but when we saw Conner later that day, she outwardly flirted with him and other people at the party, which were mostly guys from the club we were in together in high school. She’s dated guys in the club before, but it was forward enough that other people at the party brought it up to me.

She and I have both heard Conner thinks we r both snaccs, but thinks that we we’re out of his league?? from mutual friends. But tonight Conner hung out and sat by me for half of the party Christina and I went to even though he was the host, so i think he kind of likes me as well...?

He's always been creative and into drawing and he's really good at it. Last month he applied for this regional competition for high school students, which includes art, drama, music etc. The theme is ""modern injustice"" (loose translation) and the competitors have to imagine some situation involving that and create art about it.

Basically my brother drew a poster of two guys kissing and included titles from articles about homophobic attacks, LGBT rights and such. It was good but sort of controversial for where we are. His teachers rejected the entry probably because of that, though they said the reason was the bad words and names in article titles.

So my brother was pretty angry and wanted to complain to the principal with his friend. Our parents told him not to do that because his grades and teachers are more important. And well, I sort of agree with them.

He already gets ostracized and called gay and I just don't want him to make things worse, even if he's in the right. That's why when he complained to me, I told him to just back out or draw something different because this is not going to seem that important in a few years.

Given that most employers ask for this qualification when hiring I decide to not teach the students the rest of the course as there is no point given that they would never hire kid who says they were taught how to be a lifeguard without actually having the prerequisite qualification. 
Despite getting paid £80 a day to run this week long course I felt that there was no point in running this course since these kids are getting no professional qualifications out of it.

Here is the dilemma. From all of the stories and snapchats I've seen of their holiday so far, it looks like this is indeed a massive boys trip so I decided to ask my buddy John if this was a boys trip only or if that Daisy could join us and hang out.   
I gave him a call and he put me on speakerphone when I asked him and so I could ask the whole group and without missing a beat, more than one of the dudes in the background blurted out that they didn't want any females there during the trip as this was meant to be a boys trip and that I should tell my gf let me off the leash. As suspected, these dudes are meatheads and I don't want anything to do with them, but I felt like I had to because of my best bud, John. 

  
I don't have to hang out with Daisy to see these boys but I feel like Myself and Daisy had already planned a lot of stuff to do with just John and his other buddy before we fount out that these other dudes were coming as well and now the idea of her being excluded from the group because she doesn't have a penis has me feeling some kind of way. 

I told John that I don't feel comfortable excluded Daisy from the group as she literally helped plan and book a lot of the activities that we had planned for these guys so I told him that if she's not welcome to join us, then they'll just have to have a dope trip by themselves and that I'd catch him next time I head back to my hometown (which is at the earliest, another year away).  
He was upset saying that he'd been planning this catch up for a while (which is true) and that me bailing on them would be a jerk thing to do.

When I was a kid I used to be very thin and I was very close with my cousins on that side of the family. Every week we would go to each other’s houses and whatnot. Their parents however would make comments about how rebellious I was and how I was unnaturally thin, and it almost seemed like I was in constant competition with my cousin. Once for my cousin’s birthday he got a Pokémon themed board game that I really wanted. For Christmas, I got a $5 dollar yo-yo. I didn’t even play yo-yo. 

Our families stopped talking to each other when they got into a fight over our grandmother’s financials. Our grandmother’s often in debt. Not sure why but I did manage to hear once about her spending a lot of money on church. Shes from a small and poverty-stricken town. They stopped talking for around 2 years. I was 13-15?

Around the same time I began to struggle with my sexuality, religion, and body issues and I felt relieved. All I ever heard from everyone talk was the family problems and how she was always in debt and how they all had to send her money. Meanwhile my father’s business began to fail and we kept moving around and around. 

My uncle and his family would visit family in Honduras with everyone pitching in to reduce costs. My father owned a business so he was constantly working to provide for our family and send money to Honduras and all that. Once my uncle tried convincing my mother to divorce my father because he was never around. 

They made up years later and tried getting closer to us and they came over before thanksgiving where I ignored my cousins completely. I was polite but very quiet. No one understood why but I knew that the minute I became close with them again, their parents would be here every other week. I just couldn’t go through that again.  I had no interest trying to reconnect with them again.

 That Christmas, they came back and gave my siblings gifts while they didn’t give me anything. I think I was 15? 

 Now I’m 19 and my grandmother is here for a week. We haven’t seen her in years and I’m not sure what to feel about all of this. Part of me doesn’t care because Im not close to her at all. Everyone’s so excited and whatnot and I’m being guilted into everything. I hate hurting people’s feelings but i don’t know what to do.  My sister was invited to go with my aunt to bond with our grandmother and them. Wibtia if I didn’t go?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byurxx	2019-06-10 07:12:23		AITA for telling my sister her lifestyle is likely why she is struggling to get pregnant (after she tried to blame me and everything else in the world for it)?	"There is more to this but previous post exceeded character limit

My sister got married 6 months ago and they are trying to get pregnant

Her and I had an argument on Saturday because she was blaming me for her not being able to get pregnant, because I am causing her stress. She said this because I forgot to put a bowl in the dishwasher and a milk bottle in the recycling. I don't think I am causing her stress, she has been an asshole (in my opinion) about me for a long time and I have held my tongue, but when she accused me of causing her to be the reason she couldn't get pregnant I couldn't hold it in anymore. This is what I said after she accused me of being the reason she is struggling to get pregnant

>""It is not my fault you're not getting pregnant. You smoke over 20 cigarettes a day, you are addicted to caffeine (note: she takes 2 caffeine pills a day, and the rest of the day glugs diet soda by the liter, she is easily having over 400mg a day). If anything is stopping you getting pregnant, it's that. Have you never even considered stopping for all this trouble you are having? Rather than blaming me and everything else causing you stress?""

She got really angry at that, said

>""cigarettes and caffeine don't stop you from getting pregnant, they are only dangerous when you are already pregnant and she would stop if she gets pregnant"".

I told her

>""this amount of cigarettes and caffeine would absolutely stop you getting pregnant for the same reasons it would hurt a baby, and I wouldn't be surprised if you are causing yourself to be totally barren.""

She totally freaked out and yelled

>""Did you just say I was barren?""

I told her,

>""no, I didn't say you were barren, I said the cigarettes and caffeine would be causing it to be that way, and if you stopped then you'd probably get pregnant.""

She said

>""that the cigarettes and caffeine wouldn't be causing anything like that, so if I think she is barren then I must think she is simply barren""

She was crying by then and stormed off. She has been avoiding me since. I tried to talk to BIL but he says that right now whilst his wife is upset she is his priority, he doesn't want to get involved between us to make things worse right now, but will discuss it when she has calmed down. Which I understand. 

He said she may have been particularly sensitive that day because her period was three weeks late and she thought she had symptoms of pregnancy but it turned out she wasn't pregnant at all, and they had only got that confirmed the day before that she is simply having irregular periods (maybe also her lifestyle?)

Was I an asshole for pointing this out? Was I am asshole with the way i did it? Heck am I wrong that this could be contributing to struggles? I feel like she is blaming me for everything in the world anyway but this felt like too much, and I flipped."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byurwu	2019-06-10 07:12:17	Anon_cashew	WIBTA if I stopped helping a friend with his homework like I promised?	"I met this guy, Chris, in a class last semester and we quickly became friends. When the semester ended, I agreed to help edit his papers and sort of tutor him for an online class he’s taking this semester. 

I live with my parents and on Friday, they had a fight. Nothing too dramatic, but my dad threatened to leave (he does this semi frequently when they fight and it’s only for 1 or 2 nights) and my mom physically stopped him from leaving. Eventually I stepped in to defuse the situation and everything got sorted out and he stayed. I took videos without my parents knowing so that I could show my sister and our best friend, who know how chaotic my household is. 

I also sent one of the videos to Chris and told him how upset I was by the situation, because we’d been texting and having a conversation before that. He didn’t respond at all until today, Sunday, when he told me he got all his work and homework done. He had like one sentence where he said he hoped everything is okay, then went back to talking about work. 

My best friend also ignored the argument video, but I got over it because she’s my best friend and I didn’t wanna start unnecessary drama. But with Chris, we haven’t been friends that long (only since January) and we’ve already had a few bumps here and there. I think it was rude of him to not text back then or the next morning even though I’ve done a lot for him. 

My issue is that if I stop being friends with Chris, that also means not helping him with his homework for the rest of the semester like I promised. I feel shitty going back on a promise. But then I also feel like it would be awkward to help with the homework and tell him we can’t talk about anything else because I’m over our friendship. 

So would I be the asshole if I stopped helping him?

Edit: apparently I left out some necessary context. By “a few bumps here and there,” I meant I tried to end the friendship for other, unrelated reasons a few other times but he told me I was hurting his feelings and making him feel bad, so I felt guilty and decided to give him more chances. I should’ve stood my ground on the issues before, but my guilt made me think I was being unnecessarily harsh. Even before this particular issue, I found the friendship to be a little more stressful than I like."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"Now I just want to start this off by saying, there is three people in this situation (including me) I will not be saying ages, you can assume whatever age we are, doesn't matter and it's not related to the situation and won't change things.

There is me, friend A, and friend B. This all took place on Discord.

This story starts about a week before, Me and friend A were having drama and we broke apart because they hurt me, I set clear boundaries in the past and they promised they wouldn't do it again, obviously friend B got involved as they know both friend A and me well. I told them about the situation and (this is important for later) didn't ask for any advice and just told them bye.

Awhile later, friend B told me to go into a chat and jumped into a Group Chat with me, friend A and them that already existed in the past and friend B started giving us advice (which I appreciated) I was still arguing with friend A about the drama when out of nowhere Friend B started complaining about their personal life and their breakup with their ex saying they shouldn't have to deal with this, they complain to us that we dragged them into this group which is untrue.

Due to this lie and her playing the victim card I did say some harsh things then left the chat. Both weren't my friend anymore until later where friend A and I made up, and became friends again and I became friends with friend B and too and apologized for all that was said.

During the events in between me and my friends bonded we talked about the situation openly and all 3 of us admitted to our mistakes.

This comes to the events of this post, Friend B had a popular Discord Server, friend A was a admin of said chat but was fired for these reasons listed here: Not active enough, not contributing enough, said ""I want you to win"" to a contestant in their game which is ""interfering"" you have to understand what kind of discord this is before judging, this is a gameshow type thing and there is contestants playing in the games itself, however admins should be able to share their opinion and tell one of the contestants if they want them to win or not as Friend A in the past said ""I want you to win"" to another contestant in the past and recieved no warning.

I started complaining in Friend B's server when Friend B and a bunch of their friends started talking behind Friend A's back in the server, saying bad stuff about how they spoke to others, their job and personal stuff about Friend A

I spoke up against it and after a lot of arguing on both sides over their trash talking about Friend A I got kicked from the server.

After this, I got word from another friend they were trash talking me too after I was kicked from the server, I also noticed Friend B had blocked me and in return I blocked them back and cut all contacts with them.

So the big question is, are me and my friend in the wrong for this? Sure there are things we could've done better are we at fault here?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

"I’m changing the names to keep this anonymous cause i know too many people who look at this subreddit. My best friend Christina (19) and I have known each other since elementary school and she and I have been there and supported each other through the hardest times in our lives. When we were in high school, we were both in a club with this one guy Conner (18) for a few years. Christina and I always agreed that Conner was attractive and in general just a great person to be around. 

Throughout high school Conner dated another girl, Serena (19), from the same club and both Christina and i dated other people, so we never flirted with him or gave any indication that we kind of had a crush on him, but we were often around him because we were in the same friend group. After Conner’s gf graduated last year, she broke things off with him and he dated a girl for a short time this year, but they broke up after only a few months.
Meanwhile, Christina and I kept in touch with Conner when we visited home from school. Usually in a small group setting, but then this summer he hit on me in our group chat and we started talking more and getting closer since. I’m a pretty shy and socially anxious person, so I can be kind of hesitant in romantic interactions, so I don’t want to jump into anything.
Today I had a conversation with Christina to try and feel out her thoughts, and it went like this:

“Hey Christina i know I’m breaking my own rule of dating inside the friend group, but Conner is pretty cute lol”

“YEAH i kind of want to go out with him sometime i think”

Awkward silence

*laughs in anxiety* “wouldn’t that be kinda weird tho if we both did? I’d feel weird about it”

“I liked him a long time before you tho. Remember, when he and Serena broke up for a bit the first time i said i wanted to go out with him?”

She isn’t lying about that. She said that when he and Serena broke up...more than a year ago. I dropped it after that because i didn’t want to argue with her over a little crush, but when we saw Conner later that day, she outwardly flirted with him, but also flirted with some of the other guys in our group of friends, which is pretty much just the guys from the club we were all in together. I’ve never dated someone from that group, but she has gone out with at least two of them that I can think of.

I just chilled and caught up with some of my friends at the party, but Conner hung out with me and sat by me for half of it even though he was the host, so i think he kind of likes me as well...? So AITA if I hang out with him more and try dating him even though my best friend likes him too?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I am getting married this summer and I wanted to spend some time with family before then, so I have been here since beginning of May and I’ll be here until end of June.

My brother (18) and I planned a camping trip for this coming weekend, which would be the last siblings trip we would take for a long time if not ever. This is the only weekend it worked for both of us, as I work quite a bit and have appointments and a bridal shower coming up, and then I leave.

I went away this weekend to visit a friend and my mom texted me that my brother made a scheduling mistake and he has not one but three commitments for the weekend of our trip. The sites are booked and paid for, and he didn’t text me to mention that anything had happened when I was gone, so I only heard it through my mom. 
When I got home I expressed to my mom that I was upset he had been so careless about scheduling, and that I was angry because he didn’t tell me himself. He proceeded to not come upstairs to say hello or talk to me about what had happened. 

I was shocked when my mom ripped into me saying that it was ‘my choice to be upset about this’ and ‘he’s just like that because he’s a guy’. She was visibly angry with me for wanting him to own up to his mistake and apologize. 
When I went downstairs, he came out and we talked about it, and ended up resolving things somewhat, but he never apologized. I sort of let it go because I wasn’t about to try and coax an apology out of him, although I did let him know I was hurt and upset. 

I am still baffled about my mom’s response and I feel like she is coddling him. He’s an adult and should be learning to apologize when he makes mistakes. WIBTA if I directly told her what I think? Is that out of line?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

This happened about three days ago, I am still fairly hurt and she is furious at me. We have been together for just under a year. 

For the past several weeks Jenny has been asking me what I want to do for my birthday and hinting that she has something big planned, my family doesn’t celebrate birthdays so I was very excited for it. 

When the day finally roles around she hangs out with me for about an hour in the morning and then leaves because she “has to get ready”. I assumed she was getting whatever she had planned for us ready. 

I was wrong, she was getting ready for her girls night and didn’t tell me that is where she was heading for the night. I waited for her until 5 pm (rejecting my friends invites to hang out) when I texted her asking where she was. She replied 40 min later that she was heading to her friends. I then didn’t see her again till the next day. 

I was hurt and then angry when I saw her the following day. She said I was a “selfish c**t for expecting things on my birthday and sexist for not liking that she went out with the girls” and that one of her friends dogs had died so they all had to go out. I said that even though it is sad about the dog, since other friends were going to support her friend she could have stayed with me, also she goes out with her friends for drinks at least once a week, she could have given this one a miss.

I am especially hurt since I bought her a kitten for her birthday and put a lot of effort in organising a group trip to the beach for the weekend.

For the longest time, my wife and I have loved Lil Dicky. He's hilarious and has some great songs. 

About a year ago, he put out a song called ""Freaky Friday"". Not sure if links are allowed, but here's the song: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZla1ttZHaw

The whole ""point"" of the song is that Lil Dicky switches bodies with Chris Brown. When the song came out, I thought that is was shitty for Lil Dicky to interact with Chris Brown, but to each his own. 

Lately, my wife has been playing the song pretty constantly. It's on every playlist. It's a good song, it's catchy, it's funny, but I can't get past the Chris Brown part. If you don't know, or if you need a refresher, Chris beat Rihanna (Robyn) to a pulp. Here's the police report:

http://www.mtv.com/news/1606481/chris-brown-police-report-provides-details-of-altercation/

Please read through the description of the attack.

Once my wife started playing the song more than occasionally, I asked her to stop. I explained the backstory. But she still played it. I sent her the above link, but she hasn't read through it yet.

So. Am I the Asshole for asking her to stop playing the song? Or is it just a song, just music, and the history doesn't matter?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My family is not coming to see me because they shunned me ever since I left my childhood religion so I will only have my guy come see me walk. My fiance is all the family I have right now and he has 3 kids and an ex wife. His oldest daughter graduates the day before me, everyone is going to that and they're doing a brunch party for her. They all seem to like me, but they didn't ask to come see me walk... 

 I am working hard on being part of his family but it's difficult sometimes because I get a bit jealous of his ex at times since they have kids together and I can't have kids due to medical reasons so I will never have that parent relationship with my fiance. 

Mother's day was difficult because he invited her to our house and we cooked for her. He invited her without asking me if it was ok

Now I am feeling hurt because my family won't be at my graduation and on top of that I have to go to the ex's house to celebrate Father's day that same evening. I had told my fiance that idc that much about this graduation since I'm going to grad school next year and I care more about that graduation however I only said this to try and save face... Maybe that was my mistake...i want to cry because no one is doing anything for me...So i feel like my accomplishments don't matter 

I told him how I feel but he thinks I should suck it up. Am i being bratty?

Edit 1: fiance and ex have a healthy relationship. With healthy boundaries, I'm not threatened. This is just one big situation.

Edit 2: I didn't want to ask them to come see me since I'm not super comfortable asking them to do that. I've been very good with the kids, taking care of them and being cordial to the ex. I just don't feel right saying,""heY cAn yoU guyZ come See Me gradAte?""

"For some background, my parents divorced about 8 years ago and my dad remarried 3 months after. I was never really able to process the divorce and my dads sudden new marriage (it all happened so fast) and I also am an only child so at the time I felt like no one understood what I was going through and life just went on as such.

Since the divorce my parents have still not managed to get along and do not communicate AT ALL (leaving me to be the middle man- have been since I was 14), which has made a lot of things extremely more complicated than they needed to be. However, I think my stepmom has a lot to do with it because she absolutely despises my mom for no good reason, constantly fuels the fire (purposefully asking me things about my mom in front of my dad that she knows will tick my dad off; talks badly about my mom; etc.), and refuses to acknowledge that my mom and dad ever had a relationship at all and treats my childhood as basically nonexistent (she becomes visibly uncomfortable when I talk about childhood memories involving my mom and dad). 

I have never asked my parents to try to better their relationship for my sake OR confronted my stepmom about her behavior/treatment/attitude towards anything regarding my mother. I always chose to keep my mouth shut and keep the peace. Believe me when I say that I have put up with so much more than what I have shared in this post. For the longest time, I have accepted that this is just how things are and always will be. 

Flash forward to present day. I graduate from a four year university this week and I am extremely excited as I am the first one in my family to do so. However, I am also extremely nervous as my mom, dad, and stepmom will all be sitting together (against their wishes, limited number of seat-assigned tickets per graduate) and my parents have not seen each other since my high school graduation four years ago where they did NOT sit together but saw each other from afar. 

Obviously, I want to take pictures with everybody after the ceremony. This includes some alone with my mom, some alone with my dad, some with my dad and stepmom... 
and also one with me, my mom, and my dad together. The last picture I have of just me and my parents has to be over ten years old. Am I the asshole for wanting to take a picture with them on my college graduation day? I know my stepmom will be upset and will probably go off on me at some point, but this is important to me. If there’s a day I’d want a picture with my parents, it would be this day and my (far off in the future) wedding day. I can’t help but feel anxious and even a little guilty but these are the two people that I love most in this world and if I don’t at least try, I really feel like I will regret it for the rest of my life."

byulp0	2019-06-10 06:50:14	kent814	AITA My mom pays for my college and is threatening to pull me out and I think shes being too harsh	So to start, I have a long history of not putting in the proper effort to get the grades I should be getting. My test scores have always outpaced my GPA, and my mom always has been frustrated by this. In spite of this, I accumulated enough AP credit in high school to basically enter college as a sophomore. I also have a pretty big college savings account from other relatives. My major requires a 3.0 GPA for auto admission into the major, and everyone else is reviewed holistically; my first term was alright and I maintained a 3.0 GPA. But my second term I struggled a lot, as I got much to acclimated to the freedom of college and would spend way too many weekdays staying up until 3-4AM playing video games, and avoiding my schoolwork. This reflected in my grades as I got 3 Cs in classes I shouldve at least gotten Bs in, and I flunked my calculus class that I need to take for my major, so I need to retake it. After that term, my mom already wanted to pull me out of school, but I managed to talk her down from it, her stipulation was that I need all As this term to stay. At the time I obviously agreed, because I wanted to continue my education. And as this term went on, I put a lot more work into school and had really good grades in 3/4 classes(two As and a high B that should become an A). But my history class turned out to be my hardest class, and I dont even have a B in it and Im worried that I wont finish with an A in it. Throughout the term, my mom has peppered me with reminders about taking me out if I dont get all As. And now Im worried that, even though Ive definitely shown improvement not only in my grades but my overall study habits, shes still going to take me out because of this one class. Its not like I didnt try to talk to the teacher about it, and I kept trying to take their feedback to improve my work but my grades werent improving which was very frustrating. So Im basically a week away from knowing my GPA fate. AITA if I fight my mom about this rule, as she does pay for my college, but I am on pace to grad in 3 years still. Her main hangup is she doesnt want to pay for someone not willing to put in the effort, considering my history, but now that I made an adjustment it would suck for her to pull me out now that Ive turned a corner. Note: this is a potential situation, she may be bluffing on the strictness of the rule to force me to improve, or change her mind after seeing me miss out by one class that I tried to improve in.

He got an absolutely horrible monkey doll from a friend of my mothers, and it fucking terrified me. It looked like one of those dolls you get on Annabelle or Chucky. So anyway, my brother finds out I don’t like this ‘ thing ‘ and proceeds to wave it in my face for an ENTIRE 2 HOUR CAR JOURNEY. My parents didn’t even reprimand him. When we got home, I didn’t think much about it anymore, because I was distracted by a console. But in the morning, he insisted on having it next to him while eating breakfast, and when I went to clean my teeth, he threw it at me, and my mum just laughed. He was doing all this maliciously I might add. When they went downstairs, I went into his room, grabbed the doll, and stuffed it as far underneath the bed as I could. When we all got home from our daily excursion, my brother went straight upstairs to get the monkey doll. When he discovered it wasn’t where he left it and couldn’t find it, he burst into tears. My mum has to comfort him and then confronted me, asking if I knew where it was. I told her I didn’t and why would I touch that horrible thing? She seemed to believe me, and it’s still under the bed to this day. AITA? I need help here.	Asshole	0	0	22.0	8.0	0.0	0.0
byuk4n	2019-06-10 06:44:34	froy3157	AITA for getting angry that my partner doesn’t want to live with me?	"I (23F) am wanting to move in with my partner (24M) but he has told me he would prefer to ‘get the experience of living by himself’, until he decides that I can move in. My partner’s parents are wealthy and own an apartment that they are letting him move into next month, paying rent that’s a fraction of the market value. He’s never lived out of home before and is nervous about moving out, I think because his parents have always cut him down when he expresses a desire to be more independent. This place is only a few blocks from his family home but he still sees this as a big step. 

We have been talking about living together for a long time and I’ve been holding off from moving out of my current housing situation, which I’m not super happy with. We were originally planning on moving into this apartment at the start of the year, but a few weeks before the move he told me he ‘wasn’t ready yet’. I was mad about the plans being cancelled at the last minute, but agreed to give him more time. 

Well he finally arranged to get the keys to the apartment and I thought we would be moving in together, but he has just decided that we wants ‘the experience of living alone’. His justification is that he’s never had the experience of living out of home before he wants to try it on his own. He says he will be compromising by letting me ‘come over whenever I want’. He said that ‘anyone would be crazy not to take the chance to live by themselves’.

I am really angry about our plans being cancelled again. I think that my partner is overly sheltered and doesn’t realise that other people want time to sort of living arrangements, they can’t just move into one their parents properties when it suits them. I can understand if he isn’t ready to move in together but he’s told me all year how important it is to him, just to pull the rug out from under me at the last minute. I’m not in the same situation but can’t help with think that if I were, I’d want to share it with my partner. AITA? Should I take this as a hint he doesn’t want to be with me and move on?"

byuk1h	2019-06-10 06:44:13	LateForDinner1986	AITA for not wanting families gathering outside my townhouse of an afternoon??	"So, a bit of context to start. I live in down a quite narrow street with townhouses on either side. I live right down the end, and there is a turning bay right next to me where trucks etc can turn around and head back out. 
There no area for kids to play and people's backyards are tiny.

There have been a few instances of kids riding bikes and playing on the roads and cars nearly hitting them. There are quite a lot of blind spots from cars parking outside their driveways. 

A solution to kids just  being all over the street has been for parents to bring them up my end and block off the turning bay to have the kids play there. Problem is, now they gather pretty much right outside our driveway on the road and the noise is loud, and the kids seem to run through our driveway. 
What's also annoying is that when my partner returns home from work, she often has to dodge and wait for kids to get out of the way to enter out driveway. And the worst part is the parents don't even seem to care. From what I've seen they mainly just want to all sit together and drink while the kids play.

People have suggested taking them to a park but they can't drink there so they makes excuses as to why they can't do that.

Am I the asshole for wanting my peace and quiet back??

Edit:
So we've been having a few problems in the complex  with kids, cars, parking, you name it it's probably been an issue at some point, so this issue seems to annoy me as it's affects my townhouse the most. It's probably not as big a deal as it seems, but it's gets to me all the same."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

5 months ago I gave birth to a wonderful baby girl, the father of the baby wanted nothing to do with her and only wanted to pay child support. I was not thinking straight while pregnant and agreed to it. 

he now only has to pay child support (200$ a week) and I'm annoyed. I want him to be in her life more because she will need a father and I can't do that. 

some additional info 

the pregnancy was not planned and because I assumed my birth control was working we did not use a condom. I did wait 3 months to tell him but that was because I was terrified. 

I've messaged him repeatedly asking him to at least meet her, but he keeps on refusing telling me he does not want to meet her. 
I also tried asking his family what they thought and they agreed with him telling me to back off.

byujpa	2019-06-10 06:42:59	th1cc13th4fr34k	AITA for calling my aunt out on past abuse?	"This is going to be long so bear with me. 

My aunt is honestly a huge failure in life, and she knows it. With that being said, she’s insecure about it and always tries to tell me and my mom how to live our lives (I’m an only child and my mom was a single mom so we’re pretty close). Since I can remember, she’s only ever criticized me. One of the most significant times that I can remember was when I arrived to her house at the age of 12 with my first pair of glasses that I desperately needed. She looked at me in disgust and told me to take them off because I look like a “special needs child.” She was honestly one of my childhood bullies, except I could never escape her because she was “family.” I’m not going to give any more examples, just know that the comments got worse as I aged... and as I aged, my hatred grew for her. 

Fast forward to now. Her and I are not close at all, but it seems like she tries to force it while still making extremely slick abusive comments to me. Ive always been quiet or just make sarcastic remarks back to her that shut her up. I finally had enough after she made a rude comment to a cashier at the grocery store, telling her “wow you’re skinny, do you even eat?” 

When we arrived to the car (we were also in the company of my mom and my aunts daughter), I asked my aunt exactly this: “Tia, I’d like you to ask yourself if you think you’re someone that our family members would choose to be friends with if they weren’t your family members.” She was immediately confused and asked what I meant, so I went in on her by telling her that she is not someone I’d ever associate myself with if she wasn’t “family.” She began to tell me that I’m disrespectful and even started to cry. My mom is so angry at me for hurting her, telling me I should’ve “left it in the past.” I feel bad that she cried but honestly I think she needed it. No one has ever had the courage to stand up to her because she’s so incredibly mean and mouthy. She may not be as emotionally abusive to me anymore but seeing her do it to other people makes me so angry. So reddit, should I have just let it go or am I the asshole?

He had a pretty large friend group and I was ok with him hanging out with most of the girls he did. Keep in mind I said most. 99% of his female friends I trusted, I just did not trust this girl who is the 1%. For this I will change her name to Debbie. (Not her real name.) Debbie was (and still is) known to sleep around with a lot of guys, now a lot of people will say ""red flag!!!!! 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 op, you should have trusted him!!!! 😤😤😤😤""  I did trust my ex. I trusted him a lot, I just did NOT trust Debbie. Now my ex is known to get wasted pretty often with his buddies and since Debbie is sleeping with a lot of his friends she was over at a bonfire with my ex and his friends. He told me Debbie was there the next day and I told him that I trust him but I do not trust her around him when he is drunk not only that, I just don't trust her around him at all. 


He quickly responded with ""I'm not going to stop being friends with her because you tell me to."" Now, I never told him not to be friends with her. I was just saying that I do not trust her. He ended up leaving me on read for about a week, got pissed off at me for the littlest things like me asking his friend to kindly not put my full name in a paper he was writing for a class (anxiety reasons as my ex knew I was sexually harassed at that school and for privacy reasons), and worst of all, he just flat out ignored me. Now here's the thing I don't understand. When I asked him how he felt on me talking to one of my ex's he asked me not to talk to him, so I respected his wishes and blocked all communications with my ex. I thought that if I had reasons such as her being VERY WELL KNOWN for sleeping around with multiple guys was a good reason but obviously it's not because she's his ""friend"" and friends matter more than the fact that your girlfriend is legit giving you multiple reasons as to why she doesn't trust this girl.

I found out that after we broke up he ended up hooking up with Debbie and a lot of people told me I was out of his league and or too cute for him anyways. I had told him I didn't trust her and he got pissed at me for talking to him about it. 

Am I the asshole for just wanting my at the time boyfriend to be more careful around a girl who is well known for banging a lot of guys?????

And if my ex sees this: If you thought she was better than me/worth more, let me tell you my current boyfriend is bigger than yours ever was and actually can please a woman unlike you. I had to fake moan for almost 4 hours so your male ego wasn't damaged. (Lol I know this is bitchy but honestly... If he's gonna hook up with a girl who sleeps around, she ain't gonna be pleased by the game he's got either. Hope she was worth risking the STDs though.)"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byuhpm	2019-06-10 06:35:35	ItIsMeIxtlahuac	AITA for being fed up with my Drunk Uncle	"SO the relationship between my uncle and I has always been fragile. Mainly because hes a drunk that loves to rile people up and I'm a person that doesnt back down from a situation. Now I have a lot of stories about us, but I'm going to stick to one for now. I'll let you know about other times if you ask.

So today we had a little get together, some coworkers of my mom came over to eat some food that my mother made, and her brother (my uncle) came to assist. Now one of the coworkers had a daughter, and I have to say that she was a very attractive girl. My uncle noticed, and decided to play cupid. At first it was ok, just an uncle telling his nephew that there was a cute girl and that I should approach. But to be honest, even though I thought she was very attractive, I was not interested. So I told my uncle that I didnt plan on pursuing.

I guess me saying ""no"" to my uncle meant ""oh yeah of course, help me hook up with her"". So throughout the day, my uncle kept trying to get us to click. He tried to make me impress her with my meat cutting skills, start a fire by myself, show off my tattoos etc. Hes drinking throughout this time mind you. I eventually approached him and told him to stop, that it was getting annoying and to leave the situation alone. He didnt stop.

He approached the girl and told her that I was interested in her and to give me a chance. Saying that I was a nice but timid person. Soon enough I approach the girl and pretty much told her that I was sorry for his behavior, trying to pass it off as drunk talk. We eventually started having a good chat, but like I said, I wasnt interested. So nothing happened there. It doesnt stop there. My uncle approached her about 7 times, telling her the same thing, even saying ""do you like my nephew?"". At this point, everyone is getting uncomfortable and the girl and I are getting embarrassed.

The girl and her family eventually leave, and as she was leaving, my uncle again tried to approach her and ask her the same questions as before. I see my mom stop him, and I hear her say to stop. My uncle then confronts me, and tells me that I should have done something and asked her out. Saying that we were meant to be together and that he was trying to help me, but that I was ""too much of a pussy"" to do anything and to ""grow some balls"". Now like I said, I'm not the type of person to back down, so of course I defended myself by telling him I repeatedly told him to leave the poor girl alone and that I wasnt interested. He didnt like that answer.

A fight between us was about to happen, but I decided not to do anything and just chose to ignore him to cool down. I tried, I tried super hard to not hit him. I kind of wanted to shed a tear from the built up anger, but I decided to just go back to my cooking (it's what my mom would have wanted at least). But I wont lie to you, I was provoking him too. Not long after, he decided to leave and I cant help but feel like shit. If you need more info, let me know."	Not the A-hole	0	0	9.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

"When I was a lot younger, I had a great relationship with my mom, but the relationship has dwindled in recent years for many reasons (mainly me becoming a typical teenage boy). I feel our unsteady relationship and how she has to tell me multiple times to do something (like a teen and their mother do) is what affects her opinion of me.

This all started when we were driving home from the store, I like interesting facts and I read aloud a post from subreddit r/TodayILearned. The post said about a folklore tale explains autism by saying something along the lines of like the infant is switched out for the child of a fairy or demon which explains the child's mood or lack of social interaction. My nephew (her grandson) has autism, but I didn't make this connection in my mind because I knew how fucked up that would be. And then she says, ""You better not tell Emily [my sister] about that."" I love my mom, but some of the things she does can really piss me and my dad off, but this pushed me over the edge and I lit her up. ""I'm not going to do that. I would never do that. Why in the hell do you think I'd do that!? God damn it, mom! Why do you think I'd ever do such a horrible thing!? I never would and it really pisses me off you'd even get the thought in your mind that I would ever do such a thing!"" The only thing I regret was actually saying it out loud instead gritting my teeth and holding it in as I usually do. She was silent for the rest of the trip home and I was super uncomfortable because I thought I had upset her.

The same thing almost happened today at my graduation party, which she spun into a housewarming party at the last second (another one of those things that piss me off). We just recently moved into a new house and of course we have new neighbors, one are an older couple from Russia. I only know the husband's name is Aleksandr and his wife spends a lot of time at home because she doesn't know English. Well I was joking around with my friends saying I'm trying to learn Russian through video games and I said ""Brosay granatu"" and ""Prikroyte menya"", which translate out to ""Use your grenade"" and ""Cover me"". ""You better not say that to Alek."" I was wanting to call her out for it again, but we had guests and I didn't want to make a scene.

Before you say anything, I don't usually talk back to her like this. My dad taught me to pick my battles and I do; if I always talked back to her, she would have probably kicked me out a LONG time ago. I'm not posting this because I think she's an asshole and I'm in the right, she's my mother at the end of the day and I'll always love her, I've just felt bad for raising my voice at her like that even though I do feel like I had a valid point.

"i’ve been very good friends with this person for about a year now, we met through some friends and we really just hit it off. her family is like family to me, i just adore them. i would stay at her house for extended periods of time to just have fun and relax, and she always seemed to have as much fun as i did. that’s why, about a month and a half ago, when she stopped responding to every message i sent her, i was a little hurt. we have the type of dynamic where we just kinda sent each other little thoughts we had pop into our heads, just anything that made us think of the other person, and the other person would respond when they got the chance. i continued to converse with her like this for about a month after i noticed she stopped responding, just assuming she was busy, but the last straw was when i sent her a message inviting her to an important event (that she KNEW was important to me) i was a part of after not texting her for about two weeks, and she didn’t respond at all. 

at. all. 

i finally said “fuck it, fuck her.” mentally and completely checked out. i won’t respond to her texts with anything but completely monotonous and bland three word or less responses. she calls me and i send her to voicemail. my friends are concerned i’m throwing away a perfectly good friendship because my feefees got hurt, but i think i’m being completely reasonable. why should i do you favors when you won’t even give me the time of day and won’t tell me what i did wrong? she hasn’t tried to apologize what so ever, and i’m sure she doesn’t intend to. 

tl,dr; my friend ignored all my texts, including one that was me inviting her to an important event, and only texts me when she wants something. i have begun to treat her the same way. my friends think i’m being unreasonable and i’m throwing a friendship away, i think i’m treating her how she’s treating me and i don’t want to be friends with someone who thinks that’s acceptable. AITA?

EDIT: if anyone has any advice, i truly do love her but she’s really pissing me off and i’m a little afraid to confront her about it because i’m worried she’ll play the victim and i will look like the asshole even though the consensus seems to be that i’m not. how should i go about rebuilding this relationship, if at all?"

byufi7	2019-06-10 06:27:51	gmrlife6	AITA for going against my girlfriend and donating to a sperm bank?	"Not sure how to add flair for a NSFW warning, but here it is.

So my girlfriend and I are sexually active and plan on having a future together, plan on going to college, kids, owning a house. The whole nine yards. 

Well, to make some extra money for college since I'll be starting soon, one of my coworkers recommended becoming a sperm donor. He donates too, and it helps him make his payments each month for his house, his car, etc.

I brought this idea to my GF thinking she'd be excited I'm going to be able to afford college just a little easier and not be in debt AS badly. 

She completely shut me down, saying it's not her having the kids and would prefer me to wait until we have kids to donate.

I'm extremely confused and slightly annoyed because I'm just trying to keep myself out of as much debt as possible, but my GF is making it out as if I'm cheating on her indirectly by donating to a sperm bank.

So AITA here? My point if view is. 1. I'm never gonna know the baby/ parents of baby because I'm pretty that stuff is anonymous 2. It's not like I'm having sex with anyone that uses my sperm, it goes into this vial as I have read and its stored.

If I could get a females opinion I'd appreciate it because I'm really not able to see my GF's point very well

EDIT: So someone mentioned a valid point that made me think.
IF and I'm saying IF I followed through and donated, would I lie to her? Well obviously not? That's a huge decision for me and it would eat me alive if i didn't tell her. 

Someone did PM a perspective I hadn't thought of, and admittedly they are right, it would potentially cause a lot more problems in the future than what the money would be worth. So in short, I'll just stick in investing in the stock market. I appreciate the outside opinions here

EDIT 2: So, if I didn't make myself clear

1. I haven't gone through and donated, I merely talked with a coworker that suggested it, then did some online research but not a whole lot before bringing it up with my GF

2. Everyone who thinks I'm lying to her, if I wanted to, I wouldve already found out how to sign up

EDIT 3: Alright, 3 edits in less than an hour but I see why. This is a very serious topic for my current and maybe future relationships. After reading everyone's comments and being informed of the repercussions, I'm gonna make the sensible choice and not donate sperm. As everyone has said, it could lead to heartbreaks later down the road I don't want. Thank you everyone who has responded"	Asshole	0	0	35.0	19.0	0.0	0.0

"So I'm 30, single, live on my own, work full time, haven't been in my parents pockets for anything money related for a decade, and live a fairly normal tax paying and law abiding life. I do however own a few motorcycles, one being a supersport bike. This drives my father batshit, to the point that we don't really talk anymore because I don't care for his judgey comments about my lifestyle and career choices.

&#x200B;

He acts like I own motorcycles as a specific instrument to hurt him, not because I like cruising them and building them. Yes, I feel bad his mother died on one, but I never met her, I wasn't even alive when the accident happened. My paternal grandfather doesn't seem to mind too bad, he says they're dangerous, but plenty of things in life can kill you. And yes, I understand that for real riders accidents aren't a matter of if, but when. I do as much as I can to mitigate the risk, I always wear a helmet, boots and gloves when I ride and I obey the traffic laws within 25% of the speed limit. And trust me, I've seen plenty of fucked up shit happen to people on motorcycles. I mean, I never found my moms dead in a ditch on one, but I do understand the gravity of the situation.

&#x200B;

To show another angle of this story, my paternal grandfathers father, my great grandfather, my fathers grandfather, died in a car wreck in the early 70s, when my dad was alive. My dad knew him. Did my grandfather make a big deal about his kids getting behind the wheel of the car because his dad died in one? No, he didn't. And when I was growing up my dad had a couple really fast cars that we worked on together, there was nothing about, Oh no, your great grandfather died in a car crash, you shouldn't drive. No it was the opposite, I learned how to work on and drive fairly fast cars at a very young age.

&#x200B;

So help me out reddit, am I being a totally inconsiderate of my fathers feelings by riding an working on motorcycles? Or is it not really his business how I get around? Also, he left my mom while she had cancer, so it's not really like I care what he thinks anyways and he's a master of emotional manipulation and making things seem like they're not his fault, but that's for another reddit post."

All my life, my (19m) sister has been mentally and emotionally abusive towards me. When I was smaller, she was also physically abusive, punching and kicking me to make me flinch. She stopped only when I got bigger than her, and even then, i still flinch to this day when people make sudden motions around me. 

Constant ""jokes"" designed to keep me down and destroy my self confidence (one example; I once told my family I wanted to be a youtuber and she straight up said ""you arent funny enough to be a youtuber!""). Rebuilding my self and learning that I do have value and I am worthy of love has been quite a journey, one I'm still not done with.

Part of that journey was a letter to my parents coming out and acknowledging that the way she treated me was wrong, abusive and that I did not want to see her again. (She is moved out by now)

At first everything was fine; both of them said they believe me. Dad was totally blindsided by it, but mom said she had noticed things. However, ever since then mom has been pushing and pushing me to forgive her, to have a relationship with her even though I said I dont want to.

I found a seat, with some difficulty, but unfortunately, the only place I could find was a four-person double table (two half-tables with two chairs each, right next two each other). Fine, I thought, I'll just try to be brief.  I eat my entrees and get up to refill my drink. My tablet and plate are on the one table and the other table is clear. It takes about two minutes as the fountain is also busy. I get back and two girls have taken the table right next to the one with my tablet and plate (with my baguette still on it). If I sit down in my seat, I'm literally right next to them with no privacy. Taken aback, I say (as politely as I can muster) ""Can I... have my table back?"" They get up, all indignant, huffing and complaining, and go, I assume, to find another table. I was a bit surprised at myself that I was that assertive, but I mean, really. What was their plan? I was clearly still using the seat right next to them. Were they planning on sharing the table with me? Intimidating me into moving? I didn't want them to think I was a jerk, but, I mean, they took a clearly taken table, at which I had left an expensive mobile device and uneaten food. I didn't choose to sit there and by that time, there were other places for them to sit."	Asshole	0	0	397.0	20.0	0.0	0.0

byucem	2019-06-10 06:16:17	Popular_Sprinkles	AITA for letting my brother use the laundry at our house after my girlfriend said she did not want him there?	"Well first, my girlfriend does not like my brother for a few incidents that have happened between them in the past. The most recent one was when her aunt died in April. She and her cousin went back to their hometown for a week for the funeral. During this time my brother's girlfriend broke up with him and he invited me to the strip club, it really isn't my scene but I felt like if it were to help him get over his girlfriend I should go. I never told my girlfriend about it thinking she would never find out and it would never be an issue. Fast forward to May, my girlfriend sets my brother up with a new friend that she met thinking they would get along well. He told the new girl that we went to a strip club with me, and the girl reports it to my girlfriend, who was furious with both of us. I've been trying to make up for it ever since, but I still don't think I did anything wrong because I was doing something that was therapeutic for my brother.

&#x200B;

So yesterday my brother asked me if he could use the laundry at our house. (My girlfriend and I live together.)  The laundry is in the garage, so he does not even need to go into the house so I thought that she wouldn't even know he was there. I asked her if it was okay, and she said no, she didn't want him there. Again, I thought there was a chance that she wouldn't even see him while he was there, so I gave him the key to the side door of the garage. This morning when I left for the day she told me she would be leaving to run errands and have lunch with a friend of hers. I asked her when she would be back home and she said around 3:00 PM. So I told my brother to leave before 3:00. My girlfriend ends up getting home early and my brother is still in the garage. She hears someone moving around in the garage and calls me asking me to come home right away. She goes outside and sees my brother's car and realizes what is going on. So being angry as hell she calls some friends and they help her move her stuff out, including our dog. She tells me she's angry that I keep going behind her back and she doesn't trust me. She breaks up with me and JUST leaves. I feel like she overreacted and everything I did was because I am trying to be a good brother.

&#x200B;

UPDATED: Okay I am REALLY confused now. I don't know if she was manipulative or if I'm the asshole or what. I need to think about this more...

&#x200B;

SECOND UPDATE: So apparently I am the asshole. Like always. I tried to text her earlier and realized she had blocked me on all social media, and my number. I figured she would be at her brother's house so I drove over there. I knocked on the door and asked him if I could talk to her. She came out, and in front of her brother, aired ALL OUR DIRTY LAUNDRY. (Sorry for the pun couldn't resist.) She told me that she was sick and tired of me lying to her throughout the course of the relationship. (she threw away three years over this btw.) She said she wasn't super mad about the strip club thing, but about the fact that I told her her friend was lying about it, and she cut off contact with her friend after that and that led to her losing other friends, and then I later admitted that we did go. She then proceeded to list all the times my brother had been shitty to her, and how she didn't feel safe around him and she didn't want him in the house because he's apparently disrespected her many times and she didn't want him coming in and using soap, electricity, etc. I told her she was being over dramatic and crazy like always and she broke down crying (like she does to win arguments.) I told her that she was being manipulative and controling, and that people on reddit had agreed with me about this, and that her crying was another way to manipulate me.  Her brother told me I needed to leave, and I tried to apologize to her, but he was insistent that I leave, he's also kind of a pain in the butt. She called me about 20 mins later, and told me she couldn't take it anymore, that I had caused her too much pain and was sorry, but didn't want to continue the relationship. I realize that THIS TIME, I did fuck up. I shouldn't have let my brother into the house without me being there when she said he gave her anxiety and made her uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

THIRD UPDATE: Okay, I guess I can see how people think I was being an asshole. After I made the last update I decided to call my sister, who was at work but ended up taking the rest of the day off to talk with me. I did not tell my brother what was happening because I did not want him to feel like the break up was his fault. I am very private and had not told her the extent of my relationship problems. She told me that she was ashamed of my behavior, and she felt like I needed mental health counseling. We spent the whole day talking. My sister is a little mad for having to take work off, but it was a crisis. She helped me set up an appointment for counseling, and I have decided to was best to break up because the relationship was toxic for both of us. That you for your input."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byubfv	2019-06-10 06:13:01	Wither_Fire	AITA for calling one of my best friends only “okay”?	"I’ve been keeping this story in for the last eleven years. 

When I was in grade three, my dad left us for a year. He was posted in the Middle East, and on the odd visit back (every 3-4 months) he would get me something. This one time, he got me a diary. Me, being the idiot that I am, wrote everything I wanted to write in it.

I had this really good friend, she was the first friend I made when I moved here for grade one. However, she was extremely controlling, and wouldn’t want me seeing my other friends very often. We would always do what she wanted. It got better later, to the point where we were on the same page. I have great memories with her. But in grade three, I sometimes felt trapped. It’s not really her fault, we were like eight. I wrote in my diary that I liked all of my other friends, but that “I guessed that she was okay.”

About five years later we were in my room. She pointed out my diary from all those years ago, and I told her jokingly not to open it, it was very embarrassing. I go and do something and when I turn around she has her nose in my diary, and she’s starting to cry. Of course she opened to that page. No matter how much I apologized. I would call her on the phone, crying, telling her much I regretted everything. She would say that it was fine. We would hang out once or twice, and then go silent. There was never anything between us.

All these years later it still keeps me up at night. She was such a great friend, always inviting me to her cottage and having sleepovers.

It was an instant connection! We talked daily, exchanged photos, videos, music, etc. For years! We live a whole world apart. But somehow became really great friends. We are on each other's social media pages and we have always had ONE HUGE difference.... George comes from a very good home and life.  He makes my salary x 30k. George loved me for a very long time. And I loved him too. But I never felt good enough for him. After all, I was some ragged girl raised on poverty. An orphan and pretty much all alone. I still dont have a fancy job.  But I'm very proud that I'm not an addict. I'm very proud that I have my own crappy car and mediocre apartment. I will probably never own a home. Or own a brand new car. Or take a trip anywhere that nice in the near future.  

George and I lost contact about 4 years ago. Life got busy. And I think George got upset that I refused to give him a chance. I just honestly didnt think I could ever fit into his world.    We recently started talking again. Just to catch up. He has a kid and a wife now. I'm so happy for him! He sends me their vacation photos and it's all really amazing. 

But it makes me feel less about my life. It is no way his fault that his life makes me feel this way. But it does. My 9-5 job suddenly looks crappy, my life and hobbies look crappy. He gets surprised when he finds out I cant afford or do certain things. And it just feels awkward.  

I'll always love George and I'm sure he will always have love for me. But I feel like him and I live in two completely different worlds.  I have hardships. But I'm proud of where I am given my childhood.  And I'm happy for George. But we just got done talking and now I feel shitty.

byu9p0	2019-06-10 06:07:00		AITA For moving out on short notice?	"It all started one fateful morning when my roommate asked me if I was off. I responded honestly in the affirmative. Little did I know what was about to happen. I'll try to give an unbiased account of the events that evening after I got home from a friend's house. Everyone in my home smokes weed, and when I got home I heard the familiar sounds of bong rippage, so I entered my roommates room. There was a guest currently holding the water pipe and he skipped me, I figured by mistake, so I piped up and said ""Hey, I'm here, pass it to me please!"" Other roommate said, ""It's not mine to pass"" and proceeded to take a hit. I said, ""Am I not allowed to smoke?"" To which roommate1 began, ""You've been sneaking in too much without contributing"" keep in mind I've never been asked for financial contribution or green contribution for smoking with them. So I simply removed myself from the room to not be teased with sweet ganj smoke. I muttered a simple ""Ok."" After this roommmate 2 offers me a hit of his concentrate, which I decline because it felt like a pity dab, and I didn't want to mooch anymore. To which roommate 2 responds ""Okay well we need to talk"" I responded with ""Talk about what?"" (Flashback time) two days prior my roommates had tried to open a dialogue with me about the weight of my dog. Over half of dogs in the US are overweight. My dog is a perfect weight Catahoula Cur (with an emphasis on the greyhound side) so I was pretty despondent because the vet tells me my dog is perfect but strangers I meet when i take her out think she's skinny. Anyways, roommate 1 is very concerned with the weight of my dog because ""you can see the ribs"". (Present day) roommate2: well you were pretty distant when we tried to talk to you about [dog name] me: [dog name] is healthy... Roommate 1 chimes in ""Let me come in there, dog is too skinny, you basically let her use the bathroom in house (roommate1 brought this to my attention and I cleaned her accidents) you haven't cared as much about anything in the last month, your room is messy and it stinks, and if we can't be friends can we at least be respectful roommates"" me: ""I dont understand the problem. You brought these issues to my attention and i fixed them. My room is my own business."" Roommate 2: ""If they affect me? I cant have anyone over because your room is messy"" me ""okay"" (his house guest was parked in one of our 3 parking spots) ""please dont allow your guests to park in my parking spot."" Roommate 2 ""your parking spot???"" Me: ""The parking spot I should be able to park in"" roommate 2 ""okay so one of the 3 parking spots good talk"" i decided shortly after that I would simply move out as my lifestyle and way of parenting my dog is obviously not compatible and i refuse to be parented / scolded when I'm doing everything right for this dog and living in a slightly messy room. Keep in mind I pay my third of the rent for the smallest room in the house and i also manage the entergy bill. AITA for leaving?

byu93n	2019-06-10 06:04:46	Oolfage7	AITA for not liking my best friends gf for this reason	"So me (19m) and my best friend (19m) have been friends since elementary school. Over the past two years we have become really close friends. I care about the guy and genuinely want him to be happy. 

That being said he has a gf (19f) that he has been dating for almost 4 years. When we first met, she seemed really nice and like a perfect fit for him. We hung out a couple times, she was really nice and they both seemed very happy. He always says that she makes him happy which is all I care about.

One day an incident happened and seemingly just out of nowhere his gf broke up with him over text. I was the only one in our friend group that he really opened up to about this, I comforted him and helped him get through it for the next few days because I care about him. It hurt me to see this person that he trusted just break his heart out of nowhere. 

For the next 1-2 weeks we didn’t speak of the woman in question and I assumed he was getting through it well. Then one day my best friend, another friend and I were hanging out and my best friend talks about how he and his gf are going on vacation soon like whatever happened between them was ok.

When this happened I felt hurt that my best friend had gotten back together with this girl that out of nowhere broke his heart. Since then I have seen his gf a couple times like when he drives me to work and drops her off at her house, but his gf and I haven’t hung out since that incident. 

Now I have a kind of sour taste in my mouth when I hear or see his gf. It just reminds me of how she hurt him and how broken he was afterwards. I always feel like it gets kind of awkward for me to talk about her and I still rarely ever speak of her around him.

I really don’t know how to feel on this situation I haven’t confronted him on how I really feel and the incident happened a couple months ago so I feel like it might be a stupid thing to dwell on. I still don’t know the full story behind it but alI I know is that his gf broke his heart and I can’t think of her the same way. Maybe I’m just getting into something that is none of my business."

byu6sx	2019-06-10 05:56:49	Versace-Papi	AITA for posting a. Ideo on my snapchat of a guy looking through garbage for used cigarettes?	"So, this happened yesterday. My dad stops at a gas station to pick up a report and time sheets for work and I'm observing people as i do and i see this guy looking through a... i didn't understand what he was doing at first. I was just watching him basically fingering this metal cylinder outside the gas station and shaking it. I was watching him for a good 5 minutes trying to figure out what the hell he was doing. 

I finally figured it out while I was recording him on my snapchat asking what he was doing and what he was trying to do and mid video I realize and said ""ooh, good ole Chicago. Yikes"". A friend of mine messaged me on snapchat saying ""If you ever put someone like that on your story again I'll literally kill you, that dude is most likely homeless. Hes got no smokes, hes in desperation of nicotine and you're just recording him from the safety of your car without him knowing, I'm sure he wouldnt want that. I've been there, you have no idea what that's like, honestly very disappointed you put that shit on your story"". 

I don't think he was homeless cause he had a bookbag, a pizza and a couple drinks next to him while he was doing this, but I dont know, I could be wrong. I wasn't really thinking about it. I didn't mean to record him in a malicious manner I was just confused. I also didn't mean to offend anybody, but it really hurt my feelings the fact that he was so aggressive about it instead of saying something like hey, that wasn't cool for you to do. I've never posted anything like that on my snap, so since that was the first time I did that, I'd figure he would be a little nicer about it since I'm also one of the only people if not the only person that helped him out when he was struggling himself. I didn't respond to him because i really had no idea what to say to that.  AITA?


Edit: I agree with you guys on that I was a big asshole for posting that. I also forgot to mention that after I read my friends message, I deleted the posts a few minutes after I took them.

byu61z	2019-06-10 05:54:10	Successful_Papaya	WIBTA for giving my friend a firm 'no' on hanging out with her and her boyfriend?	"Posting on a throwaway just in case.  
For context, I'm 19, no one I've been friends with has ever dated anyone. My few friends in high school were all too busy, and my college friends rarely get me involved in their casual dating. I have no experience in this area.  
I recently invited a college friend of mine to hang out, Eoife. Eoife has notoriously bad taste in men, to the point where some have outright threatened to kill her, all before I knew her. I heard all of this from her too, so she's aware of this issue. Furthermore, I don't have a car, so usually when we go out (which is often) she drives. I give her gas money, of course, always enough to cover the drive. This is just context, neither of us has any problem with this. She's said she likes driving.  
But, as I said, I invited Eoife to hang out with me at a sort of outdoor festival. Admittance is free, we've enjoyed going places like that before, we both wanted to go. We hadn't set a date yet, but we were getting there. Planning came to a halt when Eoife asked to invite her old friend, Dani, and her new boyfriend. She's been dating him for a month at most now and she's known her best friend since Elementary school. I felt awkward about it, worried Dani and I would be stuck playing the third wheel and feeling awkward together.  
I tried to hint that I'd be uncomfortable, gave her soft 'no's like ""oh I don't want to be the third wheel"" or ""I don't even know this guy"", but she didn't take the hint. She just assured me she wanted Dani there so I wouldn't be uncomfortable. At this point I want to give her a firm 'no', I don't want to be stuck with some strangers at a festival all day, especially not when I found out about it and suggested it. Would I be a total asshole for just saying I don't want to hang out with her boyfriend and wanted it to be just us? I'm genuinely really scared I would be.  
TL;DR: Would I be a total asshole for telling my friend that I don't want to hang out with her new boyfriend and old friend at the festival I invited her to? Or am I just being anxious?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byu5o0	2019-06-10 05:52:37	Iateapples	AITA for being rude to a customer while on my lunch	"So, a bit of background; i am currently applying for a job at a rather exclusive company with a lengthy hiring process. I usually call back within an hour after i miss thier call and they happened to call me a few minutes before my lunch break at my current job. My current job is retail so, im sure you can get a pretty clear idea of what its like for me rn. Anyways, on to the incident.

I had just gotten my lunch and was headed back to work to eat in the break room and i decided to call back the gentleman who had called me 30 minutes prior in hopes of reaching him before he went home for the day. I ended up reaching him and as we were talking i gathered my stuff from my car and went inside. On the way back to the breakroom i had my hands full carrying my lunch (McDonald's) and was on the phone talking to someone. I also wasn't wearing my nametag. Thier was no indication i worked thier other than the fact i had a polo on but, it was just a plain black polo. The following occurs as i walked by said customer:

C: Excuse me sir, can you help me find a belt.
M: (to the man im currently talking too on the phone) umm.... hold on just one second sir.
M:(to the customer) im actually not on the clock right now so, i can't really help you. 

I continue to walkback to the back and ask the man on the phone to continue what he was saying.

C: well can you at least tell me who can help me?!?!?

I continue walking and talking with the gentleman on the phone. 

C: WOW!!! HOW RUDE!!!

After my lunch i get in line to buy something i eyed a few hours ago since i had about 5 mins left and no one else was in line. The customer from before gets in line behind me and notices me. 
C: hey, excuse me. I just wanted to apologize about before i didn't know you were on lunch but, i really think you could have handled the situation better. I worked in retail and i would have never treated a paying customer this way. I apologized and rolled my eyes as i turned around.

Am i the asshole for blowing this lady off? My manager thinks i could have handled it better and shes usually pretty reasonable when it comes to complaints about the staff. She knows how the customers can be and ive had complaints fron customers before about me being ""rude"" but, she has always brushed them off and said they were overreacting.

Edit: i was talking on the phone during the first conversation with her and i told her i couldn't help her. The cashier is in the front right as you walk in as well as a security guard so, she had to have known where atleast 2 other employees are. They greet everyone who walks in so, they are by no means hiding.

Edit 2: the apology was just an attempt to berate me more. She clearly didnt mean it and was only saying that so she could continue to tell me why i was an asshole for not hanging up the phone and helping her find something.

Edit 3: i was carrying my lunch in my hands (McDonald's) not any sort of merchandise we would sell."	Not the A-hole	0	0	39.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

Was going to post another version of this but it was too long. 

Me (25M) and my roommate (24M) have been living in an apartment together for 2 months. It's the first time living apart from our families for the both of us. 

Before signing the lease, my roommate (we'll call him J) asked me about having a 3rd Male friend sign with us ro help pay rent, and I said I was uncomfortable with the complications a 3rd person would bring. 

J started dating his girlfriend K (28F) a month into our lease. He asked me twice within their first two days of dating how I felt about him giving her a key to the apartment, and I said both times it made no sense to give a key to someone we both barely knew. After being introduced to her for one day and being asked how I felt about her, I said ""okay"", not knowing J would take that as an agreement. He gave K a key on the third day of dating and I woke up to her doing dishes. Because I wanted them to work out I didn't kick her out and instead went to my job that I work 50-60 hours a week at.

Because J does not drive, K is now in my apartment from 4pm-4am 3 days a week minimum, sometimes without either of us there. She has her own toiletries and towels permanently in the apartment, and makes frequent judgments about my cleaning habits and personality: she has taken it upon herself to intentionally insult me to, in her own words, give me a taste of my own medicine for being a rude person. She also invites herself into spending time with whatever company I bring over, again without my roommate being present.

Today I blew up on my roommate, saying how she is basically living in the apartment rent-free and could get us into trouble with the landlord, and that it is bizarre that she is in the apartment so often without him there. He told me it was too late to make this judgment after giving my ok, and his girlfriend texted him saying I'm a huge pussy and that I deserve the way she treats me in my own apartment.

byu57k	2019-06-10 05:51:03		AITA because I’m mad that my boyfriends housemates (and best friends) want rent for me to stay with him?	"Tl;dr - I’m staying with my boyfriend for a while and just found out his housemates (who are some of his good friends) think I should pay rent for sharing his room with him (that he already pays for). Am I an asshole for thinking that’s ridiculous and I should only have to share utilities (or a similar compromise)?

I’m in the city where my boyfriend lives due to business for about a month. I asked him a while back if it would be alright for me to stay with him while I’m there (sharing his room with him) and he said yes. Fast forward to a few days ago, I found out that his housemates said I couldn’t stay here unless they split the rent 5 ways instead of 4 during the month I am here. My boyfriend amazingly paid that share of the rent for me (around $500!!!) because he didn’t want me to feel awkward or unwelcome by knowing they didn’t want me here unless I paid (his friends have not always been my biggest fans). I am so grateful that he did that for me, but I feel that his friends - one person in particular had the idea for extra rent, according to him everyone else was pretty chill - took advantage of him. 

If I was staying in an additional room, I would completely agree with paying rent. 
If they asked to split utilities 5 ways instead of rent, I would completely agree. 
But asking to pay an additional person’s rent while I’m staying with him (in the room he already pays for!), I do not agree with. 

Side note is that I basically only sleep here and occasionally cook dinner for myself and my boyfriend - the same as when I’m just visiting. I’m not usually around and when I am, I am in my boyfriends room, never the living room or other common spaces. 
In addition to that I always clean up after myself and even buy things for the house like snacks / coffee / etc. and sometimes clean up after his housemates like dishes and picking up garbage. I was trying to be extra polite because I thought they were being gracious about me crashing here for a few weeks. Additionally the guys have friends over / drinking parties / their gf’s stay the night frequently, so their point was most likely not that I might be messy, noisy, etc. I feel that they monetarily took advantage of my boyfriend by asking for that much money just to allow him to share his room with me. 

Am I am asshole for thinking I (he) shouldn’t have to pay rent to share my boyfriends room short-term?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I’m from India and in my region around 10% of the people are Muslim and due to recent festivities in Islam people have been praying in public in mass. Personally I don’t really care what they do as long as it doesn’t effect what we’re trying to do. Recently Muslims have been complaining there’s not enough mosques here and have been upset with the provincial and city leaders for not being able to build more mosques. It’s fairly common for Muslims to have prayer services out in the open for this reason. I was driving recently and a traffic jam occurred. Turns out a few cars in front of me a bunch of Muslims were holding a prayer service that was blocking off most the road. They left part of a lane open so the smaller cars were able to drive around but it made traffic slower. I was driving a truck and couldn’t navigate around them and a bunch of other drivers were upset about the ordeal so we approached them and told them to leave.  We told them their prayer services should not impede our daily lives and there was extra room that they could move to off the road which they refused to go to because it was in the vicinity of a pig farm. They said they need to be at least 300 meters away from a pig farm or it would be an insult to Allah to pray near it. I told them they had 5 minutes to pack up and leave or I would drive through them and everyone else agreed as well in the traffic. 10 minutes go up and they’re not leaving so we slowly drive through knocking down tents and chairs and such but nobody was hit. Someone comes in and runs over picking the stuff up and carrying it and eventually traffic returns to normal. I can’t help but feel guilty over the issue but I can’t think of how anything we did was wrong so that’s why I’m asking	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byu29f	2019-06-10 05:40:15	TelegramMeYourCorset	AITA Am I the asshole for calling my girlfriend a bitch for trying to dump popcorn at a movie attendants feet?	"So the other day I went to the movie theater and tried to sneak in a couple of mini bottles of wine and some candy into the movie theatre. 
My girlfriend wanted to put it in her purse instead of her pockets because they never check her purse. We go in and get movie tickets and popcorn and I  ended up holding her purse as she got a soda. 

As we walk through the entrance to the movie the attendant asks to check the purse I'm holding. I'm still holding the popcorn and some snacks so it takes me a minute to give him my girlfriends purse he opens it and removes the wine as I  expected and says we can get it back when the movie is over. My girlfriend got furious as we were walking into our movie saying he had no right to check her purse and how he was intentionally trying to embarrass her. I tried to just say he was doing his job but she wouldn't listen. She didn't want me to eat the popcorn because she said she was going to dump it at the attendants feet and make him clean it up. She wouldn't talk for the whole movie and got mad at me when I took the popcorn and tried to eat it as fast as possible. I told her there was no way she was throwing anything on the floor. She got even angrier at me for taking his side and being weak and giving him her purse. 
We've been fighting over this ever since. And I  yelled at her and told her she was being a bitch. Am I a asshole?

Edit: wow this blew up I only expected to get a few comments that being said, we usually whisper to each other during movies low enough that noone can hear us. 
My GF has worked retail before and usually is very nice to retail workers so it was just very strange for me. Also the place has a liquor license and serves alchohol at some veiwings.

We try to spend the holidays with them every year for about a week or so, and my husband finds that too little and he’s always trying to turn our limited vacations into family trip opportunities involving them. This year we’re celebrating our one year wedding anniversary, which is something I’ve been very excited about. 

For our anniversary trip we’ll be in the same continent as his family, and he already suggested the possibility of them joining us for a few days in one of the countries we’re visiting. Our whole trip will only last for a week. I don’t find the idea of them joining us very appealing for many reasons, including 1) it’s our anniversary trip and I think we should prioritise our own quality time together 2) time with his family tends to be a bit stressful because his mother is needy, authoritative and has a tendency to lash out when things aren’t exactly the way she wants 3) my husband gets frankly quite annoying when he’s around them, he starts to feel guilty if he’s not spending every waking moment around them and freaks out if I suggest that we do something just the two of us for a couple hours. Also, goodbye sex life, because his mother manages to plan family outings and dinners until the early hours. 

Am I selfish for not wanting them to join at all? Yes, they do live far away and he misses them, but I dislike the “all or nothing” dynamic that exists between him and his family and how manipulative they get with him. So I feel more comfortable simply not seeing them in this trip."	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We had been friends throughout highschool, I brought her to family gatherings, we worked together, traveled together, played sports together, hungout with the same friends, a tried and true friendship which were both certain would last a lifetime. We had been butting heads a little over the last school year but nothing major as I assumed it was because we went to different colleges in different states. At some point last summer we were having a discussion (she has a history of minor mental illness) and some of the things she was saying were pretty upsetting so I suggested that she talk to a counselor because what I had to say was not going to help her. She didn’t take this well, and a few days later I hear that she’s calling me selfish, saying I make everything about myself, and more from a coworker (who also happened to be my ex boyfriend, they’re friends but that’s another story) I wait a few weeks to confront her, and she denies it to my face claiming “he only said that to upset you, blah blah blah.” I let this go and move on because it’s not worth the fight. Things go back to relative normality. A couple weeks later a coworker had a gathering to which she wasn’t invited (not my choice) but I was and I went, I didn’t mention it to her but eventually she found out and was understandably upset. I then hear from a DIFFERENT coworker that she was saying she was my only friend (not true) and I ask her about that and apologize for the party. She denies it all, and texts me back asking for space, which I was fine with, and then I hear a few days later she’s telling people that our friendship is “over”. Fast forward to now, we haven’t spoken a word since August despite my reaching out twice. She stays in contact with mutual friends, has commented on the fact that we’re not longer friends to mutual acquaintances AND our parents are still friends. Am I the asshole here, or is this being taken too far?

bytzhj	2019-06-10 05:30:43	HeyyoooitsRico	"AITA For trying to ""take"" my sisters car from her?"	"Heres whats going on: My sister a couple years back got her license, so my parents made a deal with her that if they got her a car she would have to get a job and start paying for it monthly. I (f) was 13 at the time so I wanted nothing to do with it. 

2 years have gone by. Im now 15 and a half, have my permit, and already have a job set up when I turn 16 in August. My sister (22) still hasnt gotten a job, hasn't put a penny in for this car, and has no intention of getting a job before I turn 16. 

I go driving in this car a lot, and I really like it. Its pretty, it runs smoothly, it has a sun roof, and theres plenty of space. It has become my dream car. So I asked my mom if since my sister isnt paying for it, if I could take it off my dads hands when I get a job. Theyd both still have their own car (we have 3) and it would be 300 dollars less monthly my dad has to pay. I told her how excited I am to get my own money and hopefully the car and to go out with friends and go shopping etc.  

When my sister heard about this she immediately argued ""it was a gift from mom and dad"" and ""they never said id have to pay for it"" and ""it's my car. My names on the lease."" 1. No it wasn't. 2. Yes they did and 3. We can redo the lease. She even started crying and accusing me of ""taking over everything"" and saying ""You dont get the car its not up to you.""  Which I rollesd my eyes at because shes 22. 20 fricking 2.

Another thing: she doesnt even have anywhere to go. No job. No college. No friends. She doesnt go anywhere. Id have school, a job, friends houses, and going shopping once in a while. And she doesnt like driving. Whenever mom asks her to pick me up from school she says ""you know I hate driving"". And shes not registered to drive since we recently moved states. (Another edit: Shw hardly uses the car. She used it like once a week in our old state and hasnt driven it at all in the state weve now been living at for 4 months. My mom has mostly been using it. Like I said before she hates driving with a passion and wouldnt use it much)

There are so many reasons that I should have this car and not her, but I cant tell if I'm being selfish or greedy or a spoiled brat or whatever. I just really want this specific car. But anyway, AITA for trying to ""take"" my sisters car? 

Edit: Sorry I didnt mention this before but while I was napping my sister asked my dad about it and during dinner he said ""And another thing, grandpa has like 50000 cars in his driveway Im sure he'll give you on of them"" So I guess he's on my side?

Update:My parents said if I give them 300 a month I can have the car no matter what my sister says, so I guess Im getting the car."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

He also travels a lot for work and we don’t have a dog sitter worked out yet, so when he’s gone I lose even more sleep with waking up throughout the day to care for the puppy, then working all night. So when we’re both home he’ll wake up early with the dog, but wants sympathy for how hard it is to not be able to sleep in. I just don’t care and don’t feel bad. I feel like he’ll never be as tired as I am with working overnights and losing sleep during the day to care for the dog. We also recently moved for his job and the only available job for me is the night shift. And I know that just because I’m more tired doesn’t mean he can’t also feel tired, but I just don’t want to praise him for what I feel like is a small sacrifice compared to the sacrifice of me working overnights so we could move for his dream job.

We break up. I would be moving away to another university next semester and she didnt want the long distance. Once we start my last year here, we were still friendly to each other and since we shared the same friend group we hung around each other. A month after the semester starts she had a new boyfriend. I still had feelings for her and just didnt want to be around her cause it hurt seeing her with someone else. I choose to just avoid my friends for a while in order to not see her. At this point my friends tell me that they want to hang out with me and not her and that they were only nice to her because she made me happy. Eventually they as a group tell her that they dont want her hanging around them any more. They did this without telling me. This hurt her a lot and blamed me for it even though I told her otherwise. At this point she blocks my number and ignores me if im passing her and leaves the room if im there. Since we weren't together a lot of people started being mean to her. And saying things to me like ""how could you stand her voice"" and other negative things. I always just told them that I loved her and to be nice. For the most part they listened but it bothered me since shes is a sweet girl. Throughout the rest of the semester she was mostly friendless. But didnt get bullied all too much since I told everyone to quit. 

Next semester rolls around and there are a lot of new people at the dorms. Me being an extrovert made friends with the majority of them. They however didnt know she was my Ex or who she was and would make fun of her for certain things. I would always tell them to stop. I tried in one occasion to talk to my ex and ask her who was bothering her were since I know she hates confrontation and wouldn't stand up for herself. She just ignored me and left the room. The semester went on and I was tired of telling people to be nice to her and stopped. I dont know why it should be my job to have to defend someone who obviously no longer cared about me as a friend. Her boyfriend couldve helped. Well a couple of months after I stopped helping apparently the bullying got so bad that she quit college, changed her number and deleted all social media. She never reported things to the dean she was too shy.^ I feel so guilty for this, and feel like if I had kept trying to stop people from messing with her she would still be here getting her education."

bytwku	2019-06-10 05:20:30		AITA for not speaking to my closest friend for many months?	"I just wanna say that while I’m writing this, I feel like the biggest piece of shit ever. God knows I’m not. He knows I’m not, but I just feel like that for some reason. Let me give you a bit of background. 

We’ve been friends with 3 other guys since elementary school, so a really long time as I am in 2nd year of uni. After our high school prom, and in fact during our last year, one of our friends started slacking and chose a wrong path (I don’t wanna say what he’s done but it involves drugs). As that happened, that kind of broke our circle and we kinda shifted away from each other, and this got worse after I went to vacation during that summer and we didn’t keep in touch. When I came back, everyone was mad at each other (literally every single one), and so I sat listening to each one and how different each opinion was. So I somehow got us back together for a little while, and then something I had never expected happened. 

There came a time where they started going out together without saying anything, started talking about things I’ve said about them, and just felt zoned out. Obviously I wasn’t mad at the first part, but the the second part kinda indicated that they I thought I did something wrong, when I hadn’t. I lost complete touch with them, except my friend I am talking about above. I was the one that stopped answering his messages, calls, etc. I was mid way though uni and I couldn’t believe my childhood friends stabbed me in the back, like I literally grew up with them. I forgave them, we all moved on, and I didn’t feel any type of hate towards them. As my friend kept messaging, he kept talking about how he doesn’t talk to 2 of the other 3 and how they fucked up with me. Mind you I hadn’t opened the full message then, and I didn’t care. 

I have a girlfriend now and I’m happy, I don’t talk to them anymore. As a 20 year old, who spent nearly 10 years with these guys, I had moved on completely and thought it was just another childhood run that had to end. My gf then told me that the friend I have been talking about had just gotten into a surgery for his jaw after an incident at work, and how he asked her to at least tell me. This really hit deep, and I have been contemplating since if I was in the wrong for at least not answering him. As I said, they did me dirty out of nowhere and I wasn’t going to play good guy and make amends. Not because I am petty or cocky or didn’t wanna step off my high horse, but I because I felt like my opinion wouldn’t have matter against theirs. So I didn’t bother, and we went our separate ways. I heard they are still together, and when I got the news from my gf about how he still reached out despite all that’s happened, this hit really hard. I answered him alr and we have a convo going on, and it really does feel like I fucked up.

"A few months ago, a good friend of mine of 3 years started dating another guy who had been apart of our friend group for a little while that school year. I didn't care all too much, and of course supported her, as a good friend should. However, as time went on, I saw her less and less where our friend group would meet, and less and less in the hallways. Now I didn't think much of it, but it was a little unsettling as it really wasn't like her to do that. I asked her why she hadn't been around much, and she said it was because she was having bible studies with her boyfriend.

A few weeks pass, and most of the communication I have with her is only over text. That bothered me, because I like being able to talk to my friends in person, rather than text, but because she was my only close friend at the time, I took what I could get (i wasnt very close with anyone else in the friend group). 

A few days she stopped answering me. I get a text from her boyfriend, saying she's no longer allowed to text me. I respond, asking why that's the case. He then goes on a religious rant about how ""its to free her from temptation"" so she can ""follow the lord"". He then is calling me a POS and a ""punk"" because he thinks that I'm trying to break them up or trying to get with her. He then continues to rant on me for being an athiest, and procedes to try and ""save me"" or whatever.

I’m not particularly upset that he is biromantic. In fact, I kind of suspected that he might be from the time we met. The reason I’m so upset is because he not only came out to me, but on the same day (without giving me more than half an hour to digest this information), came out on all of his social media accounts.

It seems to me, that if you are in a committed relationship there would be no reason to come out to the entire world. It would be appropriate to come out to your good friends and family who could understand you better with this information, but not everyone you know. 

It seems like his choice to come out on social media was not driven by self expression. It feels like he did this to gauge the level of interest others (particularly the men who are now on the “dating market” for him) would have in him romantically. I feel that it is very inappropriate to seek out potential romantic partners while still in a relationship.

My group of friends from high school had a reunion last night. After dinner, we went to a cafe because we're enjoying catching up with one another and gossiping abt what's up with people in our class. My HS best friend (let's call him A), whom I'm no longer that close to anymore because we drifted apart after college, said he wanted to share something sensitive. He blurted out that someone from our class was HIV positive. I froze since I know who this person was (let's call him C) and discreetly signalled him to stop talking.

A while ago, I found out that A still revealed to the group after I left that the HIV positive classmate is C. I am so furious. I work in healthcare so I know how wrong this was and A is also a doctor so he obviously knew this was extremely inappropriate and a violation of C's rights.

"I'm currently in the process of filling out my DNR and updating my living will with medical directives that will essentially let me die in the case of an accident or prolonged medical condition where I am unable to speak for myself. 

This decision wasn't made lightly and it came from using a motorcycle as my main source of transportation and my medical history. I've lost a few friends in motorcycle accidents (one where I was part of the team that got called in to the accident). Considering this, I do not want to be left in a coma or debilitating state, hence the DNR and medical directives to assure that I will pass on without any life-saving interventions. 

I have told my family and close friends and with the exception of one cousin, they have not received it well. I have been accused of being selfish and flippant with my life and have been angrily confronted by my parents, step parents, extended family, and sister as to why they are not being appointed as the executor of my will or my health care agent or why I refuse to let them keep me hooked up in the case of a coma. My friends have also accused me of being a terrible friend and not cherishing my life. My sister and grandparents are especially distraught and have tearfully begged me not to go through with it.

As of right now, I have my best friend, my cousin, and my third cousin's support with fierce condemnation from the rest of my familial/social sphere. I love my friends and family but I also want to make sure that I don't have to live in a prolonged state of suffering.

So her 22 year old son with Asperger’s syndrome (for those of you that don’t know what that is, it’s a very mild form of autism) is now living with us. And everywhere I look, I see something he did or something he has done, that annoys the hell out of me. Like he drink 2 2liters of Mountain Dew a day. No I am not lying or otherwise embellishing the truth, sometime he even drinks more. He also leaves the bottles around the house, and he leaves his room (which was formerly my older brothers room) a complete and absolute mess. Like dishes and food and bottles under the bed. It’s infuriating. Sometimes I even have to go up to the roof just to get some privacy because he’s ALWAYS there. Am I The Asshole? Also if anyone has tips on what to do that would help as well.

(throwaway) my best friend broke up with his girlfriend a month ago and he’s gone completely insane over it, even though he broke up with her. i must admit that she’s been a bit of a psycho herself, based on what i’ve seen. last night, i get a message from the best friend asking me if i know how to hack into social media accounts. i tell him i don’t know how and asked him why. he said it was because he wanted to hack on to his ex girlfriend’s facebook account to see her messages, friends, and everything else facebook has to offer. he also told me that he’d pay my old roommate (a computer science major) to hack her account. after, i told him that what he was doing is wrong and illegal and an invasion of privacy and he could get in serious trouble. i’m someone who is very against stuff like this and i think if someone is trying to screw you over you should know. you’re now probably wondering why i’m so hesitant... this best friend has been around all my life and him and his parents have helped me and my family through really dark times and financial downfalls. i know if i were to tell the ex girlfriend about this, she would tell him because she’s unhealthily obsessed with him. my outside friends are telling me not to do it for this reason and i really do want to tell her but i know it would hurt him and his family. i have text messages to prove what he was trying to pull and i know that if i were in the ex girlfriend’s position i would want someone to tell me too.

I was at a gig a few weeks ago. It was at a medium sized bar, not hugely busy but a decent audience for a Thursday night.  During the break I went off to the ladies toilet to take a leak (nothing unusual there, I am both female and a keen consumer of water so peeing is necessary). While I was in the cubicle, someone tried to open the door.  

""Taken!"" I said, loudly enough to hear but not at all aggressively. A few seconds passed and someone tried to open the door again.

""TAKEN!"" I said again, louder. 

A few seconds passed and someone tried to open the door AGAIN. At this point I know for a fact it must be the same person or couple of people as there are only two cubicles in the bathroom and nobody had left the other one yet. At this point I had only been in the cubicle for just enough time to take a leak and clean up so it's not like I had been in there for ages and holding up the line. I just ignored it, but they kept trying to open the cubicle door and started banging on it.

So, I yelled ""OH MY GOD IT'S TAKEN! SOD OFF!!!""

I finished up and left the cubicle to wash my hands. As I emerged, there was a line of women waiting for the toilet, staring at me like I'd broken into their house at Christmas and shat on the Christmas tree. 

Am I losing my damn mind? I consider it to be polite to let people finish their business without banging on the door multiple times in a twenty second period, and being told to sod off when you won't leave them alone is perfectly reasonable. 

Was I the asshole? Why were they staring at me like I was Satan for telling whoever was knocking on the door to sod off? Was I over the top?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	618.0	11.0	0.0	0.0

So we book a table st a restaurant that also has bowling lanes which cannot be reserved. Wyen the place was booked we were told if we get there at 5 we have a chance of bowling right away and the wait would be less than 30 minutes. 

When we get there at 5pm, it's pretty dead at the bowling lanes, there are people at the bar, people eating upstairs And maybe 1 lane of 8 lanes being used.

So they seat us at the table but we have to wait for a lane, and now we have to wait approximately 45min. So we decide to order appetizers while we wait. And some of the group decided to wait outside since they left and came back with their own nd you cannot have outside food and drinks. So 10 out of 18 ate the appetizers that were bought. Another 30 min go by and the food is gone and we are just awkwardly sitting there waiting for our to go bowling. So we spend a total of 2.5 hours of waiting and idle chat while everyone is getting impatient.

So since not everyone had cash, I paid for the food and bowling so that we would be able to start bowling right away. Some people decided after 2.5hrs that they did not want to go bowling. So only 14/18 bowled

When the comes to splitting the bill, i did the math and just messaged that bill was xx amount.

Yes i understand I should have split the food bill and bowling bill.  However, the amount of rage textsbim getting from someone people over being charged for food. (Food split up costed about 3$ per person.)"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

so around 20 years ago I had a one night stand, it produced my amazing daughter kate. I was working below minimum wage at the time so for the first 8 years of her life money was incredibly tight. I managed to get a better job and have been able to save 5000$ for university. she moved out at 18 and   now has her own place. 

she decided last month that she wanted to do university, she just had to decide what she wanted to learn there. she decided on becoming a P.E teacher. 

she knew I had the money and so asked for it to go on fees, she also asked me how much it was. I told her (quite happily I might add) that I managed to save 5000, she was not impressed and complained that she would have to get a job or take out loans. I explained to her how I struggled with money when she was born and that I tried my best.
that was not good enough in her eyes. 
I was then called a bitch and she stormed off. 

she came over yesterday and asked for the money, I told her that because of her recent issues around the money I'm unsure if I want to give it to you, I worked hard to earn that money and you complained it was not enough. she then burst into tears and left. 

any friend I talk to has told me it's her money and she deserves it no matter what.

bytln8	2019-06-10 04:45:09		AITA for telling a friend to “stop barking”	"A bit of backstory:

I’m from the southside of Chicago and go to a private Catholic University. Here I met this girl, let’s call her Brit.

Brit is originally from a Latin American Country (I will leave the name out for anonymity’s sake) and her father is a well off man. Studies medicine and makes a lot of money, money enough to be able to hold a plantation in this Latin American Country (not like ones in the south of the United States, the people that work there get paid handsomely) and money enough to take his daughter, Brit, to America to study.

Comparing Brit and I you’ll find a huge 180 in our lives. I’m not insanely poor, but I’ve been through a lot where I live. Seeing the deaths of cousins and friends, having to live on the streets and deal just to be able to get new clothes, doing things I’m not proud of to survive out here.

Growing up like this you get a thick skin for a lot of things, and I’ve found going to this expensive University that a lot of people don’t have it. The university I go to in the most harshest terms is filled with uncultured privileged people, people who have everything given to them and have barely had to work for anything. With this being the case people get insanely offended over things that I would normally brush off and this is the crux of the problem.

One day, on a groupchat I have with my University friends, Brit was being insanely annoying, annoying enough for me to decide to reply to her in the only way I know how: with an insult. I chimed in and told her “can you stop fucking barking”. To me, this is as light as I can get with someone, this is a simple “shut the fuck up” nothing more nothing less. Well Brit didn’t take it that way.

Instantly after I said it she claimed I was only telling her that because a) she was a woman and b) I didn’t respect her. She started saying I hate women and that I would never say that to any of the men I know.

Well that’s not true, I respect everyone I meet until I think they say something I don’t like. I immediately went to another groupchat I have with all of my friends, they are all male, and took a screenshot of the first time I’ve ever typed out “stop barking” which happened to be 2 years ago. I sent it to her and told her to never claim something like that about me because she doesn’t even know me like that. 

I told her in front of everyone, you just got offended and took it the wrong way. She didn’t want to hear me out and instead stopped talking to me, even after one of my closest friends, someone who’s also from the same neighborhood as me chimed in and told her that people just talk like that and that she shouldn’t take it too seriously. She just wasn’t having it and since that day she barely speaks in the groupchat anymore. 

AITA here? My friends are split 50/50.

TL;DR I told a girl to “stop barking” and she took it as me calling her a female dog and disrespecting her as a woman. Even though that’s definitely not what I meant."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

She changed from being friendly and caring to vindictive and hostile. This change was catalyzed by the death of her abusive mother.
However, these last few months have especially been unbearable as her behavior has been extreme. She struggles with substance abuse and I suspect bipolar depression (I’m no doctor but all the signs and family history is there). I’ve been the only one of my small family of four to always comfort and support her during her adult temper tantrums and it’s very emotionally and mentally exhausting. I’ve had many talks with her and she just cries, say some bullshit about her past and my dad, and then stays clean for no more than a week before she’s back to being an asshole. I’ve pushed her to seek professional help (I helped find a doctor and set up her appointments but she stoped going, that’s if she ever went in the first place).
She has cheated on my dad, burned through thousands on coke binges, and started many verbal and physical fights with us. I am 1/3 her size and she has repeatedly try to “fight” me before someone steps in. I’m extremely worried for her health cause I know her body can’t keep up with these habits for much longer and she is putting others at risk when she’s driving drunk. I’m hoping a few months in prison for driving under the influence and/or possession of illegal substances will be a strong enough wake up call for her to heal over any past griefs before she ends up OD.
I don’t know if this would be the right thing to do. Will karma get me back for purposely trying to get her locked up over this and putting my dad through the legal and financial strain to defend her?

I will admit I am in the qrong for being here for a few months and not contributing besides cleaning/buying my own items. I get $100 a week from my grandma solely for food/necessities.
My bf and I had been staying in a different state but it ended up not working out and I had to figure out the plan. His mom offered for us to move there and it seemed best at the time. I had no idea the burden of staying here prior to moving in.
A lot of trauma has happened to my bf here and as soon as we got here he got severely depressed. Soon after we found out he has cancer so he had surgery and will soon be starting up chemo after just taking care of stuff w his liver.
I had a job but I didn't keep it long because I am now severely depressed. His mom comes over every. single. day. telling me I'm the reason my bf is doing so bad mentally (he is currently in treatment for his depression), I'm a lazy piece of shit etc.
She also does not get depression. ""I'm depressed because of you every day!!"" ""You're spoiled and lazy"" ""I hate you and what you did to my son""
She also tries to get my grandma on her side, trying to get me to break up w bf, get me put in a mental hospital, anything. 
I was honestly doing really well until my bf left and she started doing this. Today I started a mood stabilizer and my mindset has been so much better, I've showered and cleaned and started working out.
When my bf gets out of treatment I'll be paying $100 a week to live here and start a part time job. 

I have tried telling her I just need space because I get a ton of stuff done when she doesn't come in to tell me i'm doing everything wrong and say rude things to me.
Once I start paying I really just want to be able to be alone to make sure my mental health doesn't get as bad again, I just really feel like I'll be stuck here for a long time depressed because of her. My only way out is to stick to a job and start saving up, but it'll be impossible if it keeps up.

I love him but don't like being around him right now.

My wife and I get along well and enjoy spending time together, but she just wants to sit around, watch things or game when she is not working.  I love her very much, but we have issues.  The last time we where intimate was over 6 years ago. She has no drive and that she is physically unable to get busy due to pain down there.  She also does very little around the house.

I feel my give a D*#N fading away and I am spending more and more time away from the house.  I am not cleaning it, I am getting by with the bare minimum at work and at home, and I am spending almost all my free time with my friends.  

I have a very good female friend (but not like that).  She is married too.  He husband is the same, but instead of Final Fantasy like my wife, it is Online poker and beer.  So we end up running errands and getting projects done together while our spouses stay at home on their computers.

bytbny	2019-06-10 04:12:54	thhrowawwayAITA	AITA for moving half way around the world and then questioning my wife's choice of friends?	"This all began about 4 years ago. My wife and I had been married for about 5 years and in that time we had moved all over our home country and Europe together.

I was offered a new position further afield, we discussed it and I took it. The only catch was that it came with a 6 month training program 5000 miles away. Initially my wife planned to join me but she then decided to complete her current work contract and join me when it was complete. All in all during that 6 months I think we saw each other a total of three weeks.

That was the start of her new friendship that has grown to be a problem between us. Her new friend, we'll call him John, was a former co-worker of mine. They were never friends before I left but got closer over these 6 months. John and I were never close but we have mutual friends. 

After the training period I was free to commute home until my wife's contract was complete and she would be able to join me in our new home. I would travel the 11 hour flight and be home usually one week a month.

At the completion of my wife's contract she told me that she would like to extend. This extension would make her easier to enter the job market in our new home and also make it easier for her to return to her job when we eventually returned to Europe. I agreed to this as the commute was working well even though being away from each other was hard.

Then came our holiday. We took a city break. She left her phone charging on the bedside as we went out exploring for the day. When we returned I unplugged her phone to replace it with mine and the screen lit up. She had 50 unread messages from John.

I had no idea that they were communicating this much. I asked our mutual friend if he had heard anything from John. Apparently whenever I am home he drinks himself into a stupor and complains about me to our friends.

I was shocked. I had no idea that my wife and him were so close. When I asked her about it she responded with ""I need the support when you aren't here"". I'm incredibly conflicted. I left her without support but I would rather she got it from elsewhere. But it's not my call. I'm would never try and control my wife's actions.

I've asked her to restrict or stop her interactions with John. She's been distant ever since. She's accusing me of controlling her. So Reddit, AITA?

EDIT: Many thanks to everyone that took the time to post a reply. I'll take your advice on board and try to move forward. I love my wife and I want to do the whatever I can to resolve this."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
bytbjp	2019-06-10 04:12:29		AITA for asking my aunt and my cousin to buy another dress for my wedding?	I (30 f) am getting married in two weeks. As the date approaches, some things have not turned out as planned even though we tried preparing for everything in advance. Despite going to the tailor months in advance and reserving the spot for my bridesmaids' dresses, I was notified a week ago that the dresses would be much more expensive than I was previously told by the tailor himself. Obviously, I wanted to make sure the price wasn't going to be too high, as I don't want to make my bridesmaids go over budget. This is where my aunt (53) comes in. My aunt, who is also my godmother, has always been bossy and pushy. She went to the fabric store and asked for the fabric I had initially chosen for the dresses (her daughter [23f] is a bridesmaid and my aunt fully supports her financially), but before buying it she called me. Now, I had told all my bridesmaids that I would buy the fabric once I had spoken with the tailor, because I wanted to make sure of the price. I tell her this on the phone, and ask her to wait until the next day in order to buy it. After we hung up, my cousin sent me a text saying they bought the fabric anyways and that if the tailor charged too much, they would go to someone else. I immediately told her this was going to be a problem, because I need someone who agrees to sew 6 dresses, not 1, in 2 weeks, and that I wanted them to wait until the next day so that I could verify the price again or, worst case scenario, go dress shopping at a local boutique. Now, I wouldn't mind her using a different dress than the other bridesmaids, and I agreed to it initially because I felt bad for her spending money on the fabric, but the only dress I found for all of my bridesmaids did not match that fabric at all, and I have already spent a lot of money on my wedding for a simple detail like this to throw off the wedding theme. I called my cousin and told her that I was sorry, but that I was choosing another dress for all bridesmaids. She was ok, but my aunt called me right after that and started screaming at me, saying that I was choosing other people before her, and that she had spent a lot of money on the fabric, etc. I got angry and told her I advised them to not buy the fabric in the first place, to which she responded that she was not going to continue the argument and hung up on me. I called my cousin and told her, in a calm manner, that I hoped she could understand the situation, to which she responded she did, and that she was going to buy the dress. My aunt later texted me saying that she was going to buy my cousin the dress, and I responded to her text saying to send me a receipt for her purchase at the fabric store, so that I could buy the fabric off her. She never answered to that message, but is now acting passive aggressive and distant, 2 weeks before the wedding. AITA?	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Stuff like this doesnt happen to me very often (women coming on to me in general) and I didnt initiate this in anyway, booze was involved and one thing led to another but there were other family members nearby, so not much happened. Now it feels like whenever we are semi-alone she wants to go ""all the way"". I feel like if no one finds out there should be no issue, and 2 adults get to have some harmless fun. However, I keep thinking about the ""what ifs"" and the fact that I'm not entirely comfortable with the situation. Plus I know how badly this could affect every current relationship I have."

bytb0y	2019-06-10 04:10:41	All_DayS85	AITA for doxxing a man who followed me home in his car?	"I’m a 19 year old college girl, and just today I was driving home on the freeway. I was in the far left lane, but the car in front of me was going **extraordinarily** slow (to the point that if a cop had been there, I’m positive he would have received a ticket.) I had a hard time getting out of the left lane since there were a long line of passing cars in the lane next to me; so I stayed behind him. I tried my best to be patient, and I didn’t tailgate or honk at him.

Just a while later, the guy brake checked me for no reason. I had to slam on my brakes, making a bunch of my stuff fall down and scaring the shit out of me. I got out of that lane about 30 seconds later, rolled down my window, and as I passed by him I shouted “**COCKSUCKER**!” at the top of my lungs. Seconds later, I was scared to see him suddenly changing lanes and pulling behind me.

His car stayed behind mine for the remainder of the drive home (about 4 miles). I grew nervous; wondered if I should call the cops; and when I pulled into the driveway of my house (which I share with 2 friends) he pulled next to the sidewalk in front and came out of his car. He was an older man (early 70’s I think), and he asked me if my parents were home, and that if so he needs to talk to them.

I told him I don’t live with my parents and am legally an adult, and he responded “That’s surprising. You sure don’t behave like one.” He went off on this big tangent about how vile what I yelled was, and how I have “no respect for my elders”, and the typical grandpa/old man type spiel about how I’m a spoilt millennial brat. I stuck up for myself, telling him, “I don’t care if you’re the fucking Queen of England. I’m not treating anyone with respect if they drive like an asshole and put lives at risk.”

He kept spewing nasty stuff at me and pushed to come inside and “speak to my parents” (even though I’d told him I don’t live with them), and I pointed to my friends’ cars out front, told him I’m not alone, and that I’ll call the cops if he doesn’t go. Finally he left; and as he did so I snapped a photo of him and took down his license #. I went to multiple Facebook groups (one for my college campus, one for my city, and one a college group that provides support for women dealing with stalking/violence/assault.) I posted his photo, license # and this message:

**This man stalked me (a 19 year old girl) all the way home last night in his car, intimidated and harassed me, and didn’t leave until I threatened to call the police. Had my roommates not been clearly home for him to see, I fear that things wouldn’t have ended well for me, and that I might not be here typing this. To all young women in this city and at my school, don’t let this sick creep intimidate you and call the cops if he tries to do so. Stay safe! <3**

I also sent his photo/plate to the cops. I feel very justified doing all this; but one of my friends (who I live with) expressed concern that I’m going too far. AITA?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bytatl	2019-06-10 04:10:07	iphonegoogle	AITA for telling my friends where I bought my wife's ring from?	"I bought my wife's ring from a certain wholesale jeweler. Two of my friends have got engaged recently and have asked me where I got the ring from and I gave them the details. 

One of my friends got pretty much similar to my wife's ring now. However it's a common style. 

My wife is not happy because she said they should have found another place and that me giving them the details means it's not special anymore. I have spoken to jeweler and told them to not give any of my details to my friends (such as ring type etc and they hadn't). 

From my perspective it's just a jeweler company and its a nice thing to help my friends out. But she isn't happy with me and said here's the ring back because it's not special anymore."	Not the A-hole	0	0	68.0	62.0	0.0	0.0

byta5n	2019-06-10 04:07:59	throwaway-7024	AITA for continuing to play a game that almost destroyed me relationship?	"Everyone involved in this story is in their mid-twenties. 

&#x200B;

Context: About two years ago my friends (F1 and F2) introduced me to an online game that I quickly discovered I enjoyed immensely. These friends would often stay at my place (which I lived in with my partner \[P\], who would participate) and binge some games. When this game was introduced to me, my friends and I lost a lot of interest in other games and wanted to play it a lot. My partner didn't love the game but played it a bit. After about a month he decided he'd had enough of the game and wanted to get back on with playing the co-op games we'd all been playing in the past. F1,F2, and I obliged but whenever we'd become bored of whatever we'd be playing we'd go back to the online game. 

&#x200B;

Eventually it got to a point where I was playing it without F1 and F2. I started playing a lot, until it got to the point P thought it was interfering in our relationship. Looking back it did indeed become toxic and I was a terrible boyfriend at the time. After many arguments about it things got better, I started playing the game less, and he even started playing with all of us. 

&#x200B;

Recently P brought up that even though he's been playing the game with all of us it still triggers bad feelings and memories for him and he is going to uninstall it. I offered to do the same because if me playing it around him was bad for him I didn't want to keep doing it. He insisted he didn't want to stop me from playing a game I clearly enjoy but I'm not convinced. It continues to cause intermittent arguments in our relationship even though F1 and F2 barely come over to play it anymore. When I do play with them online P will feel excluded and when I play it when he's not around he feels like I'm waiting for him to leave to play it. I tried uninstalling it but he stopped me again, not wanting me to give up the game but it's just so exhausting feeling guilty for doing something I enjoy despite his permission.

byta1u	2019-06-10 04:07:37		AITA for talking about a kid's death around their family (unknowingly)	"Ok, so I am a part of an all girls program for this week. (Keeping it undisclosed for privacy and it doesn't really matter). At the end of the might, we have a group meeting of about twenty girls. After we have asked questions about the program and what is happening for the next week, we started talking about our schools. Then it took a dark turn. One girl talked about a school shooting and another about frequent bomb threats. About half the students were sharing dark stories of their area. I mention that my school was still having backlash about an ""unsolved death"" of a student at the school. I put unsolved in quotes because the county figured it out quickly, it was accidental. But the kids parents didn't believe that, and I mentioned that ""I think they were so upset that they wanted someone to blame"", and they did. But in no way did I make them out to be malicious. They sued the school, the county, the BOE, and a couple of students they thought did it. They lost the case and were squid for defamation and fabricating evidence.

Here is where the AITA part comes in. I only got to why they declared it accidental when one of the girls says ""You are totally wrong! That isn't what happened at all!"" 

I was a bit taken aback because I was talking about the actual, written down and documented evidence. I wasn't even really pushing it one way or the other in details. I just explained what happened any have my opinion.

So I say ""How am I wrong? I am literally just telling the story from my school!"" And she points to a girl next to her and says,

""Well that kid was HER cousin!"" 

I ask the cousin, ""Well, what do you think happened?""

""Me?"" And she goes onto explain how she thought they liked her cousin. I still disagree strongly, but I didn't say anything, I let her speak and nodded to what she said.

After that, the group leader diverted us away, although she did mention that she agreed with me that the two students couldn't have done it for other reasons. 

After the meeting, I went over to the cousin and apologized, saying that I didn't want to try to belittle or smear her cousin, I really was just explaining what I knew of the case to the girls who asked. Except then I was starting to get upset because I don't want to be the person who does that, who potentially upset her about her late cousin. She kept saying, ""No, no! It's fine, don't get upset!"" And then I was upset because I was upset!

Anyway, was I in the wrong to even talk about it? One could argue that I didn't know what I was talking about, but I had looked really deep into the case, looked at many different sources and opinions and just felt close to it, being my town and my school taking the blame."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

He's considerably attractive, however and that's the biggest problem. He's such a total nerd and it makes me cringe so bad when he says stuff like dragon ball Z euphemisms for his dick, sending me Game of Thrones themed dick-pics, or bringing up memes during foreplay.. 

It kills my mood, but I don't want to hurt his feelings. If he keeps this up I won't be able to keep having sex with him, should I stop sleeping with him or tell him to shut up?  WIBTA?

My sister is in college (4th year) and I’m a sophomore in high school. I was going to Ethiopia to help build a school. My mother passed away in 3rd grade, and until the end of 5th grade I was staying at home, after that year my sister had to go to collage and my dad had to work as well. After 5th grade I lived with my dads friend’s family because I wanted my sister to go to a good school. After 2 years of staying in a different state (LA being home, and Matthews. North Carolina the other family). After 7th grade I went to live in Bakersfield, California. I have lived at home for 1 year now (half the time being home alone during the school year). I am attempting to stay here until high school is finished.


she got back and called me to open the door for her. I said hi to her and she said nothing back. I went into my room to finish up  school registration for next year. 10 minutes later she knocks on my door and says, “you don’t even care about me, you never even asked how it was”. I didn’t say anything about it because I knew she was tired and I didn’t want to make her mad. 1 hour later she asks what I want to eat for dinner, she says that we have to get something fast. There aren’t many healthy options for food so I just chose Wendy’s.  We get there and she starts saying that she doesn’t want me at her graduation, which hurt me a lot because I really do care for her, and help her out whenever I can. When we get home she says I’m not appreciative for anything, and I’ve never sacrificed for anyone. I still did not want to lose my temper so I did not say anything. I am not sure if I am right in the moment or if I’m wrong, so tell me. AITA"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
