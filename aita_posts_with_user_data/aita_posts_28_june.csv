c6u6bs	2019-06-29 03:59:26	ThrowAwayStories1973	AITA For Laughing At My Friends Sextape?	"For some background that might make this situation seem worse for everyone, the sex tape was one of him and his wife after they got drunk one night. Like, absolutely hammered. That makes him look like a bad guy for showing me, but his wife said it was fine and even watched too.

This may seem weird, but her and I used to date back in our college days, and a little after. It was never that serious, but we had a lot of sex. Because of this, she and my friend casual discuss things most couples normally wouldn't share to others (her excuse it that I've probably seen her like that more times than anyone probably will. And my friend is okay with it because, in his mind, he was able to ""steal"" her away from me, so he feels secure about himself.)

They have been married for a few months, dating for six months, but knew each other from college. My friend almost always brags about his sex with his wife whenever possible, and she fuels the fire by agreeing with him 1000%. So, last night, when we were getting hammered at a party(It was mine, so I had to clean a house with a huge hang-over. Yay!), I called their bluff and said I wanted some proof. They took me seriously and left to go film the tape. 

They showed up to my house the next day saying they have the video and were ready to laugh in my face. They even said they hadn't even watched it yet. My friend made a joke about being so drunk that the only thing he remembers was how great the sex was.   They took the video from the camera and put it into my laptop (not so tech savvy, I think it was using the sd card) and we watched the video. 

The video was an hour long, but the ""action"" was over in a few minutes. From the start of the video, you could tell he was hammered. He could barely walk straight without doing the extreme side lean, they fiddled with the camera while saying ""Turn on"" for a few minutes even though it was already on. They stating going at it when his wife said, ""Wait, hold on. Are you okay?"" He immediately responded with a yeah before going back at it. She just loudly said, ""You just feel different, Smaller."" He ignored her, finished shortly after, and then went to sleep. She tried to shake him awake, but he didn't respond. She then started to say, ""Hey, (insert name×2), wake up. You let me finish, you sure your okay? Why the hurry?"" Which is all fine and all (I mean, he was drunk. And him being quick wasn't why I laughed), but she didn't say his name. She said mine. That's why I laughed. They immediately left the house, leaving the video, and yelled at each other about cheating. 

I thought that would be it. I thought we could just get over it. I was wrong. I get to work earlier today a little later than normally(we work together), and everyone treats me like I'm toxic. When I ask what's up, they say ""You sleep with his wife, AND you show up late."" 

I explained what happened, and how I didn't sleep with her during their relationship, but they still say I am an asshole for laughing at him.

c6u64w	2019-06-29 03:58:44		AITA For not wanting to move in with my (ex)Friend?	"Started when hubby & I planned to move out at my family's house because they need room for the baby. We agreed to be roommates with her & our guy friend. She gave us her demands; wanted a 'house' near her 2nd job, we HAD to find a place in a few weeks cause her relative gave her a few months to live with her. she didnt like that she knocks on the bathroom for her to pay $20 for utilities. 

I said we have limited time & budget so have low expectations, she told us to call & look for places since she said she was busy with her 2nd job, everytime we ask her about a place she complains that; she don't like it, it's far away from work, or thinks there's other good places. We have disagreements with almost everything, mostly rent. She insists on us finding a 2nd job, I said yes because we needed to save money. 
One time I found an apt but it wouldnt be available on time, I asked if we could take a look at it cause it looked & sounded good. She declined & said that if we looked at it she would not move in with us. Our other roomie was very helpful to her. everytime we go look at places she goes home after work, she gets picked up by him so she wouldn't have to drive, when she & I aren't there to look at a house, him & my hubby takes videos and pictures for us. 

That day, She & I were supposed to eat out,i couldn't go cause we just got back from looking at a place. She texted me saying she & the guy fought, told him that he isnt getting involved in looking at houses he got pissed, told her to fuck off & that he IS making an effort. I understood his side, she told me she would reply saying not come with us the next day, which I disagreed & said that he would also want to look at the place. She replied saying she wont be coming then. On our group chat, the guy finally responded, then she said 'you guys can move out without me' stopped replying for a few hours. I replied that we invested all our time into this (sidenote: our mutual friend who she had dinner that time, said she told her that we were texting nonstop and she didnt want to reply) as soon as the guy apologized, she replied that she will be going to the open house, my hubby & I already agreed that we wouldn't want to put our trust in her so he said on the chat that we wouldnt be moving with them cause we haven't even moved in and there's a lot of disagreements, his sis is also sick & he might come visit her often, it would be difficult for us to pay for rent. He also said to not take it personally. She replied that we flaked on her, she wasted time and sacrificed sleep, she is more stressed & that we should have said it to sooner. 
She texted me saying she had a deadline and the whole time she should have been looking for an apartment on her own & that she doesn't want us in her life anymore.

All of us work together she avoids us & tells our mutual friends that we flaked on her & tries to make us look bad, which I don't really mind because now I know how much our friendship means to her."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"A few years back my dad got his old job back, so he worked around me and my brother around school and then during the summer, he worked full 9-5 work and all that. So both my parents worked fulltime over breaks. We got more money to spend for fun and stuff. But because my brother hates me and my parents were never home, I was thrown into a depression. I felt alone. So I ended up going to a hospital because I was stupid and they said I can't be alone anymore. My dad can't work full time over breaks even though I've been two years clean! He works until 3 in the morning on his computer now so during the day he can just be a non working dad.

He's always tired, always eiritated, never has any ideas anymore, and overall, he's just like a brainless zombie that stumbles around and mutters to himself to remember ""Chris wanted the drawing sizes by (some date)""

c6u5dn	2019-06-29 03:56:46		AITA For telling my GF I’m not gonna like her if she doesn’t start working out?	"So I have been in this relationship for 3 years.
For the past 3-6 months my gf started putting on weight. At first it didn’t bother me because her boobies got bigger(who would mind that) but now it’s got to the point where its starting to affect her whole body. She stopped wearing what she liked and started buying M and L sized clothing from a XS. She cant run or play basketball like before ,she gets tired really easy and runs out of breath after 3 flights of stairs, thing she could do before without any problem.Thats what concerns me. So I’ve been trying to convince her that she need to start working out and start a diet, but every time I bring this up she starts getting defensive and doesn’t want to hear about it.

I told her I’ve been in the same situation where i had to lose 20 kilos and how hard it was and I don’t want that for her(i think she is about 10 kilos overweight maybe less ). I thought if I offer my help with the working out and help her with dieting advice she will accept I even offered to go to the gym together, she says “yes, I’ll start tomorrow “ for the past 2 months finding excuses for not going to the gym and eating fast food and sugary foods and drinking soda.

So yesterday ,because I saw nothing worked to convince her, I said if she keeps getting fatter I’m going to stop liking her and if she cares about the relationship she should start working on it. She got mad as usual and said she doesn’t want to hear about it and will start working out tomorrow, like the past 2 months.

I really don’t want to break up with her but I don’t want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn’t care about themselves.

Now I’m wondering if maybe it was a bit of an exaggeration and if she will get discouraged because I said that."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6u4zu	2019-06-29 03:55:36	spazing_zombie	AITA For telling my mom that I'd move out unless she stopped fostering dogs.	"As long as I can remember, I've had dogs around the house as my mom is an avid dog lover. We have our own little dog and I love him, he's absolutely great and it's really enjoyable having him around the house. In addition to him, my mom has been fostering other dogs for a few years now. 

About a year ago we got a disabled little 3 legged dog. He's an absolute fucking asshole. He has no problem with my mom and her boyfriend as he spends the whole day with them, but he's an absolute dick to everyone else. I try to pet him and give him treats because I know he's had a tough life and I do feel sorry for the little guy. But he's always been a dick to me, he constantly barks at me and has tried many many times to bite me when he sees me go near my mom (he's very defensive of her). It's at the point where I can barely even give her a hug or a kiss on the check because he freaks the fuck out. Not only that, but every time I bring a friend over, he attacks them as well because he's afraid of strangers. Somehow I've been able to put up with this for the last year, but today I came home on my lunch break and him and a new foster dog immediately ran at me and tried to bite me when I went in to say hello to my mom. This was the last straw. 

I told my mom that the fosters had to go. I've voiced my displeasure several times and each time she said she's going to find a home for then, but this time I was serious them leaving. I understand that it's not always easy to find dogs a suitable home and I know that my mom has been trying to get this three legged guy a home for a while now, but I just can't stand it anymore. I told her that if she didn't get rid of them within the next month that I'd start exclusively living with my dad (my parents are divorced and I'm going to be a high school senior). She was pissed when I said this and told me that I had no right to speak to her this way and that she couldn't find the three legged guy a home, but would not take him to the pound. I told her that it might just be worth it to have him euthanized if absolutely nobody would take him. She was having none of that and that's where the conversation has ended for now. I talked to a few friends and some feel for me, while a couple others are convinced that I'm the asshole for threatening to not live with my mom, especially because I know how much it means to her to have me around. I don't actually want to move exclusively into my dad's house, but I really can't take it anymore. It's gotten to the point where I either don't want to go inside my mom's house and if I do go on, I don't even want to talk to my mom because this dog will be there barking at me and trying to bite me. 

So, am I being an asshole? Do I need to just try to earn the affection of this dog? I'm really not sure what to do right now."	Not the A-hole	0	0	22.0	33.0	0.0	0.0
c6u3wj	2019-06-29 03:52:34	flowerboy__	Aita for not enjoying this holiday	"This is more of just a way for me to rant than anything but i would like your opinions on this. I do apokogise in advance if the format of this is not correct or if its a weird read.

So the background is that im 18 and im on holiday with my dad. We go on holiday every year at summer, 2 years ago I met my current partner and last year in anger i told my dad that i didnt want to come on holiday with him again.

The main reason really is that I want to do my own thing and spend time with my partner, another reason for this is that whenever we go on holiday he drags me around all to the places he wants to go ans gets moody when i am not enjoying myself but when i suggest places i want to go he makes it the last priority so we never end up go there.

We are on holiday this year to new york bur we have travelled up to Toronto today and we have tomorrow day time there and he wants to get up at 8 o clock to get out early which annoyed me because we have done nothing but walk all day every day for the last week and i want some rest but he is getting annoyed at me again saying in wasting the holiday to which i replied ""well i didn't want to come anyway"" and he said i was ungrateful

I dont personally think i am being ungrateful because again, i told him previously that i had my own plans for this summer which he simply ignored.

TLDR: My dad ignored me last year when i said i had my own plans this summer but he dragged me along to a holiday that only he has interest in"	Asshole	0	0	1640.0	40.0	0.0	0.0

He's in a blue-collar job and is one of the most disgruntled people I've ever met. He is always complaining and thinks everyone looks down on him and his department (self-fulfilling prophecy?). I'm in a white collar role and think our employer is fantastic. Because of the discrepancy in our jobs, and the fact that we have multiple buildings, we don't see each other very often.

Earlier this week I had a task that required me to go into the basement of one of the sites...where I found him and someone else in their department sleeping.

I’m the only income, however, as my sister is disabled (waiting on government benefits, it’s in the legal stages). I work in a rather high stress office, and I make it an active point to never bring work stress home. 

Today, though, it was a really rough day. (Ex. someone accidentally spilled their coffee on my shirt, I messed up on a report, etc.) I told my sister that it was a bad day and she sympathized. We always talk about our days and whatever is on our mind as we prepare dinner, get an after-work coffee or something, etc - I say all this to say that there’s plenty of time for talking about our gripes throughout this time or what have you. 

When I’m having dinner, especially after a long day, I just want to relax and enjoy my food. However, my sister finds that this is the perfect and only time to bring up whatever is currently stressing her the most and turns it into a stress-filled dinner, where she asks for advice and I give it, followed by silence, but then she gets angry if I ask her thoughts about it again. 

I’m a simple kind of gal, I just want peace during mealtime so I can relax after a shitty day. It ends up, however, that I end up comforting her about her feelings and bad day. WIBTA if I bring it up to her and ask if at least dinnertime can just be peaceful?

c6u07s	2019-06-29 03:41:47	blue-box1255	AITA? I hate dealing w/ friend’s parents	"A while back, my friends and I planned to meet up at a local mall to watch a movie and eat at a restaurant. One of my friends, Lisa, has really cautious and constraining parents that are wary to let her do anything with us. Because of this, she said she couldn’t go to the meetup we planned.

Well, the day we chose to meet up at the mall, Lisa says she’s suddenly able to go. So, at the front of the mall where we chose to meet up, almost everyone shows up, so we’re ready to go, right? Wrong. Lisa isn’t here yet. We can’t head to the front of the theater because Lisa (her parents) wants us to wait at the front of the mall for another 15 minutes. She shows up, and Lisa (and her dad) walk with us to the theater. We’re early for the movie, so we want to walk around. But we can’t, Lisa’s dad wants to stay put until Lisa’s mom shows up. 

Lisa’s parents want to follow us around for ALL of the meetup. I’m probably just an ass, but a group of 14-15 year olds (with no bad intentions) at a crowded, well-managed mall don’t need adult supervision.

We can’t watch the movie because one of our friends didn’t bring enough money. So we’ll just head to the restaurant. Lisa’s mom isn’t showing up for a while, anyways. Just as we’re about to leave the inside of the mall, it begins to pour outside. All of our group is chill with running through the rain to reach the restaurant but Lisa and her dad. They think we’ll get sick if we run through the rain, although we never have. Lisa has been stuck indoors (due to her parents) most of her life and thus gets sick easily.

So we wait till the rain stops (20 minutes) and head over. Lisa’s dad sits with us in our table. Lisa’s dad isn’t some regular dad either, he’s a creep. I (and my sister) have caught him staring at us, and my mom has noticed him checking out her body. Keep in mind my sister and I were 14 at the time!

Later on, still at the restaurant, Lisa’s mom shows up and sits right beside us! They don’t talk to us,  and neither of them were sitting close to their daughter. We had to squeeze tight to accommodate. Because we’re a close group of friends and also teens, we can’t really have regular kid conversations with Lisa’s parents super close. Most time there at that point was sitting in silence or quiet small talk. They follow us around for the rest of the meetup.

Lisa never told us that her parents would be with us. This isn’t their only offense, either. Once, Lisa’s mom drove my sister, Lisa, and I to friend’s party, and her mom told us to watch her daughter and to make sure she didn’t talk or be close to a certain boy. Lisa’s mom then proceeds to dump ALL of the things the boy has done (nothing bad) onto my sister and I, IN FRONT of Lisa, even calling us over during the party to see if we’d been making sure Lisa had been avoiding that boy.

Not rough enough since every few months he travels to CANADA to see his gf). I finally snapped and wrote out ""Well I'm sorry I was born middle class!

c6tvzs	2019-06-29 03:29:43	throwafuckfuck	WIBTA for having the landlord's maintenance guy come to make repairs prior to when my roommate is able to repair herself damage to the apartment made by her dog made?	"I moved on Monday into an apartment where one girl had been evicted from the lease and the other two roommates were still living. I felt good about it apart from a few repairs which were needed. I was assured by the roommates and the landlord that they would be taken care of before move in.

One of these repairs is that the baseboard heater in my room is badly damaged and a fire risk once we get into September/October and might actually need the heat on. The other is that the fridge straight up does not work.

Between when I signed the lease and when I moved in, the first roommate's dog ate some baseboard in the living room and some linoleum in the kitchen. The linoleum exposed beneath the first layer is absolutely disgusting. She said her dad would repair the damage and me and the other roommate would not have to worry about it. However, repairs have yet to be made, and I'm getting absolutely exhausted of walking on cardboard in the kitchen, looking at exposed radiator in my bedroom, and having to eat out all the time because any groceries I buy spoil in the 70 degree fridge.

The roommate with the dog signed a lease stating written permission is required for each pet, and she did not get written permission for this dog. The written permission is a new stipulation in the lease added when we resigned due to my moving in.  For this reason I am worried about getting us all evicted and also about the other roommate being told she must get rid of her dog (who, to be fair-- is a nice dog who has a good home with this roommate. She just has some separation anxiety)

c6tuu7	2019-06-29 03:26:19	shadesod	AITA if I refuse to pay a certain amount for rent?	"I am moving into my fiancé’s place, which he shares with 3 other people. The first lives in a room which isn’t legally a bedroom. The second and third roommates are a couple with separate bedrooms. I am moving into my fiancé’s room. Because the amount of people in the apartment is increasing, the landlord is increasing their rent by 300$, to $2900. I don’t believe the first roommate should have to pay more than 650 for his room, since it’s half the size of everyone else’s. Based on an offhand conversation I just had with one of the other two, they believe that rent will be split evenly 5 ways—putting rent for each of us at $580 (before they were paying $650). Am I the asshole if I insist I won’t split evenly since we’re sharing a bedroom and my fiancé and I shouldn’t have to pay twice combined for a single room (when the other couple, of their own choice, wanted separate bedrooms). Since my presence is increasing rent by 300$, the most we should pay combined on our room is $950, but since the landlord revealed he was going to increase rent anyway, I don’t want to pay more than 850 (and the person in the smallest room shouldn’t pay more than 650). The other two have the two biggest bedrooms, and I was going to suggest them paying 700 each (an increase of $50 each). Am I the asshole if I refuse to pay more than 900 for rent? 
My fiancé didn’t want to have this conversation with them so he didn’t and now we’re stuck in this weird situation where he refuses to talk about it and hasn’t discussed it with them at all. :///

Edit: Everyone who suggested a base rate for common space usage make a lot of sense. 

The room situation is this: roommate 1 has the master bedroom. Roommate 2, her boyfriend, has a separate bedroom of his own. Roommate 3 is in an office off of Roommate 1’s master. Roommates 4 and 5 are me and my fiance. There is one bathroom. Heat and hot water are included. We will split other bills evenly. 

Part of my issue is that they signed the lease for one year, it was up last summer, and they didn’t resign, just continued to pay rent. So right now it’s a verbal agreement with the landlord which doesn’t sit right w me. I asked for a copy of the old lease and no one had a copy. I can’t sign onto a lease that doesn’t actually exist. I went to college in NYC so I’m not about to let their landlord fuck them (and me) over. Most places I lived in in NYC did it per room (and room rate depended on the size of the room).

My fiancé is paying the $300 difference for the month of July but this is something we need to negotiate amongst us before August’s rent because the landlord basically just texted them that rent would go up two days ago. That doesn’t sit right with me either, but as someone said, he has us by the balls. Living w my parents is not an option because my mother is abusive, which is why I don’t feel like I have much room to negotiate amongst the roommates. I also feel like I was lied to by my fiancé because he said that a lot of this was nailed down and it really really isn’t. His unwillingness to ask questions or state that splitting 5 ways evenly doesn’t seem fair to him has led them to misunderstand our position, which is both of our faults. 

If rent is increasing by $300, and the only factor changing is my existence here, then we should pay $950 for the room. Roommate 3 has stated that he doesn’t mind paying $650 for his tiny room. If we calculate rent based on the base rate usage many of you suggested, each of us should pay $300 for the common space.

c6ttpo	2019-06-29 03:22:58		AITA for planning to expose my ex-gf/ex-friend	"Just to he clear i haven't done this yet, but i plan to.

Some background info: im in a group of five friends, i previously dated this one girl un the ftiend group (R) our relationship ended around may.

So i have this huge master plan to expose her in front of our friend group. On the first day of school i told everyone to show up to the bus stop that we normally meet at. I walk an extra ten minutes every morning to get to this bus stop and ive been doing that for about a year. I will show up and once everyone in the group is there i will tell them everything i have collected. Just to be clear R said she still wanted to maintain a friendship and do everything we would do if we were friends

1. R every once in a while invites us to help her do community service on the group chat, i was not invited.

2. This also means she created a group chat specifically without me but with the others

3. https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c6qldq/aita_for_not_being_pansexual/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
I will basically tell them that she tried to force me to be pan

4. She tried to kick me out of a completely different chat but a different friend told me about it and revived the chat with me

5. She was riding her bike the other day and stopped right in front of my house and stopped her bike and appeared to be working on it. When i walked out there and said hi she said hi and immediately left. I texted her about that and she said thats just her normal bike route and she used a screwdriver to mess with her bike.
1. Who brings a screwdriver to a bike ride
2. I didnt see one
3. This was not her normal route because my mother and sibling is constantly outside and they would've said something

I know this is really petty and pathetic but after telling her this i will say ""thats why im no longer coming to this bus stop"" and never walk that extra ten minutes again."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6tt8d	2019-06-29 03:21:34		WIBTA for not wanting my name and business reputation reflected on this Facebook status?	"Hello, I’m opening a business and a really good friend of mine will be working with me. She is in school for esthetics currently and tonight shared a fb status saying: 


“I’m at the point in my education where I just want to give everyone a facial. Y’all be posting pictures and I’m thinking about making you look younger and brighter 💁🏻‍♀️ “



She then tagged my name and named my business as the place to come see her when it’s open.



To me it sounds like an insult to people on her friends list who post pictures. In the beauty industry I feel like we shouldn’t point out people’s flaws or imperfections until they approach us to ask to have them fixed. This just seems mean and insulting to me. I don’t want my business represented this way. I already untagged myself, WIBTA if I asked to her remove my business name and explained why I don’t like it?

c6tnox	2019-06-29 03:06:15	hopbow	AITA for using the street parking?	"Preface: my wife has been away for about two weeks and I have been watching our two small boys solo, so my fuse may be much shorter than it should be.

I have an elderly neighbor. Our neighbor has rear parking and parks there because she is disabled and cannot use the street parking because of the curb.

When we moved in into our house last year, if we parked in front of her house she would get very irritated and ask us to move because she has frequent visitors (time has determined this to be a gross overstatement). In the interest of midwestern friendliness and not wanting to irritate a new neighbor, we would park down the road or across the street (even when my two boys were with us), or whatever needed to happen. It also didn’t help that my other neighbor doesn’t feel like she needs to abide by those rules, so will frequently overflow into our lot

For parking context, most properties on this street are very narrow. Mine is one of the smallest at about 20-25 feet

The last two weeks have been different, because my wife has been away, so I have been doing what’s most convenient, which includes parking in front of her house. Today, I got this text from her:

REDACTED, I didn’t catch you at lunch, but we need to talk about why you have been parking dead center in front of my home when there’s no one parked in front of your own house. When you first moved here I explained I frequently get deliveries and visitors that need to park there. You’ve respected that until now and I would like to talk about what’s different. Thanks -

I’m super pissed because this is so stupid and feel like her message is beyond condescending. I’m over tiptoeing around this lady and I’m ready to go off on her because 0 fucks left. I’ve not yet responded, and I’m looking for a few opinions before I do"	Not enough info	0	0	27.0	14.0	0.0	0.0

I get really upset knowing that he doesn't have to pay for gas, a car, doctor visits, new clothes, and always gets everything he wants basically. 

I understand that I shouldn't be mad at him for the money his parents have, but I do. I get so frustrated because financially, we contribute equally to the relationship, but I feel like he should contribute more since he is more fortunate than I am. I have a job, I'm a full time student, and I'm busy all the time. He gets an allowance from his parents and still makes a lot of his own money during the summer but doesn't have to worry about a job in the school year.

c6tiv2	2019-06-29 02:52:44	SanctimoniousSally	AITA for complaining about my co-worker getting a weekend day off because she has children?	"Hey everyone! I know children can be a touchy subject which is why I am reluctant to bring this up to my boss, but I honestly need perspective because I don't feel as if I'm being treated fairly. 

&#x200B;

So to start there are 4 people in my department. My supervisor (who has grown children), co-worker #1 (with school-aged children), co-worker 2 (with no children) and myself (also no children). 

&#x200B;

I first started with my organization almost 2 years ago and then changed departments about 5 months in. My new department is extremely short staffed and my organization is open every day except Christmas so all of us are required to work weekends. We do get help from other departments that have rotating weekend schedules that allow every one to get the chance to have 1 weekend day off every week for a period of 3-4 months. When I first started my boss told me that eventually I would be getting a weekend day off and I just had to wait it out. This dragged on and on until eventually I am a year in and I decide to ask my boss outright if I can have a weekend day off because it was our slow season. I was told absolutely not because we didn't have people to cover it. 

&#x200B;

A couple of months later co-worker #1 transfers into our department with her schedule already being Sunday\\Monday off. My supervisor allows her to continue to keep this schedule because she has children even though she expressly told me that there was no way we could afford to have someone gone on the weekends. This goes on for about 6 months. Now it's summer and her kids are out of school. So I suggest changing her schedule to weekdays off like the rest of us for the next couple of months and allowing us to rotate weekends since she can spend time with her kids any day. My idea was immediately shot down. I honestly feel like I am being punished because I do not have children and while I hold no grudge against co-worker #1 for this, I definitely resent my boss for allowing only one of us to have weekend days off when I would also like to spend time with people I care about like my husband. 

&#x200B;

I guess what I'm asking is WIBTA if I asked for rotating weekends, even though co-worker #1 would not get to see her kids as much?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	92.0	8.0	0.0	0.0
c6tima	2019-06-29 02:52:02		WIBTA If I prevented my friends promotion	"Throwaway account

Okay so, I'm currently in a supervisorial role and have been for approximately 6 months. This position is kind of a 2 person job, however the girl who was paired in this role with me has now decided to move on to bigger and better things. This has naturally opened up her position for someone in the workplace to step up and get a promotion.

This is where the problem begins. 
I am really good friends with one of my coworkers, and he (Rob) has put his hand up to take the role. As his close friend, I have naturally had a chance to get to know him quite well, the good and the bad. The bad is something he hides quite well which a lot of people don't see, and I genuinely believe he has a very good chance at the promotion. 

As a friend, he is one my best pals, we catch up for beers quite regularly and have a lot in common, and he has been there for me many times where I've needed him. However, Rob is one of those people who always has to find something to criticise people about, down to petty stuff like their weight, what they look like or their partners. Borderline bullying. Since I have know him, I have never seen him own up to any mistake he has made and he will even go to the extent of blaming others for it. All behaviours that I have called him out on on multiple occasions.

If i report this to my manager I'm assuming they will ask me exactly why I don't believe he should be in the role, which if I tell them and outline the reasons stated above, it might lead to disciplinary action for him as well as failing to get the promotion.

Anyway, to get to the point. I genuinely don't believe he is suitable or mature enough for the supervisor role. Am I the asshole if I go to the manager behind his back and tell them not to promote him which may lead to disciplinary action?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Her parents bought her a car when she was 18. It’s a 2010 Toyota SUV. It blue books for about 10-15k. Her dad approached me a month ago and told me I had to buy her car from him before we got married. Like told me I had no choice in the matter. He wanted a check for about 9,000 or he wanted me to pay it over two years at 5%. I said fuck that and we went and bought her a new car and told him to just keep hers. Now he is super pissed and won’t talk to either of us. Like idk the car was a gift for her 18th birthday and idk if he wanted money or what but it just seemed shitty of him. I will admit I bought the new car because I was kinda pissed he was giving us this ultimatum about the car and we have the means to buy a new car so I figured fuck it why not. But now it’s been a week and he still won’t really talk to us. Did I fuck up?		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Him even having a girlfriend was news to us, so we asked a few questions. When I found out who it was, I admit it made the situation worse. Our town isn’t Mayberry, but it’s not a sprawling metropolitan. The girl is the same age as him and is on her third pregnancy, which is well known at their high school-all by different fathers. First pregnancy, she had an abortion. Second, she miscarried. Now, she’s on her third with my son.

We agreed to meet with her parents. I said that while I’m not against the kids dating, we won’t be giving any money until we do a DNA test and know the child is my son’s. I even agreed to pay for one of those tests you can do while she’s still pregnant, so if he was, we could start figuring stuff out before the baby comes. Her parents agreed to it, but seemed turned off as to why I kept saying things as “If (Son) is the father”. I didn’t come out and say it, but I thought it was pretty naïve of them, given their daughter’s situation (they know of her previous pregnancies-they mentioned them in the meeting).

My husband and I sort of got into a disagreement about it afterwards. Obviously, our son isn’t innocent either. He got himself in a situation where he potentially got a girl pregnant at 17. At the same time, I want to protect him from a potential situation. I don’t think this girl or her parents are after money, they’re not in need of it. I just think they don’t want their daughter to go through this alone and I don’t blame them. And if this baby is our grandchild, they will not lack for love…but I’m not getting attached. Husband asked if I would feel different if she were say our older son’s first girlfriend, who was a much different girl-not a very racy past. I admitted, I wouldn’t.

Because now they work at there And they are like all in my face talking to me and asking me how I am and how is my family and stuff. And I didn't really react at first because I was just telling my mom how I didn't want to ever see them again, but we made small talk because we had a really bad falling out. 

They ditched me 3 years ago because their boyfriend said to them that they didn't like me as their friend and so they sided with them and sent me text messages saying very very hateful things...... And so we just stopped communicating..... But then they wanted my number and I gave it to them and they were chatting all excitedly like we were still best friends but it was really really painfully awkward because of all the drama (I knew them from like age 14-20.... They're like almost 23 now) ..... I probably shouldn't have..... And so I told my mom about it and she starts yelling and said that I shouldn't have given my number to them and that they would try to do it again if they tell the guy who they are dating that they are talking to me again..... and why would I wanna be friends with this person again after all the previous drama. I get it and I kinda agree but I'm trying to be nice?

It requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. 

Enter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

Her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

I tried being polite about it ""Sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""Ma'am!"" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says ""I don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


Finally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that"" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. 

I'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. ""LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!"" 

People looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.

Has since paid it off a year later, mostly. Nice guy, just bad at adulting. The only reason we still talk to him is because he is nice just irresponsible, not a problem when you don’t live with him.

The friend works at a nearby bar, and asked if he could crash on the couch when he gets off work a few nights a week so he won’t have to drive 45+ minutes home at 3am. I wake up early for work, and we have a dog that would be woken and will go bonkers if he comes in at 3am. I feel bad saying no, but I don’t want this previously bad roommate coming back, waking my dog up, waking us up, at 3am randomly. He’s a nice guy and we kinda want to help him but his past behavior would make it an extreme inconvenience. 

My boyfriend is also on the fence about it for similar reasons.

"My (now ex) husband and I tried for 3 years to conceive with no luck before turning towards adoption, which was an uphill battle for 7 years. My husband’s cousin’s daughter (who we’ll call Kayla) for this story, came to us after a particularly hard failed placement (we had held the baby and all but signed the papers to bring him home). She was only 21 at the time, 6 months pregnant. We knew that she had been considering adoption but we hadn’t asked her about us at all, because one, we were planning on adopting the other baby and two, that just wasn’t our place. Kayla told us that she had given it a lot of thought and she really wanted to keep her baby in the family. She knew that we would be her parents, but she said that she felt we were the best fit. We talked about it, still a bit burned, though soon became overjoyed and told her yes.

She gave us a beautiful baby girl. Before our daughter’s birth, we outlined everything at length and made it clear that we would be the parents. Our daughter would always know that Kayla was her birth mom, of course, but she wouldn’t parent her. We also outlined visitations, pictures, etc. Kayla was okay with all of it. Everything went well those first 3 years.

Some stuff went on between me and my now ex. He’s now no longer in the picture, not with me or my daughter. This is by his choice, and I wish more than anything he would be for our daughter. This is when things with Kayla went south. She started trying to come around more (we live in the same town). She’d drop by unannounced, call constantly to check up on things and pick fights with me about my parenting. All of this while I’m dealing with the divorce of my husband of 16 years. My emotions got the best of me and I didn’t always handle it best, but it was just too much. Eventually, she told me she wished she hadn’t let us adopt our daughter because she wanted her to have two parents and now, she just has one. I snapped.

I told her that I didn’t want her coming to my daughter’s 4th birthday party. This would be the last event she’d be seeing her at for a bit since we’re moving. This greatly upset her, according to Kayla’s mother. I just can’t deal with this drama. I plan to just tell my daughter that Kayla is sick and couldn’t make it. AITA here?

&#x200B;

Edit: Some clarity. The adoption was legal and myself, along with my ex-husband, are my daughter's legal parents. (Though I now have sole physical custody.) We set up a visitation plan with Kayla, though it cannot be legally enforced.

I did not decide to move away because Kayla made this comment. I have been planning to move-which Kayla knows-after my daughter's birthday out of state as I can no longer afford to live in the same area after my divorce and becoming a single mother. Even with this, Kayla would still see my daughter, she just wouldn't be able to drop in and do what she does now.

My husband and I had what I thought was a happy marriage. He walked away because he struggled with not connecting to our daughter. He hasn't been in the picture in almost a year."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6t4jl	2019-06-29 02:12:23		AITA for not covering my coworker’s shift	"If it matters, I work at an ER. We work 3 “12 hour” shifts a week. Our shifts are often more like 13-14 hours, sometimes even 15 or 16.

There was also recently an outbreak of a stomach virus and quite a few of my coworkers had to call in sick because of it.

One of my coworkers, “Liz,” lives by herself and has pets. She isn’t into romantic relationships and doesn’t want kids which is a little odd, but not a big deal.

However, I have kids and my wife has to sometimes travel for work. She was going to take my kids to the dentist, but had to travel at the last minute. I tried to find some coworkers to cover my shift. Liz turned it down because she partied and was hungover. At least someone else agreed to (this was before the virus outbreak).

Liz agreed to work on a day off because so many people were out sick. The night before, she asked me to cover her shift and said she was at the emergency vet with her pet that appeared to have internal bleeding. I said no, she wouldn’t cover mine, I wouldn’t cover it. Apparently no one agreed to and quite a few people were out sick.

Liz got a warning and the other staff who worked that day were annoyed with me and said that I was being petty. Apparently it was busy that day and they said they really could’ve used an extra hand.

But I didn’t realize so many people were out sick and if Liz won’t help me out, I won’t help her out. I also doubt she actually asked others to cover it and just wanted to make me look bad.

Background info: I’m 14M and just graduated middle school. I’m overweight and need to get fit. I have parents who make me do a lot of unnecessary cleaning and it gets really damn annoying because at first it was just cleaning the toilet, but now it has become, “ Wash my car, clean the shower, bathtub, toilet, sink, and floor, help me with 90% of the cooking, fold the clothes, and much more. It’s summer vacation and summer camp doesn’t start yet.

TL;DR on the bottom

So today I was sweeping and mopping the house but I was getting tired of doing this every week so I intentionally did it really slowly and made my father mad. I also pissed him off before because he was trying to take away my computer. He was sitting on a couch watching youtube on his phone and I was cleaning the two-thirds of the entire house. I never get to go out so I thought, I’m sick of doing random shit every day and only getting an hour or two of computer time. So I got the brilliant idea of going outside to meet my friends and play some Pokémon GO. 

I finished the cleaning and then make a scene by walking out the door. My father even saw me but he just asked where I was going to which I responded, “ I’m just going to walk around. I also remembered there were some books to renew so I brought my library card.

So I go out to renew some library books, meet some friends, and have a blast playing on our phones together for a few hours. I get some exercise in because of walking for a few hours. There are only benefits in me going outside. My mom calls me during that time to confirm that I’m safe and whatever. So then I go home. 

When I come home, my father ignores me. When I say hello to him, he just says, “ I don’t know you. You’re just a stranger.” I’m like, wtf? It turns out that he was mad as fuck because I went out and now he’s ignoring me and acting like I’m a stranger. The wifi password has been changed. When I ask him for the password, he says, “ I don’t know you. Get out of my room. I pay for my own wifi.” I overhear him saying that I’m somehow lazy even though he’s the one sitting on his ass playing his phone. I even renewed library books while I was outside. Walking around and becoming a sweaty tryhard is not lazy. It is in fact the opposite. I’m in bed using my data to type this. What did I do wrong? AITA for going outside on summer break to have some fun with friends?

TL;DR : I go out to play with friends but when I come home my dad ignores me because he thinks I’m lazy and evading chores just to look at my phone all day.

She says he knows I exist so it wasn't a date but as someone who's seen how some guys think, I was a bit reluctant because I didn't know this guy at all.

c6t28t	2019-06-29 02:05:46		AITA: For being a bad friend?(22F)	"I have this one friend named Cat she's 30 I'm 22. We met through mutual friends. She always has drama at work and never likes her boss. She changes jobs every year. She sometimes gets in arguments with her roommates where she ends up crying because they aren't as clean by her standards. Sometimes I make plans with her to go hiking on the weekend.

We’ll make plans for one then she won't text me the day of until five saying ”sorry I slept in” she's done it about three times to me. She just doesn't set the alarm because ”she knows she’ll wake up.” I always seem to be doing only what she wants to do. We went to a restaurant I loved, and she said we could never go back because they took the pasta she likes off the menu.

She makes comments about the way I look and my personality. I told her I was harassed and bullied so severely in high school. She has made comments about how my hair looks fake and overprocessed. I go to school and sometimes work as a freelancer. She's made comments to me sometimes when we hang out like ”SOME OF US have work in the morning”

She says I ask too many questions because usually when I see my friends, I want to know what's going on in their lives. She doesn't ask many about me. I've gotten upset about her questions comments, but a mutual friend who I used to date says ”she probably thinks you ask too many questions or talk too much because she never stops talking about herself.” she's made comments like ”you either say nothing or express too much Love you though.”


I sometimes binge drink when I'm stressed. I don't drink everyday or most weekends. I've been trying to cut drinking out of my life because I don't want to become a problem drinker. I see a therapist two times a week and always talk to my family about it.She's made comments about my drinking like ”oh my God your out of control and thank God your not drinking this weekend.” she also tries to baby me in front of people and take away my drink even if I'm having one beer. She smokes weed every single day.



When I ask her to do stuff, I love like going to the movies, she always says no and makes passive aggressive comments about how I should stop asking her about it. I've gone to six different concerts she likes even though I've never listened to those bands to be supportive. In the last couple of months, I've become silent and walked out when she's made passive aggressive comments because I don't want to go off and say mean things to a friend, so I storm off and go home.



She recently made a group chat sharing an old photo of my friends and me. I'm blackout drunk in the photo, and it's very embarrassing. I texted her to not post shit like that. She said she didn't think anything of it before she posted because it was a nice picture. I just said whatever. I hadn't talked to her in a couple of weeks, and she texts me about how our relationship didn't stay healthy, and she doesn't want to stay friends anymore.

At first it was a small family (maybe 4 people). Now it seems they have 7-10 individuals circulating throughout their house daily. They home 6 cars in their driveway (is only supposed to hold 3-4 cars) at all times and 2 more on the side of the block and an ice cream truck. My driveway is parallel theirs and I have one vechile but my driveway could home 3 cars if need be. I also like to have the space for visitors since I live in a busy area. My neighbors also recently cleaned up their yard and added some mulch and whatever. They threw their big branches in my yard for some reason, but I don't have any trees in my yard at all. So I knew it was them. Anyways back to the point, they have visitors who constantly park behind me and when i ask them to move their vehicle they pretend they dont know English or respond that theyre new tenants and dont know any better. WITA if I take those branches and put them on the property line so they don't park behind me anymore? I want to just throw them in their yard but I figure this would put them to better use. I've also thought about using fluorescent spray paint to highlight the property line but my partner thinks this is all too much and I'm just being over the top.

"My wife and I decided years ago that we would live a lifestyle that doesn't scream ""RICH"" to our kid before we even had him. We together make high 6 digit figures and obviously, rent/expenses are taken care of and we have nothing to worry about, but we're not going to go to some fancy restaurant and splurge on hundreds of dollars of food a night. He's 7 now, and we don't buy him everything he asks for. Maybe a console on christmas. A single video game on his birthday. We don't want him growing into a spoiled brat not thinking about his future and living on parent's money.

We sometimes put on an act in front of him, and tell him we're living day by day and we should be thankful for what we have. We want to try to instill in him that money is a precious thing. But recently, he told his friends. He said we're just getting by, and his friends told their parents, and that's when the issue happened. The parents obviously knew how well we were off, and several of them started whispering behind our backs, then in front of us. How we're looking down on others actually not well off and how fake we were. I can see a rip between the community and my household.

Am I the asshole here? I just wanted my kid to grow properly and be less materialistic than what he can be.

UPDATE: After a serious discussion with wife reading through the comments, we decided to have a sitdown with our son. We talked about the value of money, how we were doing fine, and he didn't have to worry a bit. We don't want him to grow up thinking we're liars

I want to clear some things up though even though it doesn't matter at this point. I never said the word ""poor"" once to him. When I say ""day by day"" I meant in terms he could understand. For example, when we go grocery shopping, he'll bring a snack and we'll say how if we buy that, we can't buy food then so he'd put it back. This isn't to say we never bought him things. We buy him snacks, clothing, and anything that could be considered luxury goods for a kid. I thought we never said it in a way for him to be stressed, but I guess we were wrong.

So today I told my employer of a year that I'm probably going to be taking on a part time (5 hours a week, give or take) gig on the side doing some mostly online work for another business owner (not competition, not even in the same business really). The hours at my job fluctuate so it's normal for employees here to have a couple different things going on. He told me that he knew said business owner, and got quiet for a second. ""Between you and me, that guy is kind of a dick. I'd appreciate it if you didn't work for him,"" he said. This answer frustrates me but I keep my mouth shut, because I really like my job and my boss. After a little while he apologizes for saying that and says I have his blessing to take the gig. He finally goes on to elaborate and tells me the story of why he has this opinion of the other business owner. Now remember, I have only been working for this guy for a year and have only lived on this side of the country for 3. Goes without saying I did not know either party involved when this went down. 

Apparently 15+ years ago, the other business owner (I'll call him S) had been a client at my boss's (we'll call him D) old business. One night, S left his wallet behind and D found it the next morning in the mailbox. D saw it was S's wallet and called him up. When S came to get it, he got angry, saying that there was a bunch of cash missing from the wallet. D had no idea what he was talking about, he had found the wallet as is. Strange that it was in the mailbox for sure, but he just figured someone found it in the parking lot and put it there. Still, S goes on to accuse D or one of his employees of stealing the cash, and their relationship ends. D still holds a grudge obviously but from what I can tell S does not feel the same way. I've only spoken to him over the phone but when I told him who my current employer was he said ""oh yeah I know him, tell him I said hi."" 

Fast forward to now, I'm just trying to make ends meet and have a little side cash and this beef that has nothing to do with me and is kinda silly IMO is giving me a bit of a moral dilemma. At the end of the day D gave me his blessing and I assured him my taking this gig is not a slight against him in any way, just a side hustle. But I still have the choice to back out of the interview.

"I moved in with my current roommate in April of 2017 to a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom  house in a decent neighborhood. He was single at the time and we seemed to get along pretty well for that time. He met his current girlfriend at a music festival that following August. She was living with her then ex-boyfriend and needed a place to go since it was awkward for her to be dating him while still living with her ex. I agreed as long as she paid her 1/3 of bills and she had said that it was temporary until she found her own place. 

Time went on and she didn’t find anything for herself and needed more time. I agreed as long as she kept paying her 1/3. That extension was back in the summer of 2018, almost a year after she had moved in, and nothing else has been said about it since then. 

About a week ago my roommate and I got into a argument and it escalated into a shouting match and name calling and I usually don’t get mad, but I also don’t like to be called names like “little boy” and have passive threats like “keep pushing me and see what happens”.

c6spx7	2019-06-29 01:31:25	Faal_Zoor_Kriid	WIBTA If I post a negative review on my work’s ad.	"This is pretty long and I had to cut stuff because of the character limit so TLDR; I want to post a negative review on my current work’s indeed ad online because I feel the current managment is rather mediocre and some incidences make me feel any new hires should know.

Before I get into this, just a bit of context about my work. I work at a sub place, and we have a work group work chat.

My first incident was when I got back from school. I came back around the beginning of April and I never got my W-2. It never got sent to me and I came in and said I needed my paper work so I could do my taxes. I was told they would be put through and should recieve it soon. To make a long story short, I was very annoyed and never was contacted back about its progress in a timely manner (I had to keep following up on it myself), so when it came to being rehired, the assistant manager had to put in a good word for me to be considered to be taken back.

Fast forward to the other day and the manager puts a text in the group chat saying in his own words, “I frankly am getting tired of hearing that people... basically need to be babied at work... We are reopenning our indeed ad and I will just find new people and get rid of others. This is for everyone. From assistant manager position down to crew. If your not pulling your weight you will be gone.”

This kind of surprised me as I have never heard any serious problems about this. I could understand this from him if he mentioned this before, but we never were told this was an issue and this cropped up seemingly out of nowhere.

The funny thing is too the only thing the manager needs to worry about technically is scheduling and inventory, and he is struggling with that. We are always running out of things and he always complains we never have enough people yet someone is working literally one day in a given week or that a “request off” is simply just a request. I understand that some of this stuff is hard and yeah a request off is just a request, but when everyone is working part time, I feel there is no attempt to see from our level. And this coincides with my last point.

Today we get another text about shift covering. So I have a coworker who asked me if he can take my Wednesday shift last week. The manager was literally 2 feet from us and I told him and he said okay. The day comes and he forgot and was like, “can you come in early today.” I told him I was being covered and I already told him so ask my coworker. 

This week my coworker asked again. Now on my part I did forget to tell the manager and I own up to that, but the text we got today really f***ed me off. In his words, “Here is next weeks schedule... Please try to avoid switching shifts as much as possible. If you need to switch I must know about and approve all.” So now a request for someone covering is just a request. I feel this is directed at me and rather unnecessary. I wouldn’t care if he told me hey, let me know next time or something to that effect."	Not the A-hole	0	0	16.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

My husband and I are living in a... degrading cottage. The landlord doesn't seem very concerned over the leaking hole in the roof or constantly broken down toilets, so I'm pretty much over this place. But the rent is cheap and we're waiting to move for reasons.

We happen to be in the middle of a heat wave (predicted up to 107°f/42°c) and our AC units have been overworked. Two of three of them have been dripping water for the last 3 or so days, we have bowls under the worst one the catch most of the water, but it sits over a doorframe and has also been dripping into the framing at the top, into the actual doorframe and through the other side, which will probably end up causing serious damage over time (and encourage mold to grow which I suspect is already an issue in the house.)  The other one (drips so little I don't think my husband has even noticed) falls right onto the hardwood(ish) floor in another room. 

I would fully support using them less and being uncomfortable (without being unsafe), except my husband has a rare medical condition that makes him very sensitive to things like temperature. He gets horrible rash-like reactions that cause him a lot of pain. If we were to raise the temperature he would be extremely uncomfortable and probably unable to sleep. I'm not completely sure, but I think it could be dangerous for him, even at temperatures that for most people are just uncomfortable. 

So, AITA? Should I care more about this dudes property? And I making excuses so I can stay cool sans guilt? Thanks."	Not enough info	0	0	49.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6smlu	2019-06-29 01:22:13	Chip-girl	AITA for spraying a motorcycle behind me with windshield wash?	"-Disclaimer that I’m writing this on mobile-

On my way home earlier, I was at the end of a line of traffic that was staying 5-8 mph over the speed limit (at around 40-43mph). Not really going slow, but about average for what traffic does on this particular road. 

As I go, I hear a loud revving behind me and a motorcycle pops out of a side road behind me, and he is *right* on my bumper. I give him a minute, thinking maybe he just needs to figure out the speed that we’re all doing and he’ll back off soon. Nope, he never does. I’m guessing he’s maybe five-ish feet from me. I drive a fairly low car, but he was getting so close that his headlight kept disappearing down below my rear view window. 

After I figure out that he’s got no interest in backing off, I start to worry that he might hit the back of my car. He kept backing off a few feet, then revving it to get as close as he could. I know brake checking is illegal, and could have been especially dangerous in that situation, so I did the only thing I could think of: give him a spray of windshield wash. I didn’t douse him or anything. Just a quick half second sprits. He was wearing goggles, so I knew it wasn’t going to get in his eyes at least. Just annoying, and maybe he’d get the picture to back off. He flipped me off and backed up maybe ten feet, so I guess it worked? I felt mildly bad for doing it, but I didn’t want him running into the back of my car."	Not the A-hole	0	0	660.0	5.0	0.0	0.0
c6sl2v	2019-06-29 01:18:07	PlasmaReuse	WIBTA if I create a GoFundMe for my birthday party?	"I'm from LA and I want to rent a mansion with a pool in the Hollywood Hills for my birthday. This is mostly so I can have a place large enough to host everybody (probably 50+ people), as well as having a place for people to sleep who are coming in from out of town (Or just to black out if they don't want to go home).

I'm planning on paying for everything myself. The mansion, keg, food, etc. I expect it will be $1,500 to $2,000. This is a lot of money for me. 

Every year I tell everyone not to buy me any gifts. I don't care about that kind of thing. (My birthday is usually pretty low key). 

I was thinking that when I send the invites, I would have a link to a GoFundMe. I would remind people that I don't need a present, but if they're so inclined, they could pitch in on the Airbnb. I would even include a note saying you can contribute anonymously or whatever, and that it's totally optional. 

I would set the goal at maybe $500 or something. I don't expect people to pitch in enough to cover everything. Maybe like $10 - $20 each person who contributes, with many not doing so. 

I think it's low pressure and realistic, but my friend said it's douchey, and that this kind of thing has negative connotations. 

So, WIBTA?

Edit - So just to address a theme I keep seeing from the YTA folks. 

1) I can afford it. I don't need a GoFundMe to cover the cost of it. 

2) The reason I can afford it is because I have been saving for this part for about 10 months. That's why I said that this is a lot of money for me. 

3) Someone suggested that since I can afford it I should donate the money to charity. I have one charity I donate to on a monthly basis. If people contributed $500, that is several months of savings for this party that could be offset, which would be really useful to me, as I'm sure it would be to many of you. I'm not rich. I'm not making 6 figures or anything. I saved for a thing so I could have all my friends and family in one place.

Edit 2 - So I've really seemed to enrage a lot of people. I think many of you think I'm already an asshole for even considering it. I don't think there is anything that could be said to change your minds about that. I think some of you have even concluded that I am a fundamentally bad person. It seems the verdict will likely be that IWBTA. 

That said, I would like to expand a bit:

This party isn't about ""celebrating ME"", as some of you have assumed. 

I'm getting older. I'm feeling nostalgic. I had a childhood friend die this year. Time is feeling more and more finite. There are people who I love, who I talk to and text every day, that I haven't seen on years. As time goes by, more and more people leave LA and scatter to the winds. 

This party is about bringing people together. People who I haven't seen in years, and people who haven't seen each other in years. 

People have expressed to me an interest in visiting me for my birthday, but LA is expensive and my apartment is small. I can't accommodate everyone who wants to visit. Hence, renting the huge house so everyone can stay. 

I have been saving for ten months, fully intending to pay for this all myself. These people have expressed concern about the cost of a hotel if they came to visit. If I rent this mansion, I will be saving about ten people hundreds of dollars, each, in hotel costs. 

Even if they pitch in $20 that they would have otherwise spent on a gift for me, despite me telling them not to (they always do), they would save HUNDREDS on hotels. 

THAT is why I'm booking a mansion. Not prestige.

Only yesterday did the idea pop into my head to do a GoFundMe. Before that, I spent ten full months saving thousands of dollars to bring friends together who haven't seen each other for years, using my birthday as an excuse for the occasion. I did this fully intending to pay everything by myself. 

But, because I dared to let the idea of spreading the cost of this out cross my mind, it seems I am an irredeemable asshole - to some of you, at least. 

Enough of the YTA camp have politely pointed out that it would be poor form, that I think I agree with them. I don't think I'll do a GoFundMe at this point. 

For the YTA people who are very hateful - I'm not mad at you. You can't help what inspires rage and I did put myself out there. 

For the NTA people - Thanks for understanding. It was a pleasant reprieve from all that hate."	Asshole	0	0	37.0	15.0	0.0	0.0

c6skra	2019-06-29 01:17:16	catalinageorge34440	AITA for telling my cousin to put his dreams on hold to take care of his kid?	"My cousin got a girl pregnant and hid it from the family until she gave birth, including his own father. They weren’t together, just a one-night stand. (Btw, it's been confirmed that the baby is his, they did a DNA test before his name was put on the birth certificate.) My cousin sees the kid, but right after the baby was born, he started doing a lot more gigs with his band. He went to college for music and is a great singer, along with an amazing guitarist. I can see him making it big someday. Since he’s not huge, he’s not making much money. Which is fine, he’s in his late 20s. When it was just him, he could do what he wanted.

However, now he has a kid. The mother of the baby is going through some stuff that she needs to take care of and I know that’s not his problem. However, because of the baby, she’s struggled getting a job and she doesn’t have a huge support system. My uncle has been trying to help her out while my cousin is touring, so she can find work and provide for the baby. Meanwhile, my cousin isn’t contributing much if anything at all. He doesn’t talk about the baby to anyone, his music is his entire world. Everyone understands the baby was unplanned, but they feel like he isn’t taking it seriously. He and my uncle are not at all close, so my uncle feels like they can’t talk about it. And because the baby’s mother barely knows him, she feels weird going to him.

So, when I saw him the other night, I brought it up. I told him I was proud that he’s out here chasing his dream but he’s a dad now. I know this isn’t where he saw his life and all, though he’s got to make some choices and at least pay her some child support. He said he wanted to, but he doesn’t make much with his gigs. I said then maybe it’s time to hang up the guitar for a bit or just do gigs on weekends and get another job. He told me I just didn’t understand. I urged him to at least talk with the mother to work some stuff out because he was acting like a childless man and it wasn’t fair to anyone involved. He got pissed, told me that one day he’ll be able to provide more than enough and the conversation fizzled. My mom thinks I should’ve stayed out of the family drama.

I am currently attending a summer camp, and tonight we had a talent show. Our camp as about 15-20 or so Indian students out of around 60. They all went up and sang the national anthem. Before starting, they asked everyone to stand up. I refused to do so, because I personally believe that I'm not gonna stand for another country's national anthem. After singing, many of them were really angry at me, and came up to confront me. One of them slapped me in the face twice, while another said that I was disrespecting their culture by not standing up for their national anthem.

c6sk2i	2019-06-29 01:15:23	Thrilldew	AITA for not wanting to wait an over an hour to see a movie and insulting my depressed brother?	"Let me preface this by saying I am currently 17 and recently started working 48 hours and two jobs in order to save money before I go to off to college.

My brother is 25 and has recently moved back home and is living in our basement. He doesn't have a job and has not tried to look for one at all. He has struggled with depression in the past and went to therapy for help that my parents payed for. I love him to death and I felt really bad about what I said to him.

Today had been a particularly long day because I had to teach and work with some younger kids at a camp. My parents decided they wanted to go out for dinner with us and so we headed out. While at dinner I made conversation with the two of them but my brother was on his phone for half of the time. The food itself was great and I had a good time but then they all decided they wanted to go see a movie. After I looked up the time and saw the nearest one was still an hour away I was immediately discouraged but they still wanted to go ahead. So after driving over there and waiting in the car for a minute I got into an argument with all of them. I said I did not want to wait 40 minutes for it to start and then another 20 minutes for the previews just to see a movie I did not really want to see anyway. It ended with my brother sarcastically saying ""Thanks my name"" and agreeing to going home. I thought that would be the last of it but later on it ended up being brought up again and another argument broke out. My brother said that I was being incredibly selfish and so I said back ""that's easy to say when you have unlimited free time and then it got really quiet and nobody said anything on else until we got home. I feel really bad about it but I literally never make anything about me and I couldn't stand it anymore. So reddit, AITA.

She abandoned me when I was a baby, choosing drugs over a child, and left me to live with someone who abused me my entire childhood. She's tried to make amends over the last 15 years and our relationship now is ok. I'm now married with kids of my own and she sees us about once every few months. She recently invited us along on a trip for 4th of July. But here's the kicker. She's in a polyamorous relationship, which I have no problem with people doing that, but I can't stand her boyfriend. He's been abusive toward her in the past, both physically and emotionally, and I've never liked him even though they've been together over a decade. I dont allow him, or his wife and her other partner, around my kids and I never will. Plus, my kids don't really understand the whole dynamic of what they have going on. My oldest is 12 and kind of gets it and it makes him uncomfortable. The trip would be my mom, mom's bf, his wife, wife's bf, me, my husband, and our three kids. I told her no and that if she likes, maybe later this summer she could come with my family somewhere for the weekend just us. She then offered to just take the kids and again I told her no. She doesn't have much experience with children and I have a toddler and a special needs child. They've never been alone with her so I'm not about to just ship them off for the weekend. Now she's pissed and is saying the only reason I don't like him is because I'm racist (she's white, he's black) which is clearly not the case. He could be a purple alien from Mars and I wouldn't give a shit as long as he was good to her. I don't approve of her relationship but she's a grown woman and can make her own choices. I've also had to speak to her before about the things she says in front of the kids, mostly sexual things and some outright lies, and how inappropriate they are. I don't know what else to do anymore. Should I just suck it up and go? She's offering to pay for everything because she knows money is tight for us and it would be nice to have a vacation since we haven't been on one in years but I don't really want to go under these circumstances. Am I really such a horrible daughter? Or should I just stick to my guns and say no. I don't want to further strain our relationship but idk what to do anymore.	Not the A-hole	0	0	94.0	9.0	0.0	0.0

c6si8l	2019-06-29 01:10:14	totalcontrol	AITA for asking my sister to pay for something she didn’t break? Yet...	"Background: I’m a military member who had to take a remote assignment to the pacific and had to pack my household goods in storage for one year. 

So last year as i was storing my household goods my sister asked if she could borrow my treadmill. I didn’t give it much thought and told her as long as she picked it up and delivered it back when I returned that would be okay. 

About 7 months later she calls me and says that she was having her 17 year old son (my nephew) deliver the treadmill to my nieces house and hour away and her ran his truck into the ditch. The truck wasn’t totaled but did about 3k damage to the front in while the treadmill was “strapped in the back of the truck”. 

She said the “the treadmill took no damage and works fine” that she was just letting me know. 

Now here is where my question lies. I explain to her that I paid 1200$ for the treadmill and that it was only a few months old when I let her borrow it. I asked that she pay me 500$ for it when I returned as that would give her ample time to set the money aside. 

I explained that even if the treadmill works fine at the moment that if and when she returned it the motor or any other part broke 1,2, 3 or 6 months down the line there would be no way to know if it was caused by the wreck or not. 

She agreed begrudgingly and stated in later conversations that “I wish I’d never said anything” and that “I’m being ridiculous about the whole thing”

Now, I never agreed to let my niece use it, I don’t know if it is even damaged and if this causes a rift between us I’m completely prepared to just take a loss on the entire thing but I need to know AITA here?"	Asshole	0	0	1197.0	58.0	0.0	0.0

c6sgxh	2019-06-29 01:06:37	throwaway446798	AITA for being upset at my mom for failing to disclose that her new marriage could effect my financial aid?	"This might seem like a “obviously not the asshole” post, but hear me out.

Some backstory here: my mom recently got remarried to a guy that I cannot stand because she starting seeing him before her and my dad finalized their divorce. It caused a rift in our relationship, and things have been rocky between us for the past two months. I live with her, and we’re very close, but her new marriage has caused countless fights between us.

Today I took my mom out for coffee and we were chatting. I mentioned to her that my financial aid had come through, and that it was going to completely cover the upcoming school year. She congratulated me, and then said “I don’t know how much longer you’ll be getting financial aid.”

When I asked her why she would say that, she said that our new household income had risen because of her new marriage, and after next year I probably won’t be eligible for any financial aid. I asked why she hadn’t talked to me about this before the wedding, and she told me that she hadn’t thought about it.

I was upset because my entire college plan is based around the amount of aid I’ve been able to receive as a low-income student from a low-income household. We fought about it. When we got home, I stayed in the car to calm down. Once I had calmed down, I went inside to make myself food. I didn’t try to make any conversation, because I was still angry. 

Out of (what felt like) nowhere, my mom starts telling me that by not making conversation with her, I was not being civil. She said I was driving my siblings out of the house, and that she was going to leave because of the way I have been acting. Then she threatening to kick me out because she says that I have been making life for her miserable by fighting with her so often. 

I felt like my feelings were justified and I wasn’t wrong for being upset and arguing with her about it. She thought that I was being unreasonable and that I should have let it go and continued having a nice conversation with her. 

So, AITA?

Edit: I’m getting a lot of comments that suggest that I wouldn’t have wanted my mom to get married if it meant I lost my financial aid. That’s not at all what I meant. I just wished she would have talked with me beforehand so I was aware of how the changing income could affect me. Yes, I should have thought of it. But I didn’t. Also, I apologized to her for overreacting, because I see now that I did."	Not enough info	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I don’t like being confrontational but it’s been making me feel very frustrated that she doesn’t respect my time. I’ve sat her down and talked to her about it and she just brushes it off staying I’m being such a “mom”. Like if I ask you to come by at 6 for the gym, I will be ready to go by 6 WAITING FOR YOU. She will text me at 4:30 and say she’s getting ready and by 6:15 she’ll text me that she’s otw which takes her an additional 25 minutes even though she lives at the most 10 minutes away from my apartment. Then she comes in my apartment asking to do her hair and makeup even though she supposedly got “ready” at her apartment at 4:30. Like did it really take you an hour and 30 minutes to put on a shirt + leggings and some sneakers? And when I text her to hurry or be on time (I always am polite about it) she catches an attitude and ruins the mood for the whole day. 

At this point I just work out by myself or ask another friend to go with. I stopped inviting her out to do things because I just found it not worth the frustration anymore. I instead go out with other friends who show up on time. I went out to coffee with an acquaintance from work and she happened to see me there after not inviting her to anything after 2 months and confronted me at this quiet coffee shop causing a scene, she proceeded to text me afterwards calling me an asshole and sub-tweeting me calling me a “fake bitch”. I really just want an unbiased opinion on whether I was asshole or not. I’m gonna apologize to her regardless because I don’t want the friendship to end on negative terms. Thank you."

"Ok, weird attention grabby title to combat throwaway account nonclout out of the way- i’m 25F and my S.O is 27M. I am staying with my parents for an extended period of time but their house is pretty big- four bedrooms in the main house and a renovated basement with a bedroom, living room, bathroom and office. When I am home, I stay in the basement- the only thing I don’t have down here is a kitchen. 

SO and I have been together for around 4 years and have maintained an active and healthy sex life, but at the moment he is on another continent for a long work assignment. NBD- we’ve dealt with this before, never with me also being away from home and at my parents but it happens often enough that we know how to go about sexy time over the internet and be comfortable switching over from that to normal conversation. Tonight has left me completely and utterly dumbfounded. 

We had our usual evening (for me, early morning for him) FaceTime, we do the do and chat for about an hour. In that time I’ve gotten completely ready for bed- including washing my face and hands, changing into bed clothes and washing the toys to be put away. With him having not done any of that as he is still lounging in bed, but on FaceTime. I go upstairs with him on the phone to refill my water bottle and my parents happen to still be up- I checked to make sure he had his shirt on and looked what would be appropriate for someone just waking up & turned the phone around for him to say hello to my parents (normal for us, he knows they find it extremely disrespectful in our culture if my SO doesn’t greet them- even if it has to be adapted for modern tech and he’s from the same culture), refill my water bottle and go on back down to the basement. 

This is where I get a slew of expletives and general astonishment on his part as to how I could possibly be ok with him greeting my parents having just had sex and how I don’t feel disgusting and gross about it, he compares it to me inviting my parents into our bedroom immediately after having sex which I think is an exaggeration. He  cannot understand my side of the story (what they don’t know can’t hurt them, I had washed up and it would have been ruder for him to not greet them) and while I understand that he may be uncomfortable seeing my parents while in the after-state (and did apologize for that, I didn’t know they would be up) he didn’t say he had a problem with that, he specified his problem was with me personally not finding it gross to interact with my parents knowing we just had sex. I mean we’re adults and I had fully washed up. How long am I supposed to wait for the *stench* of sex to be off me before saying goodnight to my own parents and him saying hello over a phone screen?? It’s been a good few hours and we usually text nonstop after hanging up until I fall asleep but I have gotten radio silence. Who sucks?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I was volunteering with a pet groomer and my old boss, who is an animal control officer seen me walking home on a monday night and stop to tell me that he had a black pug. She was tied to a LCBO ( a place to buy alcohol,,, sorry if it isnt spelled right).

She was left there at 10 am till 6 pm. No food or water and very little shade. Her owners went into the store and when they came out the got into their truck and drove away. 

Well anyway my old boss held her for 7 days and had recived no phone calls about her. So thursday morning, he brought her into town and let me adopt her.. 

3 months later my old boss gets a call from a lady who just remembered she owned a black pug and didnt know where she left it.. My oldboss explained that the pug was already adopted. The lady was mad.. He gave me her number incase i wanted to give the pug back..

I did call the lady and explained that the pug was part of my family and i didnt want to give her up....the lady only wanted to breed her to another pug and sell puppies.. She said thats all dogs are good for. My bf loves the pug.

Am i the asshole for not returing the pug?. I still feel bad. They spent a lot of money on the dog.. But my bf and i fell in love with her."	Asshole	0	0	56.0	7.0	0.0	0.0
c6sec0	2019-06-29 00:59:33	wxrvynikp	WIBTA if I don't want to hear my best friend talking about her boyfriend anymore?	"My best friend and I are both college students. We go to different schools (she is in China) but we talk on the phone every now and then. 

She (21f) got together with her bf (32m) who is her teacher half a year ago. From what I hear, I think her bf is a terrible person. He is extremely arrogant and thinks he is better/smarter than everybody, and considers almost all of his students stupid. He boasts about things that are 10 years ago for him, like getting into a good law school or getting good grades at admission tests. He told his class he should be the best at English among all the people they know. He seems to need his ego boosted constantly, and literally compares his score to his students'. He is also pretty set in his own ways and does not adapt well to social norms. He is a petty, judgmental and controlling person. There are a lot of instances and examples of this that my friend told me.

The problem is, each time she is upset with him, she didn't let out her anger at him. The best she could do was tell him she doesn't want to talk. She just shows unhappiness but says nothing. Then she would get really upset or crying on the phone with me for hours. I would get all worked up and bash on her bf together with her. She was really, really upset in a lot of the calls, but after talking to me if her bf gives her any kind of apology at all she goes straight back to him without being upset anymore. I'm talking about an apology in the form of a single text. He would also say things like ""I can't help it, I'm a direct person"" or ""I'm not good with words"" in his apology. Which are shitty excuses.

She seems to have fallen into a pattern with him. He treats her like a child a lot of the times. He has a lot of power in this relationship and he seems to convince or influence her easily. My friend is not mature for her age and given their age difference, the relationship is very imbalanced. She knows it and talked about how she felt like this isn't how a relationship is supposed to be, but she likes him for some reason and never planned on leaving him. In fact, she wants to get married to him.

I really think this person is terrible, and that she had bad taste, but it's her choice and I won't mention my thoughts to her. But I would very much like to not hear about her bf anymore. I get emotionally strained hearing about this, and felt so frustrating when she cried to me for hours and then a single text of an apology fixed that. 

WIBTA if I subtly ask her to not talk about him so much? I would try to get out of phone conversations and when I meet her I could say ""we rarely see each other, let's not talk about our bfs"" ? I think I would be TA if I say this not so subtly, or say it at all. Also, AITA for thinking that this person is terrible? I know people have their advantages and flaws, but for me it's clear there are many red flags. I feel kinda bad that I do not really want to support her relationship.

My MIL is a crazy lizard lady, so like cats but lizards. She also lives in Vermont and saw a post about a iguana that needed a new home from Ohio. My husband has 2 siblings that live in Michigan. She was trying to get us to go get it for her. None of us wanted to drive 5 hours to get it and then another 14 to Vermont.

That's when she got mad. She's always emotionally abused and manipulated her kids. We were polite about it and told her no because it was a whim and lots of driving. My MIL will step over lines to make her kids feel like shit for telling her no. She messaged my BIL ""Tell (husband) I'm sorry I'll never get to meet the baby"" and other messages and pictures about hurting herself. She even went far enough to tell my husband the next time she goes to the doctor shes going to ask about dying with dignity. She's done things similar over less but I'm angry that she tried to use our baby to manipulate my husband to get a lizard.

I've been angry ever since. I never replied because it's what my husband wanted. She has been asking about more info and baby bumps pics and the such. We let her know it was a girl and the name we picked. My husband has 7 siblings so this isnt their first grandkid it'll actually be their 9th.

I suggested my mom hire a babysitter and she refused to do so overnight. I really think it’s because she doesn’t want to pay for someone and counts on me to do it for free.

We all get along fairly well, but they're a couple and the boyfriend can be extremely stubborn, to the point where he won't really take anyone's opinions into account except for my boyfriend's. 


He essentially gets the entire basement, part of an agreement with him and his gf because he doesn't like to clean up after himself. Whatever, I can ignore the cheese-covered couch and stuff. The main floor has been mostly unfurnished and today my bf and I bought a furniture set which included a TV stand. The girlfriend mentioned to me that she was tired of TVs; he has two massive ones in the basement and one in their bedroom that he talked her into putting there. I was neutral on having a TV in the room until she mentioned that she wants a nice place where we can sit, read, and chat around a coffee table. I mentioned it to my boyfriend and he said he was neutral. My roommate feels very strongly about this and I'm starting to agree with her.


Our roommate didn't like that idea when we mentioned it and flat out said no. We decided to give it a rest & came out later to grab the end tables and he told us to go back inside because they were discussing the TV issue. He's kinda scary when he's mad, so we go back in even though we probably shouldn't have. He's the type of person who can argue through anything and not take it personally, so he claims he told us to because he doesn't feel like he can argue with me without me taking it personally. 


Later he told his girlfriend that the TV is going there no matter what. His justification is that he didn't want to have his TVs and XBOXes in the basement to begin with and he doesn't like plants, but he puts up with them ""as a compromise"". He also wants a clean place where family can watch movies, but my opinion is that we don't need a TV to entertain & he can clean the basement if he really wants a place. I consider him a friend, but I'm at my wit's end dealing with this guy leaving his dirty socks everywhere & saying he ""doesn't do"" dishes/laundry/basic household chores and I honestly feel like we should be able to have a BIT of a say in where the stupid TV goes, but at the same time I feel like it's a small thing and we should give in, and he does put up with houseplants, but idk.

"My maid decided to bring her 10 year old son to my apartment today. I asked her if it’s alright if I gave him ice cream and she said no because he was sick/coughing. I told her that she shouldn’t have gotten him here if she knew he was sick and she said he’s better now but the cold ice cream might retrigger the coughs. I asked her if I could give him a snickers bar instead to which she agreed. 

Now to put things in context, the kid is bratty. His mother asked him to say “thank you” after I gave him the bar and he flat out ignored her multiple times until I told her it was alright, it’s just a chocolate bar. He was also playing a game on his phone which was super loud and ignored me when I asked him to mute it until his mother did. 

About 15 minutes after, he started coughing nonstop. The coughs felt so forced. I live in a small one bedroom condo. We have a long weekend coming and I have volunteering plans and other commitments and did not want to spend it at home sick. I decided to grab a chair and put it in the balcony and asked him to sit outside while his mom finished cleaning. 

I then repeated to his mother before I let him outside that she should have left him home with his dad if she knew he was sick. She said he wasn’t sick because he wasn’t coughing on the way here. His mother got upset with me for taking him outside to the balcony and told me she wasn’t coming again.

Coworker and I started in job together 3 years ago. On same team, became close. Have toddlers close in age. Have hung up outside of work a few times, text regularly, and talk every day at work. Have lunch at work together several times a week, nearly every day for over a year. 

Last year, when we got our performance raises, she accidentally saw my raise paper and was bitter that I got a slightly higher raise then her. She never stopped talking to me, but she struggles with money and I knew she was bitter about it because she brought it up sporadically over a year period. Refused to speak to our boss about it and just whines about it for a year.  Kept saying stuff like “it must be a mistake” etc when it wasn’t. Anyway, this is kind of important because in the months proceeding the raise issue, she had told me I would get invited to her son’s birthday party which was in the summer. 

I noticed in the months leading up to his birthday month, she quit mentioning it. Finally about 2 weeks before his birthday, I asked her point blank if she was having a party. She very hesitantly said yes, but that they were having it at her parents house and didn’t know if I would want to go. She then said, almost forcefully, that I could “still come if I wanted to”. I never told her I was bothered from that but I was, and no I didn’t go because I felt like she didn’t really want me there. 

So that was last year, and since then we are still close however I began to work at home a lot and our communication and seeing each other kind of waned. I then got a promotion (new department) a month ago (she had no interest in the position, so we were not competing). We still see each other because I’m in the same building, and have eaten lunch together a few times but it’s not every day. 

His birthday is coming up again. She had mentioned a few months ago wanting me to come to his party, and then a few days ago she was like “so (his name) birthday party is this weekend, I’m excited” and started talking about the plans. I got no invite. 

FWIW, I don’t have birthday parties for my kids and she knows that, so it’s not like she is retaliating. AITA for getting upset over this? Should I say something to her?


Edit : forgot to mention even though I don’t have parties for my kids, I do get them presents and cake and ice cream. Last year I texted this friend and told
Her a few days in advance she is welcome to come (no gift needed) with her son for cake and ice cream, and she declined."	Asshole	0	0	294.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

There is a lot of yard space but none of it has been grassed and there are no fences up yet. Our neighbor has 2 twin boys who I believe are 13 (but they are really tall and look older) and they are often playing soccer in the back yard. However they don't seem to care much about the invisible barriers between the 2 houses and basically play as if it's all one yard. I spoke to them about it and they very obviously rolled their eyes but did agree to move. However maybe a week later they did it again and I spoke to their parents about it who said they would talk to their sons about it. The boys stopped for a while but then after I came back from dropping my wife of somewhere (I was gone for a few hours)  I looked outside and saw a group of maybe 6 boys playing soccer in our back yard again.  I knocked on our neighbors door but their parents weren't home. I was tired of being ignored by them so I decided to call the cops to come and talk to the boys.

So the cops did eventually come and talk to the boys.  However, the next day I had a group of parents interrogate me about what I did and accused me of being racist and calling the police on their sons for no reason. I explained I just asked them to come and talk to them since they weren't listening to me about trespassing but they weren't hearing  it and said that they were just kids having fun. My wife also thinks I over reacted and said that I've made permanent enemies of my our neighbors now but I just think if the kids had just listened the first 2 times I wouldn't have had to resort to that."

We had known each other for a few years and she was the only person I felt I could trust, and she knew that. I actually had a crush on her and I accidentally confessed a while before shit went down and she said she felt the same way but needed time to figure out her feelings, then a few days later I found out she was dating some random person on the internet (so yeah she lied to me about that). Though it hurt me, I got over it and I tried to be happy for her. Fast forward a year or so and my group had a massive argument (there were 5 people in the group at this point, including me). I was not involved with the argument as I was not there when it happened but it was about some misheard conversation or something. R then ditched the group and quickly moved on. I still wanted to be friends with R but I also wanted to remain friends with the others. R started to hang out with this girl, I'll call her W. I didn't like W because she had picked on me in the past and she had ruined a past friendship I had with another girl I was also very close with. W was very touchy and manipulative as well. I told R that I wasn't comfortable sitting with her and W and R told me 'you don't have to sit with us', which broke my heart because I chose to sit with her at lunch instead of my normal friend group as a way of showing I still wanted to be friends with all of them. From then on, we stopped talking as much and W kept taking advantage of the situation. R then became friends with a girl who backstabbed her once and also a girl who was known to steal peoples things. A while later, I texted R basically telling her that I was sorry if I did anything wrong but I really wanted to remain friends. She agreed but we still didn't talk that much because she was always too busy with her new friends to have time for me. She would ignore me when I greeted her in the hallways or tried to have a conversation and so I texted her yet again. She told me that we shouldn't bother being friends if I was just going to continue to not speak to her, which made me a bit mad because I felt like I was the one being ignored, not her, and so I told her that. We ended up coming to an agreement that we should remain friends yet again, even though it didn't feel like we were. I asked her if she'd like to make up with the rest of my group and she rejected the offer as she was 'happier' with the friends she had at that time and said that everyone just made her feel uncomfortable. I decided I couldn't keep it up anymore because she basically said that I was just trash to her and so were my other friends. I stopped chatting with her and gave up on her. Should I not have done this? Was I an asshole for not trying hard enough? Was I an asshole for disliking her friend group?

I wear deodorant and perfume, I shower if I’ve gone out on a sunny day or if I did something to make me sweaty.

The problem lies in my parents telling me that I must at a minimum shower twice a day. I am 20f and I was told by them to think of living with them as if I’m a roommate since I’m only here on breaks.

I think that two showers minimum is excessive. Today my dad asked if I showered this morning (I hadn’t because I showered last night and I was going to be sailing like three hours later and be disgusting). I told him the truth and he gave me a lecture on it.

He told me my pimples are from that even though I generally don’t have pimples unless I’m stressed out (which I have been).

Idk.. on one hand yeah they’re my parents but I was told to think of living here like I’m a roommate. I think obsessively searching through my stuff and criticizing my every move is wrong and creepy. (They went through my drawers “looking for hangers” even though all of my free hangers are clearly visible)

I plan to continue showering when I feel it is right instead of obsessively showering every time I’m going to leave the house. Even though this could potentially cause them to scream at me for “being disgusting”.

There are about 10 people in total, ranging from parents, grandparents, aunts/uncles, cousins. They get a good deal: unlimited data and cheap because there are so many. 

I am on a solo plan. I pay about two times as much as they do for comparable plan. I’ve been asked if I’d like to join this large family plan several times, but obviously always said no. No one cares that I don’t join and I’m not pressured, but they just ask here and there. 

Now, saving $30-40 per month would be nice, but it’s not worth it to me... I eat well. The person running the plan is trustworthy and would always be on time with bills, but I don’t like the idea of someone else being in charge of my day to day life and bills. In short, I want to be the one in control of my sh*t.

c6s6zd	2019-06-29 00:39:49		AITA for threatening to throw out my roommate	"I have lived with 3 people for a year. Miranda, John, and Skylar. Skylar and John have been dating for 2 and half years. Before they moved into the apartment Miranda, John, and Skylar lived together. In that time, John had cheated on Skylar with another girl. Miranda was there for all this and she was uncomfortable with John after this but still moved in with them.

At first everyone was getting along until John started getting angry and Skylar over random shit and was verbally abusive. As time went on we stopped hanging out as much but still tried to be cordial at least. Then around winter break, Skylar and I had went home. Miranda was also supposed to go home but she decided to stay to wait out the winter storm that was coming. John did not realize that and brought home a drunk girl. Skylar texted Miranda asking if something was going on with John because he wasn't responding to her and she was worried. 

So after that situation, Miranda and I are just absolutely repulsed by John and don't even bother with being cordial and just avoid him. As you can imagine, this made for a very tense situation. On top of that Skylar is paying his rent and buying all the groceries and John ends up owing her $3000 (which he hasn't paid a cent of and never will). Miranda and I and everybody else have told Skylar that he is a shit person and a shit boyfriend but it lands on deaf ears.

Eventually John gets a subleaser named Amanda. But neither of them signed anything so they basically have a verbal agreement but are breaking the lease. Simultaneously, John continues to stay here with Skylar. So there are now 5 people in our apartment. 

Recently, I was swiping on tinder and guess who shows up? So I screenshot John's profile and showed Skylar. At the same time, John tells her he's going to his uncle's house to help him. Then it becomes him going to celebrate his uncle's birthday. When it's not even his uncle's birthday. And then it becomes him hanging with his friend instead. 

5 days later, Skylar is saying she's not sure about the relationship but she wants to wait a bit. At this point I'm just done with this shit. I tell her he's breaking lease and I want him out so I can finally live in an apartment that isnt filled with tension and arguments. 

And while that all is true, I also just want to show her that she can be much happier without him being shitty to her. It's so depressing seeing someone who obviously has severely low self-esteem and real self image problems get taken advantage of so fucking much. She's being willfully ignorant and it's incredibly painful to see.

c6s5k8	2019-06-29 00:36:01		WIBTA for filing a police report on my ex	"Short back story here. 
Me, 26, I have a successful career and live independently . 
Ex, 23 works at a salon. Her and her parents live at her aunts home. 

There have been a few times when she was short on cash when she would ask if she could use my credit card to make a payment on her serious radio account or cell phone bill because she doesn't have a credit card and she didnt want to ask her mother. 
I told her she could use it, and told her she should really sign up for a card to start building her credit. She paid me back in cash.  Same conversation happened several times while we were together making me believe she didn't save the card to her account. 

Things end between us 08/2018


Fast forward to today 6/28/19 when I'm going through my credit card statement to figure out how much I paid for a recent vacation and I see a charge for serious radio, normally nothing new as I have it in my vehicle but this was for an entire year a 140 something charge. 

I call serious, they're able to confirm that charge wasn't on my account and looked up accounts using my credit card. 

Turns out she had been using my credit card to pay for her serious radio for the last 14 months. And this month she got a new vehicle and charged the 12 months in one shot .   

Subtracting the months we were together while this was unknowingly going on she charged me $385 of that the latest $140 something charge was refunded by the company. 

 I tried texting her explaining what I found and asking if she could pay me back for my credit card she's been using.  
No response from the text. 

My friends are torn, some say to just let it go and forget about it but my current gf and my good friend who's a sheriff both think I should press charges. 
It's not the dollar amount that pisses me off it's that she knowingly charged my card for months thinking she could get away with it. 
She always lived paycheck to paycheck so I find it hard to believe she forgot how her serious radio kept working without her paying it.
She also added 3 vehicles to that account. The latest one was charged the year up front which is how I noticed something was up.  
I know I should have found it sooner. I usually glance through my statements and the serious charge didn't stick out much because of they way they were staggered in the month. I thought maybe they took a payment a week early or late for that month. I should have figured it out sooner but the question is. 

Would I be the asshole for filing a police report for this?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6s4p8	2019-06-29 00:33:46		AITA for suggesting my friend not come to the amusement park?	"Little bit of background first. Every summer, four friends and I go to the amusement park. One of these friends is afraid of heights, and will not ride any rollercoasters. We've pushed for him to try it, but he is adamant that he is afraid of heights and has no interest in conquering this fear. This is fine, no one is judging. For reference, this is a tiny amusement park where the primary form of entertainment is coasters. There’s not much else besides an arcade. 

However, he will always come with us anyway, and then sit by the ride gate for over an hour while we wait in line. We asked him to wait in line with us, but even the loading platform is too high for his fear. Even if he can't see off the side, knowing he's that high is enough. Then he'll walk with us for 5 minutes to the next coaster, and then sit by the gate for an hour again. Rinse and repeat until we're ready to go home or take a food break. This would be fine but then he will mope and pout the entire time we're at the park because he has to sit by the gate while we wait in line for the ride.

Last summer, the other friends and I pitched the idea of doing something extra that summer that he can participate in, and then maybe we can go to the amusement park without him and we won't have to just sit around in the sun for hours while we ride coasters. Keep in mind that we hang out around once a week, but usually just going out to eat. 

So I told him ""we are going to [amusement park] on [date] . You are more than welcome to come, but I feel like you shouldn't since you don't ride roller coasters."" He got offended at how I could possibly invite and not invite him at the same time. I iterated that he can come if he wants and that we would be happy to have him, but everyone feels bad that he just sits on the ground by the gates while we ride the coasters. 

I wanted to ask him for ideas for another event this summer, but he had already stormed out of my house in a rage. 

We never heard from him again. He wouldn’t respond to texts or phone calls. I ran into him at the store the other day, a year later, and he was friendly, but the whole conversation was awkward. I was talking to my mom about it since it came back to memory and she said we were huge assholes to him for suggesting he not go.

I’m in the changing rooms waiting for a shower, it’s still really humid, I’m carrying two bags and sweating. There was a woman behind me with her friend and around 5 kids, 2 of those were screaming, I was just wanting to get out of there and was so close to offering them to go before me but I was next in line and my boyfriend was already clothed and waiting on me so I just wanted to get out as quick as possible and back to the hotel. Next thing I know the woman says to her friend ‘I’m sure the girl in front won’t mind if we go before’ and I said no because I had been waiting, she then began ranting how she had kids who where sunburnt (unsure of how that was my problem) and were tired, at this point I was just staring, I was thinking she wasn’t serious but she genuinely tried to jump in before me when the next shower became available, however I managed to get in and by the time I came out she was in another shower.

I speak English (duh), however I'm trying to learn her language (kinda how we met), but I really suck at it. She lives a country with really high English speaking rates and her English is so good she occasionally corrects my grammar, her brother is younger and his English isn't as good but it's still great imo. We're long distance so we play games online a lot and most of the time when we video chat she's in her brother's room because the wifi is better there so we all end up talking and playing video games. Sometimes when we video she just ends up speaking with her brother in their native language leaving me awkwardly sitting there. Whenever us three play games, usually minecraft, her and her brother barely speak English so I feel kind of left out when they're out exploring or whatever and I have no idea what's going on. A couple times she's asked me why I haven't been talking and I straight up said it's because I can't add anything to the conversation when I don't know the language. She said she's sorry and doesn't really notice she does it and it's just natural for them to speak to each other in the language they're most familiar with (understandable) but I'm kind of tired of sitting there awkwardly so I've been thinking of asking her to try to make an effort to speak English but I wouldn't want to come off as an asshole.

"So basically I loaned my brother and mom $200 to be able to make it through the rest of the month. At the time they were both adamant that it was a loan that they would pay back when my mom got her paycheck, but today she got paid and now they're both telling me that they won't pay me back. 

I also just graduated college and am working an AmeriCorps job (which pays roughly $200 a week) until I start a Fulbright at the end of next month. When I took the job, my mom was clear that I wouldn't have to pay rent because it was only for the summer and that's what family does. But at the same time my mom and (younger) brother have this very strange relationship where they act like a married couple while my brother controls the finances and takes the car whenever he wants. It's very strange. 


When I asked if they would pay me back he started berating me and saying that I was a college graduate who shouldn't be working for AmeriCorps, that I was a failure (I have a Fulbright lol), that I was fucking disgusting, and that I was a leech. My mom gave her usual response of acting like she couldn't believe what he was saying, and my brother told me that I don't even pay rent and that he would do a calculation to see how much money I owed him for gas, rent, and food. He's 20 and I'm 22. 


I was clear from the beginning that I was happy to just give it to her since I'm living at home for the next little while, but she insisted that she would pay it back. AITA for wanting to be paid back given the situation?

The next day the manager is pissed at me for leaving work 'early' when theres still work to be done. She had to stay back until 1:30 in the morning to finish. 

I told her that I am allowed to finish at that time and that its company policy. I understand it may not be entirely ethical, but its a soul sucking job and pay isn't great.

c6rxkc	2019-06-29 00:15:10		AITA for not acting grateful for something I didn't want?	"Ok, so some back story: I'm 32F and have a long-term FWB (2 years, friends for a lot longer, he's 29). Him and I recently went through some challenges in the friendship. It's a complicated story but essentially he did some messed up things and has since apologized. I forgave him and we moved on.

He's been really depressed lately and I've been the only person he's felt comfortable venting to. It's been a lot of hand-holding, and conversations that last hours, etc. I have no problems being part of his support system. However I'm going through a lot in my own life and this issue him and I have had made my life hell for the past month or so. 

Today he calls me just to talk and seems cheerful. But I told him it might not be the best time since I was having a really bad day and feeling pretty emotional. (I had a flashback-nightmare from a past trauma which left me anxious and depressed.) He asks if I want to go somewhere to cheer me up. I get a tad bit agoraphobic when I'm 'triggered' and it gives me anxiety. I told him this and that I was just going to stay home today but he's more than welcome to come here. He says ""I want to do whatever it takes to cheer you up"" which is something he *never* does. He starts talking about food and he says it will be his treat. So after some back and forth we settle on him picking us (daughter, 7, and me) up and getting the food and taking back to my house and hanging out there. 

He arrives but he has his nephew with him. (Which isn't abnormal but he just didn't mention it.) We get in the car and the kids are chatting so I turn to Friend and say ""Is he coming with us back to the house, or are you dropping him off?"" and Friend says ""Oh IDK we'll just play it by ear."" Weird, but okay?

So after getting the food he turns to me and says ""Well, am I dropping you off at home or are you coming with us?"" I told him I thought we were hanging out at my place for a bit and he's like ""Well we can hang out while I go do XXXX or you can get dropped off. It's up to you."" and so I said home and he looked a little relieved which kind of hurt my feelings.

So we get home and I say thank you and get out of the car. I didn't look at him or say good-bye because honestly I'm in a shit mood and now I'm annoyed that I've wasted my time doing something I didn't want to do. I mean the food was cool but it's not what I would have picked for myself and I definitely wouldn't have left the house.

And I feel a little disappointed that ""whatever **you** want"" turned into ""whatever **I** want"". I'm a pretty easy-going person so I don't really mind most of the time but it seems like I've been giving a lot of time and emotional support to making him feel better but now he can't take 2 hours for me? 

But now that I'm home I'm thinking about the events of today and I'm feeling guilty. I'm sure that me just going inside without saying bye and him paying for something just to have me (seemingly) pout about it makes me look like an asshole. Am I an asshole?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6rxbm	2019-06-29 00:14:32	BriefElderberry1	AITA for not inviting my friend to group outings?	"I've known my group of friends since middle school (we're now late teens-early 20s) and we're all super close to each other. We all go to the same college. I met this girl (I'll call her Jenna) my second year of college and we hit it off instantly. A month or so into the friendship she revealed she has social anxiety and has a very hard time making friends. To help ease her into being more comfortable around people I introduced her to my group of friends and she took a liking to them. Soon after, I considered her part of the group and she started hanging out with us more, and she became more comfortable and started showing more of her real personality. She started becoming more vocal about feeling left out since we often talk about people from our hometown. I told her that she wouldn't understand since she hadn't known us as long as we've known each other and we'd like to keep our lives back at home just among us.

As time went on, a guy in our group (I'll call him Frank) said that he didn't like Jenna since she doesn't really fit in with us. For as long as we've been friends, if someone didn't like another person being around, we'd exclude them from the group out of respect for our friend. That's the way it's always been. I still like Jenna and so does everyone else, but we all agreed that she just didn't mesh with the group as a whole. If I could, I would just invite her when Frank wasn't around, but Frank always throws a shit fit whenever we hang out without him, so we figured cutting Jenna off was the better bet. 

Fast forward to several months later, I run into Jenna and she wants to talk. She wanted to know why everyone suddenly stopped hanging out with her and why I haven't been responding to her messages. I was honest and told her that Frank doesn't like her and we want to respect his feelings. She went from 0 to 100 and exploded on me. She started calling me and everyone else weak and immature for letting Frank control who they can and can't hang out with. But the thing is, it's not about control. I've known Frank for nearly a decade, so obviously I'm going to consider him and the others over a girl I met just shy of a year ago."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6rw9r	2019-06-29 00:12:14	Sinna85	AITA for not wanting to hug my friend when she told me she had lice	"So a few days ago a close friend I hadn't seen in a while came to visit. I was very excited to see her so I when we met I immediately went over and gave her a long and tight hug. When we were finished hugging she jokingly says something like ""Hey, careful, I have lice lol"". 

I thought she was joking at first, but she quickly assured me that she was in fact serious, and that she had found out earlier that day that her sibling had given her lice. My immediate reaction was to quickly move away from her, and to say I wish she'd told me before we hugged, which she just laughed off.

For the rest of the dinner I made sure I was far away as I could while still being able to hold a conversation, and I made a note to myself immediately get lice shampoo and thoroughly wash my hair. Maybe I'm being extreme, but I have very dense and thick hair, and I had lice as a kid which was a NIGHTMARE to get rid of and kept coming back because of my younger sister and ever since just the idea of getting it again as an adult is horrifying.

We hung out in a group for the rest of the night, and I made sure to keep my physical distance, which I'm sure she noticed, because I'm usually pretty affectionate with my close friends. When it came time to say our goodbyes I was also VERY reluctant to give her a hug goodbye, and I could tell she was hurt, especially because this was probably the last time in a while we're going to be able to see each other. 

I felt bad for not being able to give a proper goodbye to such a good friend, but I was already starting to feel the itching on my head (which I'm sure I was imagining but freaked me out nonetheless), and was even slightly annoyed she didn't bother to tell me she had lice until AFTER I had come into very close contact with her.

So, was I the asshole for letting the lice thing bother me so much and kind of disrupt the limited time we had together?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

We've been friends since 2011. He's been having this badass behavior to me since he got bigger approval from people that we've met in common. Lately he started to treat me like a stupid in a group chat (but this is not new) where a girl i feel attracted by, was added, also. She's friends with Jack. I texted him via private message remembering him that she could perceive me as an idiot for things he was saying there. He changed the topic. The problem gets to be a Problem in that group chat when other people starts to apply his behaviour to me. And this has happened many times before. And pisses me off. And i've been trying to unfriend him since a year or two ago for these things (and many others). At the same time, there's a girl he used to date. She broke with him in january, and also broke him since then. Well, it's like she became kinda friends with me. Usually we talk about gym and workout. But when we're talking about this, since some weeks ago she asks me pics of my body via WhatsApp. I avoid the temptation because of my friendship sense (or its remains) with Jack and because I know that these things usually drive people to other level of interaction.

I'm mad with Jack, guys. I want to unfriend him. Just the idea makes me feel free. I want to talk with him first, but also I know that probably he'll become offensive while we talk about it because it happened many times before.

One day we were going to play his songs as a band, and he had a very imperative voice tone. Our friend realized this and even told him, 'hey, calm down'. One more time this is not new, folks. For me, Jack's like the kind of idiot who feels marginalized one year and suddenly everyone loves him and he doesn't know how to live without his new reality.

I have the intrusive thinking of this girl being a good sexual friendship in case of unfriending Jack. Sometimes he does things that makes me to want him as my only friend. But he kills all this goodness by doing things that makes me willing to get rid of all my social life.

One of my oldest friends asked me to loan him $135 so he could a rent U-Haul to move a bed to his new apartment. He just started a new job and hasn't gotten paid yet, which is why he doesn't have the money now. He gets paid next Friday, so he will be without a bed for one week.

He messaged me to ask he if could borrow the money and told me what it was for, I declined and he replied saying now he has to sleep on the floor for a week. I said I was sorry, and he told me that I wasn't sorry, the I was being petty by not loaning a small sum and then we got into a fight. I told him he crossed the line by reacting this way. I told him I have no desire to be friends with someone who reacts with vitriol when I refuse to loan them money. He then told me that he would loan me thousands of dollars to help me (I fully believe he would if he had it), and that he loans money to his friends when they need it, and again that I am ""petty"" for refusing to loan my friends or family money. I told him that a life or death situation would be different, but he is not in any danger by sleeping on the floor for a week. He told me this statement offended him. He told me he will not accept me threatening to throw away our friendship over a small disagreement such as this. Then he sent me a long message saying our friendship is not equal (because he realized he is more willing to give than I am) which upsets him, and told me not to be angry anymore, but that he is still hurt by my threatening to end our friendship.

He knows how much it bothers me when my parents or siblings ask to borrow money, because we have discussed it several times prior to this incident. One of my siblings only speaks to me to ask for money. My family pays me back over months or sometimes not at all. I don't even lend money to my partner. He knows how I feel about lending money, but he told me he doesn't agree with my views. I felt like he was the asshole here for knowing how I feel about lending money, asking for it anyway, putting me in a terrible situation where I have to reject my friend, and then instead of taking the rejection gracefully or pleading his case with compelling arguments, he insulted me. He has two boyfriends, one of whom is an extremely high earner (500ks), his father is a physician, and my friend even held a job prior to this job, so he should have had some savings anyway. I wish he would have asked to borrow money from one of them instead of me. While I'm not totally financially comfortable right now, I do have the money to lend him.

c6rtvg	2019-06-29 00:06:18	CloneNoodle	AITA for calling the cops on neighbours blocking my parking space?	"**Removed visual  for privacy after several posts.**

I work from home in a condo building with assigned parking for owners around the sides of the building, which also shares a driveway with two surrounding buildings on either side.

This morning I went out to run some errands and grab lunch, came back to find a car parked in the entrance to the driveway, blocking my access to my parking space beside. As soon as I pulled up I saw a lady from the neighboring building leaving it and carrying boxes to the car, she saw me, shook her head and motioned me to park elsewhere. I rolled my window down, explained she was parked in a drive way and blocking my access to my paid and assigned parking space, I made the point that she surely wouldn't block someone's house driveway to move her things and that was effectively what she was doing to me.

A younger guy (I'm 26, he was 20) followed behind and told me they weren't moving until they were done with those boxes, ""tough shit, (they) don't give a fuck."" I said ""No, you're going to move your fucking car, it's blocking my private property and that's illegal"". The lady again repeated that it wasn't happening, I said ""wow, fuck you then"". The guy suddenly runs at me, I barely closed my window in time as he's right up to the door with his hands in the air asking me who the fuck I think I am, cursing me out, yelling.

I drove away shaken because I didn't expect that kind of escalation for a parking dispute, he chased my car down the middle of the street until the end of the block. I called the police non-emergency line to report it because I was afraid they'd damage my car next time they saw it and I wanted a record. I kind of expected they'd just take a report and tell me it's a civil issue, but they sent 3 cops who took statements from me and them. I told them what I wrote here, the neighbors said I showed up swearing and yelling at them to move immediately and the guy ""over-reacted to seeing his step-mom talked to in such a way"" even though they were rude and dismissive to me from the start and I reacted emotionally once it was clear they weren't going to move. One of the officers I was giving my statement to said that my version of events made a lot more sense as to how the situation would escalate. No one was arrested and I'm not sure what they said to them once I went inside after giving the statement.

I've been wondering if calling the cops was an over-reaction, I've had a lot of issues with other people from their building (drunk hitting/running my car, screaming in the alley at 3 am etc) and maybe this influenced me when should have just let it go.

AITA?

I’m a pretty low level employee at a really big international company. I haven’t worked for very long with them, but I’ve worked a lot and I’m always the first one to jump at opportunities and I’ve made myself available to them as much as possible.  

Today after working past what would usually be the end of our (mine and one coworker) we were asked to go help out a higher up with a client. Usually we take one car together but today we both had our own cars. We stopped for our break before we went to the other location and were caught in an insane amount of traffic due to it being the city and a few car accidents happening. I can 100% accept the responsibility for being to the location late, we should’ve stopped for our break after in order to prevent this. But continuing on we were in what I would say to be a rougher area of the city. I was not told earlier that this area of the city we were going to was more on the rougher side. I immediately began to feel uncomfortable and mildly unsafe. I’m a pretty small female and from life experience I can usually tell when people are looking at me “wrong way”. My coworker got to the location first and was looking for parking, but couldn’t find any so he told me to drive around the area until we could figure something out. About 15 minutes went by,   by this point I was starting to get more and more anxious. I have no idea how to describe what I felt other then using the words uncomfortable and unsafe. So I pulled over and called my coworker and told him what I felt. He was incredibly understanding and told me to start heading back to our office and he would meet me there while calling our manager. We both realized that this would have possible negative ramifications to the account, but we were also told that if we were ever feeling unsafe in area we were allowed to leave. I started to head back to the office and I get a call from my manager who asks me to explain the situation that just occurred. I told them I just felt really uncomfortable and unsafe and that I wouldn’t have left unless I really felt afraid. They began to repeatedly ask me why I felt uncomfortable and why I felt unsafe, and all I could explain was was that I just genuinely feared for myself being there. Which then prompted them to ask me if I felt this way due to being in an area of lower socioeconomic status.  They also kept repeating that it was broad daylight and there was police everywhere. I did not see a single policed officer or car anywhere. Even though they told me that this wouldn’t effect my place in the company, what I did wasn’t okay, but my safety was still of the upmost importance. Which for one thing I found very confusing. I feel bad for possibly impacting a client relationship but at the same time I did not feel okay being there. AITA?

My best friend has dated several girls in the past. All of the relationships never worked, but this ONE girl, really messed with my friend's life. 

This girl (let's call her Mia) has really pissed me off before, and my friend too. She would not allow my friend to have other friends around her and became EXTREMELY possessive. One day, I decided to piss her off by coming near my best friend and Mia was extremely pissed with me. Long story short, I showed my friend who Mia really was and how awful of a person she was. 

Mia would also drag her problems onto my friend a lot, and she was under quite a lot of stress. 

In the end, they broke up. A couple days later, she would continue bullying my friend and would send her friends onto MY friend. Those ""friends"" of Mia would also bully my friend. She ended up crying several times and avoided talking to Mia. 

It was like my friend was blind, and I all of a sudden shined some light on Mia to show her what kind of person she is. 

This was months ago. 

Today, my friend messaged me and told me that she got asked out by Mia again. 

My friend said yes. 

I was extremely pissed, because she's my best friend and I hated seeing her get hurt. I told her that I'm not getting in her love life again, and she can date whoever she wants, but I will not support her relationship with Mia. 

She said I was being extremely rude and that I am not treating her like a best friend should.

We were married 14 years and have two sons, 11 and 8, together, and most of our marriage was great but she’s a very emotionally distant and private person, which drove a wedge between us. My ex wife also has a daughter from a previous relationship, let’s call her Betty, who is 26. I lived with my wife not far from the only major city in our area, where Betty happens to live too. In the two years since I’ve been here, Betty has made no effort to contact me or maintain a relationship with me, which I understand and have accepted. 6 months ago I started dating Emily, 28. She’s, bright, kind, and mature, but in a way that doesn’t diminish her youthful excitement and curiosity about life. She is truly beautiful in every sense. Emily brought me to a work party recently. It’s a close small staff, and with Emily having no family nearby, this felt like a big situation to us. I arrive and lo and behold, who do I see there but my ex step daughter Betty. I admit I was kind of excited. I love her and watched her grow up and have missed her, but she was cold and distant. The next day I received a slew of messages from her threatening to ruin my relationship with my sons if I don’t end things with Emily. On the one hand, I love Emily and these threats are probably empty, as I have a good relationship with my sons and my ex isn’t the vengeful type, but on the other hand, I love my kids and can’t risk them no matter how small the risk, and I am also starting to feel the tiniest bit weird about Emily and i’s age difference.

This is a popular Pokemon Go spot because of all the pokestops and gyms where the memorials are.

I like to drink a beer walking this route catching Pokemon. It's legal because that strip is technically a ""park"" so as long as I don't step on the street I'm not breaking any laws before 8pm. I have the relevant ordinances bookmarked on my phone. 

Recently I met up with a group to do a raid, and had two beer bottles with me while we did trades. On my second beer a cop pulled up (police patrols are frequent, it becomes a kind of sketchy area at night.) and called me out for public drinking. I pulled out my phone and showed him the relevant ordinances and noted that as it was now 7:56pm I had four minutes to finish my beer. I then downed it, tossed the bottle in a recycling bin, and the cop gave a pissed off look and got back in his car and drove off.

c6rnh9	2019-06-28 23:50:00	6weekspreggo	AITA for wanting the father of my child to take down the pictures of his deceased wife once I move in?	"Throwaway account for obvious reasons

&#x200B;

Okay, let's get into it.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for less than a year and found out a few weeks ago that we're expecting. I'm only 6 weeks along. He has mentioned that he'd like to get married as soon as possible so that I can move in and all the insurance stuff will get worked out for me and our child.

So, I'm in my twenties and he's in his fifties. I'm not asking opinions on this, only adding it in for context. About three years ago, he tragically lost his wife to a car accident. I never dated anyone before him and we met after his wife's passing. We fell in love and are absolutely thrilled about this baby, though it was a major surprise.

I'm at his house every day and his house is filled with photos of him and his late wife. I mean FILLED. Every corner, I see her face. It was very hard to have sex in other parts of the house besides his room because I would look up and see her. I felt wrong in some way. I understand that his home is where he should be able to live peacefully and have what he wants up, but it didn't sit right with me. He talks about her quite often in the most inopportune times, and it bothers me some but I never say anything.

&#x200B;

Anyway, so now that we're talking about getting married and me moving in, the topic of me moving my stuff to his place came up. We talked about redecorating some and I VERY POLITELY asked if we could discuss her pictures. I did not tell him to take them down, but asked if he needed so many of them up now that I will be moving in. He got very mad and said I shouldn't question how he grieves. I was careful not to mention that I wanted pictures of us up, as I knew that may come across as I want to be taking her place. We've only exchanged words when absolutely necessary and that was two days ago. He thinks I'm being disrespectful and ruining what he's done to honor his late wife.

&#x200B;

Allow me to clarify that I do not expect to be taking her place, nor do I want to. I just want our home to feel like my home, too and I can't do that with his late wife looking me in the eyes around every corner. I don't want our baby to grow up and see these pictures and wonder who this woman is all around our house. 

Please, Reddit answer me this, AITA for wanting to create a new life with my new soon to be husband and father of my child?

&#x200B;

**Also, I don't mean all the photos. Just a really large amount. I understand that some need to stay, but it's honestly very excessive.** 

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Due to some details I forgot to include that are being asked. They were married for over 20 years and they both lived in this house together for the entire duration of the marriage. There is one child who does not live at home anymore and he lives in another state. He supports our relationship very much.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Most of the pictures are just my boyfriend and his late wife. Like just the two of them. I'm not upset about the ones that have her plus all their family or friends. I'm mostly having issues with the dozens of pictures of just them two. When we get married, I would like our wedding photo displayed, but feel weird having two wedding photos out, if that makes sense.

&#x200B;

Edit 3: His house is overall wonderful and is completely paid off, so there is no reason for us to move, although I'm sure that may be a good solution. It just can't happen right now."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6rmep	2019-06-28 23:47:19	TheAtomicBobert	AITA for cutting ties with a friend over a birthday party?	"I had a really close friend of mine who, a little over a year ago, called me in somewhat of a panic saying that she invited an old friend over to reconnect and he showed up drunk, abrasive, and with the intent of sleeping with her. He apparently kept trying to kiss her and grabbed her face so hard for a kiss that she complained of jaw pain. She threw him out and locked the door behind him before calling me. 2 weeks later she went to his house, something similar happened, and she called a mutual acquaintance for an abrupt ride home from his house.

&#x200B;

Despite the advice of several friends, she began regularly dating this man and thankfully has not complained of any physical or blatant emotional abuse. Still, she does often mention how he will constantly drink (often stepping outside to do shooters and once to the point of backing into her father's parked car) and lie about trying to seek help. She will always respond with the excuse ""well, he's sick and I just need to be patient. It's a disease"". He will frequently flake on plans and commitments with her while she bends over backwards for him. After a while, it felt like she was putting loads more priority on seeing him and less on engaging with her usual friends.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to last Fall, I transferred from a community college back to a state university that is about an hour away. Whereas the distance isn't itself that large, I could feel that some of my friendships were themselves growing somewhat distant. This is especially true for my friends who can't/don't drive. That is why I always try to make a show of engaging my old friends whenever Im in town and try to be as present as I can.

&#x200B;

Last month was my birthday and I spent a little extra money to throw two parties, one in my old town the day before and the other on my actual birthday in my new town. That way, I can spend time with both old and new friends. I invited her but she told me that she could only stop by to say hi because she was going to watch Hulu with her boyfriend. I told her that I would have appreciated her spending some time with me as my school/work schedule barely permitted me to come down as frequently and that being ditched for Hulu felt insulting. She responded by saying that I obviously don't understand how little time she spends with him with his work schedule (despite them being attached at the hip). At that point, I told her to not even worry about showing.

&#x200B;

Ever since, I've pretty much given her brief and curt responses when she occasionally messages me for advice on school and I've stopped making an effort to include her in any gatherings whenever I'm in town. I know it sounds so 3rd grade to be mad at someone for not coming to your birthday party, this just felt like the straw that broke the camels back. It was less about the party and more about feeling as though she devalued our friendship. I know alot of this is just me hating her boyfriend, but I feel really invalidated as a friend."

He had never played the game before, so i let him keep the 200 he profited from it. Mind you I had no idea about the whole surrogate gambling situation because my brother still didn’t play anything until I gave him the hundred. My brother gives me back the 20 i lent to him as well.

I believe my brother has a drinking problem & I am honestly just tired of dealing with it.
My brother started drinking when he was 15 & while I tried to be the “bigger brother” & try to stop him, I mostly chalked it up to him being a kid. Then he went to college & joined a frat. He started drinking way more, but since I wasn’t around him much & it didn’t impact his grades (as far as I am aware) I again didn’t say much about it. But after he graduated he moved near me again & we started seeing more of each other. He has not gone to a family gathering without getting hammered since college. He gets into screaming fits with me every time & will follow me around unless I physically drive away, to the point that I could not even have a drink while I am there because I need to be able to leave when ever he got too drunk. I have tried to pull him aside & talk to him about it but he gets very defensive & calls me a pussy for being “so sensitive about drinking” & I have talked about it with my parents, but whenever I have, they point out how fat I am & how that is just as bad so, who am I to throw stones. (TBH I am very overweight, I was morbidly obese, but currently working on it & now just obese. Down 30lbs since Jan 20 & 70 more to go to be not overweight by BMI standards)



The final straw at my grandma’s funeral. I was in charge of putting together who was speaking. This is really the first funeral I have been to, so I asked everyone in the family if they wanted to speak & did not tell anyone they couldn’t. Everyone loved my grandma & she loved all them, so it wasn’t like there was bad blood. Her step grandson wanted to speak & I told him he could. That'll be important later. We have another cousin that is underage & has some pretty severe trauma & he developed some addictions really young. He was, at the time, 1 week sober. His moms asked that we not get too rowdy around him while we were stay at my other grandparents pole barn. My brother refused to not drink that night. He had his girlfriend stop & get liquor. 

He proceeded to get hammered (very frat boy stereotype shotgunning beers & taking pulls straight from the gin bottle & smoking weed.) I did not confront him that night because he was drunk by the time I got there. Once he was really drunk, he was having a conversation with other cousins about something & yelled to me to ask if I agree. I hadn’t heard what they were talking about so I told him so; he was already too drunk to string together a full sentence, to the point where I couldn’t figure out what he was talking about at all. He got angry & in my face because I would not back him up. I tried to explain that I had no idea what he was talking about. He finally got angry at me & said that I had ruined grandma’s funeral because I let “step-Grandson” speak & he talked too long. That hurt a lot. I just left. I didn’t want to leave because I don’t get to see my cousins that often, but I just needed to go to bed. 

In the morning I went over & cleaned up the pole barn while they slept. My mom came over later & I told her what happened she brought up my weight again & told me my health was going to be a burden some day. I told her that was not what we were talking about & mentioned he also smoked weed there too. She was mad that he was smoking weed in my grandparents house & said she would talk to him. When she did & he got mad at me for telling on him. I explained to him all the things he did last night (he didn’t remember) & that I was done being around him while he drinks. & I left. That was 8 months ago. We still see each other for holidays, but I keep an eye on his drink & start getting ready to go after his 3rd gin & tonic. I told my parents & him that I would not stay around until he can go one family gathering without drinking. (My mom tricked me into staying the night once since I drew this line in the sand, but this post is already too long)



But this week my brother skipped work (called off) to go to a bar crawl with friends. He had just started a new job & was really broke (called me and my parents for money) so him calling off extra bothered me. While out he ran into my best & oldest friend & he called me up concerned about my brother because he could barely walk. I told him all the above & more. My friend then called up my dad to tell him he was worried. My dad called me angry that I put our family stuff out there. I told my dad, in nicer words, fuck off, if he [brother] is not doing anything wrong why do you care if I tell people about it. He told me that he doesn’t tell all his friends he is worried about my weight. I said goodbye & hung up I want to just pack it all up & cut them off, but they are family. I am tired of being yelled at, & drunkenly abused, but now that I leave early it usually isn’t a problem."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c6rjdj	2019-06-28 23:39:29		WIBTA- If I ditch a friend	"I  met this girl last year (she's 19, I'm 17). At first I thought she was kind of a Mean  Girl, but then we started getting closer, and we really fit with each  other.  
She is always really protective with me, she defended me from a  guy who was constantly insulting me. She's really sweet and nice.  
The  problem is that she comes with a lot of baggage. I always choose this  types of girls to be friends with and don't know why. She told me a lot  of horrid stories about her: about how she was in drugs, having  an eating disorder, etc... she even told me she was thinking about working as  a prostitute.

Truth is, I don't  believe her. I had a ""friendship"" two years ago where a guy told me  horrible things that where actually a lie to manipulate me (from an abusive mother to his dead twin), and I'm  terribly scarred about what that guy did to me. So I fear that she's  also lying to manipulate me.  
She always tries to contact me and come  home with me. I don't know if it's because she genuinely likes me or she  just wants someone to listen to her problems.

I (23) have a very dear friend who we'll call Bryan. He recently moved in with Amanda. He always ate a lot, but never seemed to gain much weight. He has always maintained a very unhealthy diet, consisting of mostly sweets and junk food. Since they moved in together (about 6 months ago) Amanda gained an incredible amount of weight. She was quite thin, but is now pretty big. Me and other friends are pretty sure he is the one causing this, and we are worried about her health. We all agreed we should have a talk about this with him. I'm just not sure whether it's our place to intervene. I dont want to jeopardize our friendship, but I have a hard time accepting what's happening. 

She gained about 70 pounds in half a year I'd say. Should me and my buddies talk to him about it, or would we seem like dicks? I understand she also has a role in this, but I've known this guy all my life and I know what he's like.

c6rhhk	2019-06-28 23:34:51	TheUnseenPooper	WIBTA for kicking my mother out?	"Backstory:  My mother and I were never close as my parents split when I was a toddler.  After going to college my first time I dropped out and moved in with her where I paid $500 month, roughly half of the costs.  Six years later I went back to school and still had to keep paying.  Two years in to school she leaves to be with her romantic interest leaving me to figure out how to pay for the whole thing for the last two years.  When I graduate I get a good job and buy my first place with an extra living space I was planning to use for my study.  My girlfriend moved in with me from day 1.  Three months later my mother decides to leave the guy and I let her move into my place for a short time for $360 a month, roughly 25% of the costs.

&#x200B;

Three years later I get a new job in a new city and she is still there.  In this time she has decided to go back to community college for a career pivot.  For a month or two after the move she did not pay rent and is not paying $250 to me as well as taking care of her own bills.  I am unable to sell or rent the place for a full price which would be closer to $900.  I am currently slowly sinking paying a mortgage and rent.  I am looking for a second job to help keep me a float.  I am trying to do the right thing and help someone unfortunate.  My friends and coworkers think I am crazy and I cannot help but think it may be time to change something.

Well, it was weird because she was telling me not to buy it. Anyways, she comes over and she shows me the gift she got me. It was the same jersey, however she got one that was lower quality (we don’t spend that much on each other for gifts, it ended up being the same price). So basically, this deal online is so good I feel like she got ripped off. She knows that I want the one that I was looking at today and she’s willing to return it but I just feel so douchy if I “say ya return it and get me this one. “ But I just feel bad because she spent so much on the lower quality one when the top quality one is the same price (and I really want it lol). 

WIBTA, if I agreed with her to return it and get the one on sale.

The jersey that’s on sale is a Toronto maple leafs st. Pats authentic Johnny t jersey for only $150 cdn. It’s a steal. And the one she got me is the same one but the fanatics line (much lower quality)."	No A-holes here	0	0	1356.0	59.0	0.0	0.0
c6rfyn	2019-06-28 23:31:08	badvacationfriend	WIBTA if I went on vacation without a friend?	"So a friend of mine wants to go on vacation to a city a few hours away. I'm interested in going as well, though none of our other friends seem to be. If i went i would be taking a bus into the city and spending 2-3 nights in a hotel that's about $100 a night. 

One of the issues is that this friend has basically no money because they've never had a job. They go on tons of trips like this because other friends are willing to pay for them, which is why they proposed the idea. They're willing to pay for their transportation to the city, but it wouldnt be ""in their budget"" to help pay for the hotel since they're planning to spend their money on fancy food and drinks. I'm uncomfortable staying at an AirBnB or a hostel, and since it's a vacation i'd like to stay someplace nicer/safer/more stable than a dorm or some dudes spare bed.

The other issue is that lately this friend and i dont work well when it's just the two of us. They're much more outgoing, and i'm often too introverted for them so they'll just leave me to go make friends with whatever strangers are around, which kinda hurts my feelings.

On the other hand, my hotel room would have room for 2 people (as most do) so having them join me and not pay for the hotel would cost me the same as just going alone. So wouldnt i be an asshole if i said no to them coming along?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Last night my cousins husband and my uncle told me they were really disappointed in me because without my aunt my mum wouldn't have been able to look after me and that I shouldn't have shouted at her. 

I get that but I don't think she has a right to go into my room and do whatever. Especially because I'm an a adult and I can do  I want. I've already expressed to my mum that I feel like moving out.

c6raus	2019-06-28 23:18:13	DriMG	AITA for letting my friend fail Programming class?	"So this happened in the final test of my programming class, the day before it a friend and I were studying and practicing for the exam in his house, and his girlfriend gave him the code to the programming problems she solved in the test for the same class a year ago, he shared them with me and I uploaded them to the cloud so that we both had access to them during the test. (This was not cheating because the teacher allowed us access to code we had, but not to search code from the internet) and also we agreed to do the test together (because the teacher gave the option to do the test by yourself or with a partner).

Now in the first 5 minutes of the test the teacher showed us the 4 programming problems we should solve for the test, also he gave us the percentages that each solved problem was worth, here is the list:

Doing it by yourself:
1 problem solved: 70% score
2 problems solved: 95% score
3 problems solved: 115% score
4 problems solved: 130% score

Doing it with a partner:
1 problem solved: 50% score
2 problems solved: 70% score
3 problems solved: 95% score
4 problems solved: 110% score

Also by reading the problems, I figured out that we already had the solutions to two of them, so I proposed to him that we should do the test separately to maximize our score, which he agreed.

Now during the test I noticed that one solution that we had was not as straightforward as I thought, while the other solution we had was exactly what was needed.

The issue was that my friend got stuck all the test in this problem that the solution was not straightforward and he could not figure out the real solution, so he did not submit any answer to anything so he failed both the test and the class while I solved 3 problems.

He was mad at me for abandoning him but I think that if he tried solving the other problems he would have figured out that he already had one solution to one of them and that he is completely responsible for failing the class, AITA?

"This week I was taking care of a neighbor’s three cats while she and her family were gone on vacation. The night before they left, I went over to the house so my neighbor could show me where the cat food was and everything else that I needed, and she told me that she would pay me $40 for the week, which was fine with me as it would take pretty minimal effort to walk to the house, feed the cats, and clean out the litter box. 
When I got to the house on the first day they were gone, I saw that my neighbor had left my payment by the cat food for me... and it was a $50 Starbucks gift card. 
Now, I like Starbucks. But as a teenage girl, everyone assumes that Starbucks gift cards are the perfect gift, and I’ve already racked up so much money in Starbucks gift cards from graduation and past holidays/birthdays that I really don’t want anymore. It’s not good for me, and I’m trying to save up next year for college as much as I can this summer.
I told my parents, who both said I would be ungrateful for asking for real money, especially because the gift card was worth $10 more than promised.

c6r94b	2019-06-28 23:13:57	EveningConcert	AITA For banning my sister from using my belongings and installing a security camera	"Hi guys,

Context, I'm a student who crashes at home during the vac with a younger sister (referred to as Sis). I like vintage clothing and spend a lot of time shopping for second hand designer items in thrift stores etc as a hobby. Even if I don't pay much for my clothes they are all irreplaceable.

Sis and I have always had a very open borrowing policy with clothes. At the beginning of the university year this year, I asked Sis if she could not borrow my clothes for a term, as I noticed some things were missing and I just wanted to gather them all in one place when I got back. I made clear that once I came back things would resume as usual.

During term I noticed Sis wearing one of my more expensive pieces in a social media post, and when I got back I found several bits in her wardrobe, which I hate as a lot of them have special washing requirements.

I got mad and said she could no longer use my clothes. She got angry and said I had no right to do that. I had completely stopped wearing her stuff, and she has never paid for any of my clothing.

Right before I left for uni, she stole some of my favourite pieces and hid them so I couldn't find them. I'm pretty sure she stole money as well.

When I got back, more pieces were missing, some of which I can't find anymore.

At this point, I'm pretty sure Sis is the asshole, but my mum is taking her side.

I get angry, and a bit petty, so I buy and install a security camera for my room

My mum now gets furious, as she uses my room as a guest room when I'm not around and throws it out. She promises that Sis will no longer borrow my clothes.

When I get back this term, I spot my clothes in her holiday photo's, and a bunch more in her room.

I've reinstalled the security camera, and am going to cable tie my wardrobe shut when I leave over the summer. I've also bought a lockable trunk to keep my favourite pieces in until I can move out.

Everyone is angry at me, saying that I am petty and selfish, but I am annoyed that my sister couldn't keep her hands to herself for three months as a favour to me, especially when I've been so generous before. I feel like they don't respect my room, my belongings or my wishes.

AITA for being so controlling over my clothes and reacting so harshly to Sis using them?

Edit: would like to say that the camera is obvious, I told my family I was putting up and why I was doing it, and it only shows the door so I can see who exits and enters the room. I can turn it off remotely and only store 24 hours of footage, so if needed I can turn it off if my mum has a guest.

Edit: oh wow so this really blew up.

So first of all camera was never hidden. Would like to clarify that. Informed whole family, hence the reason it got thrown out and only used for like a week.

I mainly bought it as a deterrent, and hopefully to prove to my mum how bad the stealing was which ended up being pointless thanks to social media.

Although I had reinstalled, have now taken it down after feedback in post.

Currently using the locked trunk instead, which my mum has allowed me to store in attick where it's harder to get to.

Am moving out soon anyway but due to the way my college dorm system works currently not an option.

Camera was petty, I know. But please stop complaining about it being hidden and read the damn post.

Edit: also thanks to everyone that responded. It's hard to be objective your own family, and the responses have helped me handle this better as I no longer feel like I'm going crazy, allowing me to take a step back and be more mature about it."	Not the A-hole	0	0	52.0	27.0	0.0	0.0

I told him this at a meeting the next day and said to stop moving it. He yelled at me ""it's so disrespectful that you moved it without connecting the wires. This is a workplace."" Then left the meeting to go move the computer back to my desk. Later he said ""I'm going to tell the manager we should both have someone sit next to us"" because he is jealous that I get to sit alone and doesn't think it's fair.

He hit on a couple of my friends knowing they were my friends. He lied to them about his age. He made up shit for the heck of it. I look past all this because I say that's just the way he entertains himself.

He only comes out to see me once a week and it always ends in sex. I told him I wanted a f buddy relationship but he was having none of it. He would get aggravated if I wasn't answering messages within 10 mins but he would leave my messages always hanging if he didn't want anything from me. I leave him but he comes back saying he needs me and misses me, I fall right back in and take him back. This time I lay the ground rules, he agrees and says to me ""If you ever betray my trust, I will never forgive you"" I reply ditto.

As of last month, he says we are in a relationship. Things are going as expected. We go out, he decides to have his friend tag along and he acts bored throughout the day. He shows me a post he made on reddit. I think nothing of it but make a mental note that I know his username now. Yesterday, I find myself with some free time and dive in. Find out he has a kid he's fighting custody for in another country (he called me when he went there for the hearing a couple weeks ago and said it was a family house issue.) I confront him. He only says ""I'm glad you know now."" If he was so glad I knew, how about he f-ing tells me!!! closes the message with ""it's ok if you go off on me (smiley crying emoji)"" Like really? you lied to me for the entirety of our relationship and you are going to cap it with a damn emoji??!!

Family is very important to both of us. We’re really struggling with this dilemma and don’t want to be assholes that mess up family interactions for a long time.

My family is very welcoming especially for someone like my fiance who is very kind and hard working. He’s just the kinda guy who makes everyone feel better about themselves and that people want to be around. Needless to say he has been welcomed into my family wholeheartedly no questions asked. 

On the flip side my fiance has two halves to his immediate family. On his mom’s side they are the same as mine. Very welcoming and loving. His mom and I have a really fantastic relationship and I am actively building a relationship with his siblings on that side. But on his dad’s side I’ve always felt a bit excluded and we have talked about this many times before. We were actually with his dad’s side for Christmas where his step mom asked me, “How long is this even gonna last?” I have always felt like they never cared to put effort into getting to know me even though I’ve tried to the point where I sacrificed limited time with my family to try and get to know them. 

And now to the issue. My fiance’s step brother (on dad’s side) is also engaged. He is planning for a winter wedding at the end of this year with his fiancee. They got engaged right before Christmas. His step brother actually invited my fiance to his bachelor party that was shortly after we got engaged so they know our relationship status. Well after the bachelor party we received a save the date in the mail addressed to “Fiance’s Name and Guest”. I was really upset about this because we’re obviously very serious and plan on getting married as we’re actively planning our own wedding. I would definitely make sure to put the names of long term committed significant others of my siblings or his siblings on any invitations etc. I was upset that my name wasn’t on the save the date especially because we are engaged but I was understanding since it wasn’t for very long time frame at that point. It just made me feel very insignificant and I was hurt. I just decided to let it go after talking to my fiance about it. Neither of us really felt like it was right to clear the air with either of them since it was likely placed in the mail right before the bachelor party which means they may not have known we were engaged. Plus wedding planning is stressful.

Fast forward to now four months later and we got the official invitation in the mail. Again it was  addressed to “Fiance’s Name and Guest”.

c6qz7o	2019-06-28 22:49:56	cheesychickenfries	WIBTA for not inviting my step grandson to a family dinner?	"I am tentatively putting out the feelers here as to whether or not I’ll be the asshole in this situation. 

My daughter is married to a wonderful man, Tom. They’ve been married for 3 years and were dating for 2 before then. Tom has a son from a previous relationship, he’s 13 years old. 

My youngest sons (19) birthday is coming up soon and I wanted to take my other half and children out for dinner to celebrate. This would include my husband, my 4 kids, and their partners. None of these other people have children and as such I would prefer it to remain childfree.  

The reason for this is because I invited my step grandson to my daughters birthday meal last month and he loudly complained about the food because it wasn’t his preferred restaurant. He said the food was ‘just whatever but I’d prefer Olive Garden’. His father was mortified on his behalf and apologized profusely, as he said it loudly enough for the whole table to hear, and then he spend the rest of the meal on his phone.

Now, I’m paying for this meal entirely out of my pocket and I want everybody to have a good time. I’m sure that my son in law has had words with his son about appropriate behavior, and I’m equally certain his father will be happier if he’s invited also. However, I have to take into consideration that the rest of the family would prefer a child free atmosphere (which has been indicated via WhatsApp group chat) but I also want to be sure to be welcoming to everybody.

c6qv2t	2019-06-28 22:39:50		WIBTA for inviting all of my friends who don’t like each other out for a party?	"It’s my birthday soon and I’ve had a pretty rough year. When I finished school, my large friend group of about 15 people splintered off into smaller groups and they all fell out with eachother except for the people in the new groups. I also managed to stay on good terms with everybody and still talk to most of them on a daily basis.

The problem is, some of them can’t stand each other. They will just argue and stir the situation just for the sake of it, or make stupid snide comments. It’s all very childish, I admit, but when they’re all together it’s just an unholy storm of jabs and insults. I want everyone together for my birthday for reasons I’ll explain in a moment, but I’m not sure whether I’m being selfish and not looking out for the people who will be being insulted or getting into verbal altercations. 

Usually I wouldn’t do anything on my birthday or maybe I’d go out with a couple friends. But I’m going to be 20, which in my family is one of the big ‘milestone’ birthdays, most people would do sweet 16/18/21 birthdays but we just do every 10 years just to save money/tradition.

As I said, this year has been (especially financially) pretty rough. Members of my family have been scammed, robbed, forced into homelessness amongst other things. All of this has culminated in a much smaller birthday than past years. I don’t really mind as I’m not materialistic and I appreciate the validation/attention more than anything haha. However, there’s a lot less family members that will be able to celebrate with me as well. I guess instead of lots of presents or cards, I want to compensate with (cheesiness intended) the gift of a lot of company!

I’m kind of aware this sounds like a ‘looking for validation’ post, but I personally feel like it’s a bit of an asshole move to make everyone uncomfortable like that - but I’m also viciously aware that I’m an overthinker. I brought it up to a friend that won’t be attending, but she says it’s a bit of a ‘dickish’ thing to do as I’m ‘stirring the pot’, implying I just want to watch everyone fight colosseum-style and give my thumbs down at the end of it. 

And what if I didn’t tell everyone and just invited them all individually? Then, surprise, everyone’s all turned up and they don’t have time to prepare witty comments etc? Or would it be less assholey just to inform everyone so they could decide themselves whether they want to be in each other’s company?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Im trying to keep this as anonymous as possible so I’m sorry if anything is unclear. 7 years ago when I was 18, my older sister died in a car accident near a place that she loved not far from where we grew up, a body of water named after a precious stone. She was a very free spirited, aligned with nature type, and from what I gather she used to cleanse crystals there, which was fitting because of the name. When she passed our family found a lot of solace and beauty in that location, it was always very positive and comforting to go there and it still is. Recently I became pregnant, and during a conversation with my MIL, she happened to suggest the name of the location of my sisters death. She had no idea about this, but my husband and I immediately looked at each other and knew it’d be perfect. I know my sister would love the idea. Well, when I told my mom, she lost it. She immediately got emotional and we got into a bit of an argument about how I could even think to name her grandchild that, and how it’s morbid and inappropriate. The thing is, I don’t see it that way. I see it as a perfect way to honor my sister, considering we spent so long in morning treasuring that place. WIBTA if I name my daughter this?

I'm feeling guilty about something that hasn't even happened yet.
My manager called me in the other day to tell me there might be a full time position opening up.
I currently work part time but constantly work over time. I work all the hours nobody wants and can work 2 weeks straight on over 12 hour shifts just to make my wage livable.

Here's the problem.

Someone is on maternity atm. There is a girl covering her role until she returns. Said maternity girl may not be returning to the job and my manager has asked me to go in for the position if it does come up. However maternity cover girl really wants to stay and will obviously put in for the position, should it become available. 
She has been there for over 6 months and I've been there 11.
I work really hard, I love my job but I'm losing sleep over worrying how I'll find over time each month. (Its not always available) my manager has told me to think of myself but I also think about this other girl who also has bills to pay.
I'm not used to being cut throat and out for myself. 

However this girl knew her job was potentially temporary. 

Sorry for the long post I guess I just need to know if I'll be the biggest asshole going if I go for this job or not."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6qqt0	2019-06-28 22:29:46		AITA for warning my friend about the guys she’s pursuing?	"Long story short-ish, my (22F) best friend (22F) of 18 years recently decided she’s had enough of the single life and is ready to start actively dating again after a 2 year relationship that ended a few months ago. This is all pretty good and I’m super supportive of her doing this! However, so far, the last three guys she has gone on dates with/spent time with have all been guys who I previously dated/hung out with to varying extents. I am in a happy relationship now, so there’s no animosity from me about this per say, but I have expressed my concern to her for a couple of reasons.

All of these three guys only stopped seeing me because I put a stop to it and wasn’t really interested in pursuing it further. Even in the last month or two, all three of them have tried to reach out to me (knowing I’m taken) to see if they can somehow make me stray (again, met with a hard no/ignored). 

Secondly, they all only began messaging her after particular nights out where I had rejected their advances in the first case, eventually talking to my friend and getting her number afterwards. The messages themselves from what I have seen seem to be these men repeating the **exact** lines to her about a ‘*strong connection*’ and ‘*something special’* that I once received. At the same time, they were still trying to message me whilst actively messaging her, two even going as far as to ask if I’m jealous that they are now talking to my friend.

Anyway, I had a chat with my friend about all this, and told her just to be careful of these men, as I was unsure their intentions were always good. I have the personal concern that they pursued her only after having been unsuccessful with me (in the least conceited way possible). I admit, I wasn’t the most sympathetic discussing this, as its now hit her messaging the third guy, and I’m a little tired of having to talk about men from my past.  

Since they have continued to message me (which my friend is aware of, no secrets) I am worried that my very open hearted friend is going to get hurt by men who are pursuing something either to attempt to make me jealous, or simply because she was the next option. 

My friend was upset and told me I was ruining her excitement for the dates, and making her feel bad about going forward with these guys, I just wanted to make sure she wasn’t being played with. She says she has no way of meeting men without me introducing her to them, me only reluctantly introducing her in these instances as I was approached in a bar while with her. I said I would help her find some new guys who I had not been involved with, but she became mad and said I was being possessive and making life more difficult when there were three single guys right here for her.

c6qpzi	2019-06-28 22:27:50	Dubrx	AITA for joking with a restaurant owner about finding a bolt in my food?	"So a few weeks ago my wife and I were eating at our favorite local Mexican street food restaurant when suddenly I looked down and there was a bolt in my burrito.  This was not just any old bolt mind you, this thing was like an inch and a half long.  Now I didn't bit down on it and no harm was caused.  When I showed it to the owner he freaked out and did the right thing by comping our food and drinks and was extremely apologetic about it.  He later figured out it it came off their massive tomato masher used to make their pico.  We've since been back to the restaurant a couple times (the food really is amazing) and I had hoped the owner would recognize me and I could give him a hard time about it, but he hasn't.  So fast forward to last night, we were at a local food festival that was jam packed and super busy and the restaurant was participating.  The owner hands me a taco and I jokingly say ""There's no bolts in here is there?"" And he looked very confused for a sec and just says ""nope no bolts"".  My wife couldn't believe I said that and said there's a time and a place for that kind of joke.  Now I feel terrible cause the owner is super nice and the food is super good and I feel like I need to go back and apologize.  So, what do you say...AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0	174.0	124.0	0.0	0.0

c6qp9a	2019-06-28 22:26:07		WIBTA if I gave back my engagement ring? He called off us getting married but still wants to stay engaged.	"So we’ve been together for almost 10 years. I got pregnant quickly after we started dating. Like 5 months later. He proposed and we’ve been engaged for almost 9 years. He said it was the right thing to do okay. He’s 43. I’m 32. 

So this past February he said I had to set a date or we were just gonna go elope. Well I did. We went to Hawaii to do a planned elopement. 2 weeks before we leave he doesn’t want to get married. I’m devastated. We decide to do it anyways. Week before he doesn’t want to. But we talk about it and decide to do it. So I called the judge and set up an appointment at the courthouse. 

We get to Hawaii. He doesn’t want to go get the license. Then I read the marriage information wrong and said I don’t think we can. His face was of relief. Then I made a phone call and learned we’re still good. But he doesn’t want to. So we don’t. We get back and tell everyone we’re just gonna do it here. We haven’t. We’re not even talking about it yet he is telling everyone is was mutual we both backed out. Umm no I did not. Stop lying liar. I’m thinking in my head. But I don’t say anything. I just roll with it. I’m very laid back and just roll with the flow. 

Now Monday I’m picking up my ring from the jewelers because a diamond fell out before we left and wasn’t fixed until after we got back. I’m planning on giving him the rings back. I know it’s gonna start a fight. I know I’m not an asshole. I just wanted so words of wisdom here. On how to not make it a fight. I don’t want to break up. I just don’t want to be engaged anymore. I don’t want to spend my life engaged with no future of marriage. 

Side note: he was/is supposed to adopt my daughter from a previous relationship (whole different story where her dad has nothing to do with her ever)but our state won’t “make a child a bastard”, the states words not mine. Yet now we can’t because we’re not married. 


So next weekend I’m planning on giving back the rings. I don’t want to be engaged anymore. I don’t want to be tied down. I’m fine with the status of boyfriend/girlfriend and I’m planning on saying that this is not to break up it’s just give me the rings when your ready. No ultimatum. No pressure. 

I think he didn’t want to because he’s 43 and never been married. His parents divorced and he says it really messed him up. Plus all of his guy friends are divorced and telling him not to as marriage is a mistake in their eyes. All of his friends are divorced. All of his family is divorced and I think this is what scares him. 

So there we have it. 

TL;DR. My fiancé got cold feet and doesn’t want to get married and I’m giving the rings back. It’s gonna start and argument. And I am just wondering if I am an asshole for doing it."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6qow8	2019-06-28 22:25:17	Msergeofin	AITA for giving my parents crap for not letting me drink now?	"So I'm 20 but I turn 21 in late July. In the past I've never had any problems with my parents letting me drink at home in moderation ever since I graduated high school, things like letting me have a wine cooler with a meal, have a beer watching a movie at home, my mom ordered a rum and Coke and gave it to me at a wedding reception, they let me have a few shots at their friends' New Year's party, etc. Also they told me that as long as turn over my car keys to them for the night they won't question me about going to my friends places or what happened there, so I'll have my friend picks me up or take an Uber if I'm going to a party of my friends at home that'll probably have drinking. 

This summer they basically cut all that off once I got back home. My mom once asked to see my ticket stub when I told her I was going with my friend to a movie (I actually did so it wasn't an issue but I was frustrated by the lack of trust), they aren't giving me liquor or beer ever. When I asked my mom why the big change she said that my dad and her let me drink in limited amounts under controlled situations because they knew I would probably drink anyway and was at college, so this let me do it safely and not feeling repressed where I'd go drinking unsafely or driving drunk. But since I'm turning 21 so soon there's no need for this and the safest thing to do is just wait because it's pretty short anyway. She said she'll allow the occasional wine cooler with a meal until then but that's it.

This makes no sense to me so I kind of blew up at her. Since then I've been almost giving the silent treatment. I also can't believe I'm almost 21 and being treated like I'm back in high school. But now I'm feeling a bit guilty. Was I being a dick?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

In my opinion she's an **ugly, mentally unstable creep, and nothing can change that**. She's basically every stereotypical crazy woman in pop culture put in one body. Okay, so now that we've got that out of the way, let me start.

I'm 18, and moved into my first apartment. It's nothing fancy at all, and I've had to do a fair bit of work on it, but whatever. I have a few neighbors, most of them are perfectly normal people, except this person. My first impression of her was *terrible*. She basically pulled me aside while moving in, and told me about all the ""crazies"" in the building.

She has a habit of jamming the door open to ""keep out the toxic gas"", and opens her windows incessantly, even in the *freezing* Scandinavian winter. It fucks with the temperature of the whole building. 

She makes a lot of noise too. I'm guilty of this too, I play the guitar daily, but only during approved hours, and with halfway decent insulation. She however brings over ""friends"" to hang out in the stairwell, moves furniture around at night and walks like she's a human whale.

I'm honestly trying to get rid of her. To some it sounds heartless, since she is severely mentally ill, and just the general fact that no sane person would house her, but I want her **out**. After 5 months of this i don't care if she ends up on the streets. But my friends think I'm too harsh, and should just talk to her. Are they right, ***AITA?***

c6qmeh	2019-06-28 22:19:30	throwawayflatulence	WIBTA if I didn't share (much of) my newly found wealth with my boyfriend?	"My boyfriend \[30M\] and I \[25F\] have been together for 7 years, lived together for 6. Recently, we bought two pretty affordable apartments, one to live in ourselves and one to rent out.

Both flats are in both our names. We agreed to split the costs 50:50. However, since my boyfriend has more money than I do (he is older than me, earns more than me by about 60% and has more equity, and his parents also lent him some money free of interest), he lent me most of the money. That is to say: He paid for the real estate with his own money, while I will pay off my interest-free debt to him within the next couple of years. I have paid off quite a bit already since I am frugal (about 1/6th). In the beginning, it was a struggle to convince him to put the real estate not in his name only, but also in mine.

At the moment and for the last couple of years, we have lived in a rental flat. Until last year, I was a student and had next to no income. My boyfriend has always had a relatively well-paying job since I have met him. We have always handled the costs as follows: He pays 55% of the rent, while I pay 45%. Regarding everything else, we split the cost evenly. He admits he is tight-fisted.

Now here’s the thing. Very recently, I inherited a large sum of money. It is enough for me to never have to go to work again and live comfortably. Probably, it would even be enough for two people to retire early.

He knows about the inheritance, of course. He is happy about it. We have not yet really talked about what should be done with it. I feel he is ""afraid"" or too decent to ask. This might be due to the fact that were we come from, we are taught not to talk about money, especially not if you have a lot of it or if you are indebted.

Primarily, I would like to have advice on how to handle this. To what extent would I have to share my wealth with him in order not to be the asshole? To be honest, I doubt that he’d share much with me if he were in my place. He would definitely not waive my debt, but he would probably pay for activities that we could do together (i.e. travels) and probably food (or even the whole rent, but I doubt that).

Would I be the asshole if I did not share my wealth with him other than paying for the occasional holiday (and other leisure activities) and food/rent?

In case it is important, we do not want any children and we don’t want to get married (barely anyone gets married in our culture nowadays). Our life goals basically are not having to slaving away at soul-crushing jobs. I personally would like to become an entrepreneur if I had the funds (which I do now, I still can't believe it) while my boyfriend would like to stop working alltogether. I will also pay him back what I owe him as soon as the money is on my bank account."	Not enough info	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Now, apparently, her boyfriend is being kicked out of his dad’s house and has nowhere to live, so she asked me if I would have a problem if he moved in until January. I said no again. A few hours later she texts me asking again if I would reconsider. At this point I’ve told her multiple times that I would not feel comfortable with him living here and now she’s very upset. 

AITA for not allowing her baby daddy to live here with her? I feel like I shouldn’t be guilted into letting him stay here just because of their poor decisions and literally planning to have a child this young with no real housing plans."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

Its her second tattoo but way bigger than her first. Since we booked it a lot has changed, most recently we both moved and started new jobs. When i started my new job i arranged to get that day off to drive her there and back (50 miles each way) and for support and nerves. This has been the plan since day 1.

 Her appointment is now this upcoming Monday and my work is on fire. Our general manager quit with no notice, the schedule is changing effective immediately, and our new manager starts the same day as her appointment. I have been told previous days requested cant be honored for that day because of everything happening on top of it being the last day of our financial quarter in sales. I have nothing in writing from the previous manager to back up me having it off either. Ive explained to her that it puts me in a really uncomfortable situation to fight for a day off when everyone else is expected to be there and i feel like it starts me off on the wrong foot with new management. Im also the newest employee here. All in all it sucks and i feel horrible for having to back out so close to her appointment but i feel that its out if my control and it is what it is. I dont think a tattoo appointment is worth making a big deal about at a job I've only been at 1 month.

She is very upset, which im understanding of but im still not planning to escalate this with my work for the time off. Her whole stance is that im being extremely unsupportive, that i wont be at this job for much longer (planning to leave end of summer), and that i should fight for the day considering how long ago we made the plans. She pays for most things and feels like i shouldnt worry about possibly losing money or sales.

My whole stance is that I don't want to risk my position here and start off on the wrong foot day 1 with new management. I would be the only person off that day and would likely miss important meetings and possibly sales. Im too new to have a strong case to make as to why i should be able to be off, and none of this was within my control. I dont feel i can be called unsupportive when i had made evey effort to be there for her.

At the end of the day i love her more than any job but i also need to look out for my success at work for us to have a future together in the first place. 


So reddit, AITA for not pushing for the day off or should i start begging my managers to reconsider?

I’m a 20F. I generally do not believe in self diagnosing and I think it’s important to visit a health care professional regarding mental health. And I want to go to a professional, but it’s very hard to reach out for this stuff.

I don’t go around introducing myself as having depression or anything, but sometimes if my friends ask why I’m not coming around much or my family gets onto me for being unmotivated, I say I’m having a depressive episode. Which is truly what I believe is going on.. I wouldn’t make it up.

Some background on me: I started getting suic*dal thoughts when I was around age 12. I briefly went to therapy but then made my parents take me out. For the past 8 years, I have struggled with these thoughts. In fact, yesterday I was going to go through with it but my family was home all day so I couldn’t. I feel better now luckily. During these “episodes” it’s hard to get out of bed or have any motivation to do basic things. I often don’t eat but one meal a day.

I’m scared to reach out and get help, because this has been who I am for a long time. My dad has the same issues and even with therapy and medication he has never really gotten rid of his suic*dal tendencies. Unlike him, I have never attempted to “self medicate” with drugs or alcohol. 

But I know that self diagnosing is really frowned upon, I guess I never really thought about how what I do could be seen as harmful. I know it is a trend to be “depressed” now days.

They also don’t care if I explicitly say No beforehand. Most of the photos are either not flattering or flat out embarrassing, too, and a fair few of them go on social media

c6qdeu	2019-06-28 21:59:11	definitelyher	AITA for feeling neglected?	"This is old and from late last year, but it crossed my mind again recently, and I want some unbiased opinions.

Okay. So my (now ex-)boyfriend (18M) and I (18F) had been in uni for about a month or two. The both of us were pretty stressed (as first year students are).

Circa that point, I hadn’t seen him in person in a few weeks. Which was understandable because of adjustment, we also had very different class schedules. Most of our communication was over texts/instagram because of this. At some point during mid-late October he started taking several hours to reply, which turned into days at a certain point—times when I knew he was home with his phone.

I can understand not being able to reply right away, but the response time of days was ridiculous to me. So I texted him telling him so, and that if we can’t communicate then it wasn’t going to work out.

About 10 hours later (I sent the text at noon and he replied at night) I got a reply from him saying he didn’t know what to tell me, but he was staying away from social media and such. 

Conversation ensued where I explained that it wasn’t much of a relationship if we didn’t interact at all. Eventually he said he was being distant because I had said something that offended him.

It’s difficult to tell when he’s offended because he’s an introvert and not super expressive by nature, so it’s hard to see the difference between him just being quiet, and him ignoring you sometimes.

I asked him what I had done, and it was something along the lines of calling him “robot boy” (he’s a comp-sci major in AI) about a month back. To which I told him that he needs to tell me if I’ve offended him because he can’t expect me to read his mind.

I was just pretty much pissed off at this point. The conversation went on to whether or not he was ever going to have time for me since he was so busy and just tired. Basically we broke it off.

The next day I had gotten a text from him saying he wanted to fix it, but I was already jilted.

I had told him countless times in the past that he needed to tell me when I’ve hurt him because I’m *terrible* at reading emotions. The fact that he didn’t tell me, and that he was ignoring me made me feel like crap. I didn’t trust him anymore because of that.

I basically told him it couldn’t work if he couldn’t make any time for me, and that I was having issues trusting him after that.

It has evolved into where I'm now unspokenly expected to play at least every 3 days. If not I get a bunch of passive aggressive ellipses and stuff.

I guilt trip myself pretty easily and I don't think it's fair to even ask me to do this every day or every other day.

If I say I can't play for long there's half sarcastic jokes (at least how I take it)about how my time is valuable so he better hurry up and get to the Xbox. By play I mean do whatever he asks and just build stuff and not explore.

On the way, he says he's gonna take a picture of me in it (I don't wear anything fancier than blue jeans most of the time), and I tell him not to.

So we get to the bridal shop, and I ask for it. While she searches, me and BF start talking about it. He mentions at one point how I never feel like dressing up nice. (Which is true.)

The girl finds the dress and asks if I want to try it on. I'm curious to see how it looks in its proper color, so me and him head over to the dressing room. I get in it and go out to show him. 

Now at this point, I'll admit, I don't think I look good. The dress looks fine, but still needs altering (it's long and I'm not), my hair's a mess, I have a very exposed bra strap due to the dress style. Just- no effort, just want to see how the pink looks. He compliments me all over for it, and before I turn around to go back, I see his phone raising up. I immediately turn it down and hear a click of the phone shutter. Immediately remind him that for the last time, I didn't want that, I don't look good. ""But Verdant, you look fine!"" Well, I don't feel fine, please respect my wishes and knock that off. A couple seconds of back and forth, then I go back in and change. 

Now, between the rebagging of the dress, the ride home, and now, I can't help but feel dickish. I know it's gonna be a bit before I alter it and feel okay with wearing it, so I feel bad for taking that. On the other end, this isn't the first time he disregarded my feelings on having my picture taken, so I'm glad I pointed it out. So Reddit, AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	600.0	52.0	0.0	0.0

c6q7tm	2019-06-28 21:45:57		AITA - For saying no to a job offer for SO?	"I am 25F, and bf is 27m. We’ve been together three years. A few weeks ago, I was offered an amazing job opportunity for a summer position at a school with opportunity that t would lead into a job in the fall. This job was part-time (three-four times a week) 10 AM to 3:30 PM, full-health benifits (rare for a part-time) and opportunity for free Masters program and retirement fund. 

I promised him that we were going to spend the summer together as well.

So, I was called by the job, I called him a few times for his opinion and didn’t pick-up. I ended up saying yes. 

When I told him about the job, and me saying yes, he flipped. 

He works at home, with felaxable hours and makes okay money to substain himself. He’s a night owl, so he sleeps from 6AM to 2PM. So, whenever I go to his place and wait for him to wake up and browse on the computer. It’s really boring. When he wakes up, we usually go out and eat. And bedtime and repeat. 

He wants to me to live with him for the entire summer. He was also going to take time off from his job to spend the summer with me. 

I’ve also been out of work for two years. So, I was shocked I was called in to work. I thought it was perfectly because hours are going to work around with my chronic illness. I pay for my own stuff and pay for my own medical insurance ( which is important because job offered medical insurance coverage and i would have been saving 850 dollars a month) 

Gets upset because I ruined his summer because I promised the summer was ours. Which I did promise him that. I declined the job offer to be with him. But half of me feels torn. 

I gave him the silent treatment for two days, and I realized how childish that was because that doesn’t resolve anything. He also said another opportunity will come knocking at my door.

However, my other sisters are in town (18F and 27F) and I want my other little sister to come with us ....but I know that my mom would get extremely mad if we left the sister (27F) out of our plans(we are all currently at our parents home). 

Now I know that is usually a horrible thing to do to exclude people ...but my older sister is super religious and conservative and my other sisters and I are not anymore..If she came, she would “tattle” to my parents that my sister and I were drinking (even though we’re both of legal age), which would just cause a huge fight because my parents are VERY against alcohol and think that any form of drinking is a “sin”. We also would not be free to talk about ANYTHING as she essentially tells my parents EVERYTHING (and has told them in the past that I am a “bad influence” for showing them the “ways of the world”- literally just drinking, not even in excess, and telling them that they are not any less of a woman or “impure” (like we’ve been told countless times) if they have had sex with a boy). We literally have to talk in code or text when she’s in the room sometimes. 

Now this isn’t such a problem for me if she tattles bc I have graduated college and moved out/ am financially independent...but my parents currently help both of my younger sisters with some of their college expenses (and one still lives at home). If my parents find out that they are engaging in “sinful activities” like hooking up with boys or drinking, they would withdraw all financial support and literally make them come home from college.

He was emotionally abusive throughout my childhood due to unresolved trauma from his own childhood. He was quite unpredictable and yelled frequently about the smallest things. Undiagnosed and untreated depression, severe anxiety.

I found that the easiest way to cope with this was to do everything in my power to do what he wanted and keep him happy, which helped me avoid a lot of confrontation. As I grew up he became more and more mellow and we (family) no longer had to constantly feel like we were walking on eggshells around him. Along with this we grew closer and my fearful respect for him became a loving respect and I looked up to him in almost all aspects.

He has always been opposed to tattoos, neither of my parents have any, and constantly pointed out tattoos to me that he found trashy or poorly executed. Now on to the gist of this: I have diagnosed depression, generalized anxiety, and anorexia/bulimia (yes, both). I went into treatment a year ago for the eating disorder because it got to a point where it was life-threatening. 

I responded well to treatment but I still struggle. Nearly a week out of residential treatment, I fell in love with and adopted 2 cats (later, a third). One in particular is very connected with me, he cries at my parents when I leave, he snuggles with me almost every night, he really has saved my life because he loves me unconditionally and I wouldn't be able to explain to him why I had to leave if my mental health worsened and I ended up back in treatment. He is the reason I push myself to go to therapy, keep up with medication, avoid resorting back to ED behaviors, etc.

I want a tattoo of him (cat), on my forearm. By the time I get it, it will have been a year since I decided on it. I want him to be a literal physical part of me, permanently; a positive reminder of how far I've come. He will age faster than I will, but as a tattoo on my arm we can age together and experience life, in a sense.

The problem (for my dad) is that I've only been 18 for 8 months and therefore I've barely had time to be an adult, so why rush?

That is exactly why I want it now. I go to college in the fall to study to be a veterinarian. I officially start my life this fall, away from my parents and my home. The time feels really important to me, to get it now, but this is causing a fair amount of tension between us that I find incredibly stressful. 

So help, WIBTA if I acknowledged his advice but went ahead with it anyway?

TL;DR: complicated relationship with my dad. I want to get a tattoo of my cat as a reminder to stay in recovery and so he can be a physical part of me as I begin my adult life, so we can age together. Dad insists I should wait as I've barely been an adult for long.

The tattoo won't affect my job opportunities, it's coverable, I've researched tattoos and care for years, and I've taken a long time to choose the artist who will do it."	No A-holes here	0	0	7.0	6.0	0.0	0.0

TL;DR - in laws keep referring to my unborn son by a different name to the one my husband and I have chosen. AITA for telling them not to speak to me about him until they stop?

INFO:
I'm currently six and a half months pregnant with our first child, a boy. My husband and I spent ages choosing a name together (which was not easy, as I like classic names such as James and Matthew and he prefers unique names like Ezekiel and Leonidas) before finally settling on Kieran.

Since deciding, we have bought each other little keepsake presents and signed them 'love from Kieran' etc.

My husband's parents and grandparents have since decided they ""don't mind"" Kieran, but much prefer the name Finlay, which was one of our secondary name choices. Every time we see them, they shout ""Hi, Finlay! Grandma/grandpa loves you so much, Finlay!"" at my stomach at every opportunity. They also refer to him as Finlay when speaking in the future tense - ""when Finlay grows up,"" ""when Finlay comes to visit,"" ""when Finlay has a little brother/sister"" etc etc.

This has been going on for about 3 months now, and both my husband and I have voiced several times that we really don't appreciate it. We love the name Kieran and that IS what he's going to be called. Every time we get told ""well I prefer Finlay."" 

Yesterday, after listening to my MIL and FIL talk about 'Finlay' for an hour, I finally snapped and told them they are not to speak to me about my son until they can either call him Kieran or something less personal such as ""the baby"" or ""the bump."" They were really insulted and told me they were just excited for their first grandchild. They said we could call him Kieran but have Finlay as a nickname. I told them that's not how nicknames work and they can't dictate what he's called as he's not their child. My FIL began to shout that I was spoiling his experience, and my husband asked him to leave.

I know it's very petty, as it's just a name, but it makes me so uncomfortable! My husband agrees with me and has told them to drop it, but my mum said I was being overdramatic and needed to grow up. I do feel guilty as I know my in-laws are just excited, but I also don't think it justifies their behaviour. AITA?

I wanted to post an update, since the response to my post was overwhelming and people have asked. I appreciated how passionate people got and even though I was not labeled TA, the people calling me one had valid points that I took to heart. I appreciate people taking the time to respond, even if it was hard to hear. And for giving me honest unfiltered opinions which was what I needed. I’m happy to report that my boyfriend and I ARE still together. We are now back to having sex, after almost 4 months of celibacy. It had been a month or so longer than I thought when I originally posted. I feel that this break really helped us connect on a deeper level.

It has been more awkward than I thought to get back into sex after not having it for so long as people warned me about. But it’s getting better with time. We don’t have sex every day anymore, it’s toned down quite a bit and I think we both feel less pressure, which was another thing suggested to me on my post. Going through this was tough, but made both of us realize our relationship is worth fighting for. We are even more serious now. 

A lot of people called me an asshole for making a unilateral decision, and they were right. However He was clear that this should have been my choice because it’s my body so I don’t think he held that against me as much as was assumed on my post. But he didn’t appreciate the blindside (fair). People suggested me setting an end date which was a good idea. I decided on not choosing a date to for sure start sex again because that would be counter productive, but a date that we revisit the idea. we discussed everything at length that was brought up in the comments of the post I asked him to be honest with me. There was some yelling out of frustration, But ultimately we were ok and he was patient. We decided that if we weren’t having sex by July (I let him decide) we would have to see if we needed to try something else or if it was time to part ways. Luckily we never had to have that talk.  But having a date to at least revisit things was a huge help. I also continued to check in with him. It was very, very far from idyllic But we kept communicating which was key. 

Overall, I’m at peace with my choices. I feel super confident, I know he’s with me for me, and most of all I learned how much value I bring to the relationship. I’m glad I posted that, because had I not I’m not sure I’d have gotten to this point if I hadn’t taken the advice I got. There were things brought up in my post that I never would have thought about on my own."	Update	0	0	35.0	4.0	0.0	0.0
c6q393	2019-06-28 21:35:23	octopusinwonderland	AITA for thinking my job should give me more than two days notice of the next week’s schedule?	"I spoke to HR and she said if the regional manager wanted to put out the schedule the night before, I would have to cancel any plans I’ve made to be at work. I don’t have any predictable hours. So getting my hair cut, visiting my family, making it to the vet, who knows when I can make that happen.

The store manager says not to worry about the late schedule because the regional manager will make whatever I need work, but I’m on reduced hours through FMLA and the regional manager is quite livid about it, repeatedly telling me how much I inconvenience her and she “has to put her foot down”. I’ve only requested off for non-medical appts a few times over several months, and I don’t even request off for that many dr’s appt anyway.

I’ve offered to schedule appts around work if I had some idea of when that would be, I’ve offered to work other locations and different shifts. (I current work the hardest shifts that my store manager’s children (three are my coworkers) don’t want to work.)

Keep in mind my store manager’s daughter told me to my face in front of another employee she has no scheduling concerns because of whose child she is.

I feel like I’m asking for validation here, because I feel I’m right! I realize FMLA complicates scheduling, but it is the law.  I didn’t ask to have a disability, and I didn’t agree to sign over my existence for $11 an hour. Am I crazy for thinking this is not ok?"	No A-holes here	0	0	371.0	19.0	0.0	0.0

Also on mobile so sorry about formatting. 

A couple nights ago, a friend of mine (I’m a 24 yr old female) tried to set me up with this one friend of hers (a 25 yr old male). 

She gave me his number and over text we had really hit it off. He asked me out and we agreed to meet yesterday night at a restaurant. 

So I get there and we both are seated, we start talking and there are obviously sparks. We start talking and we somehow get to the topic of music and different bands and things of that nature. 

I tell him how I love to play the piano. My dad passed due to lung cancer when I was 8, but he was the one to really inspire me to start playing because of how often he would play the piano for me, or simply in his spare time. 

So I bring up my love of the piano and he starts to laugh. I ask him what’s so funny and he admits that he hates classical music. 

I was kind of skeptical and explained that a lot of songs use the piano, even if the songs aren’t classical. 

He didn’t believe me and continued to berate classical music and such. So I flagged down the waitress, spilt the tab, paid and left. 

I told my mutual friend what had happened and she said I was an asshole because he was such a good guy and music shouldn’t really change that. 

So Reddit, AITA?

About two weeks ago, some of my college friends and I found out that we were all going to be in town on the same day. We hadn’t seen each other in two months, and wouldn’t be able to for another two. One of us said “hey, would you guys like to meet up two fridays from now?” Of course, I said yes.

A few days ago, it clicked. I hadn’t actually looked on the calendar, but two fridays from them is June 28th: my girlfriend’s birthday. Now, I’m in a long-distance relationship, so we couldn’t be together physically, but we could still call each other and hang out online.

Once I realized this, I immediately texted my friends and told them I had to cancel, which they took well. However, my girlfriend found out, and she has been very bitter that I planned something on her birthday ever since. I’ve done everything I can to make it up to her: bought her some presents, spent even more time with her, and asked her what I could do, and yet she still is angry at me despite everything.

c6pxri	2019-06-28 21:22:42	ninogringo	AITA for dating a girl my flatmate secretly has a crush on?	"So I'm (M22) living in a big fraternity house with 9 other dudes right now. Fall last year, my flatmate (M24)(let's call him Josh) got the number of a girl (F19) (she'll be Maria for now), who's working in a grocery store close by. They got along quite well and she came to visit very frequently. At first we all assumed he wanted a romantic relationship with her, but months later nothing happend. We were pretty chill back then and got along great and I asked him, what his plans with her were. He always replied that she was way too young for him and that he would not be interested. Only when he was drunk he tried hitting on her, which he was aware of and always repeated that he is not interested in a romantic relationship. 
She as well said, that she was never interested in a relationship with him more than being friends.

So me and a couple of friends wanted to go out on a weekend back in April. We knew Maria was going out as well and contacted her if she and her friends wanted to join us. She agreed, but she was the only one coming with us. 
So long story short we ended up making out that night.
We agreed that this was a one time thing and we didn't plan to repeat that.
Josh found out about it and seemed to be a little pissed, and I kinda get that, because we had a similar story with me and a good friend of him that didn't end well, because there were one sided feelings and some jealousy.

However, I told him that it was a one time thing and he seemed to be normal again.
Well we made out again a couple of weeks later and we both admitted that we had some feelings for each other.
I spoke with him again and wanted to know if he's cool with that. He said it's fine as long as he doesn't have to see us make out. I didn't really think he would mind it, as long as it didn't end like last time. But as we were serious about it already I told him it's nothing like back then.

We didn't really have a lot of contact after that because we were both busy. Marie told me after a couple of weeks, that he confessed his love to her and that he apparently was very jealous when they were drinking. He also told her that I stole her from him. 
He also told everyone in the house how I stole her and betrayed him. I don't know what kind of story he told them, but the whole house is pissed at me for being together with a girl, that wants to be together with me as well.

What confuses me the most is that he told everyone, literally everyone that we know about this. He also says that they all agree with him, at least that's what he tells Marie, because he's not talking to me anymore. He also tried to make her decide to choose between me and him.
I really don't know how I could have avoided that. I wasn't planning to get together with Marie, it just happend. On the other hand he is just a friend of her, so why is he pretending to own her and allow or deny who she's dating.
So AITA? Seriously?

c6pxc7	2019-06-28 21:21:39	Punky_Grifter	AITA for throwing out the kitchen sponge	"So this is an AITA that my husband I are both reading and wanted community input.

Two days ago my husband and I got into an argument because I threw out the kitchen sponge and replaced it with a new one. The sponge was only 3-4 weeks old and had been sanitized by being microwaved in a bowl of water for 2 minutes. I sanitized at least twice if not three times in the 3-4 weeks.

My husband thinks that sponges should only be thrown out when it is obvious that they are done. When they really can't be cleaned, when they are literally falling apart, when they have a funky smell that won't go away with washing. He is against having an expiration date on the sponge and thinks you should only throw them out when they are done.

The sponge was used nearly everyday to knock off food particles because our dishwasher is pretty awful at cleaning dried on food. And it was used just as often to hand wash the bigger dishes.

So, AITA? How long should one keep a kitchen sponge around?

I am a student and live with 5 other guys (all students). We are moving house on Sunday (it’s Friday when writing this) and 2 (me and 2)of us have spent the day cleaning our current house. Now two of our other housemates (3 and 4) aren’t here because one is a foreign student and has gone home, the other works over 2 hours away and works full time. He is however coming tomorrow morning to help clean and get the house ready. Our fifth housemate is the one I shouted at. He is off on a holiday tomorrow morning and has been at the University house for the last 3 days. In that time while my housemate and I have been cleaning he has been sleeping till midday and not contributing saying ‘he’s really busy and needs to pack’. 

We come to today and we have asked him many times to help clean the house and he decides to go shopping from 1 till 5 and we say he needs to help. Then later on he says he will go to the supermarket and get kitchen paper. We do other jobs and realise it has taken him over an hour to do a 6 minute job (I know as I went to the same shops and got some). What he had done was go to the uni library to print off some items.

Once he got back myself and 2 were very angry as he was shirking his cleaning again (he’s also done it many times throughout the year) and I raise my voice to tell him it’s simply not good enough and to f—king help.

c6prod	2019-06-28 21:08:56	ntmgreener	AITA for getting into an email snarkfest with my coworker?	" 

So quick background - my coworker, I’ll call her Erica, has been at my place of work for 15 years in the same position. Mid-level with some independence. She (48F) likes to be seen as the “mother hen” of the office mostly by telling new people about how things have been done in the past and maintaining the status quo. There’s been a lot of turnover recently and her former, older counterparts have been replaced by 25-30 year olds, including me (26F).  I started about two years ago, and since that time have been promoted twice, and now have the same title as her. She’s told me before she thinks I moved up way too fast and that millennials need to “pay their dues”

She and I get along outside of work, but at work she often sends me snarky emails telling me to do things a certain way if I propose a new policy, and will often “call out” team members in emails. I’ve tried talking to her about this outside of work before and she understands it makes me feel attacked and off put. She stops for a couple weeks, and then it starts again.

So, recently she wanted to start a women in the workplace lunch outing/mentoring group. I went a few times and she dominated the conversation and would often just gossip around our team leadership and share her negative thoughts on our new policies. I decided to stop going because I didn’t feel it was a good use of my time and said I was just “too busy”.

A few days ago I stopped by my coworkers cube to talk about an upcoming concert the next weekend. As they are neighbors, Erica likely heard this conversation but didn’t jump in or say anything.

I get back to my desk on the other side of a hallway and Erica had sent me an email saying this:

“If you have time to socialize, you have time to attend our women’s lunches :). So, we will see you at our next meeting” 

This got me pretty enraged because I felt she was monitoring my time and being snarky, so I wanted to set a boundary and decided to write back with this: 

“Hi Erica, Those meetings are optional, and to be honest I like the freedoms to use my break time as I need it to recharge and get my work done. I ask as my coworker that you respect this.”

She wrote back and said “jeez I was just kidding silly you”. 

Since then, anytime I see her It’s uncomfortable. She won’t look me in the eye, won’t engage. Has talked to other coworkers about me but hasn’t directly talked to me in person about anything. Because I’m setting a boundary I don’t want to overengage so I’m just letting things play out, and if she wants to talk, we’ll talk.

Me and my BF look at each other and like almost roll our eyes and she asks my BF if he would break up with me if I got a tat and he said plainly yes he would. She then looks at me and I just say he's allowed to have preferences so that was the end of that. 

So anyway she apparently thinks having a preference is abusive and texts me the next morning saying I shouldn't have to put up with that and all this it's like paragraphs about how I deserve better and should get a tattoo etc (which I never even said I wanted a tattoo I literally just deflected with a joke) and I text her back saying my boyfriend isn't abusive and is allowed to have whatever preferences he wants and that she needs to relax.

c6ppxq	2019-06-28 21:04:56		AITA for not wanting to be my girlfriend’s designated driver?	"My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years now. We moved in together earlier this year. Some friends of hers invited us to go to a party at this concert venue where they play emo music. I’ve never been a fan of this music so I passed on it when they went before. My girlfriend and her friend got drunk and had a good time, but it was fine because the other girl’s boyfriend was there as the DD. 

Today they invite us to go again, but I would have to be the DD for my girlfriend to go. I haven’t had my license for very long, despite being 25. I’m not the greatest driver and I still hardly ever drive on highways. This party would be downtown and at night, which I’m not really comfortable with as far as driving goes. Maybe it’s a stupid fear, but I don’t want to have an accident. My girlfriend usually drives whenever we go anywhere. She’s complained about this before, but she also complains about my driving. She’s driven to things I’ve wanted to go to before, but none of those have involved drinking or being out terribly late. I told her she should just go to this thing with her friends who are going earlier and I’ll pay for the more expensive ticket for her so I can stay home. She said I’m being a selfish asshole because she does so much for me and we’re going to have dinner at my parents house this weekend and she doesn’t want to do that either. I told her that’s not really comparable because it’s ten minutes down the road and doesn’t involve drinking or music that she hates. 

I finally said I’d just drive because the highway will probably be mostly empty anyway, but she’s already pissed because I didn’t immediately say yes. I would just never ask her to do something like this. I know she wouldn’t have fun sitting at a concert full of music that she hates while everyone else gets drunk, but for some reason I’m expected to do this with a smile on my face.

So Anakin is my best friend, and actually lives with Pepper. Pepper and my girlfriend have consistently fought in situations where our entire group has admitted she was totally in the wrong. 

Historically, she has treated people badly. Anakin and I have deemed it because she more or less hates any other woman who she thinks is better than her due to a need for attention. 

So my girlfriend has basically said she never wants anything to do with Pepper, which is fine by me, and I’ll always support my girlfriend in a fight but it puts me in a hard position with my friends. 

So Pepper works retail at a certain store I really love, and there was this expensive jacket that cost upwards of $300. With a summer sale and her employee discount, Pepper was able to get it to me for $35. 

I told my girlfriend and she was FURIOUS. She said I’m letting her control me and think she’s my friend, and that this is the root of why everyone let’s her be shitty. While I agree everyone let’s her kind of be shitty, I view it differently. I view it as a means to an end and I suggested that the fact that I 100% don’t care about her and her life it was an empty gesture which is worse than ignoring her in hatred. 

I’m moving away soon anyway, and I figured that it wasn’t worth it to start fights now—by the time I come back most likely I won’t ever have to see her again. That being said, Anakin has been having his own problems with her and would move out when their lease is up, by which time I’d be able to move back to their area. 

My girlfriend said I’m not supporting her enough, and that if someone that we hated asked her of a favor she’d say no. Clearly I think there’s a disagreement in values at a fundamental level, but AITA??

c6pnj1	2019-06-28 21:00:10	VurigeVuurtoren	AITA for asking my girlfriend to see her parents less?	"I'll start with some background information:
My girlfriend and I met in high school. We started dating in my senior year and have been together ever since.
She is 1 year younger than me and was 2 years below me.

When I started university, we decided we would try long distance. I have traveled ~8 hours every weekend to see her. She never came to me as public transport is free for university students in this country and otherwise it would cost her too much.

She just graduated high school and is going to a university that's relatively close to mine. It would be a total of 4 hours (2 to come, 2 to go) instead of the 8 to go to our parents' home town.
However, when I was talking about how I was happy that I finally didn't have to sit in the train for 4 hour sessions anymore, she said she would probably still be going home every weekend.
I said the following: I totally understand that you still want to go to your parents every weekend in the beginning, but you should also understand that I traveled 8 hours every weekend for 2 years for us, I have missed a lot of events to see you and I would like to stay at my own place more often from now on.

After that she was clearly upset and said I was driving a wedge between her and her parents and if I continued this way, she would always choose her parents over me.

I was kind of shocked since I thought I was being reasonable.

I'd seen them around campus, but that night was the first night we actually had a conversation. The real meat of this issue starts the morning after. The party was at my \[Greek Life\] tower but we had gone back to their dorm, and I spent the night. I got up, was getting dressed. They woke up when I did, the following conversation took place (my best recollection):

Them: ""So am I going to hear from you again?""

Me: ""I'm sure we'll see each other around campus and at parties.""

Them: ""I mean like are you going to text me?""

Me: ""Is there something for us to talk about?""

Them: ""\[exasperated noise\] I guess you're gonna make me say it. I think you're cute and we should hang out.""

Them: ""I think you're cute too but this was a hookup. I was drunk last night, but I remember we were both explicit about that.""

Them: ""I know what we said, but I want to get to know you a little.""

Me: ""I'm flattered, but I'm really just not interested in anything more. If I gave you that impression I'm sorry.""

At this point, I really wanted to fucking leave and I turned to go. **I knew that I had been explicit about my intentions and I was done trying to be polite about it. They got out of their bed and stood in front of the door and pushed me back before I could leave.**

Them(yelling): ""WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO HANG OUT? I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO FUCK BUT NOT ENOUGH TO GO ON A DATE?""

Me (trying to keep my cool after they put their hands on me): ""I'm not looking for anything serious right now. I really don't need to justify myself, I'm just not interested.""

Them: ""THAT'S BULLSHIT. TELL ME WHY.""

Me: ""FINE. We have had literally 1 drunk conversation. You have fucked all four of my best friends, and a bunch more in my \[Greek Life\]. They are all great people, and I see absolutely no reason that you're magically interested in dating me when you weren't interested in them. It seems to me like you've just decided you want to have a \[partner\] now and I'm the first person you've hooked up with since making that choice. Would you be romantically interested in *me* if I had fucked half the people you know? A drunk hookup isn't a foundation for genuine romantic interest. I don't date people after fucking them within an hour after meeting them. If I were interested in you beyond sex, I would have made that clear *before* we had sex.""

By the time I was done ranting they were starting to cry and when they turned away from the door I got out. My best friend says I should have just bullshitted and kept trying to let them down easy, and I'm getting dirty looks from their friends around campus.

AITA?

Edit: It seemed obvious to me too until my friends said I should have just kept going easy on \[hookup\], that's why I'm here for objective opinions."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6pie3	2019-06-28 20:48:29		AITA for not letting my friend change her uni course	"It all started when a friend of mine who i have a crush on talked to me about changing her course after studying for almost a year ( phsyothearpy) which is 3 years course. So she was telling me she is doing this course only beacuse her mom wants her to and she is not enjoying studying phsyo at all and its one of the reasons she is sad and depressed but in the same time she was scared of changing beacuse her parents might get pissed and she doesn't want that to happen 
I was there for her and managed to convince her to just suck it up and finish what she started 
After 1 sem she failed her semester and she had to talk to her parents and be totally honest with them about everything so surprisingly they showed support to whatever she told them amd gave her a chance to choose whatever course  she wants in any country she desire and so she talked to me again to help her i was supportive in the beginning and helped her with researchers and stuff so she can study whatevr she wants but out of sudden she told me that she likes me and she will miss me and stuff and i had to take advantage of that somehow for god knows what reason. The thing about her is she cant make up her mind and make a decision on her own she always asks and follow whatever i say, so i told her of she gonna start over in a new place it will be scary beacuse she will be alone and no one will be with her and she will end up be depressed and lonely and that will make her fail whatever she is studying and i told her that she already finished a year so she is half way there and there is no point of wasting time and money ( we are studying a broad) and in the end you will regret and look back and be like what if i could do it, so you must suck it up and just finish whatver u started."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6phlm	2019-06-28 20:46:43	Tossaway2279	AITA for being to busy to make a few basic measurments	"  

A bit of back story, I am a university student in Bulgaria. My parents live in the UK. I was born in Bulgaria so i have a lot of family here. My parents have also told me to be wary of anyone here, especially people who i have to trust at home, and to never leave them out of sight, out of fear of stealing (this will be important later).

A week ago my dad asked me to make some measurements using a sewing tape measure because he wanted to buy a new wetsuit for me. This was due to the fact that my old one no longer fit and he wanted it for our holiday to Tenerife. He didn't specify a time frame and I didn't have a tape measure since i was in my uni dorm at the time.

Tuesday (25th), I finally sorted all the issues at uni and was finally able to leave so i went to my home town. This is usually a 3 hour journey but was extended to about 7 hours due to the fact that i missed my bus and had to do a change. When i got to my town, there was a large thunder storm and no taxis, as well as being very late. I got home and directly went to sleep.

Wednesday (26th), I had a few issues to sort out in town (my apartment is a long drive/taxi away). A few of the issues involved meeting with family to discuss a few issues that had popped up, such as luggage i need to take back to the UK as well as getting a haircut.

Thursday (27th), This was the first day that the technician came around to fix my balcony. The balcony has been a hazard since i have been little and my parents had been looking for a person to repair it. It had chunks of rock just breaking off, with some so heavy that i could barely lift them myself. This is where i had to stay home for the entire time because my parents told me to be wary of everyone here. The technician worked from 8 AM until 8 PM and left for the day.

Friday (28th), today, the tech came in, with the same times and worked on the balcony, so again i couldn't leave home. At around 10 PM (8PM UK time) my dad calls and tells me that he is very disappointed that I didn't give him my measurements and that he won't be able to buy me a wetsuit. I told him that was fine and that the Scuba centre would provide one anyway (like they did before). He told me that that was the other issue, due to my negligence in performing this simple task, he didn't want to *risk my life* with scuba diving (even though i am a licensed diver, while he never ""officially"" got a license because military service that he worked didn't give them), so he would not allow me to go into the water, just sit on the beach next to it. I got into an argument that if that was the case then i might as well not go and he started saying that he would cancel my ticket to the UK in that case too (i hadn't been to the UK to see my parents in almost a year) and he would also stop all funding for my university studies, leaving me all on my own.

tl:dr - Dad threatens to cut all funding for my university because I failed to fulfil a simple job"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c6phez	2019-06-28 20:46:21		AITA for my expectations?	"I'm in love for the first time in my life. The relationship lasts for three months. We are know each other from more than half a year. From dating app. At the beginning we were spend our days at phone calls only. Literally I was looking for every moment when I could call her. It was incredible, I known at this time that I always have someone who would listen to me.
So we met for the first time, than again and again. At the moment when I realized that it is going to somewhere, I decided to talk with her honest about my feelings. She had quite problem with answering me. I thought 'well, maybe it's too fast', but I known that I am not indifferent to her. She was feeling better when she was texting to me about what she thinks, but that was never as clearly and specific as my confession.
I was full of hope that she just need more time to feel comfortable talking, because honest conversation and not having secrets it's great measure to me.
But it doesn't changed. Dispite asking, many monologs she still keeps quiet.
Our best relation is before, during and after sex and what's even more important when we still joking or talking about stupid things. But then this is so special moments for me that I don't wanna think what would I do if I didn't find her.
Now, it's more common that we spend silent time together. It hurts me, because I don't know what can I do more. She explains that she never couldn't speak to anybody and with me it's diffrent and she talks with me more than everywhen sooner.
I noticed that if I won't start talking or joking we are spending whole day in silence. I expected that in relationship both sides can rely on each other and if someone had a worse day the other will there to consolation.
I will mention that this is my first serious relationship and I am 21. She is 17 and more experienced than I."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So my birthday is this weekend and I'm flying home to see my family, staying with my dad. Usually, when I visit my dad, I also try to find time to visit my grandma. We usually go out to eat or have a family dinner or something. So I worked out a schedule and my grandparents are picking me up on Monday. I assumed we were going to lunch because that's what we talked about on the phone, but we might be going to another family member's place for lunch. 

Either way, my grandma texted me yesterday and said ""your choice: pineapple upside down or carrot cake"" with a birthday cake emoji. Now, I'm not a big fan of either of these cake types. I don't like pineapple upside down cake at all, and I only kind of like carrot cake. I didn't want to be ungrateful, but I also never asked my grandma to make me a cake (she never has before, except maybe when I was a kid). 

I told her I would pick the carrot cake as long as there weren't raisins or nuts in the cake. To me, those things ruin a carrot cake. My friend said I was being a jerk about the cake. So was I TA for being picky about how my grandma could make a cake she is offering to make for me, even though I never asked for a cake?"	No A-holes here	0	0	39.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So last time (exactly 9 weeks ago) literally the day before my infusion, I get a call from my coordinator saying that my nurse had a death in the family and needed to postpone the medication til next week. That screwed up my schedule a bit, and need to suffer feeling ill for another week, but I understand.

Well now today, the day before my my infusion, I get I call from my coordinator saying how my nurse had *another* death in the family and needs to postpone the medication til next week. Now if you had UC, you’ll know the struggle of having flares and pooping 8 times a day.  But after getting medication, it does wonders for me. 

Now this “death” seems a little fishy to me because it just happened to be on the Canadian long weekend which I don’t think I can even enjoy now because of my flares. And the fact that it’s happened TWICE in a row.

A few months ago, some trees in the back of the property I live on were clear cut without my family member's permission.  The new neighbor mistook the location of the property market in the back of the property and has started clearing the area before they realized it wasn't their land and just stopped, leaving the mess for me to clean up.  After that happened I got a little over vigilant and anything that was out of the ordinary I mentioned to my family member. 

Yesterday I noticed in the front of the property that a large pile of branches had been left on what I thought was the corner of FM's land and mentioned it which turned into them confronting the neighbor to have the debris moved. Today, FM's husband came out and showed me where the marker was supposed to be, and it was several feet from where I thought it was. So basically, me saying something caused the neighbor to have to clear branches that were actually on his land, and I obviously owe him an apology.

I tell her the realities of having a kitten. This crushes her dream and makes her disappointed/upset AITA for crushing her dream.


So my sister got a little kitten without doing research or realising how much work it is she only wants a cat be cause she wants to solve her mice problem for good and she got a kitten because she wanted it to grow with her family. I got the cat with her and for the first week it was fine, settled in nicely and used the litter box with frequent but minor accidents, when I left for 3 weeks and I came back she complains about how annoying the cat is. Saying it wants to play all the time and kept having accidents I asked how often she plays with the cat and she says once a day for 10 minuets but I know she has to play multiple times a day to get all the energy out she doesn't clean the litter often I understand she doesn't have the time, she has two kids. But why get an animal when you don't have time for it. Whenever I'm staying over the cat is perfectly behaved cause I play with him. I told her she should get sell the kitten and get an older less attention needing cat. If I could I would adopt the kitten and get her an older cat i would but I have a parrot and my mum won't be able to handle the mess of a cat and a parrot. When I told her all the work that needs to be put in she sounded upset and disappointed that she won't get what she's looking for and I feel like a total asshole. But then 3ekjlj with her feet and it's giving her scratches and bites.

EDIT: so I've talked to her, she says that she plays with the cat whenever the baby goes to sleep during the day and during the night so that's like 2-4 times during the day and once during the night however she doesn't play as long as I do or as vigorous which explains the cats extra energy, I told her to get a remote control electric toy to fix that and she's gonna clean the litter more regularly. She doesn't want to get rid of the cat no matter how much she says she dislikes him or calls him my cat whenever I come over its clear she doesn't truly hate the cat"	Not the A-hole	0	0	133.0	19.0	0.0	0.0
c6pb5a	2019-06-28 20:32:52	ChillyyCanadian	AITA: for ’not’ defending my friend?	"~Sorry in advance for my terrible grammar, etc~

I was walking home with 3 of my friends. 1 was white (Ruby), 1 was brown (Maggie), and the other was black (Jen). We were sitting on this tree as we have for the past week or so, and these 3 white girls walk up to the stream bed in front of the tree. 

Maggie had previously said that they called her and Jen, retards. We didn't really want any trouble so we grabbed our bags and walked across the pipe. Jen had looked back a couple of times (the oldest chick had red hair and huge ass hoop earrings so I don't blame her). 

Then hoopie started screaming racial slurs. Her most popular: ”Hey, blackie! Stop looking at me!” and she just kept going on and on and on, Ruby and I turned around and gave them the finger as Jen was clearly distressed. Then Maggie screamed ”H0e!!” at the top of her lungs. 

They began to follow us, my first thought was that they'd try to cut us off theough a parking lot. They didn't, at first, but by the time we had reached the gas station they emerged. 

Then again she started to panic. I told her to stop looking back, that's one of the main reasons why they were following us. We crossed 2 small streets and arrived at the intersection. Eventually, they caught up to us. ”Do you have a problem with me, Blackie? Why do you keep looking at me... Huh?” she just kept going on and on. Until Jen said,” I don't have a problem with you”. But she still kept calling her blackie and talking about how the tree was hers and why we were ”dirtying” it. 

That's when I said,” The tree isn’t your spot, its a public place and anyone and everyone can go there..” she then turned around and said (to what I'm guessing are her sisters) ”Hah, ghee, they think it's not my spot!” and chuckled. She then said,” Now you and your dumbass friend can't even look at me.” I then leant over and stared her straight in the eyes. She didn't seem to notice and continued to bring down, my friend.

I told Jen to give a reaction but she snapped and screamed:” Go away!!”.
She began to cry and the bitch walked away laughing. How sad does your goddamn life have to be to put down others because of their skin colour? 

Earlier that day my black friend also got hit by a car. She was fine (her bike protected her from the hit) just had a few scapes etc. 

So we walked home and I talked shit about the chick to hopefully make my friend feel better. 

Then the next day at school Maggie (who only saw a portion of it) told our drama queen friend (that we all put up with after I told her she shouldn't have told anyone,  Maggie said it was Jen’s business and she could share it with whomever. But my black friend didn't originally say anything, Maggie did. Then Jen slags me for ”only talking shit behind her back”. When I was the only person who fully stood up for her. Honestly, I don't think anyone would have said something rude in front of that psychopath as we would have been hit.

As we got older though we started to get more and more cold towards each other we started fighting every time we saw each other and it felt like she was starting to resent me as she come to my house to spend the night the first night she’d be fine but then in the morning she would straight up ignore me. I also felt kind of manipulated by her too because most of our fights would start with me telling to stop doing something and she would ignore me I’d get mad we’d fight for a bit then she’d guilt trip me by ignoring me one time I even cried in front of while she ignored me. She would also ghost me and and sometimes straight up insult. Don’t get the rong idea here though she a lot of great quality’s too like she was a really great listener I knew if something was on my mind I could always go to her, she was really funny too she could always do something to make me laugh, and I feel we had a pretty deep connection like we could tell each other anything I think she really cared about me and about what I had to say.

I plan to have 6 bridesmaids. These include 3 of my closest friends, 2 of my cousins, and my sister, who is the maid of honour. My fiancé has 6 groomsmen, one of whom is my brother.

My fiancé has 1 older half sister, who is 26. I’ve only met her twice and Im not very close with her. She and my fiance were close as children but now they have grown apart over the past few years. She is still invited to the wedding, of course, along with her husband and 2 kids.

Now, there is some disagreement over her role in my wedding. I picked out my bridal party almost as soon as I got engaged. Last week, my fiance told me that his sister was wondering whether I’d make her a bridesmaid. I told him that I’m only planning to have 6 and that I don’t really know her well enough to make her my bridesmaid. He said that was understandable and told her.

Yesterday, she texted me randomly and said I’m free to do what I want for my wedding, but she just thinks it’s a bit rude that I didn’t even ask her to be a part of my wedding. I told her that my bridesmaids are people who I’m particularly close with, and besides, they all know each other and we live in the same city, while she lives like 6 hours away. Also, I told her that she may not have much in common with them (they are all between the ages of 21-23) and preferably my bridesmaids are unmarried.

She then asked if she could make her daughter, 4, a flower girl. I said I already have a flower girl (a family friend’s daughter). She sounded annoyed after but said she understood.

Today, my fiance told me at breakfast that his sister is very upset I’m not making more of an effort to include her in my wedding. She said something about how I’m superficial and the only reason she’s not included is because she’s not “hot enough” to be a bridesmaid. Yes, my friends are pretty attractive but that’s not the reason why I didn’t include her! I’m just not that close with her and she wouldn’t mesh well with the other girls.

My fiance says I should consider making her daughter a co-flower girl, just to appease her. I said I’ll think about it. He says ultimately it’s my decision but I need to act like the bigger person here. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Ok so some backstory, I am living at a lot that my boyfriend's mom owns. She had a partnership with a longtime friend who passed last year, and with evidence of contracts from their llc she was able to prove that she was the rightful owner of the property, as it was under the llc name. The man's son is(was at the time) a prestigious lawyer, and decided he had claim over everything, and tried suing for it. He came onto this property and began taking everything he believed was his. Apparently the chief of police or whoever has high standing in the department in our small town is his cousin, and was helping him, but that's another story, I dont know all the details. From my understanding the lawyer has been fighting a losing battle, but the legal stuff is not over yet, so I have been warned by my boyfriends family that since he has been laying low since February, I should be fine but if anyone comes on the property to call them and they'll call their lawyer to rack up more evidence against him.

So I (21F) am naturally cautious when people come to my living quarters. It's in a remote area, in a dead end neighborhood. There's 'no trespassing' and 'private property' signs posted at the entrance. Today as I was leaving to go run some errands a four wheeler pulls into my yard. I go out to greet them and say 'can I help you?' This older woman and I guess either her friend or family member were sitting in it (both female). The driver said 'oh, I'm just showing her around!' I said 'ok?' And kinda glared at them. Then I guess to make it more ok she said 'I am *my boyfriends mom*'s friend. I just repeated 'ok?' And glared at them till they backed out.

 Immediately called my boyfriends dad since hes the one who usually comes up and does yardwork and was planning on coming later in the day. I told him ' I didnt mean to be an ass to them. If they had come and said 'hey we're neighbors just wanted to say hi' that's fine but just coming up to a strangers residence with a no trespassing and private property sign to 'show around' my place is definitely trespassing, unwelcome, and creepy. Especially to a 21 year old female who is alone'
He said hell talk to them and tell them not to do it again. Since I've had time to think about it, i realize they were just my neighbors, and not part of the lawyer's scheme, and I do know that she was friends with bf's mom. AITA for reacting the way I did?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c6p6hl	2019-06-28 20:22:40		AITA for getting back at a car dealer who didn’t take me seriously ?	"For motivation my boss asked me to go into Aston Martin to check the price for a new vehicle. 

I went into the dealership in a suit and I made my enquires. The staff were incredibly rude and told me that they would take my details down and contact me for a meeting to discuss the car further. They told me I wasn’t even allowed to open the car door unless I had a meeting. 

The sales rep took my details down on a piece of paper which was odd to me as most lesser car dealerships take my details down on a database. 

I didn’t take it to heart, I’m 23 and I must say myself I do look younger than my age. I gave them a week to contact me. They didn’t. 

A friend of mine send me proof of funds for a deal we were working on and he had over 1 million pounds in his account.

I decided I would go back to the dealership and show them his proof of funds and ask them to apologise for not taking me seriously. 

I did so and told the sales rep that for everyday he didn’t contact me he should take £5000 off the price which is £40k and I’ll give him a week to consider it or I’ll buy it elsewhere. I had the proof of funds ready and was willing to show him but he didn’t want to see it. 

I feel kinda bad for doing this. Although I he does give me a discount... I can buy it."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6p3bn	2019-06-28 20:16:02	shhfhebaib	AITA for not wanting to go on a date with someone with the same medical condition as me (narcolepsy)?	"Background on my condition: 

I have narcolepsy, a condition characterized by excessive sleepiness where your brain is constantly on the edge of REM sleep because my brain doesn’t produce the chemicals it needs to make me feel awake. Even with a good night’s sleep, I’m basically functioning as if I haven’t slept in 2 days. I experience constant tiredness, have hallucinations when I go to sleep and wake up, and can have sleep attacks where I basically can’t keep my head up.

I manage it pretty well. I take Concerta (time-release Adderall that serves as a stimulant) and try to get as much sleep as possible. But it’s still a daily factor in my life. My ex-boyfriend was really great with me. If I got too tired, we’d go home. If I had an occasional bad day health-wise, he’d be patient and even get me food or groceries because I’d be too tired to leave the house. Since he woke up before me, he’d wake me up, remind me to take my meds, and let me go back to sleep so I could wake up with them already active. Even though my ex was great (broke up because of circumstances), I can function fine by myself. He was just a support system. 



Recently, I matched with someone on Tinder and we got talking. We were supposed to go out for drinks tomorrow night but he mentioned that he has narcolepsy. I thought that was kind of cool that there are other people near me with the condition because it’s pretty rare but realized that I could not, under any circumstances, get romantically involved with another narcoleptic.

It’s just one date, but on the chance that we ended up really liking each other, I didn’t want to risk it. My narcolepsy is a huge burden in my daily life and I know how it feels to be constantly tired, occasionally agoraphobic, and definitely helpless on some days. If I end up with someone, I’d like that support system again and to be able to support them in whatever they need as well. But I just don’t want to have narcolepsy take over even more of my life. I’m totally aware a first date is very low commitment but I figured it’d be nicer to cut it off ahead of a meeting to not waste his time.

I sent him the following message: “I appreciate your honesty but I’m also narcoleptic. You seem like an awesome guy but I don’t think it’s a good idea to go out with someone who also has narcolepsy. Two sleepy people can be trouble! I hope you understand and I’m really sorry about this.”

He replied with a whole string of messages saying that I was prejudiced against the disabled and I need to learn how to be more open-minded. 

I considered my line of thinking as logical and genuinely didn’t want to hurt his feelings. Also, I’m confused on how I’m being prejudiced because I have the same condition he has.

AITA by not giving this guy a chance just because we have the same medical issue?

This happened a few months ago. In high school I was close friends with a girl, let's call her A. We got along very well, but we had completely different lifestyles and drifted apart once I graduated. I didn't mind much, she often tried to pressure me into going out with her or drinking more than I wanted to, or doing drugs. (Nothing against alcohol or drugs) 

About two and a half years later, with no further contact than Facebook birthday wishes, she texts me out of the blue to let me know she's pregnant. I was surprised but congratulated her and we chatted a bit. 

It's hard to explain, but since then she's been acting like we've always been best friends and nothing has changed. 

She wanted me to throw her a baby shower, she's been asking for pretty expensive gifts, jokes about how her baby can call me ""auntie"", and already making plans for me to babysit. 

This whole thing feels weird to me. So I asked her what made her contact me again in the first place. She told me we're close friends so of course I should know. When I asked about us not speaking for 2.5 years she got defensive and said she's been busy. 

I told her that it feels like her friends after high school ditched her when she couldn't drink or do drugs anymore, and that I don't consider her a friend anymore. 

 She left crying. My mom thinks I really crossed the line, because she's pregnant and obviously needs support. And I do feel bad. 

So, AITA?

Edit: I did try talking to her about all of this before, it didn't work. She wouldn't talk about it. Kept dodging questions.  At that point I felt used and was admittedly rude."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6oyo5	2019-06-28 20:05:40	lunaferrin	AITA for shutting my mother out of my life?	"My mother is a very complicated woman. She has multiple mental illnesses and we do not whatsoever need to be living together. When I was was 17 I got pregnant with my now 8 month old daughter and moved in with my now husband.  As my mothers health is declining from an accident back in 2017, (she was hit by a car and broke her neck) things have just gotten worse mentally for her and me.
   Both her and my anxiety and depression has tripled, but I'm handling it as well as I can for my child. A couple of days ago my mom was babysitting my daughter and she called me saying she thought she had the measles. I immediately picked her up and told my mom that I dont think it was measles, as she had no other symptoms besides bumps, and that I thought they were flea bites. 

     She immediately started getting defensive and trying to force me to take my daughter to the hospital. Normally I would just to ease her mind, but right now we do not have insurance and cant afford a hospital bill just to be told its flea bites. When I told her that I was putting my foot down and not taking her she lost her mind. She started calling me a bad mom, saying that I dont deserve my daughter and that when my daughter gets older she will know how much of a bad mom I am. 
  I then said I will not let my daughter be around someone who bashes me because I am the one she looks up to and I would not want her being treated like that. I told my mom she could either learn to respect me or not be in our lives at all.
I then stopped replying to her and she kept messaging me, blowing up my phone saying she will find my daughter and tell her everything, that I'm a bad mom, ect. I told her to stop messaging me and that it was harrassment and it will not be tolerated. 

The next day my husband was on his way to work and he passed by her house and saw that she impounded his 1999 Toyota Avalon. He was devastated. She shut our phones off, and refused to give us any of the baby stuff that was at her house. I'm not worried about the stuff she bought, I just wanted what I bought but she called the police and he said i cant force her to give me my stuff back. That's fine. The last straw was when she called C.P.S. on us. She told them that we do a bunch of drugs in front of the baby, and I prostitute myself for drugs. 

I talked to some of my friends and they said I should take her to court for harrassment, defamation, and making a false c.p.s. claim. So, I was wondering AITA here? Or WIBTA if I took her to court?

To preface this story, I am 15, and will be turning 16 in two days. I chronically forget to do things for the birthdays of my family, which I do realize is a jerk move on my behalf, and something I am working on fixing, though it is not the focus here. My mom decided, since I didn't do anything for her birthday, she would do nothing for mine. She also said she would allow mw to do anything I planned myself

Though I was upset, I figured it was fair enough, I have a job, I could do my own thing. I worked with my friends, who ended up planning a surprise party for me, as well as I scheduled things I wanted to do, namely attending a global food exhibition in my town, as well as going to dinner with my grandparents and dad(my parents are divorced). None of these plans involve my mom, which I thought was fair, since she said she didn't want to do anything, so I made it so she wouldn't be involved.

Cut to today. My sister had told my mom about the party, and I was asked about it today. Long story short, she told me I was being insensitive for not including her in my plans, saying that I was supposed to ask her to do something, after she told me she wouldn't do anything.

c6os32	2019-06-28 19:51:31		AITA for reporting my coworker to my boss for sitting around while I worked?	"My coworker, Brad, is a nice enough guy. There are three people in our department. Me, my boss, and Brad. My boss has been working in the facility since he was 18, nearly 10 years. Brad has worked there 3.5 and I have worked here 1.5 years. That's why I feel kinda bad. Brad has two years of work on me plus he's about 30 years older than both my boss and I. We work in assisted living. 

I was working the bar from 4-5 as I do every day. Occasionally, Brad will be doing something somewhere else. Working, but not with me which is fine. Even though they're old, I still make at least 30 drinks and it's nice to have a bit of help. Well, at 4 pm I come down and begin working the bar and I see Brad sitting in the front office. He must be preparing for tomorrow, I think. Which he sometimes does. But a half hour passes, then 45 minutes, and I can still see him just sitting there. I go over finally and ask him why he isn't helping. He said ""I had a hard day.""

Now, to me, that's a horrible reason for not helping me. I've never made a formal complaint but he does this ALL the time. 

when I brought it up to my parents they said ""that's how it is working anywhere."" Well, yeah, I know. But that doesn't mean it's acceptable behavior. I think my main issue is that I feel bad because he is working in a department with two young people who seem like they're ganging up on him. 

Help me gain some perspective please. 


TL;DR:My coworker did nothing for an hour while I worked within eyesight, and this is normal behavior. I reported him to my boss, but feel bad because we're young and he's my dad's age."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"Bella (fake name) tends to post a lot of news articles on Facebook, especially news from other countries. She posted one where this Brazilian model had been stabbed to death by three female gang members. The thumbnail showed three women in masks throwing up gang signs that they had shared on social media before they committed the crime. I clicked on it expecting to read an article, but instead was directed to a video of the stabbing. It was very graphic and I was not at all expecting to see someone getting stabbed in the face and neck. It took me a second to close out of it because I couldn’t find the X to close it and saw more than I ever wanted to. I went to comment and ask her to take it down, but she had already left a comment first saying “That video was so hard to watch? :(“ So I responded “Bella why the hell would you share it then?”

And it’s not exactly the first time. She also likes to post graphic post abortion photos of babies that are well past 23 weeks. I’ve tried explaining to her that they’re inappropriate and usually those websites are just fake and full of propaganda, and while I can’t control what she does on her page she should at least block those posts from our younger family members. She just says that it makes her sad and feels like people need to learn the “truth” about why abortion should be illegal because teen moms are “killing innocent 8 month old babies”. Worst part is that she posts all of these right alongside photos of her newborn daughter and her older kids, saying that they’re “blessings and not mistakes”. 

Usually I just hide the post, or unfollow her for 30 days, but once I saw a literal video of someone practically being beheaded on camera I told my husband I was going to report the post. He said that IWBTA if I did because they could suspend her account and it isn’t fair to her because she has a lot of photos from over the years on her Facebook that she could lose. I told him that she has her own young children on Facebook and they could see that, and our nieces and nephews have her on Facebook and I don’t want them seeing that.

My eldest Jack is the most ''successful'' of our three. I don't have a favorite child of course, but I am the most proud of him. He's going to make our family proud because of what he's done. Not only is he going to graduate from an Ivy League school but he's got an internship lined up with a prestigious firm. He's extremely confident, social and also good looking so it's not a surprise he's popular with ladies. 

He hasn't been the type for relationships but he got into one with a girl we can call Danielle about 6 months ago. He hasn't brought her to the house, they mostly stay at uni together and he doesn't want her to visit. It's clear he's not taking it seriously as she seems to be way more into him than he is her. Anyway, he came to visit recently and left his phone unlocked. 

My youngest saw that and instantly checked his phone and found lots of messages/nudes sent from other girls. He's clearly cheated which is confirmed by the multiple texts to other girls. He showed Anna and then me. I took a look, and didn't like what I saw. I decided to also tell my husband and he flat out said ''Don't bother me with this shit I have more important things to do'' (which to his credit, is true. He works close to 80 hours a week. Yes we are very well financially but it's largely due to him/his connections at a prestigious firm). 

Anna and Mike were disgusted and demanded that I punish Jack. They confronted Jack and he told them to ''Fuck off''. I had a word with Jack and told him this behavior isn't good, but that's about as far as I will involve myself. I'm incredibly proud of my son for doing what he's done and told him that although I don't condone his behavior, I still love him and if he needs anything that he can always ask me. So we hugged and then I dropped him off to see his friends.

Now my other two are angry at me and Anna said that I'm condoning misogyny. I said it's not like that. I took them aside and calmly explained to them that they need to focus on their lives, because quite frankly, I don't like their career choices. Anna wants to study some sort of Sociology degree and Mike wants to become a YouTuber. I told them that they I'll take them seriously once they start taking themselves seriously like Jack and now they called me every name under the sun. Well I told my husband and now he's super pissed at them and is going to have a stern word with them. Anna is 18 so we can't punish her, but now I am considering punishing Mike for snooping on Jack's phone. They still won't talk to me, AITA?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Is this normal? He takes it personally and it upsets him because he wants us to play together but I just would really prefer if we had different hobbies at this point.

c6oiyw	2019-06-28 19:31:11		AITA for blanking a guy i'm seeing when I was with my co-workers?	"I understand how the title sounds but let me explain.

I'n not out as gay, in fact i'm not 100% sure I am gay. I'm 29 and I've only ever been with women. And I've liked many of the women I've been with, though never had a long lasting relationship. But, to cut a very long story short, I ended up in a ""friends with benefits"" relationship with a male acquaintance about 5 weeks ago. I told him from the get go that I'm not sure if I'm gay, and until I know my ""deal,"" I don't want to go public. He said he understood and  I had nothing to worry about. 

Cut to last week and I'm walking out of a cafe at lunch with my co-workers and my friend with benefits is walking towards me. If I were alone I would have stopped and spoke to him, but because of the situation I walked right by him and didn't acknowledge him. He didn't look mad, so I assumed he got it.

He didn't message me that night, so I messaged him the next night asking how he was and he was very passive aggressive. When I finally got him to tell me what was going on, he said he felt insulted that I ignored him when I was with my co-workers. He knew from the get go that our relationship was a private one, but he thinks I should still have stopped and spoken to him. He is a very out and proud gay man, and all the power to him - I'm glad he's comfortable with himself, but i'm not and I didn't want to talk to him with my very stereotypically ""mens men"" co-workers.

If I am being an asshole I'll apologize to him, but he did say from the beginning that I'd have no pressure to come out publicly until I know where I'm at."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6ocpu	2019-06-28 19:16:44	Minter_moon	WIBTA for not having another kid?	"Repost bc I exceeded character limits. 

I have a 3 year old. His biological father is not in the picture and basically never has been. I've always been content with that and started looking to date again when he was around 9 months old. I wasn't expecting to hit the jackpot but I did. My husband is the best man I've ever known and we are the absolute best of friends. He took my son in as his own and loves him to death. I'm so so grateful for him every day and my son adores him. It's just an overall awesome situation I never thought would happen. 

Okay. So my husband has always gone back and forth about wanting to have a child of his own. I've gone back and forth about it too since I had my son and ultimately I really, sincerely do not want to have another one. I have a lot of varying reasons for this.

 My husband does want one of his own. Mostly for the ""novelty"" of having a child with someone you love, passing on genes etc. A child who is biologically his that he helped create. I totally understand why he would want that and I empathize completely with how he feels. Although other times he will say it sounds nice, but he could really live without it and it's not the upmost important thing to him, he sees more benefits to NOT having another one etc. I think he feels like that sincerely at times but deep down he still wants one of his own. 

Today it came up again after a long period of time of not discussing it at all. We were talking about some bad shit happening in the world and I said that it's another reason I feel I don't want another child. From there it spiraled. My husband said that I'm denying him the opportunity to have one of his own. He said that I don't want another one because I'm lazy and simply don't want to put in the effort to raise another child. It got nasty. By the end of it after we both kind of cooled down the tone was basically ""if it happens it happens, if it doesn't it's whatever"" but now I feel this massive weight of pressure and guilt that I'm not sure how to get past. 

I get where he's coming from. I truly do. And I know theres a big possibility that down the road he will end up resenting me if I don't decide to have another child. But I absolutely cannot force myself to want it. I can't make myself have a kid out of obligation. There is no part of me that wants another kid. Honestly, I didn't ever want to have kids in the first place but shit happens I guess. I love being a mom, I love my son to death. I know there is a possibility one day I'll change my mind, and I accept that, but I don't want my husband to bank on that happening. 

So WIBTA if I remained adamant in my convictions to never have another kid for my husband's sake?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

First off, I wanted to thank everyone for their opinions and comments. I’ve trying to get through them all and hope to reply today and tomorrow.

So my husband and I sat down and talked to her again and really stressed how we want to help her but we need to compromise. We payed out our offers and just told her think about it. We could tell she still was angry but we just left it at that.

Yesterday we took our daughter for a spinal tap and a IV port for her chemo in the morning. She had her first round yesterday afternoon and is now resting in her hospital room. She asleep and tired so it’s pretty tough to watch. 

My sister stayed home while we took our daughter and my husband and I decided that I would run home, grab some stuff for her and us and just make sure my sister was fine. I went home and the house was empty.  I didn’t know where my sister went but I wasn’t too concerned because she’s 18 and I figured she was seeing the city.

I went back to the hospital, tried calling her a few times on the way and told my husband. He told me not to worry yet because she was an adult. This morning at around 5 I got a text from her that said “I’m going to take a few days on my own and will be back. I just can’t handle the stress right now. I’m not going to answer your calls but I’m okay and I’m a safe location.” I immediately got upset because it wasn’t fair that she was treating me and my family like this. I don’t need her coming in and out of our lives like this.

She’s an adult so there’s not much I can do but I am very worried about her. I know she’s very street smart but it’s New York and she’s new to town. I just hope she comes back soon because we all need her."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

The night continues and my mom decides she wants to sleep on the porch around 11:30 so she goes out and LEAVES the main door open, so now both doors are open. Normally they check to make sure the screen door is closed I guess tonight they did not. In the morning I wake up to a scream and the cat is dead in the road. They basically immediately blame me and tell me I’m responsible for the cats death and to take responsibility, repeating over and over that I’m the reason the cat is dead. I had hardly anytime to Grieve and that pushed me over the edge I told them they were disgusting and pitiful to do that and left.

&#x200B;

Background: Fiance and I have been together for 3 years. She has a child and i've been around to help raise him this whole time. I contribute very much to helping with the kid. She is also a sick person and has to take a lot of medications and is quite sick right now. She also just lost her job due to her illness. I contribute very much financially to everything. She has been to the hospital quite a bit and bed ridden the last month. I was there for everything making her food, taking her to the ER, getting her medications, watching her child when she can barely get up to walk. 

&#x200B;

She drinks a lot. And isn't a nice person when she drinks. I don't really drink anymore because i've been healthy and I enjoy doing  She felt better one night and we got into it after some drinks. I went to stay with my parents for about a week. This whole time she's telling me she's not sure she can do it anymore etc etc. At the end of the week she's wanting me to come home. So I come back and everything is actually really great. 

&#x200B;

Last weekend I get a call from her ex's (child's father) girlfriend. Saying she's been cheating on me with him. Now this gf is known to be pretty crazy regardless so I took it with a grain of salt. But long story short she was...virtually. She ended up drinking while I was gone and was sexting him. No pictures were evidently sent, but not sure I believe it. 

&#x200B;

Now some background on him. We get along great honestly. He's done some very bad things to her however. He took her to court about 6 months ago to sue for more time. I paid over $2k for a lawyer for her to fight it. He also slept with her friend. Pretty obvious she should hate this guy but she just forgives and goes back to being friends with him. She's just so easy on him for huge wrongs he's done, but if I say one thing she doesn't even want to be around me. Which was where most of our arguments came from. Me just being like you go so easy on him but if I say one thing you don't like the next few days are going to suck for me. 

&#x200B;

She says she's incredibly sorry and I do believe her. But I don't think I can go back. Some people's reactions are ""oh it wasn't physical?"" and seems like I should let it go. But some people are telling me I dodged a bullet. Also she will still have to always be in communication with him. It's not like she can just cut him out. So it will just always be there, forever. I love her to death but this has destroyed me. On-top of being guilty that she is incredibly ill and I am not there be there to help financially now that she has lost her job.

I asked him if he’d mind not parking there because it is a handicap spot, thinking maybe he’s in a rush and didn’t notice.  He just told me too “mind my own business” and proceeded to go inside.  Normally bank visits aren’t that long and I don’t know the person or his medical history, but it did bother me.

*Edit*: I’m in Texas, and I did look at his plates and they had no handicap marking or symbol.  This stuff bothers me because my grandmother has MS and can hardly walk.

     So recently my brother and I both got rolos (a chocolate candy if people haven’t heard of them) and we split them evenly between us and we each put our own candy in separate bags and took them into separate rooms. My brother ate all his candy pretty quickly, while I just ate like one a day. Anyway the problem comes when I find a bunch of mine missing. I ask my brother about it and he admits that he ate some. 
     This was all like two weeks ago, and my family is going on a trip with a long flight next week and we always get candy for the plane ride. While we were at the store I mentioned that I should get extra because my brother ate a bunch of my candy before (I wasn’t that serious, if she said no i would’ve dropped it). My mom then said that it was bad of my brother to eat my candy, but I shouldn’t ‘taunt’ my brother with my remaining candy. I never taunted him in any way at all. What she was referring to was that I left the candy in the view of people who walk past my room when the doors open. 
     When I told her she was being ridiculous and that it’s not my fault he can’t control himself my mom basically said that if it happened again in the future it would be my fault because “you shouldn’t leave yummy food in front of a bear”. I replied saying that people aren’t animals and we should have self restraint and that she’s victim blaming. She said she hated language like “victim blaming” and said that I would just take the problem away if i just moved my candy to a drawer instead of on top of the dresser. I said that “that isn’t the point, if I feel like leaving my candy on top of my dresser in my own room I should be able without worrying about people eating it, it’s not like i’m leaving it in the kitchen” She said I was starting this stupid argument and I should just let it go.

B has started seeing this guy a couple weeks ago. She's smitten. All she talks about is how great he is. I haven't had the chance to meet him yet. But from what she's told me, He's financially set. He's older (were in our late 20s he's in his late 30s) He has a lot of the same views as her. She's planning on traveling the world with him. She wants to marry him and have his babies. I've been with my bf for 3 1/2 years and it's getting to the point of where I would *love* for him to ask me to be his wife. I don't think he's ready quite yet and that's okay. I'll be right here next to him regardless. (Dropping very strong hints) I don't remember being this infatuated with my bf when we first started dating. Honestly, I think over infatuation is unhealthy. B hardly knows this guy, and no one has really met him yet, but that doesn't stop her from saying things like ""I'm in love with him"" or ""We will probably get married before you and D."" 🙄 I'm hoping this is just a really strong honeymoon phase that will pass with her and I've even voiced that to her. B's response ""Our honeymoon phase will never end"" like how fucking exahusting is that?!  At some point, don't you just want to be with someone with out having to be so grossly smitten and still love them unconditionally?  I haven't actually celebrated my birthday in a couple of years, for really dramatic, mostly unrelated reasons. Actually celebrating my birthday is kind of a big deal for me, I'm scared it's going to be just another shitty day where I feel super depressed. I'm celebrating the day before, which is a Saturday, which my bf works, so he plans on spending all day Sunday with me instead.  B is my only friend that I hang out with on a regular basis. I don't want to fuck this friendship up, because if we're all being honest here, she's my best friend. I care about her and I want her to be happy. I'm very skeptical about her new relationship, mostly just based off of how she 'finds it so perfect.' Nothing is perfect. A good relationship is a lot of hard work. When she talks about her new found dude, I feel like she's attempting to  undermine the relationship I have and that I built with my bf. Because he doesn't own like 5 businesses and travel the world all the time, and we live in a trailer, he's not good enough for me? I love our trailer. And my bf is happy with his work, and is still able to pay his bills. Why can't that be enough?

The only problem is that it seems that in some situations she lacks a backbone. 

Recently she called me in tears about how a work colleague had been constantly playfully touching her up at work. He’s apparently one of those weird people who is touchy with a lot of girls. My girlfriend told me he had touched her a lot more than usual and had even breathed down her neck despite her telling him to stop. She told me that he always does it in such a jokey way that when she tells him to stop he never takes it seriously, although it makes her so uncomfortable it brought her to tears. 

There were incidents before this, apparently her ex also had a massive problem with her colleague. She’s told me that he also honks his horn at 14 year old girls and is a massive creep.

We discussed it and came to the conclusion that next time she saw him she should take him to one side and really tell him how uncomfortable he makes her. She has evidence of him drinking at work so could easily get him fired, thereby using that as ammunition she could get him to take her seriously. I obviously wanted her to get him fired right away but she wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt which is fair enough. 

She had work with the same guy again today but didn’t say anything because she doesn’t want to ‘make a fuss’ or ‘cause drama’.  I am quite pissed off and disappointed with her because she’s just throwing away her self respect and letting people get away with treating her like shit.

c6o25n	2019-06-28 18:53:18	thomasdatapeworm	AITA For not giving my roommate a permanent parking spot?	"This is the first disagreement Ive really had with my roommate, so I wanted to get a second take 

Im a college student currently living in a condo owned by my parents, I room with my brother and friend who ive known since Elementary. My brother and I get to stay there on the basis that we paid off our schooling through scholarships, and my roommate pays about 500 dollars. The rent covers his own room, utilities, and laundry, so its a pretty sweet gig and much cheaper than similar housing since my parents have known him. The condo has a 2 car garage we can park in, and from the very beginning my parents made it clear that parking in there would and would always be a first come first serve basis. The other options are park in the neighborhood guest parking (very close) but risk a ticket from the HOA if your car is there too frequently, or park on a nearby curve (a slight walk away) if theres a spot available.

My brother and I used to share a car so parking in the garage was never an issue. but a few months ago we each got our own car. At first, my brother  and I would let him park in the garage out of courtesy, but we both got warnings and parking for us became either get lucky with a spot on the curb or risk a ticket. This went on for a few months, until I noticed my roommate would sometimes be gone until very late at night, leaving the spot in the garage open. so I decided to start taking it. This went on for a few weeks no questions asked, but recently my rommate came to us angry that he didnt have a permanent parking spot. My brother offered to compromise with some sort of system of who gets what day, but he didnt like that at all since ge felt he was being punished for us getting another car and hadnt been able to park overnight for the past couple of weeks. My rebuttal basically was

1. My parents made it clear that parking was first come first serve basis and that still applied with 3 cars.

2. Me and my brother had been having to park our cars overnight other places for MONTHS, so to complain for not getting the spot for the last couple of weeks seemed kinda farfetched. On the same note, he was consistently out til very late so he cant be that mad he wasn't getting the overnight parking

3. Kinda a stretch, but my brother and I have both received warnings from the HOA due to us having to use the guest parking, my roommate hasnt gotten any so I think its kinda fair he parks at the guest if the spots are taken.

On the same token I dont think hes financially obligated to have it, my parents already give him a great deal and if he really wants a guranteed spot he can pay for it like he would anywhere else. My parents basically sided with me and my brother on some sort of schedule but they are my parents so I wanted another look at the situation.

EDIT: We are looking for a more permanent solution to avoid any tickets, I just wanted to know if I was justified on my stance."	Not the A-hole	0	0	3.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

The clothes i set to dry for 1hr 15min and the towels for 1hr 30min because they are thicker. (Dryers are 'good')



I show up about 1hr 45 min later which was late I agree I was cooking and cleaning and lost track (meaning 30 min after clothes should be done drying and 15 min after the towels. 


So I return I see my shirts and gf underwear and stuff slightly damp (only two articles of clothing werre slightly damp) on the crappy dryer. And the towels done inside the machine as planned.


I happen to see the guy and tell him shit. He says he needed to do laundry for his daughter. I tell him he could use the other dryer and that shot ain't cool. He says I took ober an hours. I said bull shit cuz it's barely 1130 and the was room opened at 8, and I did laundry around 9 so the timing dont make sense. (Also our wash room is slow.)


I told him if I see his daughters clothes im gonna do what he did to my gfs. (His kid comes over like once a month) and is like 7 or something)


Then he gets pissed. And talks shig hard.


I say go on your with your day. You don't need to do laundry anymore. Cuz the buiding maintenance guy walked by. He asked whats up and said just dont worry about it (he's a good man)


Was i wrong? Am I an ass? Im not mad. I understand what he did. I left one machine alone for close to 30 min. I think if I was 1hr too long I would be an ass tho."	Asshole	0	0	8136.0	601.0	0.0	0.0

I moved to a new house recently and discovered my neighbours are in a band and they have band practice at the house a few nights a week. The walls are paper thin and so when they start I have to stop whatever I'm watching on TV cause I can't hear it anyway. It sounds like I'm in the room with them. So AITA/WIBTA if I play loud music to try and drown out the sound? I've done it a few times but felt kinda bad.  If I can hear them they can sure hear my music so I don't know if it would interrupt with their band practice. I get on with the neighbours so I don't want to start any drama.

She says to me: ""u/Morangatang , can you go downstairs and get the tap from the garage?""  It's a crystal-looking bucket with a spigot on it, very common for sangria, and it was attached to a stand to elevate it (the stand happened to be made out of the same clear plastic that the tank was).  

Now I had never inspected this thing too close, because it always just sat on a shelf, and also I don't drink.  I look at it and think it's just one piece, as both the tank and the stand are made of the same lightweight plastic, so I pick it up by the sides without much thought.  As I carry it in to the kitchen I bring it up to set it on the table when the bottom just slides right out from under it and hits the ground, resulting in it forming a big crack in the plastic.

My mother is suddenly livid, yelling at me that I should've held it from the bottom, and that I ruined a really nice piece of kitchenware (really nice cheap plastic, apparently).  But I certainly didn't do this on purpose; I was holding it by the sides because it was lightweight and I had to set it on the table, and up until that point I had no clue that the thing was even two separate pieces, and she didn't tell me at all that it *was* two pieces.
AITA?



TL;DR:
Thing I thought was one piece was actually two pieces, and as I was holding it by the sides, the bottom piece just slid out from under it and broke on the floor."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1949.0	163.0	0.0	0.0

I'm sixteen, and I went on a school trip to a resort where they had rides etc as a fun thing for finishing exams. Our teacher told us to stay in groups of 4 and we had a curfew to meet our teacher at a certain time. I was in a group of 5 and we just about finished a ride to go back to our teacher. Once we all got off the ride, my friend was looking for her bag and I waited for her to get it. Not realising our friend's had run off without us because we were around 2 mins late already. Me and my friend were lost and called them multiple times and we were infuriated because we didn't know which way to go when they did, and we're making the teachers angry  When we called I heard my best friend laughing on the other line for a briefly which had angered me because you could hear the frustration in our voices because we were lost. We finally managed to get there but our teacher told us off and when we explained the situation on how our friends left us. She said we had just made an excuse most likely. And that she had a bet going on who would let her down, and annoy her today whilst looking at my friend because that teacher doesnt like her for some reason and that we weren't in a 4. We basically got told off for no deserved reason even though we explained our friends had left us. When I looked at my best friend and she goes hurriedly, ""I told them to wait but they didn't listen"" which I honestly didn't believe because we begged them to stay where they were or at least come back but they were all too selfish and left us lost and i heard my best friend laughing.  So I said ""yeah right"". We got the coach back, and my friend who I was lost with, had to go on one coach with one of the other friends who left us and she texted me explaining to me that the friend had apologised. As soon as me and my best friend sat down, I didn't say anything to her but listen to my music and she just sat there staring out the window and didn't say anything. But then as soon as I get home she sends me a paragraph saying, ""wasn't going to say anything to you but let's make one thing clear.. If you r gonna be petty and pissed by all means pls do. But know the facts that I was the one who told the others to stop they are not behind us but they was like no its fine they will make their way we can't stop. Bit pathetic how you take it out on me when I was the one telling them to stop. Anyways have a nice day cba for this shit"". Judging from the time she sent the message, she sent it whilst on the coach. I responded back, I can't exactly remember, that she was very rude and she never bothered saying anything to me on the coach anyway. All I wanted was an apology. And she replied with something along the lines of erm I explained and you said yeah right. I blocked her because I couldn't believe I was being called petty when she selfishly left me and my friend.

There was never a court mandated agreement on custody but we split it close to 50/50, i usually have them 3-5 days a week. It probably works out pretty close to even over the course of a year.

I never refuse to take the kids, i love them to bits and cherish my time with them. Really, its the best part of my week. But my ex has a habit of ambushing me with extra time. She will maybe ask me to take them for an hour or two on a day i wouldn't normally have them, i almost always say yes, unless i have a prior appointment at that time that makes it impossible for me to do so then i'll ask her to have a friend watch them. 

What she has been doing increasingly is waiting until we meet to swap them over then saying in front of me. ""Hey kids, would you like to stay with daddy tonight?"" They of course say ""Yay"". She does this without asking me first so i'm left having to take them or hurt their feelings. 

I told her i don't like being ambushed like this and that i want her to ask me before she presents it to the kids as an option. But apparantly im an asshole who doesn't think of his kids or value the time i have with them.


I want to be really, really clear here. I have no problem taking them, its being railroaded that is pissing me off.

c6nuj6	2019-06-28 18:36:03	someradkid	AITA for not paying my friend back?	"About 4 months ago, my friend lent me $1000 to help get an apartment together, for the deposit. The listing came out of nowhere, the apartment was beautiful and in a great location, so to even get a chance at it, we made an offer right away. I would pay her back, of course, throughout time, though we didn’t have a payment plan set up.

Once moving in and adjusting, paying back has been proven to be difficult because she wanted the money back as soon as possible, which I tried but I had prior bills like school loans, rent, other living expenses to pay for. She has a sugar daddy who pays for everything and yes, the deposit money she lent me was from him. Every month, I’d pay her about $200-$300. I even backed out on a prior trip, that was planned months in advance, just to pay her back. 

I admit that there were times, where I did spend some money irresponsibly by going out to eat, or dancing. I could’ve really cut down some costs on my end and used some money to pay her back. I take full responsibility for that, but in the end, she benefited from those expenses too. Whenever I went out dancing or to eat out, it was with her.

So now, I’m at the last homestretch of owing her the last $50 for other expenses. At this point, I’ve pretty much paid her back for the deposit, but the costs kept accruing as she’d buy stuff for the apt, while I kept trying to pay what I previously owed her. She would get upset if I didn’t pay her the amount I said I’d pay her. I get it, it’s annoying and I’ll take the responsibility.  But she knows that I’m not financially free as her, yet she’s upset at me for not coming through with what I said I’d pay. She explained that she feels taken advantage of and it frustrated her that the amount I said that I’ll pay her keeps changing. As far as I know, I’m still paying her back.

"Basically my fiancé and one of my best friends went to middle school together and i didn’t know either of them in middle school. I met my friend early in high school and he is an extremely funny and friendly guy. Met my fiancé at the end of high school. Anyways fast forward to college and and my girlfriend drunkenly told me she hates my friend and vaguely says in middle school he said her face/ass was weird and it really fucked up her self confidence. I asked her to elaborate but she didn’t want to talk about it.

 I felt terrible but i remained friends with him because i believe that people can change and maybe it was just shitty middle school moment. I have never seen my friend act like that towards anyone, and i told her if he ever did we wouldn’t be friends. Anyways fast forward to a few days ago and we are getting married and she said she really doesn’t want my friend to come to the wedding. Keep in mind they haven’t talked/interacted at all since that one time in middle school. 

I want him to come and I would probably ask him be a groomsman but i thought I shouldn’t because of her dislike for him. But now she doesn’t want him to come to the wedding at all which feels so wrong because we’ve been great friends for like 9 years.

c6nsgs	2019-06-28 18:31:42		AITA for wanting an apology from my fiancée's friend before inviting her to our wedding?	"To set some background, my fiancée [23F] and I [24M] have just gotten engaged and have been preparing for our wedding. One thing we've had a little disagreement on is whether we should invite my fiancée's good friend (referred to as ""A"").

About 2 years ago, my fiancée and I were celebrating Christmas with my family. Out of nowhere, A texted my fiancée asking to meet up at the last minute. Understandably, she told her that she was with my family and could not meet up. That's when A blew up at my fiancée, saying that she didn't care about their friendship and that she (A) was done and that she hated my fiancée. 

My fiancée is sometimes too nice for her own good, and took this abuse while trying to apologise and mend the friendship. So, when A asked for my number, my fiancée gave it to her.

A proceeded to send me a long message that accused me of being ignorant and bigoted. These sentiments stem from the fact that when A got together with her now ex-girlfriend, I said that it would not last. I said that because I knew what kind of person A was, in that she was prone to be extremely dramatic and paint herself as a tragic character. Altogether very childish in general. Anyway, A felt that my view was coming from a homophobic standpoint and proceeded to say things like how ""I should read a book"" etc. She went even further as to say that none of my fiancée's friends even liked me (not true, as said friends would later reveal). The tone of the message was extremely aggressive and I felt had the objective of trying to break us up. I replied telling her to grow up and that I was glad that she and my fiancée were no longer friends. I then blocked her.

Fast forward about 6 months and A messages my fiancée again to try and salvage the friendship. She apologised to my fiancée and wanted to be friends again. My fiancée and I talked a great deal about it after their friendship ended, and we concluded that A was toxic and only wanted a friendship where she was the centre of attention. I was against it, but my fiancée decided to become friends with A again, albeit nowhere near as close. I've accepted it and am indifferent to their friendship, as long as my fiancée doesn't get hurt.

The issue that my fiancée and I face now is that I do not want to invite A to our wedding unless she personally gets into contact with me and apologises for her behaviour and the things she said. My fiancée feels like I'm holding a grudge and dredging up the past. From my point of view, A was against me as a partner for my fiancée and had nothing but bad things to say about our relationship. I don't want anyone who was so against us even being together to be at the literal celebration of our love. A has told my fiancée that she's (and I quote) ""okay"" with me, but it still doesn't seem like any genuine support for our marriage.

I'm 20 years old and live with my parents and brother. So 15 minutes ago, my mother came into my room with an unassembled fan and asked me to help her build it together. I was watching a livestream tournement in my bed and said her, I'll help her once the stream is finished. She told me she needed it now, because she was heading to the shower and afterwards wanted to sleep with an active fan. After suggestint her, she should go take a shower while I assemble the fan later, she started to try assemble the fan on my desk while repeatedly asking me for help. It went on like this for a time and she really started to push me with pharses like: ""this is something for a man"", ""please eleking help me NOW"", ""Just help, you anyway are doing nothing"", ""Now help me finally, it's alway you're brother which has to help"". 

She stormed angry into the shower after I told her aggressivlly ""GO AND TAKE THE SHOWER"".

Should I assemble the fan in the meantime or demand an excusion? I don't want her to treat me like this and accept my answer, but also it's not that big of a deal to assemble that fan.

My (used to be) friend (call her K) and her bf (C) were nice enough to let me stay in their apartment as the third girl (A) on the lease was home for the summer which meant an open room. 

I feel like a little back story is needed so here it is. Six months ago I made the extremely dumb decision to buy K a brand new iPhone X Max as her old phone had broken and she promised up and down that she would pay me back. I still haven't seen a single dollar of that back.

When I moved in we made an agreement: all four of us would each pay the same amount to make rent. This didn't even last a month as  A couldn't afford to pay her whole cut. To make rent for June I loaned her $150 on top of paying my whole cut. I haven't seen a dollar of that back either. 

Fast forward to a week ago I went to visit my mom in her new vacation home as it was 35 minutes from the apartment. I stayed the night and when I got back the next day, my juul was not in the place I left it and the pod was drained without anyone asking if they could borrow it. This was the last straw for me and I moved out to my parents new house the next day.

After I moved out, K asked me for another 150 for the month of July as they are really struggling and could possibly lose the apartment without it. I refused to give anything as multiple people in the house still to this day haven't payed me back anything. And on top of that I know C took my juul because he's done it before. And the whole time I was living there, I would take K to work almost every day because I was the only one with a car.

So am I the asshole for letting them possibly not be able to make rent for July and putting the apartment at risk for them?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	38.0	24.0	0.0	0.0
c6nks7	2019-06-28 18:14:32		AITA: I told my sister to drive my car instead of hers to save gas, she gets mad.	"Background: my sister moved with my adoptive dad (M74) and myself (F25) a little over a month ago. I am currently working making roughly 1650/month. I am saving for when I go to grad school I’m August 2020 to reduce future student debt. My sister has 4 kids, and she is unable to work. she comes for a domestic abuse situation spanning from age 15-29, resulting in her having no GED/diploma and has zero work history and he socially stunted her. She has severe PTSD resulting from this, basically rendering her disabled. So she has no contribution financially, my adoptive dad is retired with limited income. I have a savings goal of 20,000 by the time I get to grad school, so I myself live very frugally. She is on food stamps which saves 780/month, and Medicaid for herself and all the kids. Other than that, my adoptive dad pays the rent & utilities and I pay for the extraneous household stuff such as laundry supplies, cleaning l stuff, hygiene, pet stuff, etc. And I also am paying off my 18k undergrad student loan off now. These costs used to be minimal but now (obviously) with basically 5 dependents these costs have skyrocketed.

Now to many question of AITA: my sister’s car is a major is a major gas guzzler, literally put a bit over 500 dollars in her car in June. My car and my adoptive dads car is cheap in gas, spend about 50/month for gas max, her driving it will likely make it about 80/month max. She gets mad with this and claims my car (a Prius) makes her too nervous to drive and it’s too low to the ground. Basically she wants me and my adoptive dad to fund her expensive car because she doesn’t like ours. We would save a good 400/month right there easily. She told me very passively aggressively that “guess I will not go to my appointments then”. And now I feel guilty and like shit for suggesting. I’m now thinking of just working my weekends picking up OT to help fund her extra expenses (also includes me spending 80/month gone her cigarettes)."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

She likes this guy so much that she even made plans on the weekend of my birthday (this weekend) for her and my Dad to be with my sister's second husband's family, fully knowing that I dont want to be around them. My mother had even told me that ""the devil has my heart"" for not wanting to be around him.

I think that since I'm a grown adult I'm able to say who I want to be around and who I don't. I don't want to be around the man who was in an affair with my sister. AITA for not wanting to be around him?"	Asshole	0	0	938.0	53.0	0.0	0.0
c6nf45	2019-06-28 18:02:00	wytwabbit	AITA for not wanting to make monthly payments on a Christmas present given to me.	"Ok first time poster here so let me know if I’m doin this right

My (ex)boyfriend bought me an iPad last Christmas.  He ordered it early but wouldn’t let me open until Christmas “so my family could see.” He put it on our joint Verizon account, but never told me how much it was or about monthly payments, etc.

We broke up in April and he kept saying “I want to make sure you get to keep the iPad.” Repeatedly. I mistook this as him trying to be nice because I’m an illustrator and the iPad is like my baby now I love it so much.

After the breakup he was stalking me through the location services on our joint Verizon account. And harassing me and my friends about where I was. He had done this previously in the relationship as well and I was generally freaked out at this point.

My family urged me to separate the account so he couldn’t track my phone anymore, so we went to Verizon to figure it all out. 

But when he kept saying “I want to make sure you get the iPad” what he really meant was “I want to make sure you have to pay for the iPad now.”

I didn’t understand that until we were already in the Verizon store. The lovely Verizon people notified me that my credit wasn’t even good enough to take on the iPad payment plan. (Student loans fml)

So now he insists I pay him the monthly payments until the payment plan is completed and he no longer owes. It still has several months left and I honestly want no contact, but because of this I have to communicate still to give him money.

It seems petty and I try to be a good person, but it really bothers me that I now make monthly payments on a PRESENT. Sure I love the iPad and I wanted one, but he bought it of his own free will so why do I have to pay for it? He also makes more money than me and after the breakup I let him keep the house and have been couch surfing until I move next month.

But then at the same time if I were him I probably wouldn’t want to pay for it either, so that’s why I ask you reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay him monthly for a Christmas present he gave me?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6nezh	2019-06-28 18:01:42	kaijusdad	AITA for wanting to provide my nephew a stable home?	"TLDR: Raised my nephew for the last 4 years. My wife wants his dad to start taking responsibility, but I feel our nephew is better off with us. AITA?

Kid’s dad went to the PI to take care of some family stuff. Asked if his son could stay with us for the summer since he gets along with his cousins. Summer goes by, everyone is having a great time.

Trouble hits. Visa issue & he is stuck in the PI. Asks if we can watch his son until he gets back. We understand visa stuff can take a while so we offer to enroll him in school so he doesn't fall behind. Everyone agrees that's the best option.

We get guardianship. All the kids get back to school clothes, shoes & supplies. Not something I budgeted for, but we made it work. He gets used to our routine, everything we do, he does.

Dad gets back in Dec. Doesn't make sense to pull him out so we keep him & continue our routine. Dad is a deadbeat. Works, but sends $ back to PI, drinks/gambles & has Grandma watch his other 2 kids. I ask for a little help. ""Sorry, can't help. I don't have any $."" Fine, I let it go.

Summer comes, Dad asks for son to come visit. He stays for about 2 weeks & asks to ""come home"" as his dad just leaves him with the neighbor or Grandma. We go pick him up. Rest of the summer he's with us & continue with our routine. He asks to stay since he likes his school and new life. Another year goes by, & another… nothing really changes.

Now here is where it gets tricky. He starts ignoring his dad’s phone calls & stops calling him all together. He does keep in contact with his sisters though & periodically sends his mom pics of his achievements/awards via FB.

To me, he's family and I think of him as my responsibility. My wife on the other hand keeps reminding me that he has a dad & that he needs to step up, that we’re enabling him by taking care of his son. He has no reason to do better for himself or his kids because everyone has lifted those responsibilities from him.

Nephew went back to dads for the summer again. My wife sits me down & says, “Its time for him to go back to his dad permanently. He's going to start high school, its the perfect time. He'll be starting a new school anyway.” I got mad and asked if she even talked to his dad or to him & asked what he wanted. Nope.

I have a lot of baggage when it comes to this as I was an orphan and adopted later in life after being in foster care. So I know what its like to feel a part of something & have it torn away. I'm surprised at my wife as she too lost both her parents young and was bounced from family member to family member until she was an adult. We ""fought"" about it & her answer is that we had no choice as kids as our parents were dead. His dad isn't. His dad lives less than an hour away & when he has a tournament or a play, he never makes an effort to be there... he isn't being the father that he needs and expecting me to fill that role emotionally and financially.

Am I the asshole for wanting to provide the kid a stable home?

UPDATE: His dad messaged me today and said he (Nephew) wants to go to school with his sister (she'd be a Sr and him a FrMn) so he'll be staying out there. Not sure if I should investigate or let it be. I did shoot my Nephew a message that if he needs us for anything to let us know and that he is always welcome in our home. If he's happy, I'm happy."

Coach expressed that he was upset with this student for not showing up and stuff like that and that he’d be having a lengthy convo with the student about it. I was this student’s captain for the debate event we were doing, so I asked the coach about the outcome of the convo. He then snapped, saying that it’s “none of my business” and that this was a “teacher-student matter”, as well as “Don’t tell me how to do my job!”  Mind you, had I not been in a leadership position, I would’ve agreed with that judgment and not asked for a  follow-up of any sort.

c6nbp7	2019-06-28 17:54:20	Nondscript_Usr	WIBTA if I asked my friend for a refund	" 

I'll do my best to present all the facts because I see too many of these where something vital is buried or omitted. TLDR at the top as a summary with some additional details listed below. 

I (my wife and kid as well) rented one of my friend's vacation homes in the desert (100+ degrees) and the AC that cools the bedrooms was broken upon our arrival. Sleeping was pretty uncomfortable and my friend made no effort to fix the problem past a 5 min phone call where he had me troubleshoot a few things. 

Now for some details (I'm not good at narrative so here is a list):

 \- My friend lets us rent his place at a moderate discount mid-week when they aren't booked. Its enough to make it worth staying there vs a hotel for what you get but not nothing. We also still have to pay for cleaners which, because of the short duration of our stay (two nights) equaled the amount we spent for two nights. 

\- He and his wife were coming to stay right after us. This partly causes me some ire because he piggybacks off our cleaning fee. Knowing we aren't going to make a mess (in fact because we know each other we are extra clean and tidy) like a big party group would, they stay right after us. I half-jokingly asked him if that meant we would split the cleaning fee. He told me the cleaning fee is for us to start with a clean house, not to to have it cleaned after we leave. He said he could cancel the cleaners before our trip if we wanted to deal with whatever mess was left after the last group. Still, he is benefiting from us paying to have the house cleaned. 

\- Desert houses have two ACs over a certain sq ftg if I understand correctly. So half the house and one bedroom (for my kid) was cooled. 

\- I let him know within an hour or so of arriving that there was a problem with the AC that controlled the bedrooms. He said he knew there had been a problem but the AC guy they use assured him it was fine. I checked the plugs and I checked the breaker for him and no solution. He asked me if I wanted to see if the guy could come that night. I told him, if the guy could come and not charge them emergency fees then yes thatd be great if not the next day would be fine.

\- I texted him about other things and he never mentioned the AC guy again and so neither did I. I am home now, he is there, no word from him.

If I was a regular guest I would certainly ask for a refund or a discount. I know I already have a friend discount but in my eyes it doesn't change the need to remedy the AC problem. I know this is my friends business and I'm not looking for a hand-out. Aside from utilities for 2.5 days my stay doesn't cost him anything as we only stay when the house is otherwise unbooked. 

Ultimately its not a ton of money to compromise an old friendship but I'd like to know if I'm justified in confronting him about my dissonance over the broken AC. "	Not the A-hole	0	0	132.0	80.0	0.0	0.0

I say this because I'm taller and more muscular than him, so I wouldn't be scared for my own safety against this friend.

I'm not one of those homophobes who has the audacity to assume all gay people are attracted to me, but this gay friend was touchy with me all night and constantly trying to hold my hand so I think he was trying to hook up and it was making me uncomfortable as he knew I'm straight. At first I asked myself if I was just being homophobic, but I reasoned that I would think the exact same about a girl doing the same thing as him.

At the end of the night, we're all crashing at the house and having to share beds and the gay friend wants to share a bed with me. I ask another friend to swap and tell them that I'm uncomfortable because the gay friend has been hitting on me all night. The other friend says, ""[gay friend]? You? Quit being so fucking homophobic, [gay friend] is way out of your league anyway.""

"Alright, this will probably be pretty open and shut because it is a simple situation, but I'm looking to get feedback because if I'm being the asshole in this situation I'll change my behavior/decision accordingly.

My girlfriend is staying with me for a week at my mom's while she is out of town- we've got a fully stocked fridge, all the supplies needed, etc. Tomorrow, she is organizing a small get-together of her friends in the evening, and I'm similarly inviting 2 of my friends. Now, my girlfriend wants to go grocery shopping for a few extra thinhgs and also get supplies for the get-together, most notably a bottle of liquor of some sort, probably a bigger one so she can have left over. I don't really like to drink liquor, I'm buying myself and my friend (the one who drinks) some nice beer. In addition, I'm 100% positive her friends are bringing some liquor of their own too.

Now here's where we get to the conflict: I don't really want to contribute towards the liquor because, I'm not planning on having any of it at all and want to buy. Realistically, I may have like a single glass because she will undoubtedly offer me one. She's saying I'm an asshole for not wanting to help her pay for supplies especially when I've been known to have a glass of her liquor here and there... But like I said, I'm sort of having my own get-together and one of my friends doesn't even drink, so its not like they'll really be having any of my gf's liquor, especially when I'm paying for beer for myself and my own friends. Also, to be clear, I'll make it known ahead of time that my gf and I have a very good relationship. I'm not trying to be stingy money wise just to be obstinate or cheap, I never am with her, but I do have my own things to pay for too.

c6n80p	2019-06-28 17:45:52	Deoxys_0	AITA for mourning more over my cat's death than my grandpa's death?	"A few years ago, my cat passed away. I mourned for weeks and often went to bed crying.

&#x200B;

Today, my grandpa passed away.... And I'm not sure if I feel anything.... And I feel angry with myself because of this.

&#x200B;

Over the last few years.... Well, every since my grandpa moved to the same area as us after his wife (not my grandma as they had a divorce) passed away.... I really went into a decline. I'm not sure if it was the loss of his wife, the move, or a combination of all of it. His health declined greatly and it got a lot harder for him to move around. He also began not being very hygienic... He used to come over for dinner several times a week, and I was more active around in then, but over time it dropped to about once very two weeks.

As his health declined.... Although I still cared.... I felt more pushed away from him. I had trouble eating at the same table as him because he'd constantly make..... Disgusting noises.... And spit up food due to stomach problems he had. My parents got used to it, but I never did.... I feel bad now but then I usually just ate somewhere else to avoid getting sick. I don't know if he cared or not.

Then it got to a point where he wasn't.... Fond to be around even in places outside of dinner. I began to isolate myself more and more to my room whenever he'd come over.... And eventually, without me even realizing it until now, it became a norm. I guess I just felt like I didn't have a strong connection with him anymore. I regret it now though.

Sometimes my parents would complain about him when he wasn't around. They would complain about how he couldn't really go anywhere without getting sick and how he needed us to drive him so much. My mom complained the most (he was my dad's dad) because she often felt like she had to be a taxi driver for him. Apparently the ""old folks home"" (sorry, I don't know the proper name) had a driving service for things like that.... But it was expensive and it was cheaper for us to drive him around. 

Things were different when I was a lot younger (I'm in college now). When I was between the ages of like 6 and 14, seeing my grandpa was the best thing ever. He always had health issues... But maybe my young self was just blind to them... Or maybe they never really were major until recently.

Being older now... I'm not sure if I just became an asshole.... Or was more transparent to what was really going on... And what he was really like. But despite that thought... I still regret it. I regret all the time I chose to hide up in my room and not spend it with him. I feel like an asshole. It's like I didn't even realize I was doing anything wrong until now... Until he passed away.

I guess I just need help getting a better understanding.... From other people... As to where I'm at right now... Even if the responses aren't anything good."	No A-holes here	0	0	2.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

She and I have never been close, but I’m excited for her. When I got the invite I was surprised she had only registered at two places: one very high-end store and an upper middle tier store. Checking out the registries, I was honestly appalled. The most expensive item was well over $1,000 (and there was a $40 spoon!!) and the majority of items are over $100. While I can easily afford to get her something of her choosing, I have an issue with this sense of entitlement on principle. It is one of the many reasons I don’t really interact with my mom’s side of the family. 

The middle tier registry has already been picked over, so I know I’ll probably end up getting her a gift card to the expensive store in the amount I was looking to spend anyway (so that I don’t have to see what she wastes it on), but WIBTA if I got her a gift card to a different store where she could get more bang for my buck or better yet, a practical gift that she doesn’t seem to have thought of?

As the title says, my dad is currently dying. Stage IV pancreatic cancer, prognosis of six to eight months. In all honestly, I'm struggling to feel anything about it. 

He and I have never gotten along. He's been pretty terrible to me my entire life. I'm not gonna get into too much detail because idk what I can and can't say per rule 5, but he pretty severely mistreated me for as long as I can remember. I'm the youngest of six kids and, while he was no angel to the others, he definitely singled me out and I got the worst of it. For a long time it was a mystery to me as to why, but when I was 12 I found out my mum had had an affair and that the other guy is most likely my biological father. However, this info came out after my mum died and I've never found out who the guy was, so I still consider the guy who raised me my dad. Everything came to a head when I was 16 and my busybody aunt saw me holding hands with my then-boyfriend and told on me. Dad chucked me out, changed the locks while I was at school, left my stuff in a binbag on the lawn and severely threatened me if I ever went back. I went to stay with my bf who, without getting into much detail, turned out to be as much of a POS as my dad and put me through three of the worst years of my life.

Now, all of this was ten years ago and I've barely spoken to my dad since. I saw him at my sister's wedding in 2011, my brother's graduation in 2014 and my grandmother's funeral in 2016. Aside from that, I've deliberately avoided him the entire time. I don't want a relationship with the man who did all this to me. When he was diagnosed, he reached out to me to let me know how sick he was. He also apologised and told me he wanted to try and salvage a relationship. I told him I was very sorry to hear he was unwell, thanked him for apologising but said the things he's done to me are unforgivable and I've no interest in accepting his olive branch. I'm now being told by various family members that I'm being selfish and unreasonable, asked what kind of arsehole refuses a dying man his wish and told that I should grow up, leave the past in the past and get over it. It's making me feel kinda shitty, especially since it's causing tension between my siblings (a sister and both brothers agree that I don't have to forgive him and he burned his bridges with me a long time ago, other sisters think I'm being a colossal twat). I know he's dying and I'm being stubborn, but I really feel strongly about this. Am I an arsehole for refusing my dying dad a relationship with me in his final months or am I justified? 

**TL;DR: my dad mistreated me my entire life, including kicking me out at 16. Now he's dying and wants a relationship with me, but I've told him no and it's made a lot of family members really mad at me.**"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6n6e5	2019-06-28 17:42:04		AITA for pushing back on wife's decision to do the ketogenic diet as much as I am?	"Wife has wanted to lose weight for some time. She decided recently to start the ketogenic diet. I pushed back on this at first , before she started, as I felt like it wasn't healthy, sustainable, had too many risks, etc etc. I encouraged her to talk to her doctor about it, first (and still do). Once she'd started the conversation about wanting to lose weight,  I also campaigned for her to adjust her portions, eat smaller meals more often and get more exercise (which is what I do and works well for me, which I have been careful to point out may not be the case for her or someone else) 
m
Anyway, she felt she'd done enough research and keto was right for her, and started the diet a month or two ago.  I've done my best to be supportive but there are times when I've not been able to hide my qualms with the diet/ lifestyle. She's been doing fairly well with it, but it's extremely hard to maintain, and the stuff she's preparing does not at all fit in with the diet/exercise routine I've maintained for years 

I'm prompted to make this post cause we just had an argument over a grocery list.

I tried to negotiate to like half and half vs heavy cream, Greek yogurt vs sour cream, some stuff like that, and she agreed but was obviously annoyed because it would entail like all new recipes.  We try to compromise but this kind of thing will pop up and it's hard to bite my tongue when she makes a grocery list or plans a meal that I feel like is terribly unhealthy. More often than not it's not a big deal, but it definitely occurs

c6n6bj	2019-06-28 17:41:52	SuperTDP2	AITA for refusing to help a good friend with his landscaping project?	"Alright Reddit, I’m looking for an honest judgment if I am an asshole in this situation. I don’t feel like I am but another friend said I was, I will accept whatever judgement you dole out. 

Yesterday I was hanging out with a friend, watching tv and he turns to me. The following convo ensued:
Him: so this is what you’re going to do bro. 
Me: yeah what’s that?
Him: you’re gonna take July 17, 18, and 19 off work...
Me: and? (At this point I think he’s gonna suggest a road trip or something). 
Him: and help me tear my deck up and build a new one. 
Me: <laughs> I genuinely thought he was kidding. 
Him: so is that a no?
Me: oh you’re serious? No dude I can’t. I only get 10 days off a year and I’ve used 5 (vacation to Mexico with my gf). 
Him: cmon man it won’t be that bad. 
Me: sorry dude it’s a no. I’d only have 2 days off for the rest of the year. 
Him: wow. So much for counting on your friends. 

At that point things got quiet and awkward so I said goodbye and excused myself. I don’t feel like an asshole because I have valid reasons not to be able to help. They are 1: the days off issue I mentioned. 2: if I take days off, I don’t get any overtime that week. I get paid, but just straight time. I’d lose about 4-6 hours worth of OT, or about 130-170 bucks. And 3: he didn’t ask very nicely. Kind of passively demanded I help. 

This guy is a good friend of mine that I’ve known for awhile. I’d help out over a weekend but taking that much time off work to help is too much.  So give it to me straight, AITA??

Tl;dr: am I an asshole for refusing to take 3/5 of my remaining vacation days to do landscaping for my good friend, for free?

"Edit: If you guys can stop commenting ""I had my first same-gendered crush when I was X years old"" that'd be great. I heard it enough times and your not adding anything. Go upvote the other 100 comments that say the same thing. Thank you.  

I'm really bad at writing events because I usually end up rambling, so I'll just make a sequence of events of what happened.

- I was walking with my friend after school when he told me that his 10 yr old sis came out as bisexual.

- I told him that I don't believe that someone her age shouldn't know for sure at the age, and he says ""I don't know man, if she says she is I believe her.""

- Next day at school in class I said ""My 10 year old cousin says she's bisexual but there's no way in hell she knows that yet."" (I said cousin because I wanted to respect my friend's sister's privacy). And they sort of started arguing with me that it's her own body and that she gets to decide what sexuality is, no matter how old she is. Then my teacher over heard us and when my friends told him what we were talking about he started implying I was homophobic or something, saying, "" Why does it matter, do u have a problem with queer people? You should love your cousin no matter what."" (I never said I would stop loving ""my cousin"" btw) 

So I don't know, it feels like everyone is disagreeing with me and maybe I am the asshole."	Asshole	0	0	688.0	324.0	0.0	0.0
c6n4vp	2019-06-28 17:38:28	pengie151	AITA if I decide not to room with someone for college?	"So, I had my college orientation a couple weeks ago and I was assigned a dorm room for the night with 3 other people. I met one kid there who initially seemed really friendly and we seemed to share a lot of common interests so I thought it'd be best to stick by him for most the day so I wouldn't be alone.

&#x200B;

However, as the day continued I met another kid who had been sticking with me and the kid I initially met, but I learned throughout the day that the kid I initially met was someone I did not want to end up rooming with. I stupidly said ""Let's see how today goes, and if it goes well we could probably room with each other."" Giving him false hope that we could room together. By the next day, I had made my decision that I wanted to room with the second kid I met and not the kid I met first.

&#x200B;

Later, as time went on through the week I had reconsidered rooming with him and asked people who knew him if he was a good kid or not. I learned that he had a reputation at his high school to creep on other girls, and he actually added one of my friends on Snapchat and constantly hit her up saying weird things to her.

&#x200B;

I broke the news to him about who I wanted to room with, and obviously he didn't take it too well.

&#x200B;

Personally, I don't want people to think I'm like that if I do room with him, so I thought rooming with the other person would be in my best interests.

A few months ago I was going through some mental health stuff and I just wanted to disconnect and take some time for myself. Now I'll admit that I just started ignoring people which was the wrong way to handle it and I fully accept my fault on that part. After like 3 days I told my 3 friends that i just wanted some time for myself and the other two said they were just worried and that I can take as much time as I need. The third friend is the friend this story is about. She basically blew up at me saying that because I'm at home all day, I shouldn't need time. She also said things like ""How dare I treat her like this"" because I wouldn't tell her why I wanted to be alone. She even went as far as to say ""Your mother wouldn't like that you would prefer to shut me out. Me of all people"" (for context, my dad passed away a few years ago and my mom and I became super close). I was called unfair and hypocritical for ""acting this way"" and after that she basically said ""Do whatever you want with your life"". She also said ""I left you alone for a week"" which, to me, just felt like she thinks she gets to decide how much time I get. After months, she messaged me and basically said she doesn't understand why I'm mad at her and she doesn't know what she did. That pissed me off. I went off on her and told her that I felt she was being manipulative, selfish and entitled. She then sent me a voice note ""apologising"" (her apology was basically her just talking about how shes affected rather than what I dealt with). It's not just this either. Over the past couple years shes said things that really bother me, such as she doesn't believe bisexuality is real (even though I have told her multiple times that I am Bi), she also said things along the lines of ""people can't be depressed if they have money or fame"".

c6n3g8	2019-06-28 17:35:20	kat_brady	AITA for putting a family business on my resume?	"I'm still somewhat new to the workforce, recently out of college. I don't have too much professional experience. However, starting when I was in high school, I began working for my parent's company. When I was younger, I did very basic office work, filing, stuffing envelopes, etc. As I got a bit older, I began taking on actual responsibility and a real job title. I was a great employee, learned a lot, and to this day my parent has a difficult time finding someone on my level to replace me. 

Ever since I graduated college, I have put these years of experience on my resume and they have helped get me through the door. I have moved to a different state, so besides seeing this past experience on my resume, my new jobs do not have any ties to my parent. I do not make it clear that the company was owned by my parent, and use more recent employers as references. Of course, if it came up in an interview or in the office, I would not lie about it. I just don't voluntarily admit to it. 

I understand and recognize my privilege, and I am very grateful that I had such an easy transition and open door to an actual professional position. I understand that this is not the case for many, and I tend to downplay the position or just not talk about it with friends. However, if it does come up, they often make snide comments about how I do not have real experience or that I'm dependent, spoiled, etc, and it has caused rifts. 

I do not argue that my parent is the reason I have come this far. I just don't think I need to advertise that, and I do consider this real, marketable experience as it has given me valuable skills. 

AITA for putting this on my resume, and hiding the fact that it was a family business? If I am, let me know if I should be disclosing that it's a family business, or if I should be leaving it off of my resume entirely. Thank you!"	Not the A-hole	0	0	138.0	28.0	0.0	0.0

"this summer I’ve decided to stay on my college campus to take summer classes and to work. One of my friends recently started dating a new girl and he brought her to a party to introduce her. Turns out we crossed paths once, but not in a good way

About two months ago I was jogging at 10 PM on a weekday night around the campus (we are a huge school so there were a few people around) when I saw this new art installation I hadn’t seen before. I stopped to look at the installation and the plaque on it. Now I had my AirPods in and a beanie over my head so I couldn’t hear anyone approaching me from behind, but I saw something out of the corner of my eye so I turned around. There was a short white girl on the sidewalk right behind me, so I gave a nod, a shy smile and I said “hi”. She looks at my face like I’m a ghost, says something to herself (it could have been “fuck!”) and she sprints away like the devil was after her. She sprinted all the way down the street until she had to turn the corner maybe 200 meters away. 

I’m 6’2 180 pounds and I’m dark skinned (my father is from Cote D’Ivoire and my mother Vietnamese) so I’ve been getting the suspicious stares and the purse clutches and the “people crossing the street to avoid me” deal all my life. Ive learned to deal with it. But this was on another level. 

So me and this girl were both shocked to meet each other at this party last Saturday. I recognized her partially because she is wearing the same rainbow socks and shirt she wore that night and for her..... I guess she remembered the big scary Black man that dared say “hi” to her. When we shook hands, she said “are you....?” And I said “yes, I’m not dangerous you see, haha”. She uncomfortably laughed then walked away. She privately told my friend what happened, then my friend asked me what happened on that night, and he was understanding. He said she got a little freaked out that night, and that she wants me to understand that she felt she had to run. I didn’t think I did anything wrong that night and I tried my hardest to not be menacing, plus I felt a little bit insulted that she couldn’t tell me that herself in a public place with her boyfriend that knows I’m not a threat 

I told my friend that I won’t get in the way of his relationship, but that I’m not speaking to his girlfriend until she reaches out or apologizes."	Asshole	0	0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

The east coast friend said he was interested in visiting us so the west coast friend invited him to come.  He actually invited the east coast friend to stay over at my house, which I found rude, but I'm fine with hosting him.  Basically the visit was more their idea than mine.

&#x200B;

Now the friend who lives in the same city as me is a notorious flake.  Things always seem to ""happen"" to him and he's 50/50 for showing up to things he gave a hard commit to.  East coast friend arrives today, and I've communicated to them for days what our itinerary over the next two days will be.  Thus far everyone has agreed.  


Just five minutes ago west coast friend has something come up, his coworkers want to get dinner and I tell him that's fine, but we need to meet at X place at 930.  He says he'll try and keep us updated, but that he'll definitely meet up with us ""later on"" in his words.  


In the pit of my stomach I can sense what's coming since I've seen it so many times, so I lay into him.  I tell him that east coast friend has gone to a lot of trouble to see us and we owe him much better than ""maybe's"" or ""i'll see what's up.""  I remind him that when the trip was announced I specifically asked if he could clear this friday and saturday and he said yes.  I told him to be true to his word.  


Now to be fair, he hasn't technically flaked out on us partially or wholly yet.  He could very well show up at the specified time.  But I've seen this play out the same way many times, something small comes up, and then that becomes something big, and then radio silence, and I spend much of the night irritated.

c6mzw1	2019-06-28 17:27:08	2kidsnosleephelpme	AITA keeping contact with brother's ex/baby mama?	"My brother and his ex don't get along.  They have a small child about the same age as my child and ex and I have a minimal text-only relationship.  99% of the time it is pictures of our kids (obviously they are cousins).  I live hundreds of miles away from my brother and his ex, and this is commonly the only updates I get on my neice/nephew because my brother doesn't have much interest in maintaining a consistent long distant relationship with me, except through our mother and every few months contact.

Since the above sounds too simple to warrant an AITA some background:

Brother and ex have a possible abusive/manipulative/narcissist/codependency relationship dynamic.  (I don't really know who the instigator is, and have the belief that they have equal propensity to be terrible to each other)

At one point, I felt I had no choice but to tell brother he was out of line when the ex called me with verifiable proof of verbally abusive texts.  This happened after they broke up one of many times, and her request was that I help her to stop him contacting her until custody was determined.  He was upset initially, but understood later that I felt I needed to because everyone had been trying to tell him to leave her alone and he wouldn't listen.  Plus I couldn't ignore the abuse and cry for help.

I am completely out of their drama otherwise.  I don't know the daily ups/downs, she doesn't tell me, I don't want to know.

They are currently in a custody battle, where she has been reasonably fair considering the likelihood she has worse dirt on him than has made it to court.

Our mother relays their drama to me occasionally, of which these text messages have occasionally come up.  I don't trust her version of the story 100%, because I don't trust brother or ex after the on again off again, he said she said bullshit they continue to pull.

It is my mother who is asking me to block the ex, because she believes the ex 'taunts' brother with having contact with me.  (1. I'm not sure how you taunt someone with pictures already available/similar to my Facebook friends.  2. If she truly wants to offend/taunt him with such benign content, I'm sure she would use absolutely anything to irritate him, and it has nothing to do with these pictures or us having a ""relationship"" that he has known about and encouraged at one time or other.)

I have minimal contact with his other child because his other ex was my major contact with that child (outside of holidays) as well."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I can't afford to buy my own apartment on the money I'm getting so where else am I supposed to go when I can't pay the rent needed (it's around 20 according to my parents).

"I'm 28F, with a 4-year old and a 2-year old, and my sister, 23F has always been, shall we say, a little less responsible and more adventurous in life. I've always tried to be supportive of her choices and tried to be someone she can confide in because we do not have great relationship with our parents.

The last six months however has been stressing our relationship. She is involved with an older guy (33) and I'm not opposed to older men (I'm married to an older gentleman myself) but he's someone who isn't very mature and is leading my sister down some weird paths. 

I know they indulge in a lot of kinky things which I don't worry about too much. However, they're starting to be bolder with it in family settings and I think I want to call them out on it and stop them from doing it.

I noticed she had a temporary tattoo on her shoulder that had something to do with cuffs, she's wearing a little locker bracelet, and some sort of collar that I know is them doing something about their BDSM stuff in public. I also noticed she was not talking directly to him (eye contact) and staying back whenever we talked. I can imagine they enjoy this, but I want to keep this to the bedroom without others involved. I've got kids here for gosh's sake.

Am I being too controlling? It's my party, and I just want them to be normal and not have their bedroom spill over. I also really want her to end this relationship, but that's not something I can bring up or impose. I told her that next time she comes over, she needs to be more careful."

c6mtok	2019-06-28 17:13:10	seacowpotatopig	AITA for not prioritizing visits with my dad and his wife?	"Background: my dad and I have a long and tumultuous history ( not according to him - he thinks everything’s fine). My parents split when I was young and He’s been a really terrible parent. He’s always been around, but never did any of the hard stuff ....never paid a dime, never met with our teachers, never helped my mom with anything. He thought being a good dad meant wanting to see us on the weekend. 

I’ve grown an enormous resentment for him for this - because he expects me to make time for him and give him the same time I give to my mom. He literally has told me he feels entitled to the same treatment! He lays guilt on thick and rarely accepts no for an answer. He has a brain injury from a motorcycle accident so I don’t think he can honestly see why this is unreasonable. 

I now have a 9 month old son, so my priorities have changed. Where before, I didn’t care about seeing him and would carve out time here and there to appease him, now I don’t WANT to. My time is precious, my free time is infrequent, and when I get time to spend with friends and family I choose to see people who don’t make us feel bad or uncomfortable (stepmom has a habit of getting Karen wasted and gets very touchy).

When I had my son my dad asked me every day when he and his wife could come see the baby. I was experiencing extreme anxiety, I didn’t sleep for like 3 days, I was not taking visitors. Every. Day. He made me explain this and say no, please don’t come, I’ll let you know when I’m ready. He just doesn’t understand why I wasn’t ready, and it was honestly like having a distant relative come visit two days after you’ve birthed a human. 

So today, my dad finally beat me down to accepting them to com for a visit today and 530 and having some dinner. I realized that just doesn’t work for me, it’s the busiest time of day with a baby, my Husband is working late, so I’m not interested in cooking, doing bath/bed for DS and entertaining on my own. He’s now trying to convince me itll be fine. He has no respect for me or my boundaries.

c6mqie	2019-06-28 17:06:03	r3adNwrit3	WIBTA if I asked my friends not to go to the fair without me?	"I'm a recent college grad living a couple hours from my childhood home, and every year, my hometown has a ""fair."" I'd been talking with some college friends about attending this year, after we'd tried to go a couple times in the past. Unfortunately, I had a family trip scheduled and later found out that it's the same weekend as the fair. 

&#x200B;

When I told my SO I was bummed about the timing and that we'd have to put it off yet again, he said something along the lines of ""you're the one leaving - we can still go without you!"" I couldn't help but feel a bit hurt about this, as we'd previously put off the trip when not everyone (5 of us) could attend. I explained why I felt bad and asked him if we could wait again, and he said we'd figure something out. From his response, I'm a little worried it'll come up again and the group will go without me - WIBTA if I asked them to wait so we could all go together? If the topic comes up again, I'm planning to offer up another weekend to visit and just hang out, but would it be selfish/an asshole move to ask them to wait on their first fair visit?

&#x200B;

For context: The ""fair"" is by no means a big event.  It's really a generous term - it's more like some live music and games at our community center in a town of <1000 people. None of the group has connections to the area aside from me, and aside from my SO, they've only been to the town once before when I invited them down years ago. The reason I'd rather we wait than have them go this year and with me next year is that the group is pretty unreliable with planning trips, and I think it's unlikely for them to want to go two years in a row (or even more than once at all)."

c6moua	2019-06-28 17:02:22	vchen294	AITA wanting in-laws to live elsewhere from us when they’re providing help	"My husband (M26) and I (F24) are currently expecting our first baby. Before trying to conceive, we asked his parents since they were retired if they would be willing to come help us out for a few months when the baby is born. My due date is 3/2020 and we live on the opposite sides of the country. My in-laws agreed to help, which is our green light to try for a baby. 

I am currently 6 weeks pregnant and my in-laws happened to be visiting so we told them the good news early so they can make arrangements for the move. All seemed to be good, until my husband and I asked what type of place would they prefer to live at. We were met with a very awkward silence. My MIL was confused, so my FIL said bluntly “They don’t want us to live with them”. 

We have a decent sized condo with 1 bedroom downstairs, 1 loft (currently our master bedroom), and 2 full baths. It’s comfortable for me, the husband, and our two fur children. Although it is physically possible to add two adults and a newborn, I would prefer not to. There is absolutely no privacy in the condo (open floor plan) and my in-laws have different schedules than us. You can hear absolutely everything within the condo. I’m not talking about anything intimate, because just putting dishes away sounds like a concert.

My husband and I are fairly introverted and already feel like it’s a social event every time we go downstairs when they’re here. I end up staying upstairs just to get alone time.

My MIL is upset that we said our place isn’t big enough for everyone and she does not want to live in an apartment. Money is not an issue. As much as I would appreciate the help, I do not want to juggle a newborn and living with my in-laws. My husband said it’ll be only a few months and that the help is more important than our comforts. 

I feel so guilty for asking my in-laws to live away from us even if they’re only there to help us. Am I a bigger asshole if I told them I would rather not have their help because I don’t want them to live with us?"	Asshole	0	0	93.0	8.0	0.0	0.0
c6mofa	2019-06-28 17:01:28	chrissy0116	AITA - HOA Drama over Board Member's 14YO Basset	"  

Am I overreacting? Small HOA Comm (90ish TH), mostly retired ppl. 5 board members incl me as VP (50F). Pres is 70M, Treas (T) is 65M, two other Dir (both 60+F).

Board mtg called to order. Open Forum is where residents bitch about whatever. Today no residents (we think, whew, this mtg will go FAST!). Except, T says, I have an Open Forum item. He says, it's about chrissy0116. She lets her dog out into the open area in back of TH not on a leash. And her son does too in front. That's against the rules. I reply, T, you know we stand at the back door, and son does too, right? He says, yes, but it is still against the rules. I just say, OK, noted. After adjournment, I turn to T and loudly say, I am extremely upset and angry that you called me out in a public forum over something so trivial. Had there been anyone in the audience, I would have left and resigned the board immediately. He said, well, it is a public forum issue and that would have been your prerogative to do so. I left and got more and more angry. This is a 14YO basset hound with one foot in the grave, who slithers himself off the porch, sniffs around the grassy area for 2-3 minutes and then hauls his old butt up the porch and back inside. We stand there and watch him in case he wanders off. Son lets him walk up and down the grass next to the house while he smokes, and then brings him inside.

After awhile, I called Pres and said I would finish my term out of professionalism and not to put Pres in a bad situation (1 F board member is leaving at EOM and another is an a cardiac rehab facility til ??). If I quit, there would only be 2 functioning board members. I told him that T was not welcome in my house for any reason, and if he ran next term that I would not run or serve. 

I realize that I have been breaking a rule (re-read covenants).

If the doggo happens to relieve himself in the shared open area, I always pick it up.

Townhomes are in a row of 6-8 with back porches and then 20 ft of open grassy area between the back. T lives catty-corner to our TH, and thus the dog wanders over by T's back door ever so often, but mostly stays behind our porch. Neighbor across from us (next door to T) has no issue with doggo.

When walking him, we always leash him.

Questions:

AITA - am I overreacting? He’s kind of a jerk because he is so obstinate (he demanded we write up various people for putting up their Xmas lights a week early for instance), but up til now I have always supported him even if I didn't agree.

WIBTA – I’m NOT going to follow the rule, because in this case, it's stupid. Even if he brought it up again, the Board would have to vote and the other Board members would not vote to reprimand me. If the situation plays out as described in #2, he might even quit in protest. 

WIBTA - I could demand he resign thru a board motion, and the Pres and other Dir would agree, as they dislike him also - too harsh?"	Asshole	0	0	223.0	20.0	0.0	0.0

c6mnhf	2019-06-28 16:59:16	redditneonate	AITA for wanting compensation for damage to my car from an injured person?	I am an Ophthalmogist from South East Asia. So yesterday while driving to my sister’s place, I noticed an erratically moving two wheeler approaching me. The road wasn’t crowded and I was immediately alert and slowed down my car. The man (he was probably having a heat stroke or a nap) proceeded to hit into my car regardless. The side mirror on driver’s side was completely shattered along with multiple scratches on the same side. He himself fell down and broke his arm (both bone open fracture right forearm). Someone alerted the police and EMT took him to the hospital. All eyewitnesses agreed that it wasn’t in any way my fault. The policeman on the scene told me to go home and that they will inform me when they want to take the official statement. A couple of hours later I recieved a call from the police and went to the hospital that guy was admitted to. Now he was clearly a poor man (works as a wood-cutter or something) while it was obvious that I came from a resourceful family (I was wearing a White apron when this happened). The police convinced us both to settle without lodging a FIR which that guy agreed to if I paid for his entire treatment (he will need an operation for the fracture). Even though he agreed that it wasn’t my fault, the police told me that the only to settle this out of court was to give him what he wants. I was infuriated but unfortunately that’s how the system works. They told me that since I had the bigger vehicle, it is automatically assumed that I was at fault. The whole thing didn’t make sense to me and I wanted to tell that person to fuck off and pay for the damages to my car and to compensate me for the mental harassment this whole thing caused me. I anyway had to agree to pay for his treatment, since even the thought of lawyers and court makes me shudder. Its not that the amount of money will make a difference to me, just that what happened felt super unfair. AITA for wanting an injured poor person who was clearly at fault to pay me?

Since last year he comes downtown regulary to hang out with is friends that live nearby, and since he always left late his friends house he asked me if he could stay at my place and i always said yes.

Tonight is one of his friends birthday and there's a party, and he wants to drink so he won't be able to drive, and as usual asked me if he could stay. I'd normally say yes but lately we can't hang out because of work and college, and i only see him when he comes home drunk and goes straight to bed, and in the morning when we wake up and have breakfast because he always leaves before lunch to avoid traffic. I feel like a hotel and it's kind of shitty, plus i'm having very intense few days and i'm exhausted and if he comes home i'll have to open the door for him at 4 in the morning and wait for him to fall asleep because he is a conversational drunk and won't shut up.

c6mj7z	2019-06-28 16:49:39		AITA for playing Pokémon rather than working?	"Mobile user, tl;dr at the top, new account but not a throwaway. 

tl;dr Manager didn’t reactivate me when my leave ended. Payroll doesn’t know I’m back. HR and everyone else doesnt either. End up working three weeks for zero compensation, while still being on leave. I say nope and play Pokémon instead cos I’m still on leave.

Back in April, I ended up going on medical leave from work. FMLA-covered, paid benefit. Anticipated return date of June 10th. This was communicated to my manager at the time, and then three more times between late May and early June. This is important because it’s his responsibility to do the reactivation; neither HR nor I can. 

Ignoring the shit show in between, I go back on the 10th as anticipated. No issues with physical security, nor systems access, and everything looks good. I badge in and out about 12x all over campus per day, show up in multiple system logs across the enterprise, and both my workstation and laptop have been signed into basically nonstop since the 10th. 

On the 25th, I get a call to schedule a follow up in August.  The system wouldn’t let me submit a time off request, so I screen cap’d the error it threw and opened a support ticket with HR. Did not hear back. 

Today, the 28th, my direct deposit should have gone in. 5:45, no money, 6:20, no money. 7:00 ping a peer, he got paid. 8:00, call HR. Their response, yeah no paycheck cos we show you as still on leave, with your benefit ending on 6/9 per [benefits admin.] Your manager needs to reactivate you and we can sort this out. He says he did this morning, but it will be Monday before I can confirm. 

So, after that discovery, plus this whole “I’ve been online since 5:30, and was over 40 this week before that,” I think I’ve earned some Pokémon time. I don’t think my boss acted out of malice, nor failed to act out of stupidity, and it’s likely just some clerical oversight. But it also isn’t the first time he’s inadvertently fucked me over. Either way, this isn’t “file a claim with the department of labor” level inconvenience yet. 

Also, how in the hell did HR not notice a guy who’s supposed to be on leave working 55-hour weeks while logged into two machines? Literally everything I do lands in a system log somewhere."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

To give context, every once in a while she gets sudden urges to break up due to feeling insecure, fear of commitment and trust issues. I try to talk her out of it and support her every time.

For me I have been crushing on this girl from my class and I have huge insecurity issues and I over think a lot, and I tend to talk to my friend about it.

So a few days ago, she texted me saying she's having the impulse to break up with her boyfriend, even though nothing bad happened and just a day prior to this she herself said she's had the happiest day in a while because of her boyfriend. So naturally I talk her out of it. So basically I talked about how she's expecting too much sometimes, and how she needs to learn to trust him more. Then I text her: ""so what are you going to do?"". She doesn't reply or even read the message.

Now prior to this I've been dwelling on the topic of my crush for weeks and it has been killing me because i think I messed up by not confessing earlier and now it's really awkward as our(my crush and I) conversations are dying.

 So 30mins later with no replies I just text my friend saying: ""idk what to do"". 

She replies: ""about what"".

I say: ""The whole [crushes name] thing”

Here's when my friend tells me:“im sorry but tonight is my turn to complain, and whatever because I have nothing to say because it's not fair you're stealing my thunder.”

I was confused and demanded her to explain and she said: “im sad and I'm feeling a lot of things but empathy is not one of them, and even after you've talked to me about it (boyfriend problem), I'm still sad and I'm am in no mood to empathise and help you when I can barely help myself""

She then adds: ""you've complained about this for a little too long and you've done not much to help your own situation"" 

And that's where I flew into a rage and called her a cunt and a shit friend, and we are no longer talking.

c6mi4y	2019-06-28 16:47:10	extraguacamolo	AITA for not helping my coworkers?	"I started off here a few years ago doing warehouse. I have experience doing shipping/receiving and inventory management. My coworkers know this and have come to rely on me at times to help because of this, and I'm always happy to do so. I've moved up in the company but I still feel a bond with the guys and girls I was ""in the trenches with"". I have more of a standard office job now, but I still keep in touch with my old buddies even though I'm at a desk and they're in a warehouse.

So the last few weeks, our manager has been on vacation. In the past, when our warehouse has been behind, I've asked if it would be okay if I joined in and helped them catch up. I understand it's not my place anymore, but I sympathize with the team I worked with. I also understand I'm not getting paid to do warehouse duties so understandably I was okay with being denied helping them.

We're a very small company, roughly ~25 people, but we operate at a high traffic rate. So the last week, it's been busy, we're down people (multiple going on vacation at the same time). Our warehouse (only 3 people back there right now), asked if I could help catch up. I felt bad, but I had to tell them no because my direct manager didn't approve of it when they were in the office last week. Now they're on vacation and I feel like it'd be worse if I went behind their back to do the same task.

AITA here? One guy totally understands and she's still cool with me, but the other one doesn't seem as friendly with me anymore. This is really bumming me out because I really enjoy their friendship and being able to talk to them in passing, lunch, or wherever. 

I know I'm doing what's best for my career by sticking to the manager's wishes, but part of me feels like I'm a huge ass for not helping out in our busy season, when we're down a few employees too. Is there anything I can do to rectify the situation? Should I bring them some snacks or something? I don't want to convey guilt either, but I do feel really bad that they're slammed and I'm just working leisurely at my cubicle."	Not the A-hole	0	0	18.0	9.0	0.0	0.0
c6mho1	2019-06-28 16:46:05	glowwormy1234659	AITA for telling someone off on a post about depression	"So I 23F posted a photo on Facebook basically saying; to give yourself a better chance of getting through depression self care  (exercise, sleeping well, healthy food ect) is vital. And while the post didn't say this my brother's best friend (roughly) 21F called me ignorant and accused me of saying people who don't try self care aren't worthy/ don't try hard enough to get better

* I want to stress I never advocated this or those in replacement of professional help or medical treatment, only as a supplement* 

I then went on to accuse her of gatekeeping on treatment of mental health. 

Copied FB comment from 21F; ""@glowwormy1234659 Yes but this post suggests that if you don't try the above then you aren't must not even be trying to get better, which as those posts explain well is quite ignorant and what the issue is. I have a lot of friends that struggle with these issues and it to suggest that is very rude to the individual.""

I in no way meant to Imply those things. Personally self care has helped me deal with those feeling when I'm depressed but I know that it's not a miracle cure, but it can help when used with professional advice and medical treatment.

She then went on to block me, even though we've known each other since elementary school and she's my brother's best friend. So were bound to bump into each other. She would never pick a fight with me in public but I'm pretty annoyed that she'd do all this over such a trivial post on Facebook.


Edit: here is the wording of the post for those who asked

""I believe that depression is legitimate

But I also believe that if you don't: 

Exercise,
Eat good food,
Costume positive material,
Get sunlight,
Surround yourself with support

Than you're not giving yourself I fighting chance""

It’s also hard to be quiet when I’m making breakfast/lunch and I have to find the pots/pans/plates, clean dishes, etc. When my girlfriend sleeps over it’s even worse, because he expects us to whisper to each other and not make any sound. Often he’ll text me as around 10am - 12 pm accusing me of being loud and knowing he’s asleep, and to be quiet. I’m never being maliciously loud or trying to wake him up on purpose.

I quickly said no and she got very defensive about it. I don't like the way he left my sister, he still has my belongings, and I want him to know nothing about me or my family.

Last year I made a new friend, a dude, we’ll refer to him as Jay. Jay is a year below me and seemed like a pretty nice dude, we had a lot in common, and became close instantly.

As our friendship continued, I realized that Jay didn’t have the best control over his emotions and was kind of a narcissist, but hey, it’s college. People are full of themselves. He was humble when he needed to be and he was always nice to me.

Anyway, during February, my boyfriend and I separated for unrelated reasons. I was devastated. Jay seemed to comfort me like any other person would.

And then when my boyfriend and I got back together a week later, Jay was *pissed*. I found him waiting for me outside of my dorm wanting to know why I’d come back to campus in my boyfriend’s car. I explained that we’d gotten back together and he lectured me on why it was a horrible idea and just told me to be careful.

Our friendship continued, rather tensely, until May. One night I started getting texts from Jay that were very self-demeaning and negative. He didn’t seem receptive to my comfort, and I honestly can’t remember what it was but I said something that made him snap and he laid into me.

He started calling me a bitch and a whore, told me that I didn’t deserve my boyfriend, that I deserved the miscarriage I had a year ago (ouch), that I could stop pretending to care about him if I was never going to “take it further”.

I blocked him on every social media platform and we haven’t spoken since, but I did find out an interesting tidbit from a mutual friend. Jay was diagnosed with BPD the week after I got back together with my boyfriend and this was apparently just a meltdown.

c6mdj7	2019-06-28 16:36:29	HorriBliss	AITA for telling my house-mate to tell his girlfriend to keep the noise down?	"OK, background:  I'm a student at University and lived in Halls last year (7 of us with en-suites, and shared kitchen and living room).

So my house-mate (Ron) finished his exams a whole week before the rest of us did.  He stayed an extra week so he could be in the flat when we all partied on the last weekend.

Ron's girlfriend, Hermione, does NOT live in the house.  But for the last week was in the house 4 nights a week.  This isn't a problem, she played Mario Kart with him all day, and then went to his room.

However.  Hermione's last exam was on Thursday, and my other house-mate, Tracy, had an exam on Friday.  Hermione got very drunk and was obnoxiously loud.  11pm is our agreed 'shut the fuck up' rule where we be quiet as people want to sleep.  She was being loud at 11.30pm (I could hear her 3 doors down, whilst I had music playing on my laptop speakers), and if I could hear her, the likelihood is that Tracy could too.

So I messaged Ron:

""Hey man, do you mind telling Hermione to keep it down a wee bit?  It's just that it's past 11, and Tracy has an exam tomorrow, it's just a respect thing.  Thanks babe xxx""

I thought that would be in the end of it.  But 10 minutes later Hermione texts me:

""Why can't you tell me yourself?""

So I reply:

""Oh sorry.  Just thought it would be more polite to go to Ron.""

""Why?  Do you think he owns me?""

"" ??  What, no?  I just thought it was more polite.  It's not that deep.  But if you insist.  Can you please keep it down in communal areas, especially as people have exams the next morning.""

""lolololololol""

I don't know why I can't let this go as it was like 3 weeks ago, but it just pisses me off to no end.  On top of that, she saved the last message I sent her to Snapchat, so that pisses me off too.

To further compound things, Ron will be living next to me next year, and this bitch'll be around then too.  If she's noisy (and rude) again, I'll fucking go through her the first chance I get.

My parents (50M and 48F) were there too. So we were in the living room and I was sitting on the sofa on my phone and my cousin (28F) brought up how I'm getting on at university (just started last September) and I said I'm doing good.

I was still mostly just focused on my phone and not really on the convo at hand and she said in a jokey way as families do whether I have a girlfriend and that the girls must find me attractive with my new hairstyle (whole family starts laughing, cos I permed my hair. It's sort of an inside family joke) and I still wasn't paying attention to what she saying but I just blurted out ''Yeah all the girls at this uni fucking love me they can't get enough of me tbh they're annoying''.

c6mbgw	2019-06-28 16:31:59	mandovera21	AITA For sleeping with a girl that one of my best friends liked	"So I’m not sure how to do one of these or even really how to start but I’ll try to give as much context as possible. It started a few months back when a new girl got hired at our job and she was cute but I didn’t think anything of her. She also had a bf at the time and for me when a girl has a bf she’s off limits.

Skip a little forward to about a month and a half ago he tells me that he’s trying for her I’m like oh okay cool go get it (he had just broken up with his girl recently and was trying to test the waters) but after he mentioned it that day he never mentioned it again.

Last week her and I are working together and early in the day I invite her for drinks she says okay. Her shift ended a little earlier than mine so she left before me and didn’t mention anything about coming out nor did I press her to. I figured if she wanted to come she would and if not that’s cool too. Me and my other coworkers go out for drinks and she texted me asking if I was out. I send her the location and tell her to come and sure enough she did. She’s not much a of drinker but she’s having a few drinks a couple shots says she hasn’t eaten all day. She’s telling about how she just broke up with her bf, how it wasn’t working out for a while and that she moved into a new place. I have a little buzz going but I wasn’t getting too crazy cause I had to drive. Turns out she lives 5 mins away from me now so I offer to drive her home cause there’s no way she should be driving.

We get to her house (and this is where I probably fucked up but I just didn’t think anything of it because I’m oblivious to seeing signs) and she tells me about this bottle of wine she has that’s so good and I have to try. Who am I to turn down a glass of wine?! So I come inside she pours the glasses of wine she takes me to her room and the rest is history. When it’s all said and done she asks me not to tell anyone she’s fairly new and doesn’t want any rumors to start and I say I’m cool with that I don’t tell people my business anyways so it was a good arrangement.

Fast forward to a party where we’re all at everyone is having a good time I’m talking to her, then I’m talking to him, then I’m talking here, then I’m talking there.. you know, social butterfly things. My boy comes up to me and we’re chilling talking about random shit and then jokingly he says by the way stay away from my girl. Right then my stomach kinda turns. I tell em “ahh shit are you still going for her?”. The look on his face goes from laughter to anger/sadness cause right then he knew. I told him what happened and he said it’s cool you’re my boy and walks away. 

It’s been weird the last couple of days he hasn’t been himself and I know I’m to blame but he won’t tell me. I didn’t think they were that serious cause I hadn’t heard about her for a month and a half or so but judging by how his been these past few days I’d say otherwise."

"We are subleasing and I found somebody to sublet my spot and cover my portion and responsibility of rent and utilities. I was dumb and agreed to splitting the remainder of rent with my housemates if we didn’t find enough people to sublease the entire apartment because their sublets dropped and I felt bad. We filled five out of six spots and there is one spot left to be split amongst me and three other people. (Note: this is entire situation is only for the month of July) I am no longer able to help pitch in for this as my financial situation has changed in the past week. I covered what is supposed to be my portion of the rent so I believe I should be able to back out of the agreement. I also don’t feel that I should be responsible for any other spots in the house that weren’t filled because we had people drop at the last second due to my housemate’s negligence and her being last minute with communication towards our potential sublets. 

EDIT 1: Our agreement is also for the people not living in the apartment but one of my housemates will be mostly living there for the entire month. She is splitting with us and not paying for rent because everyone else agreed (without telling me) that she would be staying as a guest. 

EDIT 2: My housemates have said I can pay them back at any time in the future. I have decided that I will still split with my housemates but only if our other housemate agrees to pay for rent since she is staying at the apartment for at least half a month’s worth (not staying on the weekends).

I said “I’m sorry, I have a boyfriend.” He was understanding and asked if I had any pictures of us. I pulled out a picture of me and an ex-fling. He said “oh you guys are cute” and moved on.

Yesterday, I received a text from him. Apparently, he talked to our mutual friend and asked HER if I was seeing anyone. She told him that I was single and that I’ve never even been in a relationship. He texted, “I’m just kind of hurt that you lied to me. I wish you would have been honest and told me that you weren’t interested.” 

I panicked and doubled down on my lie, told him the friend doesn’t know what she’s talking about, that I JUST started seeing this guy. He replied, “Lol you can stop, I give up.”

At a game yesterday, he didn’t even talk to me. It was really awkward. Did I do something wrong? I ALWAYS use the “I have a boyfriend” excuse to turn down guys I’m not interested in. It’s effective and nobody questions it, except for this dude apparently. I know it’s technically lying but is it justified or AITA? Should I have been more honest?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6m976	2019-06-28 16:26:45	Achileas7	AITA: Got into a car accident and act bad	"Context: I got into a car accident. Everyone if fine and no one got hurt in any way. The accident was decent but not a huge one.

The other guy was riding a bike. I was driving a car in a single lane road with two directions. There is a shop in the other side of the road and I want to go there and park outside of it. I use my signals indicating I want to turn, I checked the other direction that no one was coming I went for the parking. Officially what I did was not legal as entered the opposite side of the road.

Next to me is that guy with the bike. He wanted to pass me through my left which is not legal regarding that he has to enter the road with opposite direction and as the road is single lane he cannot pass at all.

He hit me in my driver's door and smashed into an other car. His bike is damaged a lot as long as my car.

As my car is pretty new and got through a lot to take it, I am really pissed off. I know that I done something not legal but I doubled check, and make sure everyone is safe. Never expected anyone to show up from behind me as he didn't have any reason to do so.

When I told him that I was wrong but he wasn't supposed to drive so recklessly he replied ""it's a city, bikes do this all the time and the way I drive is normal.

Police and insurance came and neither of us want to take any responsibility regarding the damage.

In a nutshell I got really mad because a lost a big job cause of this and behave like an idiot. Bikers in my area tend to pass cars from any side despite if it's safe or not. I was wondering what would happen if a kid Crossed the rode and I had to avoid it.

 A few hours later he asked me for a charger which I didn't give him mostly because I was pissed off (he already had made his phone calls)

I can understand my wrongdoings but I am acting defensive as I try to balance my life in 3 jobs, and guys like him appear from nowhere driving really irresponsible and ruins everyone's life. Also, he cannot understand that the way he drives cause troubles from everyone and can cost lifes despite the legality of the matter.

So am I a total douche acting like that?

"So my girlfriend (22) and I (27) live together in her hometown but we’re planning on moving to my hometown next year. We are set to rent an apartment there between the two of us. Her sister (19) moved to that city a few months ago because she couldn’t stand her father anymore and is living with her uncle. Her uncle apparently turned out to be also an asshole who according to my gf comes on to her sister. So her sister asked if she could rent an apt with us next year when we move there. I absolutely don’t want to live with her, I have nothing against her I just want to live with my gf that’s all. Also I make more money that she makes so she wouldn’t be able to pay an equal amount of what I would pay monthly. 
I tell my gf this and she says the other option would be that she moves to that same city but instead of living with me, she would rent with her sister to help her out and that she has to think and consider both options. I got really sad about this, offended as well. I moved to her hometown to be with her and we we were planning to move to my hometown together, I’m even saving money to do that. It’s like everything we planned goes out the window because she wants to help her sister. And I understand that BUT nobody made her sister move there without a college degree just to try her luck, she was being childish and irresponsible and now she wants her big sister to save her. It’s unfair. So, AITA? Should I understand her thinking and be cool with her NOT living with me? We already live together so it would be a huge step back, I feel like it would ruin our relationship."

Bit of back story: My friend has recently found out that her mother is dying. She has cancer that has been left undetected for a while, a long with a few more medical issues on top. In reality, life has dealt her a shitty hand.

We work at the same food place, and our shifts are often together but when one has a day off, the other works.
Last week she booked off the week to go on holiday, it meant that I had to work my ass off as we were already down one anyway. Now she's back, I booked a few days off myself (Mon-Fri) to go away and enjoy the sun. (I've only returned a few hours ago) 
Anyway, she text me asking if I could cover her shift tonight, she said she feels awful and she wants to visit her mother. The thing is, Ive worked so hard lately to enjoy my days off, I've planned an evening for myself and I really don't want to go into work tonight. Especially with a busy weekend ahead of us. 
I told her this, and she said it was okay but I feel like such an asshole. 
I can only justify this to myself by thinking that she has had plenty of opportunities to see her mother during the week (she's been on late shifts) so is it really down to me?

TL;DR : friend asked if I could cover shift so she could see her ill mother, I rejected.

Edit: okay after rereading the post I see that I've left out a few details.
1) she's been on evening shifts all week so she could spend time with her mother everyday if she wanted to 
2) she specifically asked for more shifts
3) the likelyhood of her even getting to see her mother tonight is slim as visiting hours are limited and she has no mode of transport.
4) she had a chance of recovery but it is slim. Maybe I shouldn't have used the term ""dying""

Edit 2: her mother has been in and out of hospital since January. She's had a lot of health complications. I don't know exactly when the cancer was found. But she was in hospital during her vacation."	No A-holes here	0	0	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I would read him a couple books, and tuck him in every night. He struggled with it for about a week, but quickly adopted the routine and was going to sleep with a smile on his face every night. This only lasted for about a month until my girlfriend and I got in an argument about it, and she said I was taking her away from her child and she was missing the chance to cuddle with him, and she is going to regret it for the rest of her life. I gave in, and for the majority of the last year she has been sleeping in his room. I recently brought the subject up again, and we ended up in another argument.

Now they all know that I really don't enjoy board games and I was exceptionally tired (ended up sleeping on the couch until about 1 A.M. LOL), so I said I didn't want to. I offered to let her come hang in my room so we could put on a Vine compilation and talk, but she didn't want to. It had to be a game. I apologized, explained that I was just really exhausted, and continued to sleep like I had been. That's when she went off. She started saying that I always do this, that I'm selfish, and that I'm making the evening about me.

I (15m) have been friends with this guy since elementary. (He’s also 15m) we’ll call him Kyle, which is not his real name. 

In grade eight, Kyle and I met these girls from another school. (Ours is single - gendered). There are two girls who we meet, who also have more friends etc etc. 

In grade eight, Kyle had a thing with one of the girls in the group, and I have a thing with the other.  We’ll call the girl Kyle had a thing with Sarah. That lasts about three months. 

Fast forward to this year, they start talking again for a little over a month and then decide to part ways. 

Kyle has said multiple times that he’s much happier without her, and that she’s strange, and most of all that she’s really ugly

Meanwhile, I’ve been friends this entire time with her and have been talking to her semi frequently throughout the year. About a month after Kyle and Sarah stop talking, I start talking to Sarah even more frequently. 

The minute I mention I even have conversation with her he’s hostile. Says that I’m too good for her, says that I should stop talking to her altogether. 

After school ends Sarah and I decide to hangout. I have feelings for her and definitely wanna act on them but I didn’t want to mess up our friendship. We get along, ya know? 

Kyle also heavily dislikes the fact that I’m even hanging out with her. Again, stated that I’m too good for her and even told her on a video call that she’s ugly. Which I found particularly hurtful. 

During this, I say multiple times to Kyle that I can be friends with whoever I want. I don’t explicitly say that I can be friends with Sarah, that detail is important. 

When I hangout with Sarah one thing leads to another and we end up kissing. Kyle, upon hearing this is very angry with me and calls me low, a fag, spineless, and tells other people about it. 

I’m very confused, because although I get bro code and I didn’t explicitly mention Sarah (when I said I could be friends with whoever I want), he was against me even talking to her from the beginning, and was unhappy when he was with her. So why the big deal?

I'm feeling a little nervous about my wedding ceremony after a wedding I just attended and wondering if I'd be a huge dick if I said something. 

My fiance was a groomsmen and his parents were invited. During the ceremony, I was sitting with them and of course he was up at the front with the groom. When it was his turn to walk down the aisle as a groomsmen, my future mother in law burst into loud, sobbing, hands- in-face tears that went on for several minutes. These did not sound like happy, emotional tears. The people sitting around us noticed and were starting to get uncomfortable, my fiance noticed from the aisle and his place at the front and was embarrassed. After she recovered from his small part she didn't bat an eyelash at the rest of the ceremony, which was very lovely and emotional. 

 She's always been very possessive of her son and I know she doesn't care for me/blames me for ""coming in between them"" (whatever the fuck that means) so I'm inclined to believe the scene she made was because she's genuinely upset her son is getting married. 

I'm worried that at our wedding she's going to make an equal or worse scene, which will be A. humiliating B. completely take us out of the moment during a ceremony that's supposed to be just about us together.

I'm still in high school and currently there are 3 guys that are clearly pursuing me and one of them is actually someone I also have feelings for. One of the 3 guys, Jeremy, is very weird and creepy. I really don't want anything to do with him. He texts me constantly when I'm being dismissive, asking where I am and sometimes comes to the place I'm at without any notice. It's really uncomfortable. Asked him to stop a couple of times but he just won't listen. He also tried to touch me a couple of times and I tried to say no, but he kept on trying to touch me(putting arms around my waist, holding my hand, etc.)

Note that I live in a conservative country and we don't really show public affection unless it's appropriate to.

A couple of days prior to this post, me and my close friend, Sharon, were doing a celebration for our confirmation at a restaurant in a mall. Jeremy is one of our friend from the same church who also received the confirmation.

Me and sharon invited our friends from school and we both have the same friends so I know those people well.

When we were eating, Jeremy texted me, asking, ""Where are you?"" I replied with a simple ""I'm at a mall, with my friends."" After more unimportant questions, he finally asked, ""Why didn't you invite me?"" And I simply replied because the ones I invited are people from my school and he doesn't know them. It would be awkward. Then he stopped texting me and started texting sharon, asking her if she wants to go to the arcade at the mall. She jokingly replied with a yes but apparently jeremy is so dense that he came to the arcade and sharon, feeling responsible, came to the arcade to meet him. At that point, I was so irritated I refused to come up to him.

Meanwhile, sharon and 2 other friend came up to him and made him pay for the games they play when the rest of my friends who doesn't know jeremy just stand around the arcade. I accompanied them and told them we should get out of the arcade and we did. We waited outside for sharon and the other 2 friends who knew jeremy. When we were outside, I told the rest of my friends about what happened and apologized for it. They took it well and told me that they're fine with waiting for the 3 of our friends. After they finished, we walked around the mall for a while and went to the karaoke before going home.

A day later, my friends who played in the arcade called me rude for not saying hi to jeremy. I told them that it's dumb for me to abandon the people I invited to meet up with jeremy who came without me knowing anything about it. But then they said that 'jeremy made an excuse to meet me' because I refused to meet him a couple of times in the past. 

We ended up arguing and it's been days since we talked. I also stopped replying to Jeremy's texts because his creepy behavior is too much.

My gf went out of town on a church trip without her phone for five days, while I went to another country on a separate church trip. We haven’t been able to talk at all while we’ve been gone and I’ve been seeing the sites around a melting Europe. These five days have been very relaxing and I’m in a better mood than I’ve been in for months. 

So if I’m not particularly looking forward to talking to her again because of the potential stress, obligation, and distraction of her texts, am ITA?

c6m2ei	2019-06-28 16:10:50	tobleronetromboner	AITA for refusing to pick up my daughters half siblings when I pick up my own daughter from school?	"My daughter is 9 years old. I split up with her mom because she was cheating on me while she was pregnant with my kid. 

After my daughter was born and I was confirmed bio dad, we split acrimoniously and there was a lot of unresolved anger from my part. My ex was vindictive and left my daughter on my doorstep (without telling me she was dropping off our baby) so many times. It got to a point one day where I called the police and sobbed and sobbed that I didn’t want to give my daughter back because her mom kept withholding her from me, and then leaving her in unsafe places without letting me know until after she’d done it. 

They helped a LOT and I was given custody of my daughter eventually. I can’t say a bad word against child services and the cops because they both helped me out hugely. Over time my ex wanted to see more of our daughter and she stabilized enough where she will take our daughter once or twice a week. She also ended up having 4 more kids who she has custody of. 

Lately my ex has been asking me to ALSO pick up her other kids whenever I pick up my daughter from school because they go to the same school because she’s ‘too tired’. She asks on days when she doesn’t have our daughter. Obviously due to the nature of our relationship I don’t want anything to do with her outside of necessary stuff for our daughter. I keep saying no, because a) they aren’t my responsibility b) I’m not a taxi service to be dropping her kids to her after school and c) I want to do NO favors for this woman. She chose to have all these kids, she can pick them up from school herself. 

I told my mom that my ex keeps asking me to pick up all the other kids too, and my mom thinks I’m being a giant ass because my ex lives close to the school and it would make her life easier. Frankly I don’t think it’s my problem.

c6m2af	2019-06-28 16:10:36	NerdSergeantM7	AITA for not including my partner's name in the project	"In science class, we were given a one-day assignment and that was to research a type of mineral(ours was schist). My seat partner was a girl that was in my general friend group but we never really spoke. We will call her Annabella for reasons. So this bag of schist was given to us and we were told to research it. Just so you know Annabella was always passive aggressive towards me in science class, so I never really spoke to her. Immediately Annabella told me that she wanted to work alone and that she didn't want to work with me, so I left her alone. She put her Chromebook away and started drawing on the lab table with her pencil eraser. Fast forward to the next day, and I had to present the first slide, and the look of surprise on Annabella's face when she didn't see her name anywhere on the slide was indescribable. After noticing her name was not up there she went and talked to the teacher. The teacher pulled us aside and asked why I hadn't included her name and didn't give her credit. I then went on to explain how she refused to do work and the teacher told me that I shouldn't have done that, but Annabella lost all 20 points on the assignment. The story doesn't end there, she told everyone she could that the story was flipped, so she told all of my friends that I had done nothing and that she had done everything while I messed around. Before this project, we never really spoke. But before you go and say ""she deserved it"" maybe, maybe not. I knew that she would lose 20 points off her grade, and because it was the beginning of the marking period so her average at the time would be REALLY LOW, but I tried to justify it in my mind knowing that I was still going to make her grade plummet.

c6m1jy	2019-06-28 16:08:55		AITA For being annoyed when my partner doesnt say bless you?	"Throwaway account.

&#x200B;

This is something my boyfriend and I have been in disagreement about for the past few months, and we figured we'd leave it up to reddit to see who's right. 

So I don't sneeze that often, maybe once a month/once every two weeks. But they're normally pretty loud, and hard to miss, at least I think. I noticed after a couple months that my boyfriend never said bless you when I sneezed, and didn't really think anything of it, even though it bothered me a little bit. Growing up I was taught that it was polite to say bless you when someone sneezed. 

&#x200B;

So after a couple more times of sneezing with no bless you, I asked him why he never said it. And he said that he just never noticed that I sneezed, even though we're sitting like 5 feet apart. I told him that even though it wasn't a big deal, it would mean a lot to me if he made an attempt to say it. It's been multiple months since then, and he has still never said it, despite me reminding him about it. 

&#x200B;

Whenever I sneeze, I look at him afterwards, and he's almost always looking at me, so I know he notices, at least after the fact. I know this is super petty, but it's less about the actual act of saying bless you, and more about the fact that I told him that something he was doing was bothering me, and he doesn't care enough to make even a tiny effort to change it. 

&#x200B;

So am I just being overly petty? Or am I justified that if he knows something bothers me, he should at least try to compromise with me?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We had gone out to a trip on a sunny day and was watching an Elephant show. It was so hot that my crush wanted to walk out and stand in the shade then sit out in the hot open stand. I was sitting next to her mom and asked her if she wanted water and she wanted. So I headed out to get some water. I wanted to head out anyways as I was not comfortable that my crush was feeling tired because of the sun.  I happened to buy cold Starbucks coffee and water and got 2 umbrellas. I gave one to my crush even though she did not ask. But I am sensitive to her needs. I gave the 2nd umbrella to her mom and sat down next to her. After the show got over in 20 minutes, I offered her friend the coffee and she did not take it. She was upset that I did not offer them during the show when it was hot. I did not feel like the Asshole but after 3-4 days I felt like one. So I called her and apologized as I realized I hurt her. She advised me that I needed to be more attentive to other people too. I started to defend saying that since she knows me for some time, she could have taken the liberty to ask me to get some water.  Anyways it sounded like she accepted my apologies. She then exited from the Whats app Group and did not bother to join that group again after 1 week. I feel sad that I was not socially right but I have apologized. AITA still ?

These two friends (X & Y) are well-acquainted & while one (Y) likes the other well, the other (X) does not care much for this person but tolerates said person’s presence. X agreed to have Y tag along because it benefited X to have Y along for the ride.

The day of, X was delayed in meeting up with myself & Y. Y did not want to wait. I was willing to wait & said so. I asked if X wanted us to wait & said if so, I would tell Y to either wait or go on without us. X said not to wait but we would meet later.

I asked multiple times if X was sure because it was originally supposed to be myself & X going to do the thing. I was assured each time that X was fine with meeting later.

I left with Y. Y drove; I was a passenger.

The area we were in had poor cell phone reception. X, Y & I knew this from past visits.

X tried to call. X texted. I received none of it.

Later, when I got a bar of service, messages & missed calls appeared.

I got a few messages back & forth. X was on the way & suggested we meet up to eat together.

Meanwhile, Y was doing a side activity which did not involve either myself or X. This also meant Y could not be contacted at the time to verify that the suggestion for a meal was accepted.

Upon Y’s return, X was still on the way (driving) & unable to receive messages or calls while the vehicle was in operation.

I informed Y of the modification of plan, but Y had come across Friend Z & invited said friend to accompany us to another place to eat, which was not the same as requested by X.

As passenger, I had no choice. I attempted to contact X but again had no service. By the time I got through, X said it was fine but I could tell that X was very angry.

When we all finally met up, X ignored me & when X finally spoke to me, it was in a very dismissive but ‘up’ manner so as to not let the others around us know something was wrong.

I tried to apologize several times but the wall was there & not coming down any time soon.

X left after the event without speaking directly to me for the evening.

Y was oblivious.

A few weeks later after having sporadic contact with X, X asked to meet.

We talked for an hour & X revisited the situation with the event. I apologized profusely & reiterated that I hadn’t gotten messages & due to being a passenger in Y’s car, I was overruled in where we went to eat by Y & Z.

X then informed me that we would no longer be doing things together & that rebuilding our friendship would take time because X felt betrayed that I didn’t do more to ‘force’ Y to do what X wanted to do.

It has been nearly a year & while X still messages me, I feel that there is no longer any meaningful relationship left between us, despite meeting up occasionally.

c6lv5o	2019-06-28 15:54:58	iggyfpontificates	AITA - Brother wants my details for his student finance forms	" 

Hi, first time poster so sorry if any mistakes. Me (42m) and my brother (36m) get on pretty well. We hang out and generally have a great relationship avoiding (for the most part) all the normal sibling bullshit that can sometimes occur.

Just for some background, he is starting a degree as a mature student and I work in a bank. Neither of us is rich but we pay our bills.

Now, today he texts me in work. I cant answer right away so about 20 minutes later he calls me asking for my address and some other details (nothing financial like card/account details though) for a 'student finance form' ASAP. He seems kind or hurried and urgent. I should say I would have zero problem giving him details like this but I did feel like I should at least ask WHY he wanted this info.

He basically said 'just because' and when I asked again he says that he 'just needs the details' in a kind of entitled impatient way that kind of annoys me.

Well, as I said, this all seems a little fucking off/strange to me so I ask again if he can explain briefly why I need to give him MY details for HIS finance form. At that point he says 'never mind' and hangs up on me!

I text him in a civil manner and say I really don't think what I asked was unreasonable in any way. He comes back to me with some shit about how he would have not even asked me any questions if the roles were reversed and that his girlfriend's brother gave him his details for whatever purpose was required on this finance form (I still don't know what he needed my details for..)

I should also say I really don't think this is anything shady. He's an honest guy basically. But, the basic lack of respect he showed by not deigning to even explain briefly the reasons for his request sort of irked me. Like I'm just some sap who should pony up his details on demand because little bro asked. I haven't had any communications with him since this happened this afternoon and that's expected as he can huff when he doesn't get his own way. I love him but recognise that this huffing behaviour is basically manipulative. He is going to stud psychology so is well versed in this shit.

Any questions please just ask. Thanks for reading.

So I called her out, saying that posting pictures of dead animals and complaining about them was insensitive, it's a living being. What's next?

Then she goes on a rant about how rude and mean I am to her.
I put the straw back down and dropped the water bottle.
“So you just aren’t going to answer me then? Why would you even do that? I am breast feeding two kids and the only reason we are even in the car is to take you to your appointment.”

c6lseh	2019-06-28 15:48:39	AutomaticTennis	WIBTA if I reported my neighbor's daily yard sale?	"I live in an area that is currently gentrifying, I moved there almost two years ago. That is to say that a lot of my neighbors are not well off and they have some side hustles like yard sales, crafts, parking in their yards for events, etc. and there can be some tension between the new residents and the old residents.

&#x200B;

Last year, the people who live directly across the street from me started doing a yard sale. They did it literally every day for 3-4 months. They had old clothes laid out, hung all along their fence, appliances piled on their park strip, etc. It wasn't just an eye sore, it drew a lot of traffic and people parking in front of my house (we all street park) and my dogs couldn't go out in the front yard because the some of the people would upset them.

&#x200B;

I thought maybe last year they were making a big push for some extra cash or something, so I let it go. But they have set it up again this year.

&#x200B;

The law where I live is that you can only have two yard sales per year, and they can only last 3 days each. I'm worried though that they may need this money, and I know they have some kind of procurement process for all of this stuff (people don't just have five vacuums laying around), so I worry about them being left with all of this stuff they can't sell.

So, WIBTA if I reported them?

  My parents divorced in 2009 for legal reasons (mostly), my father had a debt (he's still paying it as far as I know) and my mother didn't want to be legally binded to him. My mother kept on living with my dad for a short period. She then started looking for a new partner and moved around a lot because she would meet most of them online. 

  Due to this, I don't have a lot of dear memories to look back to when I think about her. We couldn't stand each other for longer than a day or two after I hit the beginning of my teens. She would pretend to care what I am up but then she would interrupt me after 1 min and change the subject to her or her new partner.

  She even called police on me when I was 16, so she can convince me to sell my flat in my hometown so she can get the money. I was a minor so I couldn't deal with it, she wanted me to to agree to give her rights over the property. I obviously refused. And 2 days later there was police on my (my partners') door.

  Point is, she's done so many shitty things to me and I honestly don't want anything to do with her. I haven't seen or spoken to her for 3 years now. She has been living in this flat that she wanted sold just because she has nowhere else to go. She's been unemployed for 5 years. She goes to live with my dad during winter because she doesn't have money for wood for our fireplace.

  I signed a declaration letter 4 months ago to give my dad the right to sell the flat. I will get a certain amount of money (1/3 if its sold for a good price). If the flat doesn't get sold by the end of 2019 that letter/document its not valid anymore unless I resign some stuff. I plan on contacting an agency and have an agent sell it rather that my dad. So this means that she will need to move out. So she's left homeless. AITA for planning on doing that?

P.s I plan on using half of the money to buy myself a house in the country I am living at or my country's capital, and the other half to help me dad's debt. He really needs a breather."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"My boyfriend and I (22F) moved in with his HS best friend (Jason, 25M) to save money until I’m done with my internship. My boyfriend has a friend group composed of liberal and “woke” people. There’s this girl, (let’s call her Em) who started to get close to Jason. Jason likes her but is too cautious to try anything since Em still has a boyfriend of 3 years. The boyfriend doesn’t like our roommate and it caused tension in their relationship. Now, since two weeks ago, I come home and find Em chilling the in couch and staying until past midnight just talking to jason. Like literally just talking and I can hear them through the walls when I try to fall asleep. I really think she’s shady AF by how she conducted herself around our roommate, especially knowing that she broke up with her boyfriend to be with him. I’m also pretty sure Jason gave her the keycode to get past the apt gate and that makes me super uncomfortable. Now she’s over practically every other day and I can’t even be comfortable when I go outside my room to be in the kitchen. I didn’t signed up to live with a 4th person and this girl has a house. A HOUSE to go to instead of here.

Everytime I see her in the apt., I don’t talk to her or acknowledge her. Our roommate made us aware that I was giving off the “cold vibes” and that it made her feel unwelcome. I said i didn’t really care since I wasn’t the one who keeps inviting herself to the apt all the time. I know my animosity against Em could caused my bf to be isolated from his friend group. I really don’t care about his friend group but I know it’ll make him sad if he is pushed out because of me. I’ve told my bf about my bad feelings about her and he understood. He also doesn’t like her but he knows she’s an integral part of his friend group.

Should I be nice to Em for the sake of my bf even though she’s SHADY AF? Or confront my roommate on how she makes me uncomfortable knowing that it could cause my bf to potentially lose his friends?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I know their relationship is none of my business and that it's not my place to judge. I acknowledge that. But every fiber of my being cannot like this girl. I just don't and I have tried to vibe with her and it doesn't feel genuine so I stopped long time ago. Also note that I don't go out in my way to be mean to her. I have never said anything that's rude or curse at her. I just don't make an effort to talk to her because, again, she's not my guest nor did I invite her over.

EDIT: When I have guests over, I don't expect my roommate to talk to them, even small talk, or even interact with them because I am the one who invited them over (after giving him a heads-up that people are coming over). I just don't understand why he expects me to talk to her and pretend I'm interested in whatever she says, and he never gives us the courtesy to let us know if he's inviting people over.
EDIT: I talked to him about giving us the courtesy to let us know whenever he’s inviting people over & he doesn’t think it’s our business if he’s inviting people & it’s rude that we don’t make them feel welcome."	Asshole	0	0	150.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

so last year is when I made this friend and I met him the day after I came back from a mental hospital. (I had tried to commit off myself) He was chill and an overall cool dude. Now at the time I was in a relationship with an emotionally abusive guy and he broke up with me about 2 months later. The day he broke up with me the friend asked me out. I said no as I literally just got out of a relationship. A week later he asked me again and I was like ""yea sure why not"" It lasted a day before I realized I was in NO place to be in a relationship. I told him I wasn't in the mental headspace to be in a relationship and he said okay. For 2 weeks he bothered me, asking if I was ready yet. I eventually snapped at him saying I wouldn't be ready for a long time. He understood but proceeded to act bitch and annoying the following year. A couple months ago we mended bridges and were friends again. He again, told me he loved me but I was/am in a relationship with my new boyfriend who I love very much and is the actual opposite of my ex. (don't worry he's not abusive in any way,shape or form. He's like a heckin doggo he's so good n sweet.) So he nodded and understood. About 2 weeks ago I had a mini party with him and some friends. We went swimming and then back at my place. After swimming he kept his shirt off and it made me n the other guys uncomfortable. He even complained, saying it was cold so I told him to put on his shirt. He said no so I shrugged it off and sat on my bf's lap. I'm out in the mountains rn and I got word two days ago he randomly showed up at my house, Wanting to know when I'd be back. I flipped out and told our mutual friend to tell him if he did that again, I'd break his shins in with a crowbar. In the past I had a guy find out where I live and he'd randomly come over with no warning. I gave him my mom's phone number but he would never call.

So i have a crush on this guy who is very secretive. I think I might be quite good friends with in school. I try to hang out with him during lunch or break altough sometimes he finds me annoying sometimes. We text alot almost everyday. One time I thought he flirted abit so I screenshotted the texts and sent it to my friend to ask him if he was or is he just playing around. I also sent him some other stuff from our text. For me I don't think I sent anything personal between me and my crush to my friend.

Anyway, my crush saw my texts on my friends phone and during break he asked me if I did send those to my friend, to which I responded yes and I asked him why but he decided to walk away. I decided not to go after him cause maybe he might just wanted to know and needed to do something else. I approached him after lesson again and asked him if there was anything wrong but he didn't respond but he just walked away. I kept trying to ask him if he was mad but he just kept ignoring me and told me to go away. I tried texting him and apologizing to him but he didn't seem like he wanted me to be near him. My friend told me he was a bit upset and he said my way of apologising is not mature (I think that's because I did it over texts). So I decided to go up to him to apologise to him in real life but again he ignored me and told me to leave him alone ( I think I didn't really sound sincere )

I'm not really sure what I did wrong because he didn't tell me why he was upset about it. And I don't know how to get him to talk to me again or how to become friends again.

Basically, am I the asshole for sending screenshots of my texts between my crush and I to my friend causing my crush to just ignore me?

c6lmmh	2019-06-28 15:35:15	concerned-parent1234	AITA for telling my disabled son and his partner I disapprove of their relationship?	"I'm fully prepared to be called an asshole.

My son is 23 and has cerebral palsy that is quite severe. It only affects him physically. He is very smart. I have recently setup his financials where he gets his disability sent to  him directly and got him his own place. 

His caregiver visits him daily at his new place. I did this because I wanted my son to be independent. 

He did very well for a few months but recently he has gotten into a relationship with a 58 year old man that I simply do not approve of.

It's not that I'm homophobic. But it's the fact that this man older then me has now moved in with my son. They've only known each other for three months.

And what's worse is that my son isn't gay. I had a heartfelt conversation where my son broke down and admitted he isn't gay but is scared of dying alone.

I have been heartbroken ever since and tried to setup some counseling sessions only to find out that his partner is double booking activities on those days and forcing my son to choose.

I'm not sure what this older man's deal is. He is contributing around 25% of the rent and seems to work.

Last Sunday I had them over for lunch and I couldn't control myself. I called him a predator and I thought he was disgusting. He then proceeded to take it on himself to physically push my son out the house without even asking.

My son called me after and said that what I did was wrong and I don't understand his predicament.

Every instinct in me is telling me that man is bad news. 

I'm contemplating reporting him to the authorities. But that might be going too far and my son will likely resent me.

Was I really the asshole for calling out that creep like that? 

All I want is for my son to be happy. And right now, I really don't think this situation with a man he isn't attracted to is making him happy. But he is 23 and I may have overstepped."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

She has since blocked me, I contacted her on an alternate account to apologise and she's stated that she can longer trust me and that I've broken her trust.

Now I know I shouldn't have lied, and when I was called out on it I DEFINITELY shouldn't have lied, but ending a 6 year relationship over it, just seems a little over the top.

So the town in which I live holds a pretty big event every year that draws in a ton of people from the surrounding area and also people from around the country. This event takes place in our downtown district and conveniently my dad owns a business close to downtown with a good sized parking lot. So last year my little brother and I had the idea of going down early in the morning and selling spots in our lot (a lot of other businesses so the same) and we made roughly $500 in two days. My then gf (now wife) also helped a ton. 

Anyway, this year we’re planning on doing the same thing. My wife took the day off of work so she can come help all day. My little brother said that if we had another person he would likely not come down on the day she’s there because he’s gonna take the opportunity to visit a nearby amusement park with some friends because everybody else is gonna be busy at the event in our town. We were all cool with it.

As I was discussing with my wife what we were gonna do, she said something to the effect of “so we’ll split the money three ways, I’ll take a quarter because I’m only there one day, you take half because you’ll be there both days and your brother can have a quarter because he’ll only be there one day” which to me seemed a little sketchy. The deal was that he would take half and we would take half. 

I can understand her point, and I think I agree to an extent because he’s only gonna be there one day but I can’t help but feel like it would be an asshole move for her and I to take more money than him. So what do you all think?

Edit 1: sorry! As I was drafting this I accidentally left out a detail. I was gonna add it after the second to last paragraph but I must have forgotten. Last year he worked both days but when it came to splitting the money he told me to take all of it as a wedding present. I told him no I didn’t want to screw him out of his work, but he said it’s a wedding gift. Idk if that changes anything for this year."	No A-holes here	0	0	1662.0	147.0	0.0	0.0
c6limm	2019-06-28 15:25:43	kitkatknots	AITA for telling my friend [21F] she's emotionally draining me [21F]?	"My friend always has some shit to dump onto me. She doesn't do anything to help herself. Sometimes I would have to find solutions and drag her to finish the task bc she literally asked for it. Our other friend and I have tried every thing by giving her advice, listening to her, suggesting solutions, initiating those solutions, lecturing her (not the way to go ik), nurturing her, but nothing worked.

Out of frustration I told her that she's emotionally draining me. She then said, ""You're not the only one who's drained by this. I am, too."" It sounded like she took advantage of our compassion and empathy. Our other friend had to cut ties with her because this was toxic.

This girl's been through a lot. She has to deal with conservative parents (close-to-being-an-alcoholic mother and homophobic father), pay for some kind of bill for her parents (i.e. cable, dinner, etc), was bullied as a kid, etc.

WE TRIED to help her. She doesn't speak up nor does anything to help herself and ends up victimizing herself. I've told her to go seek professional help because the anxiety and potential depression will get worse. But she spends all of her money either on concerts, makeup, almost all meals for herself, dinner for her family, car fixing, pay off cosmetology school loans, and gas money and still refuses to go full-time.

She tells me her interactions with her parents and it seems like she gets annoyed by them for no reason. She likes to cook pasta with tomatoes. Her dad's allergic to tomatoes. Whenever she'd make pasta, her dad would ask her why she didn't make her dad (tired truck driver) one without tomatoes. She'd get annoyed. Therefore, my girl rarely cooks at home = no $ left

Sometimes her mom gets drunk after work and leaves the car who knows where. I was involved once when I was supposed to spend the evening with my bf on our date night and I told her I wasn't even in the city. I thought her sister would help her. She didn't inform me that her sister could help, so I ended up driving back home + finding her mom's car.

If my younger sibling had money problems, I would let him live for free for a month or two. Idk why she's too scared to ask her sister (only 2 years older) if she could live with her. She pet sits her sister's cats all the time.

I'm not saying, oh, everyone gets bullied, so you should get over it. Girls would call her names in elementary/middle school. I got bullied by kids and adults. I became stronger from that. Our other friend got bullied for being deaf. She was able to get stronger. Fortunately, none of us were physically bullied. But home girl still gets triggered. Our friend and I are able to laugh things off or tell our stories like they're a part of our milestone/lessons in life.

c6lhxj	2019-06-28 15:24:01	woohoothrow	AITA For Telling the Bus Driver to Drive More Quickly	"I started a job for the summer a few weeks ago, and I commute each morning via bus. I always take the same bus at the same time and it's always been ""on-time"" at least within a 1-2 minute  window. Yesterday, I was waiting at the bus stop and checking an app that lets me know when the next bus will be here, and the time jumped from 2min away to 6min away (which is not unusual because the app is pretty unreliable). I thought that was a little suspicious but I wasn't too concerned because a 4 min delay would still let me get to work on time.

Anyways, the bus driver ends up being 9min late (which is hilarious, since the bus comes around every 10min so the next bus would be there in the next minute or so). I thought to myself that maybe there was a small issue that explained why the bus was held up for so long, but I didn't think much of it until the bus driver started driving: And I realized the driver was incredibly slow, going about a 1/3 of the speed that previous bus drivers have/cars around us were (below the speed limit). In addition, he wouldn't leave a stop until everyone who had boarded the bus was seated (which I understand is appropriate for some passengers, e.g. elderly, disabled, young kids). Midway through the ride, I realized if this driver kept his pace, I would be uncomfortably late for work, and so I went up to him and told him, ""Sir, do you mind driving a little more quickly? My work day starts at 8."" I said it with a smile and tried to say it in a calm/friendly way because I know it was selfish and I didn't want to sound high-brow/arrogant  (but I was pretty anxious so I'm not sure how it sounded). After I said that, the driver just shot me a glare and told me to get seated.

This normally is never an issue, because the bus always gets to the stop near my workplace at least 10 minutes before 8, but with this driver's pace, I would be uncharacteristically late. So what normally is a 12-15min bus ride ended up taking a whopping 25min which I've never experienced in my 3 weeks of commuting to work. In addition, the usual rotation of bus drivers always drive uncomfortably fast (but within the speed limit), to the point that I always have to grab a rail as soon as they take off or else I'll fall to the ground.

Yes, I understand that this is one experience in a whole lifetime/planet of human experiences, so me being worried about being late to work is inconsequential in the long-run; and yes, I'm aware that unfortunate things happen sometimes outside of our control. But because I don't want to develop a bad reputation in my office since I'm still starting out/in my probationary period, being on-time is important; and usually, I'm hit with a wall of work from my manager once I walk into the office, so being there on-time allows the rest of the office to function (in some way).

AITA for making this request?

tl;dr Bus driver drives unexpectedly slow, so I asked him to speed up.

EDIT: I've taken this same bus at the same time to work since my first day and it always gets me there 10-15min before my work day. This day was a random occurrence where I took the same bus at the same time and ended up being late.

I met a woman at one of my local college bars. She was super cool and we hit it off pretty well. Turns out she was a semi recent graduate and was there as a recruiter for a business. It later came up that she was married and had a kid of like 2 or 3. She used this opportunity to bitch about her husband not taking care of the kid and other stuff (but that's not important). She ended up trying to come over to my place but since we were both kinda drunk I thought that could end badly, so I gave her my number and told her to call me tomorrow if she felt the same way. I made up a bullshit excuse about having to get up early the next day or something. Obviously as the title implies, she ended up coming over. Now some of my friends have really been upset over this stating they've ""lost some respect for me"" and called me a ""massive asshole/home wrecker"". Now in my defence I figured that since I'm single and not committed to anyone than I'm personally not cheating, nor is it my job to police her relationship. Plus if she's willing to cheat on her husband with me than she's probably willing to cheat on him with someone else and I'm not the only thing between them and happiness. AITA?

Edit: To all the people saying ""get tested she's probably done this before"". Doesn't that mean I'm not the asshole? This is gonna make reddit hate me but like put yourself in my shoes. On one hand, I get laid on the other hand I don't but either way she still cheats, thus aren't I at least neutral party in this situation. I mean she's a consenting adult, who did I hurt, nobody. She's the one who hurt her family. I don't even know them.

Last edit: For final clarification. I have no intentions of having a relationship with this woman. Though reddit may disagree I'm not stupid."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6lf77	2019-06-28 15:17:43	Zaahm	AITA for making a joke about strippers to my brother who will soon become a monk?	"My brother was still young when I left my parent’s house, and we don’t have a very close relationship. We meet 2 or 3 times a year, mostly for family events. Maintaining a conversation is always a struggle, because we have no shared interests. He’s a math genius, and as much as I’ve tried understanding what he does, it’s just way above my head. I had always hoped that as he grew older, he would develop other interests and we would be able to connect in some way.

&#x200B;

About three years ago, he became very involved with religion. My parents are devout Christians but not bigots, and both my sister and I are atheists. Our morals can sometimes differ but we all place our love of our family above these differences, so I didn’t expect this to become a problem although I would have preferred if he got interested in something I could relate to.

&#x200B;

My brother was set to defend his PhD dissertation this week, and become a researcher in his field. A few weeks ago, he announced that he would not become a researcher. After getting his PhD, he would become a monk, join a monastery 200 miles from us and live the rest of his life mostly in seclusion (there is a visiting room where they can meet family a few times a year). Obviously, this came as a huge blow to all my family, and we’ve been struggling since then to cope with the news, and try to understand how it came to that.

&#x200B;

A few days ago my brother was awarded his PhD, and afterwards the audience went for drinks in an adjacent room. I noticed a big cardboard box about the size of a person in the room, and joked to my sister that the striper still hadn’t come out of her box and was surely starting to get hot in there. She laughed. I told the same joke to my father, who also laughed. I then got to my brother, and as soon as the word “striper” came out of my mouth, he grunted, turned his back to me and started a conversation with someone else.

&#x200B;

At the time I made the joke, there were only family members in the room except for one of his friends. Afterwards, I asked him if it was wrong to make this joke because his friend was nearby, or just in general. He said in general. I said it would take some time for my sense of humor to adapt to the way things are now. We didn’t discuss it any further.

&#x200B;

I realize now that making a joke about strippers to someone who will soon be taking a vow of chastity is not in very good taste. In the other hand, I think the joke was light-hearted and even a monk (which he is not yet) could hear it, smile politely and move on.

Too many people, too much traffic, etc. So I was window shopping when I came across a second school (School 2). I apply, and I didn't hear back for a few weeks. I get the call and get everything lined out. It was a bit expensive. 24K a year before my fafsa. We do my fafsa, I'm pulling scholarships left and right. My remaining balance for Fall 2019 was $6300 I go to orientation and  get a roommate and my classes and I'm even on the archery team! It turns out.. I'd owe 12K a year. Turns out that $6300 was per semester...

Last night I started searching for colleges (School 3, which has been emailing and waived my application fees and even extended my deadlines. I had to pay $150 in may, didn't respond, so they kept extending and extending until june 30th. It's the same distance as school 2.  It has a ton of meal options, the dorms are incredible, and after the fafsa and KHEES and scholarships, I'd owe $4000 a year. 

&#x200B;

School 2 stopped texting me. It took them ages to finally respond when I said that I already called the admissions office. They texted me a minute ago and pleaded with me to stay with them. They said they'll look for scholarships and everything. When I said no, they said ""fine. I'll see what I can do."" 

&#x200B;

School 3 was not my first or second choice, but they did come to me. It's cheaper, the dorms are nicer, and there's more to do in town.

c6lcrp	2019-06-28 15:12:02	QueenRowana	AITA for asking parents to pay for a camp their kids is no longer going on	"Mostly are we the assholes

At scouts we have summer camp. We ask parents to tell us way ahead if kids will come on the camp. Then we book the camphouse and book outings like swimming and climbing for them. 

Parents had said their kid would come. We booked the house for roughly 25 kids. Then a week ago parents took the kid off scouts altogether so he also isn’t going on the summercamp. 

Point is we as leaders have some costs that we divided by 25 paying  kids to create our budget. Some fixed costs like renting the house and transport have already been paid. With a kid missing our budget changes and we have a loss. 
Of course we wont need to buy food for him or take him swimming.

So we (my fellow scout leaders and i)  discussed and asked the mum to pay a third of the camp price to minimize our losses. 

She went berserk. Saying we had no right to ask for money for a camp her kid isn’t going on. The fact that she had originally filled in a form to say he would come was irrelevant to her and so was the fact that we had incurred costs on her son’s behalf. 

Stupidly our entry form for camp stated nothing about what parents would be liable for if they withdrew the kids last minute. We plan to change that next year obviously. So we didn’t have a leg to stand on and had to cut our losses.

c6l7oe	2019-06-28 15:00:17	Lotsofsnacks1	AITA for spending $250 of my husband's money on snacks?	"So, for various reasons me and my husband have different bank accounts. He makes much much more than I do, so I just pay whatever bills I have the money for. I normally do not have hardly any money left for myself though.


Well, we've been having a lot of problems lately because of his excessive drinking and have been fighting a lot. My best friend wanted to take me to this nice store that's pretty much a grocery store for snacks to cheer me up. This was a couple nights after me and him had a big fight. When I told him I was going to go snack shopping he told me to take his card. I let him know I was planning on splurging because this place is fairly far away and theres alot of stuff I'd like to try and he said it was fine. 


Well when I got there, there was wayyy more stuff that I wanted to get than I thought. I knew if I was using my money I wouldn't be able to get much, but he had a good amount left after bills, so I figured I could get some extra stuff. So I called him for a couple of the things I wanted to make sure it was okay, since some of them were fairly pricey, and after like the 4th time I called he told me to not worry about it, I don't need to call him to ask, just get whatever I want and that it's his way of apologizing for being so mean to me lately. So I did exactly that and got everything I really wanted. For the record it wasn't actually a ton of stuff, it's just that most stuff there is pricey. When I got home and he asked how much I spent, I told him about $250 and he flipped out on me, saying that he didn't mean I could go that crazy and if I was planning on spending that much I should of told him. I didn't know it was going to be that much until I checked out though, it was only a few bags of stuff, its just everything is expensive there. I told him sorry but I did tell him I was splurging and called him about the more expensive items ($40 cake, $15 jar of jam, $25 cheese), and that he spends way more than that on his booze each week anyways, but now hes pissed at me. I talked to some of my friends about it and they said I shouldn't of spent so much just because it was his money and not mine, but he said to get what I want. AITA here?


Edit: since it's been mentioned a lot and I was asked to add it to the post, it wasn't what people normally consider snacks. I got stuff like vegetables (pearl onions, small colored potatoes, etc), some exotic fruits, spices and fresh herbs to cook with, a nice bag of coffee beans, and other non essential groceries to make meals or snacks with."

c6l53k	2019-06-28 14:54:10	quotebymichaelscott	WIBTA If I Made My GF Pay Rent?	"So basically we are both in our mid 20s. I've been fortunate to have my goals set early on in life and knew the first thing I wanted to buy (other than necessities and other minor fun stuff) was a house. This means no car, no vacations, no big weekends, no rent (Yes, I lived at home probably much later than many of you, but I took advantage of my parents offering to let me live home to keep saving).


Anyways, I managed to buy a house and seeing as I'm still young, don't have an expanding family, etc, I don't need the entire house for myself. I rent the upstairs floor for approximately $1,500/mth (2 bed, 1 bath) and I keep the downstairs for myself. My total monthly mortgage payment is just under $2000. This means I have approximately $500 to make up to cover the mortgage. If I didn't live in the basement, I could probably get $1000-1100/mth for the 1bed/1bath. But, I don't really want to do that as I would have to find other accommodations and pay rent to someone else. Anyways, let's get back on track.

Me and my girlfriend would both like to live together and I've been thinking this alternative for her to move in as a tenant (sign a lease at a rate of $500/mth) to help cover the costs. WIBTA If I did this? It seems weird having my gf pay me to live in a house I own but if we didn't, 1) we would be paying someone else just as much, if not more and not showing any equity for that and 2) I'm caring and giving, but I also don't wanna be just a support system... I want this relationship to be even support from both of us."	Asshole	0	0	217.0	17.0	0.0	0.0

Little backstory, my fiance and I have been together about 5 years and in the course of those 5 years he's never been good about gifts. This year was no different. 

I'm generally a pretty good sport, I KNOW he loves me, I don't need a gift to see that. He takes the trash out, does the dishes, and his share of laundry. 

This year my birthday fell on a short check for him, and he wasn't able to get me anything. He did apologize, and I accepted, but I was sorta expecting maybe he might do something next pay day? Like dinner or even a nice card. 

Its not about the gift, its the effort.

So WIBTA if I brought it up? It's been two weeks and we've been paid again, however I don't want him to feel bad and spend money he may not have just to go get me one out of obligation. He's sensitive so I don't want him to think I'm mad at him either. Kind of a catch 22. 

What do?

Edit: it's 100% not about the money. HE mentioned the money in his apology, but hindsight has me wishing I had just asked for something not money related at the time. I'm not looking for a physical gift, just actual effort.

c6l421	2019-06-28 14:51:35	babytooth666	AITA for being mad at my mom?	"Hello! Long time lurker, first time poster. Sorry for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile. 

Background: I (25F) have an old car of mine parked at my mom's (50'sF) house. I bought it years ago for $1000 and it lasted me about 3 months until it died for good. After that, she let me keep it parked there and I bought another car. (She helped me with the down payment for that, we each put down $2000)

Fast forward to this week, my mom is moving from her house into a new apartment because the house is being foreclosed. I am going there to help her move tomorrow. 

She asked me to get the car taken care of, so I contacted my dad. He lives a few states away but the car is technically registered to him. I told him I needed to order a copy of the title so I could have it junked. He responded and told me that he would get ahold of his buddy ""Mike"" who tows for a salvage yard. Mike never got back to him, according to my dad, so I started panicking a little as the moving date came closer. I called a junkyard near me and we worked out a deal, I have the old registration and a photo of my dad's license and I was all set to get the car towed away today.

Here is the issue. I texted my mom once I got all that squared away and told her ""I'm having the car towed away Friday at 3!"" and she replied with a thank you. Now, she called me last night and told me that she apparently ran into Mike at a gas station and mentioned the car to him. He said that he hadn't heard from my dad but he would be happy to help. So he goes over there and tows it. 

When she called me and told me that, I was initially mad that she had done it all without asking me. I had the appointment made and I could really use the cash. She clarified later that Mike will pay "" a minimum $250"" which granted is more than the other place offered ($120) but she just let him tow it away (illegally) without any kind of payment. He is a family friend but my parents haven't talked to him in a long time as far as I know. 

We talked and I simmered down when she told me how much he could (possibly) offer once he talked to his boss but then she tells me that I can have $150 and she is taking $100. I got mad again and told her that it was my money that went towards the car initially and I sort of need the cash. She brought up my new car, but in the time that I was still living with her I paid her rent AND helped her out with bills she couldn't pay so I feel like she isn't entirely justified in bringing that up. 

I'm just not sure if my opinion is skewed because we have had a rocky relationship. She was abusing painkillers during that time as well so I worry about her spending. All my friends seem to agree with me but i wanted some outside opinions because she texted me today explaining herself again but then telling me ""this is over now"" before I could reply.

c6l3zi	2019-06-28 14:51:25	criminalrhyme	WIBTA if i told neighbors to stop using my yard as their own?	"***UPDATE: I told my husband that we we're sending the neighbors mixed messages and regardless of his attitude that it didn't matter it was bothering me. I told him that I agreed to the ladders being stacked there but not laid out in the yard and they were taking advantage after putting me in a bad spot. We are going to the store to get the items we need for a temporary fence. There are lots of rules for the fence since we are on a corner nit we already know them. The fence will be going up starting Sunday and today they need to get their ladders off my lawn so I can mow first. This is non negotiable. I can't do yard maintenance with their things on my property. I will (nicely) be speaking with them later and informing them that while they might think I am TA that they didn't give me the full truth and I feel they are taking advantage of my nice nature. 

For those asking we had a survey done when we moved in and our map is accurate. ***


First time poster, long time reader so please forgive any mistakes I make. 

We have lived in our house for 4 years (we own if that makes a difference). We have a rather large aide and front yard when you compare to the rest of the neighbors. We have a fairly good relationship with our neighbors, saying hi, general pleasantries etc. I didn't grow up in a city so have never really had neighbors this close to my house before. 

Within the last year our neighbors have been using our side yard as if it was their own. It started with them putting their garbage cans on the sidewalk in front of our side yard on pick up day instead of in front of their house ( not a huge deal just began to bug me when everything else started going down). I came home one day to find that they had painted the fence on my side (it's a super ugly color that clashes with my house). They let their dog out to do his business in my yard and acted as if they didn't realize he was doing it when I caught them. They have mowed a single strip of grass along the sidewalk at such a short cut that it killed the grass. More things have gone on but space restrictions and I don't feel it's really necessary.

This is what's going on rn and lead to this post, they decided to have a yard sale. I came home to find that they had stacked about 8 ladders in my yard without warning, just put them there as if it was their property. The wife came over and asked if we minded, putting me in a tough spot to look like TA if I said no so I told her that my dog would bark at anyone that came into the yard as it was his job. This morning I wake up to find that instead of 8 ladders being stacked against the fence these are now laid out all along the side of my house and a yard sale sign in my yard. Already there have been people standing in my yard, right next to my house. My dog is freaking out and people have been loud with my dog. 

Is this normal? Do neighbors use other people's lawns like this?  WIBTA if I went over and now asked them to remove the ladders as the people in my yard is making me slightly uncomfortable? Should I just let them have their sale and talk to them later?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6l31h	2019-06-28 14:49:04	gr00vygal	AITA for not wanting to go on a family camping trip with my 6month old in the month of July?	"To explain my MIL, planned a family camping trip to Georgia in the summer without asking anyone’s opinion on the idea. It’d also be an 8hour drive from where we live to get to the campsite. In my opinion, it wasn’t very thoughtful of her to ask this of me and not get my opinion before making plans if she was expecting that I go with them. I’ve looked up the weather and it’s looking like highs in the upper 90s and lows in the 70s. I have a 6month old baby and the thought of driving that long in the car, being outside all day and  dealing with her at night sounds just miserable. Doesn’t sound like a vacation to me. If it were just me I’d have no problem dealing with the heat. I love traveling and adventures outdoors but my wee one complicates things. So I figured it’d be best if I stayed back while my 7 year old and husband join them on the camping trip. A good experience for them to bond as well. I didn’t think it’d be a big deal and it made the most logical sense to me. However, mil says baby will be fine because she did it with her kids when they were that young. Also, Husband says I’m being a baby and is trying to guilt me into going because I’ll be “missing out on precious memories”.  He also thinks I’m just not going to spite his mother.  Which is NOT the case.  We have our differences in opinions on a lot of subjects but I wouldn’t skip out on a family trip because of it. Part of me just wants to give in and go instead of dealing with the drama.  The other part of me thinks I should stick to my guns (my motherly Intuition) and not go.  Anyways, I’d just like to get the general consensus on the subject! Am I overreacting and it’s totally normal to go camping with an infant in the summer or should I not feel bad about staying home. Thanks!


Update: I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for their advice and feedback. I was feeling unsure of myself earlier today. However, I’m feeling much better about my decision to stay home with the baby while my husband goes with our older daughter now. Also, I took the advice from one of the commenters here and showed my husband this thread. It was just what he needed to see! :) He has since apologized and feels really bad about not initially being supportive of my decision that he now thinks is the right one."

c6l2p5	2019-06-28 14:48:15	Kafanicalaganica	AITA if I abandon my friends for months to study?	Throwaway just in case. I just graduated law school and am currently studying for the bar, which means I am studying for about 14 hours a day with a few breaks here and there. I currently have an apartment with four friends I’ve known since high school in downtown LA, where I do not have a desk but I do have a lap desk that I can kind of comfortably work on. I let everyone know ahead of time that I am not going to be in commission this summer and I may be studying at my parents for a good chunk of it. At my parents house, in the suburbs about two hours away, I do not have to worry about food, paying for coffee, there’s two different water filters instead of a small brita shared between multiple people, parking is in the driveway, I have an entire home office to myself and I am in a quiet environment from the time everyone goes off to school/work until the time the come back. I wouldn’t feel like an asshole if one of my roommates didn’t require medical care, that we happily have provided as he would have done the same for us- another roommate has taken on the bulk of this from the start of diagnosis and even when I was home I was mostly doing emotionally supportive stuff or taking on extra cleaning around the house. Since I am not home, i’m obviously not doing chores but I am also not contributing to mess and they have full access to my private bathroom (not that they wouldn’t with me there, it’s just less people around to use it). I still pay all my bills on the place but I am so much less stressed studying at my parents place, I don’t focus as well with the noises of living with that many people who all mostly work from home and I can easily yell at my family if they’re being too loud but I can’t very well expect my friends to stop their lives because i have to study & I am EXCEPTIONALLY cranky if I do get disturbed (every finals week that coincided with another roommates finals week would have both of us snapping at each other out of sheer exhaustion and stress). Idk, i’m conflicted. If they were random roommates I wouldn’t feel like an ass, but they’re friends of over a decade and since one of them has gotten sick we have all formed an emotional bond I feel like I am abandoning.

c6l24v	2019-06-28 14:46:56	Drakojana	WIBTA if I told my best friend I think his relationship isn't healthy?	"So there's quite a story to it. I'm 22F and my friend, who I'll be calling Adam, is 22M. We've been best friends for almost 14 years now. We never dated, fyi. Two years ago he found a girlfriend in his college and I was really happy that he finally got in a relationship. The girl (I'll call her Maria) seemed shy and timid when I first met her but I wrote it off as just a bit of social awkwardness of first meetings.

Some time later we played a tabletop RPG game and Maria got really stressed because she got like, two bad rolls. But she panicked so much we had to stop the game because other players lost their patience since it seemed she was about to breakdown. No matter what we told her, she was so sure her character would die and she was bad at it etc. Adam also felt bad, because he couldn't help her in-game and didn't know how to cheer her up afterwards.

That was probably the first time I noticed there's more to Maria than just social anxiety. She'd often apologise. And for really trivial things, like speaking up at the same time as you, dropping something or mentioning something that she thought wasn't important. Hell, she'd apologise for her own existence if she could. And she would always say sorry so genuinely, like she was about to cry so it made you feel bad for her.

Some time later Adam told me Maria tried going to a therapy but she gave up twice, claiming that they didn't help at all and that ""she did more on her own"". I have no idea what she could've meant by that. You can't play with her almost at all, because she can't lose. She gets visibly upset and it's like playing with a child - you have to let her win because otherwise she might cry.

And when the time came for them to write their thesis, the worst thing happened. Being the horrible pessimist Maria is, she kept saying how she wouldn't write it on time, how she'd surely fail and shit. Adam wants to get PhD abroad and Maria wanted to go with him but if she failed the thesis she'd have to stay behind for a year. And she would tell Adam that he'd probably forget about her in a year and leave for someone better because she's such a loser. Adam has always been a very good student so Maria's talk made him feel bad. Bad for being better than her (although I think it's always been a bit of an issue) and bad for the fact he'd be successful. He was so conflicted because he wouldn't want to waste a year waiting for Maria but he wouldn't want to upset her either.

Thankfully they both passed but that just sounded like emotional manipulation. At this point I don't care if she's got some big social anxiety or whatever, because I'm attending a therapy and I don't believe she came across bad psychologists twice. Plus it can't justify being a manipulatory partner.

So Reddit, Would I be the Asshole if I told Adam that his relationship isn't healthy because it makes him feel bad?

c6l0l8	2019-06-28 14:43:04		AITA: for getting upset that my girlfriend slept with someone even though I said it's okay?	"First time posting so I'm sorry if it's done badly. 

My girlfriend (24) and I (25f) have been together for about 5 years. We are crazy for each other. It's insane the way I feel for her and she feels the same for me. We are happily in love. We are kind of needy with each other but not to the point where it's clingy. We both get really anxious from time to time for no reason and we are always there for each other. 2 weeks ago my gf and I talked about trying out something like an open relationship. We talked about what we are okay with and what we are not okay with. For example, we don't feel comfortable if we are finding people to sleep with all the time. just more of a here and there type thing. 

So a week goes by and she's telling me she's been trying to get with some dudes she works with and she's messaging people on tinder and I was kind of surprised. I didn't think she would go this far this quick. I knew she wanted to get with one guy from work but not multiple. I talked to her and told her how I felt about it. How it's too much too fast. I asked her to just take a step back for a second for this is completely new to me. All is good. 

Well I've been feeling mentally off. I think it's anxiety, idk but it started the day before her and I had this talk and is still going about 5 days later. It's just been a rough week mentally and I have no idea why. Well two days later after our talk, she goes to help this guy from work pack because he needed to move soon. She left for about 2 hours and came back home. After we talked a bit she told me she slept with this guy. 

Today, I am not jealous that she slept with him. That's not what bugs me. I guess it bugs me that we just talked a week ago how I'd like for her to just take a step back from this because of all the guys she was talking to. Also, my anxiety has been so bad the past couples of days, I just got upset. I got upset that she left to go sleep with some guy when I had a hard day and she knew i needed her. I pretty much told her I was upset because of the timing. If she would of just waited for whatever this funk is I am going through to pass, I would not of cared. It was just too much for me at that moment. I got really upset. 

We are good now but I can't help for feeling like an asshole. Afterall, I told her I was okay with her sleeping with him. ( I didn't know when she was planning on doing it). I even told her I feel like an asshole for being upset but she doesn't think so. Idk guys, I feel like an asshole. Lol"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6l0a3	2019-06-28 14:42:18	I_am_also_queer	WIBTA if I bought and kept a fleshlight without my girlfriend’s knowledge?	"I’m 24M, she’s 23F. We’ve been dating for about 3 years now and have lived together for half that time.

Recently she confronted me and told me that, due to her own body image issues, she’s been having a really difficult time engaging sexually. Because of these issues, she’s asked me to be patient with her and not really initiate sexual activity.

Now I’m complete okay with this, and I don’t want to do anything if she’s not 100% comfortable with the situation. I understand that even though it’s obvious to me that she’s beautiful, her brain has a tough time seeing the same image that I see.

The other day I was picking up clothes around the room to get laundry and I noticed a pink vibrator behind the bed. I don’t care if she has a vibrator or not, and actually it makes sense to me that she would. She still has sexual urges even if her body dysmorphia makes it difficult to actually engage in sex. The only thing is that she never mentioned it, which kind of got my own insecurities running a bit. Like maybe she’s just not really attracted to me much anymore (I’ve put on about 20lbs since we started dating) and would rather have a toy than me. It sounds ridiculous and even I know those thoughts don’t make any sense, but they wouldn’t be insecurities if they were rational, right?

Anyways I’ve been thinking lately that I also have sexual needs, and if she’s got a toy for her then why not get one for myself? I’ve always been curious about fleshlights and I’ve been browsing the online store for them to check out some options. The thing is, I’m not sure how she would feel about me essentially having sex with this thing. I mean yeah it’s just a toy but it seems like it’s on a different level than a dildo or vibrator would be. And I would ask her, but then again I think that it’s really not her business. Just like it really isn’t any of my business whether or not she gets new toys.

So I’m stuck between thinking that it would wrong to get one because, idk I guess it’s more “real” than a vibrator, and thinking that it doesn’t matter because she’s got toys so it should be fine if I have some."	No A-holes here	0	0	22.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
c6kz9s	2019-06-28 14:39:45	IzzyScoutC	AITA For Asking My Brother For Money?	"So last year I sold my old car to my brother and agreed to do payments since he's in a bad spot. While I wanted the full sum of the car then (about 2000), I looked at how much I owed on various things and decided I could take payments. I had planned to sell the car third-party and use the money to pay off credit card debts.

For the first few months he paid on time but then this past May he basically fell off the face of the planet. I didn't hear from him at all for about a month and when I finally did, it was from his manager at work telling me he was doing something for work and couldn't use his phone. About two weeks later I get a text from my brother saying he's back. I ask for the payments he missed ($450 total) and he said maybe and that he wasn't sure and had a lot of stuff going on financially. I then asked if ""he's just not going to pay and just ghost me"" and he told me to ""calm the fuck down and stop with the dramatics."" He then called and told me to be patient and that I was being dramatic and insensitive. Today I asked if he'd be able to make his payment for June and he told me he doesn't know. 

AITA for asking for what's owed or am I being insensitive here?

Update 7/3: He sent me $240 today, saying he would be hungry. I’m assuming the payments will go back to being on schedule but I won’t be getting my hopes up."	Not the A-hole	0	0	273.0	71.0	0.0	0.0
c6kz29	2019-06-28 14:39:15	njsmmz	AITA for Kicking my Widowed Aunt Out for My Cat	"28F, living alone in a high rise apartment with my cat, Bella.

My Dad's sister, Aunt Jess her husband had no children, so they treated me as their own. We were close until my family moved overseas 20 years ago.

Earlier this year my Dad informed me that my Uncle-in-law passed away, and that Jess wanted to have a vacation to deal with grief. She'd be staying in my town for a month and wanted to stay with me, I agreed.

When Jess moved in, Bella rubbed on her legs. Jess swept her away, telling me that she dislike cats. First time somebody resist Bella's charms, but whatever, not like everybody like cats.

It was a busy period, I could not take days off work, so Jess passed time on her own, sightseeing and shopping etc, she also cleaned my place. During weekends I'd keep her company, we'd cook together and chat for hours. It would have been perfect had she not expressed how much she hate Bella.

Jess frequently complained how Bella creeped her out by rubbing, jumping and staring at her when I was out. She also complained how much I spent on Bella, and the money was better off elsewhere. I would always politely explain to her that I loved Bella and was willing to spend on her.

Once I came home and found the storage room open, it was usually closed to prevent Bella from entering as had sharp and toxic things inside. Fortunately nothing seemed touched. I asked Jess, she said she was cleaning and forgot to close the door. I suspected she did it on purpose, but brushed it off later, women her fifties and could get careless. 

Then came a day I reach home to find the windows open. UNMESHED, WINDOWS, 14 LEVELS FROM THE GROUND, WIDE OPEN. I closed them and looked for Bella, she was sleeping under my desk. I confronted Jess and asked her what the heck? Did she not know cats could jump? Did she not see the meshes I put on windows? Those unmeshed  should be CLOSED, AT ALL TIMES. Jess snorted, and told me that she opened the windows because it was too warm. Well, I installed air-cons for a purpose.

This was the last straw, not going to let my cat to be at risk any longer, who knows what she would do next time when I am out? I called up my Dad and asked him to have Jess leave before I kick her out myself. Dad soon ""invited"" Jess to live in his place. 

Dad told me later that Jess felt lonely, unwelcomed and unloved, and it was very mean of me to have treated her this way. I was sorry for not spending as much time with her as I should, but I could not have her endangering Bella's life, even after highlighting how precious she was to me."

Let me preface this by saying that I'm completely open  to the possibility that I might in fact be the asshole in this situation. Also I'm 26M. 

Long story short: my parents split when I was in my teens, but I'm not exactly sure how old I was because the whole period is pretty blurry for me. Times weren't fun and it left a pretty big mark. I'm in my mid twenties now and I have a very good relation with both of my parents. They're great people and I consider them both to be the funniest people I've ever met. Mom always made sure I was OK, and still is my go-to person whenever I need advice on anything. 

My mom now has a new boyfriend, and I'm very happy for her. I, personally, dont really like the guy. (Hes a friend of a mutual family friend, so I met him at some parties a long time ago). I always thought he was a bit of a doofus. I realize that this is a stupid reason to dislike someone, but I tend to like hard-headed people with a temper. The other kids at the parties used to make fun of him behind his back for being a doofus. Him dating my mother feels incredibly humiliating now. I know it sounds dumb, but I just cant get myself to see it any other way. Also the fact that he knew my mom when my parents were still together doesnt sit well with me. 

My mom asked me to meet him a couple of times, but I keep politely refusing. I told her I have no interest in meeting him. She now takes him to some family stuff, and I just dont come. I know this saddens my mom, and I do feel bad about it. I just dont want to act nice to someone I dislike, and I'm not even sure I can. (Except if it's it work-related, ofcourse). I'm by no means unfriendly in general, but I can be a dickhead. I'm aware of this and I think you guys will tell me to grow up and make mom happy, but all opinions are welcome. 

Thanks for reading this. I dont really talk about personal things with my friends, so I didn't know where I could turn.

Edit: I really appreciate everybody calling me an asshole. I believe you are all absolutely right. I have invited him to our next get-together and I have to be more open-minded.

"Just a quick heads up, the relationship that I currently have with my stepfather is great, although we've met ourselves with some difficult situation sometimes. This is simply one of them and I am interested to hear some of your thoughts about it. 

Small background: My stepfather is some kind of preacher and also a businessman who goes on various cities on a daily basis. I managed to meet him every week or so and we spent time together talking about various things, usually about my future. It's safe to say that I need him and that feeling's mutual.  
I woke up in the morning and prepared myself to attend my lectures. My stepfather then messaged me to lend him about 35$ so he can go out and do something that he didn't specify. I had full intention of giving him that much until I checked my actual saving. It was no more than 60$ (It was the end of the month). Earlier this month, I already lent him 100$ for his necessities but, he spent all of that money and his own so quickly. Apparently, it was for the salaries of his workers, his medication, and for his own transportation fee.

So that 35$ request was not so surprising, but still, I have necessities on my own. My (nondegree) course fees might be coming, so I couldn't spend my saving mindlessly. So I told him to wait till next month for me to lend him more money. He hasn't specified his need for that 35$ so I assumed that it was nothing urgent. Then he said to me that it's ok and he would stay at his home instead of going to work for the day. 

He told me later that day that he went outside the city to attend some lectures, with almost nothing in his pocket. He ended up not eating for the whole day, except for some snacks in that event. He then teased me about that 35$ request and how it would've been really helpful for him. I asked him back about why he didn't tell me that he would go to work and the urgency of that request, but he went silent. I felt bad but also annoyed at the same time.

TL: DR AITA for not lending my stepfather 35$ for necessities that he didn't specify earlier and then ended up starving himself for a day because I keep my own remaining savings for emergency?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	21.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

My colleague is gave me the silent treatment - now that i gave one back hes mega butthurt	"So my work mate (and generally good friend) started avoiding me like the plague and wont talk to me about it. So Ive been avoiding him and now hes acting butthurt af. AITA?

Here's what happened: were a team of two and we both come from different backgrounds but work wise we have the same goals and where he lacks I pick up and vice versa - so you could say were a pretty good team. 
Earlier this week we had a meeting and I had the idea of designing this app thing for the company and shared it with him. He seemed supportive and was ready to give advise should I need it. So I began working on it not yet willing to tell the bosses till I have something more solid to show them. Anyway, a supervisor walks by and asks me what im doing so ofc I tell him and he starts praising me like a lot (so much that the rest of the office gathered round me to sneak a peak) I explained i wasnt ready to show the boss yet but he went ahead and brought her round anyway. 
So I explain my idea to the boss and shes looking forward to seeing the project completed and plans to have a meeting next week. 
Meanwhile my colleague is across the desk divider listening. 

After they disperse I msg him like omg he put me on the spot like i wasnt ready at all - and no reply left me on seen. 
Then he started to act differently. Not talking to me. avoiding eye contact. basically as if he wished i didnt exist. My guess is that he got envious... But Idk why exactly or what I did to upset him.. he wont talk to me.

So out of angst I picked up on the silent treatment and now Im doing it to him. (although i feel mega guilty and hurt because i did nothing to offend him in anyway possible - i didnt ask to be put on the spot and I wouldve ask him for advise along the way and include him for sure). But now hes acting gloomy and sad around the workplace almost begging for pity because im not paying attn to him.


Also - if this childish behaviour goes on next week WIBTA if i told the boss on him? we need each other to work together. If our friendship is over fuck it. But i need this job."	Not the A-hole	0	0	3.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
c6kn2s	2019-06-28 14:09:52	sassyramennoodles	AITA For not wanting to work extra overtime so my co-workers with kids don't have to?	"So I recently started a job at a new company as an engineer. As a consulting firm our hours very much depend on clients needs and can result in a lot of overtime and out of town buisness trips.

I was talking to my boss the other day and he mentioned that we may be doing a lot of work out of town in the next couple weeks and he said that because I am the only one without kids I will be the one doing almost all of the extra work. He said it would be unfair to send people with family's away.

When he first said this to me it kind of made sense and I went about my day but I have been thinking about it and I think it is super unfair. Just because I have chosen to live my life a certain way does not mean that my time is any less valuable outside of the office.

I wouldn't be so offended if it was a ""you're new so here's extra work."" Or if I only had to do some of this extra overtime and out of town trips and I could split it with coworkers who are equal with me on the totem pole, but I am offended that I am being stuck with all of it due to my relationship and life status. My boyfriend, parents, friends, and siblings would love to see me more often but apparently that is irrelevant?

I was telling a friend of mine who has a family about my dilemma and they told me that I was being kind of a bitch because the people with kids should spend time with them, and while I agree that if you have children you should try and spend a lot of time with them, but that isn't really on me.

Even typing this I feel like I sound like a terrible person. What do you think?

Edit: some of my grammar errors were bugging me!

Edit 2: For people who have asked, I am hourly, I will not be salary until I am eligible to get my P.E. license in 2 years. Salaried professional engineers get to basically do what they want at the office which I don't mind, they earned that. 

That being said while I am new to the company I have been in the field for a couple years and still pull seniority within the company over some people, i.e. I got my own office instead of a cubicle, I train people, etc. The people who are getting less hours to spend time with their family's are other EIT similar to age and work status/level as me (some younger)

Edit 3: I don't plan on making a scene or a big deal about this besides some internet complaining and complaints to friends. I love my job for all other aspects besides some of my bosses less than desirable comments. I am not insensitive, which is why I questioned my stance, I understand that kids get sick, special events in your kids life happen and such and I would be happy to cover something. Esspecially if a co worker asked me, but I just get upset when I feel like my commitments are not being validated due to my lack of children. I will work reasonable overtime and jobs to further my career, but I will also be sure any important weekend or travel conflicts of mine are expressed to my boss."

c6km4l	2019-06-28 14:07:18	_test_lefticle_	AITA for expecting my dad to carry my stuff and ruining my graduation	"So this has just happened and I'm typing it up while it's fresh in my mind. I've just come out of graduation after fiver years at my school (we live in England) and it's had been a really great event, with everyone having a good time. I had some bits and bobs left in my dorm, it being a boarding school, and we went to get them after the celebrations. (side note - there is a big party happening later tonight but there is nothing going on graduation wise in the interim.) I went upstairs and picked up what I could, my mother took a toastie maker and my sister carried a supermarket carry bag with a pair of shoes in it. I myself carried a reasonably large guitar amplifier that I could carry in one hand, as well as my pretty large yearbook (normal A4 size but hardback and wide) and a box of goodies maybe 10x10x10 cm.) 

After getting about 30 meters to the car I said exactly to my father (who I had checked wasn't carrying anything) ""would you mind carry my amp"" and he agreed. About twenty meters later he says something along the lines of ""I can't understand why you expect me to carry your stuff after this event"". This seemed completely out of the blue to me so I immediately got defensive and said something like ""wait what?"". I then launched into a bit about how I often carry heavy stuff around the house for my parents so it wouldn't be unreasonable that I request the same from him. This isn't a lie as I am often maneuvering chests of drawers or helping him take the roofbox  off the car and whatnot. I havent (as far as I can remember) recall if I have asked him to return the favour before but I'm pretty sure I haven't. Anyway, he, much to my surprise, stuck to his guns on the matter. He became more and more surprised at me as the argument went on and he began to accuse me of ruining the day after picking a fight over something like this. He then took the perspective that I am an able-bodied young man and can carry my own stuff. This much is true, and I could have carried the amplifier with everything else in my hands, but it was bumping against my yearbook and I didn't want to scuff the corners, as well as the weight of it becoming somewhat uncomfortable, what with the other things in my hand. However, I stated that it was a simple courtesy and he is more than capable of carrying it too. This is also true as he is a frequent runner, and despite being 56 is a relatively strong man who is physically fit too, more so than I in both respects. I was surprised by his stubbornness so I asked for an apology for this and he scoffed and said ""it's like you're coming from another planet, I don't understand why you're picking an argument over a bloody amplifier.""

c6kla5	2019-06-28 14:05:08	peenieparade	WIBTA if I reported my neighbors’ behavior to their landlord?	"This past week,  I have been dog sitting for my aunt’s small dog. He’s a dachshund/shih tzu mix, so he’s pretty small. He also lives in the country and has not been properly socialized with other humans/dogs. As a result, he is scared shihtzless (sorry couldn’t help it) of other dogs, and some humans, and hides behind me when he sees them. 

I live in the city, so I’ve been taking the dog on leashed walks throughout the sidewalks in my area so that he can use the bathroom. 

In one of our first walks, I noticed this house full of young men and women partying on their rooftop deck. As I got closer to their house, I noticed that they were all cheering and egging on their male friend who was outside of their house, on the sidewalk, urinating on the street.  Whatever NBD. He wasn’t harming anyone, and was clearly just VERY intoxicated. I kept walking. Nothing happened. 

Last night, I walked passed the house again, on the sidewalk opposite off their house. As I do, two of the young men exited the house to smoke a cigarette. They brought their three unleashed dogs with them. Upon seeing my dog, they bolted over to us and jumped on me and the dog. I tried to pick up my dog, but had difficulty doing so.  The neighbor’s boxer then bit my dog’s leg. Naturally, since the dogs were unleashed and their owners were preoccupied with their conversation/cigarette, I was initially left alone to break things up. Eventually the tenants came over, and apologized claiming “their dogs would never hurt or bite anyone.”  I told them that the one dog did, in fact, bite my dog. They didn’t have much to say in response, and I left. 

I was angry about the entire ordeal. Though we live in a city, many parents of toddlers, and many other small dogs live in the area and play on the sidewalks. Loose dogs, especially when medium/large size, can be dangerous around such vulnerable children/dogs, whether they intend to be, or not. 

When I got home, I checked out my dog’s leg and it seemed fine. No broken skin, and no change in the dog’s gait. 

I found their landlord’s contact information, and considered writing him a letter to let him know of his tenant’s behavior.  I honestly just want them to put their dogs on a leash.

c6kj85	2019-06-28 14:00:03	possiblymaybejess	WIBTA if I walked out of my future in laws' church?	"My fiance and I got roped into going to church this weekend with his family by my fiance's grandma. Now, I was raised Catholic, am currently pretty agnostic, and generally don't care about going to church (like I'll go for weddings, funerals, baptisms, etc., but not of my own volition), but my fiance's parents go to a veeeeeeery conservative Christian church. We have never been to this church with them specifically because we know the views are completely opposite our own.

I told my fiance that if the sermon gets offensive, i.e. talking poorly about women's rights, LGBT folks, etc., that I didn't intend to sit through it, and he said he understood and was on the same page. The issue is this: yesterday, I realized that Sunday is our major city's Pride parade. So in my mind, the possibility of the sermon involving LGBT issues just jumped way up.

If I did step out, I have no intention of making a scene- just to go sit outside until it's over. However, my understanding is that this is a very small congregation, and it wouldn't go unnoticed. Plus, my fiance's family is very involved in the church, so my actions would be associated with them. WIBTA?

Eta: I appreciate everyone's input. I agree the best course of action would be to avoid being in a position to walk out entirely if possible. I'm going to talk to fiance to see if his family knows what the topic of the sermon will be ahead of time."	No A-holes here	0	0	355.0	41.0	0.0	0.0

Context : my boyfriend at the time was well into his late 20s, and did not have a license to drive. He halfheartedly took lessons but gave up pretty quickly when he got a job that made it harder but not impossible. 

He was very into sports and going out in general, and would commit himself to events without (I can only assume) much thought of how he would arrive there/get back.

Generally speaking, I don’t mind giving people lifts here and there, and I’ve never once in my life asked people for fuel money. What I do object to is being told off and someone having a go at me for arriving 5 minutes later than the person expected me to.

Further context : by 5 mins, I really do mean 5 mins, not half an hour plus after the requested time. I used to get a lot of calls asking for pick ups, or expectations that I would provide lifts, or sometimes even a request to pick up even though prior to the event he’d said he didn’t need it and would make his own way somehow. 

His outlook was that he had a right to be annoyed at me not being bang on time, because he did a lot of other things - due to working hours would often be home significantly earlier than me, so mainly did the washing, cleaning etc. My outlook was that it was only convenience that he did those things, I absolutely would have done them (and did, if I were off or somehow home earlier) and also I never had a go if something wasn’t done or done quickly enough.

c6kgx2	2019-06-28 13:53:50	justsuperexhausted	AITA if I don't want to share my passion with my sister when we don't have a good relationship?	"So, I'm young enough to still live with my parents and sister. I love my parents to death, but my sister's an absolute narcissist.

She always goes for the lowest blow when she's talking to or with me. I've asked her numerous times not to insult me because it's something I'm fairly sensitive about. Even though I've been asking her for years, she still responds with things like, 'just don't get me angry, then'. The point I am making is that I've tried many, many times to repair our relationship, but she's davka and won't do anything to help me.

I'd like to make one thing clear: I was not a good sister for the first five years of her life, by any stretch of the word. I was rude, threw tantrums and the boss of the house until I was around eight, at which point I mostly left her alone.

I really like musicals. They got me through a lot of hard times. Sure, I have other hobbies, but most of them are things that my sister does too, so they're mentally tied to her. When doing these things, I think about her subconsciously. Musicals aren't like that - she isn't involved in them, and so when I listen to them, I don't have to think about our relationship or fights.

I have OCD-like tendencies, and so I have a lot of bad thoughts about what what would happen if, say, I skipped the wrong song at the wrong time. Because of that and the way that I listen to them (so that I don't get sick of them), the order of the songs is something I always control completely.

Recently, though, she's been saying she wants to get into musicals. I know it's selfish, but I don't want her to. We go in the car together often, so it's not like I can just ignore her interest in them - so far I've discouraged her from listening to them in front of me, but as she gets into more of them it'll get less likely.

I know, logically, that there are lots of people who are into musicals, but they're really special to me. It's fine that my friends listen to them, but her listening in front of me takes away the control that makes them help me so much. I've explained this to them, but she and my parents think that I'm being an asshole for asking her to not listen to them specifically in front of me.

My parents say that it's something that can bring us common ground and fix our relationship. That's not going to happen - anyone who's witnessed one of our fights could tell you that. It wouldn't be hard to fix our relationship, she's just... not willing to put in the effort. We won't become friends (or acquaintances) because of something like this.

\-prognosis: yes, I am. I get that now. Thanks for your arguments, though - I see why she thinks it's unfair :)

c6kgfk	2019-06-28 13:52:35	jfhsbsj	AITA for not wanting my [21] bf's [19] sister [36] to come with us on vacation?	"Yes, she's really 36. They were born many years apart. 

Firstly, I love his sister. She's great, and her bf is great. But let me tell you the story. 

I originally wanted to go to go further and have a longer trip with my boyfriend (about a week). But shortly after beginning to plan that, he got a new job so his schedule couldn't accommodate that trip. Instead, he suggests somewhere closer and that we go for 4 days (the first location was a plane ride away, the other a 3 hour drive). I say okay.

Because we're going for 4 nights, he suggests he invite his sister and her bf to come for 1 night to make it cheaper. Also, it allows us to have some company. 

Now I'm not too thrilled with this, because this was meant to be a vacation for just the both of us. We both live with our parents still and we never get time alone. But I hide my disappointment and think ""it's only for one night, that's fine"".

Then something happens that is completely out of his control and he suddenly can't pay for his half (he was originally paying a third because I make more money) of the vacation. I say fine, I'll pay for it all because I have some more saved up and I really want to take both of us there. But in order to lighten the financial burden on me, we cut it to 3 nights. Now I don't want his sister to come, and I told him so because this was originally meant for us to have alone time, and now we have fewer days. I am also paying for the whole thing so there's no financial burden on him. The thing is, he already told his sister about it, and now I feel bad about excluding her. 

I don't know if she's booked time off or not yet. AITA?

EDIT: There seems to be a consensus. While I would love to listen to that one comment that says, ""plans change, sucks for her"", I can't ignore the consensus.

c6kgdo	2019-06-28 13:52:27		AITA for wanting to spend summer work money to go see my LDR boyfriend before we may not be able to see each other for 6+ months?	"Hi all!

So I’m in a long distance relationship; I’m in NY, he’s in IL. Roughly 750 miles. I’ve been really lucky for him to be able to come out here twice! Because I’m finishing high school I haven’t been able to go out there yet, but I’ve been planning to this summer. We are both 18, I am going to be a college freshman in the fall and he is going to be a sophomore. I’m flying as cheap as possible, I’ve found a ticket that’s about $150 round trip for the dates I want.

Now, the problem is when my parents get in the picture. I asked how they felt about it and they seem to think it is a complete waste of money. They want me to spend every dollar I earn this summer towards college, which is understandable, but I worked my ass off in high school so my tuition is completely paid for. I already paid for my laptop as well, and they promised to cover room and board. (Which I really appreciate.) I also earned another scholarship recently. So in short, I’m in a MUCH better place than most other people and I’m grateful for that. Any money I make this summer goes towards books and supplies, which I plan to buy used.

In their minds, spending this money is a waste and I am putting college on the line (?) for this trip. They said if I go, they think the trip will cost ~$400 dollars, so the first $400 I ask them for towards college they won’t give me. They want me to work more hours (although I much prefer part time, because summer is still summer, I want some free time and a break before I go to college in the fall). I can make a healthy chunk of money before I would leave to go to IL. I also plan to work on campus in the fall to help cover some costs of activities in college.

Am I being an asshole for telling them I want to have some fun this summer and not live to work and go to college? I want to have this experience, and fly out to see my boyfriend before we may not be able to see each other for 6+ months. I also get to meet his friends and family and get to experience flying by myself and learning to budget a trip. The only other thing I plan on doing this summer is working.

My parents are pretty heated about this, as am I. I don’t understand how they don’t see this as a positive experience, even if it costs money? I feel as though I will be okay with finances especially if I minimize other costs too. Am I choosing my boyfriend over my family?

TL;DR - My parents don’t want me to fly out to IL from NY (~$400 trip, total) because they think I’m putting my boyfriend before college, and think I should only work this whole summer. I want to live my life a little because I have the school year to work super hard and the rest of my life to work full time. They will refuse to give me money for the first $400 I need towards various supplies in college if I go on this trip. AITA?"	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6kg3a	2019-06-28 13:51:43		AITA for not appreciating the birthday gift from my wife	"So I turned 30 this year. I don't really ever have birthday parties or anything, and this year wasn't any different. My wife and I planned a short camping trip for the weekend and we went to dinner with friends. That's perfectly fine with me 

The night of my birthday she gave me a great card and a gift bag. When I opened the gift bag I found 2 camping cups and a tumbler. Now before I continue, I need to clarify a few things. I adamantly avoid the Wal-Mart brand. I have personal and political reasons to avoid shopping there and I don't like my money being spent there. If there is any alternative to Wal-Mart, I'm taking it. Another thing to note is that my wife and I have done pretty well in our careers so shopping at Wal-Mart to get the lowest prices isn't necessary. My wife doesn't completely agree with my Wal-Mart aversion, and about a week before the camping trip we had a small argument about buying some of the things we need there. 


So I immediately recognize the cups she purchased as the knock-off Yeti's they sell at Wal Mart. Now I don't give a shit about the fact that the cups are knockoffs, I've never been a fan of the Yeti brand because I think their products are comparatively overpriced. I'm just kind of annoyed that my wife bought my 30th birthday gift from Wal Mart after we just had an argument about the fact that I don't want to support their business practices. I thanked her for the gift and didn't say anything negative about it, but I did ask if these were the cups they sell at Wal Mart. My wife got a little defensive and rolled her eyes at me. I reassured her that I appreciate the gift and that was pretty much the end of it. 


This morning I was thinking about it on the way I to work and honestly I'm pretty annoyed. She bought my gift from an establishment she knows I avoid less than a week after we had an argument about purchasing from that very establishment. It just feels like she didnt care about anything that came out of our previous discussion. It just feels like a cop out that she bought my gift from Wal Mart in the first place. She was literally just in an REI the day before. Am I the asshole for not appreciating my birthday gift?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6kfim	2019-06-28 13:50:24	ThePagnumLord	AITA for telling my ex-girlfriend's new SO about her unfaithfulness?	"So I'm a 17 year old male. I was talking to a girl(also 17) for just over 4 months. On several occasions we kissed, held hands, etc. and she referred to us as being in a relationship. She is bisexual. I am straight. I knew she was bisexual this whole time we were talking but I was always suspicious of her relationship with her ""best friend"". About 2 weeks ago now I looked up the twitter of my 'girlfriend' and in her bio was the initials of her best friend with a heart and almost every tweet was about her kissing her best friend and calling her her girlfriend. We talked about it and she made it out as if I was the bad guy. After cutting off all communication with her (except twitter because I never told her how I found out)I decided to tell her girlfriend/best friend about her unfaithfulness. I did this by sending her pictures of me and her holding hands, convos of us saying I love you, and other incriminating evidence. Am I the asshole for telling her girlfriend about how she was basically cheating? She has not seen the twitter thread yet, I'm currently awaiting a response.

EDIT: I feel bad because I was forceful with providing evidence and did it kind of assholey. I bought her two cheap rings that she asked for once and I thought she would let me have me one but she never gave me it back. I found out from a tweet that she gave it to her girlfriend. One of the many photos I sent was a confirmation of my order of those rings.

c6kd9u	2019-06-28 13:44:23	LurkerWantsToPost	AITA for yelling and cussing at my neighbor?	"I have four cats who are basically toilet trained to use the sand in our garden. Like all cats, my cats like to roam around the neighborhood and visit the other homes in the vicinity. Furthermore my neighborhood has a lot of cats and these cats tend to roam around as well, sometimes even dropping in to my house. 

The problem is my immediate neighbor is not very animal friendly and some of the neighborhood cats have been in the habit of leaving their feces in his garden. My neighbor assumed it was my cats and had been in the habit of arguing with my mother. 

I was away for college and a couple of weeks after I returned home for summer, one of my cats went visiting to my neighbors place. There he got into a fight with another cat and I called my neighbor and asked whether I could come rescue him. My neighbor said no and then proceeded to rant about the cat visiting his house and soiling his garden. I kept trying to explain to him how they're cats and it's in their nature and it wasn't our cats who were using his garden. The neighbor would not listen and continued ranting eventually telling me that he would beat up the cats the next time they came over and refusing to let me come rescue my cat. At this I basically lost my cool and started yelling and cursing at him. I completely lost it because he wanted to beat up an innocent animal, I realize I should have been more diplomatic but when he said he would beat them up, I saw red. AITA?

Edit - Okay I think I need to add more context. I live in a less developed country. Animal cruelty is very high and these cats were all abandoned cats I found on the road as kittens. One of them had been hit down by a car. There are no animal homes? Or whatever they're called. So it's either you keep the cats or you let them die on the road. There are no indoor cats and outdoor cats per se, most of the cats here are outdoor cats unless you buy a cat from foreign country and ship him here. Furthermore my cats are spayed, neutered and vaccinated. Unless I keep the cats locked up 24/7 there is no way to stop them from roaming around. My only other option would be to euthanize them."

So, this is basically exactly what the title says. I [19M] moved out of my parents house on incredibly bad terms about a year ago (the why is irrelevant but going back to theirs isn't an option for me). A friend of mine [22M] really saved my arse by letting me move into his place. His parents are loaded and set him up with his own house and stuff when he turned 18, and they agreed to let me move in for super cheap rent and stuff. He's honestly been a massive blessing for me and I just wanna make it clear that I'm very grateful for his generosity. 

Now, since I'm now entirely financially independent I'm juggling uni and a full time job (though classes are currently done for the summer). On top of that, I have a super shitty immune system and get sick a *lot*. Never anything serious, just stuff like colds and stomach bugs but we all know how draining stuff like that can be. I also have issues with insomnia, which seemingly for me comes and goes in cycles. All this to say, I'm fucking exhausted a lot of the time. I nap a lot. If my naps are planned, I'll take them in my bed but more often I'll just be hanging out in the living room and fall asleep on the sofa. My friend has never minded: he spends 90% of his time in his room anyway as he builds computers and spends most of his time tinkering away with that. He actually would often cover me up with a blanket if it was cold or crack a window for me if it was warm and he'd wake me if I slept too long. 

Recently, however, he got a new girlfriend, [27F] and she's begun complaining about me sleeping on the couch when she's over. She says it's rude, selfish and lazy of me to ""comandeer"" the entire living room just so I can nap and that she dreads to think what other people would think. Note she said this to my friend, not to me. He's asked me to try not to sleep on the couch any more and I am trying (drinking more coffee, turning up the TV volume etc), however sometimes it just sort of happens and she gets annoyed, meaning my mate gets an earful. I feel bad. I've told her she can just wake me up but she doesn't. I'm making an effort to avoid sleeping on the sofa but I can't always help it. AITA?

c6k9p1	2019-06-28 13:35:07	mrs_badteacher	AITA for being mad my colleagues didn't tell me about a death?	"I had been working as a teacher at this particular high school for 7 years (permanently appointed). For all sorts of reasons (not least of which was a toxic executive staff), I took a temporary leave of absence for 12 months and left the area for other work, but always with the intention of returning. This high school is a hotspot for issues with mental health and has (sadly) experienced a number of student suicides in the last 5 years. Some of which have personally affected me, i.e. students in my class.

While not currently working at the school, I still have access to their internal communication system and have been keeping tabs on general information and changes. Again, my husband and I have always intended to return to the area after this break, so keeping up with possible changes in the school seems prudent. I still try to keep in contact with my colleagues, and we visit during breaks as my husband still has family in the area.

I found out today that one of the students died a week ago. I had seen an announcement last week about counselors being available for staff and students but assumed that if it was something particularly serious, or something that might have affected me, one of my colleagues would have contacted me. As it turns out, it was a student I had taught for 2 years previously (and would have taught for a 3rd year if I had remained). I found this out from reading the minutes from the welfare meeting, and then some minor Facebook sleuthing (fairly uncommon last name for the school/area was mentioned).

At this point, being 11 hours away, I am unable to make arrangements to attend the funeral without negatively affecting my current work. A weeks notice would have made it much less of an issue. I am also finding myself angry and frustrated at my colleagues for not making the effort to reach out. They haven't taught this student in recently, and it has been less than 6 months since I left. If I hadn't found this out know, the next feasible time for me to be informed would be in another 6 months when I return to the school. I understand that this is shocking news for all the staff, and its not like I expected the principal to email/call me directly, but there are 7 other staff members in my faculty that have worked with me for the past few years.

I know that part of why I am angry at the moment is the grief talking. He was a good kid and it's not fair that he's gone, but AITA for being angry/frustrated that no one reached out to me about this at all?

EDIT: I want to say thank you for the feedback. I understand that I come across as selfish in this scenario and I appreciate the points you have made. I would like to make clear that I did not say any of this to my colleagues. I called to get the needed details to organise flowers and a card for the family, and realised that I had made a few assumptions about the everything, which I should not have done. I am upset that I do not have the chance to grieve my student with the people that knew him, but that is my own issue to deal with."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6k9ib	2019-06-28 13:34:35	ATPGamer101	AITA for including my associate in a conversation with my CEO?	"(Just saying, I work at a startup company and I’m sorry if my writing or story telling sucks)

Yesterday at work I was having a nice normal day at the office. I thought everything was going smoothly but then our operation department informed me about something our VP wasn’t doing. What they told was pretty much, the VP pushed a shit load of work on them and kept saying to everyone in all the offices “we need all hands on deck, we need everyone to be working at 100%.”  Then after he gives them a lot of work he goes into our office (me, him, the owner/ceo, and another guy with the same position as me (1 position below the VP)) and just puts his feet up and starts watching golf or women’s soccer. (honestly forgot which one bc he’s been doing it all week.)

Either way he and our ceo leaves for lunch and I’m sitting there with my co-worker josh (not actually his name).  I tell Josh about the VP and he’s also pissed bc we’re doing all this work and he’s doing nothing.  Then he says some things I didn’t think of how essentially, the VP makes money off deals we bring in but we don’t make any off the deals he makes and how he’s pissed that he’s not putting the time in like the rest of us yet he makes money from all of us.  This wasn’t my main concern but it also bothered me bc he had a point.

After they come back from lunch, we work for an hour or so and then the VP leaves for the day.  He came in at 10 and left at 4.  Our CEO comes in at 8:30 and leaves typically around 6/8.  I personally come in at 7:30 till after my CEO  leaves.  I do this to make sure all the outstanding tasks for the day are complete and he doesn’t have to worry as much.  Josh comes in 9:30-5 which is fine because he’s productive. 

After the VP leaves I talk to my CEO how josh and I are pissed about what’s going on with him.  How he’s slacking and so on. (We can be transparent with him bc he’s asked us to do it before.)  After I bring up the points josh and I both spoke about my ceo leaves to talk to the operations department. 

 Then josh turns to me and goes “Don’t talk for me again.  I don’t think it’s needed and I can speak for myself.  Just don’t include me when you say we.”  Taken a back bc I thought we were on the same page, I apologized but had a sour taste in my mouth.  He said this in a very aggressive and annoyed voice but I wasn’t sure if I was in the wrong or not.  

After the ceo comes back and I begin saying everything as “I think”, “I disagree” instead of “we”.  After my CEO thanks me for my comments and then left early and so did Josh.

So jake has a job but no car and lives near me, well 20 mins from me and he works about forty minutes from his place. He asks me for rides all the time and used to give me gas money. I also have to drive my mom to work and back every day which is a 2 hr round trip. I gotta up at 430am to.bring her and pick her up at 2 and.be to work myself at 4. So jake asks me the other day if I can bring him to work the next day at 12, it is about an hr trip out of my way to pick him up and bring him to work. I say okay but he has.to be ready as soon as I get there. Well I show up the next day at 11 on the nose ajd wait. Give a quick honk and nothing. I go and knock on the door and nothing..wait another minute and say Fuck it just as he comes out in a towel. I go "" yo you are supposed to be ready"" he looks at me and says ""for what?""

We were planning a trip to Asia, and were discussing the street food they had. One of our friends made a joke on how you could eat dog meat in Asia. Jack took offense and called it animal abuse and that anyone who would eat a dog is a criminal. I told Jack how hypocritical that was as our Indian friend doesn't eat beef, yet Jack tries to feed him beef. I also told him that different parts of the world operate differently, while most places wouldn't dream of eating dog, there are places that don't differentiate a dog from a cow. Jack threw a fit and called me a barbarian and said he was disgusted I would equate a cow to a dog. Jack looked towards other people for support, but everyone else either stayed neutral or defended me. Jack said he was disgusted by our behavior and walked out the restaurant. We were all shocked by his behavior. Later that day I got a text from him saying that he expects an apology. I really don't know what I did wrong. So AITA? Did I really do something wrong?

Recently, my friend has been commanding the assembly as he has a rather loud voice. Just yesterday, he asked me to substitute his role for a day since his throat was very hoarse. I rejected. Commanding isn't really my job anyways. (I do have a loud voice). So he told me that I was an asshole for not covering his role just because I am ""shy"" (for that matters, I'm not shy. I'll be performing in a local concert soon, and a crap ton people come there).

"My SO’s brother and sister-in-law asks me about their kids sometimes and I just give simple replies, such as; “they’re boys, they’ll grow” or “maybe teach them not to”. But i’ve been feeling lately that his nephews (6&3) are rude and spoiled. His bro and SIL aren’t the “discipline your child” type but I feel like I’m in no place to “tell” them about their kids besides the simple “advice” I mentioned above. I’ll give you a few events that’ might help you understand why I feel this way. 

1. The kids go through peoples bags regardless of whose it is. I have told them to not go through my bag and tell them “it isn’t nice”, they’ll listen...for that moment.

2. They expect gifts when it’s someone’s birthday, though the older one doesn’t so much anymore. When it was my daughter’s birthday, I was told to bring “something” for them. I smiled and said “I have party favors.” When it came to opening my daughter’s presents, which I allowed them to open for her because she’s only 1, the youngest demanded to Play with the toys but I took it from him and put it away. I told him it wasnt his to open, he cried, I didn’t care. To top it off, he wanted to take my daughter’s smash cake for himself. He cried but I stood my ground and refused to give it to him while his AUNT, my SO’s sister, was holding him back. His parents were physically there but idk where their minds were. 

3. I understand they’re siblings and siblings fight but they FIGHT ALL THE TIME. 

4. I baby sat the younger nephew with my daughter, once. He didn’t want to play with her. As she was crawling around, she crawled to “his area”, he blocked the doorway so she wouldn’t be able to get in. I tell him it’s fine that she’s crawling around, she isn’t touching his things but he continues to block it. She’s trying to get through to leave, he’s pushing her, then grabs her collar and pulls it up, choking her. I rushed over and spanked him to let go, he brushes it off and goes play.

There’s so much more. I don’t hide my feelings from my SO about his bro and SIL’s behavior towards their sons but when it comes to his family, I can’t tell them because it isn’t my place. I’m very fed up with the kids’ behavior especially because they’re my daughter’s “brothers” (first cousins are considered brothers in their culture), I don’t want her to think their behavior is acceptable. I do my share of scolding them, which I’ve done before and feel like crap about, but how can anyones’ teachings get through when the parents are enabling their bad attitudes? His bro is a very proud person and his SIL is very kind and patient but I’ve seen her defend her sons and I understand, those are your babies. 

I know of my SO and his siblings tough upbringing and i understand why it’s difficult for the bro to discipline his kids but discipline doesn’t mean beat the fck out of them! So back to my question, WIBTA if I spoke the entire truth or should I hold my tongue?

Keep in mind that I’m not blood related, just by marriage.

Added details in comment.

Edit: okay, WNBTA but would need to use less offensive terms and approach this situation delicately when asked next time. Thanks. 👌👍 but I would probably first have my SO approach his Bro and SIL about their behavior when my baby is around."	No A-holes here	0	0	752.0	86.0	0.0	0.0

Basically my water broke too early. Bff wanted to come right away but the surgery schedule was up in the air at first and she lives  two hours away, so she waited to come til we were sure. No big rush because my mom flew down and my husband is with me, but I was counting on my bff for emotional support. I love my husband but he’s not great with that sort of thing and while my mom can give a mom’s comfort our personalities just can’t spend a lot of time together. I needed my bestie. After fighting with the insurance for over a week, I finally got the pre-op scheduled for this Tues and surgery scheduled for Wednesday. Bff said she’d come Tues and stay til Thur.
Monday while reconfirming she said she was waiting on sons coach to confirm game reschedule because of rain and so wasn’t sure when she’d come. Tues morning she tells me oh well he’s scheduled the games for every evening this week and her husband didn’t want to miss work to take him so... *shrug*

I’m like wait wait wait. Are you seriously abandoning for a goddamn fucking LITTLE LEAGUE GAME!?! It’s not the playoffs or whatever, just a regular season makeup game. She tries to turn it into I’m asking her to choose between her son or me. (I hear her husband’s voice in that, he is constantly belittling her). I’m like don’t fucking twist this into some “noble mother” bullshit. The surgery was at 7am. She could have gone to Tuesday’s game, drove down, stayed over, and driven back in plenty of time to go to Wednesday’s game. Yes I would and have done similar for her.

For all my life I've gone with the flow and said yes to everything my friends wanted to do no matter what it is. Lately I reflected on this and really thought about how I end up doing some things I don't really care for because I can't bring myself to say no to anyone. 

Well the other day I finished up my classes and had free time for the rest of the night, so I just chilled in my room with my roommate and watched TV. A bunch of my friends came in saying they were going out to a steakhouse and wanted me to come, but I wasn't feeling like going out that much, and I also felt like this would be the perfect time to test what saying no to them was like-the point that makes me feel guilty. They begged more and more for me to come and then blew up and got angry saying that I had to come, before eventually storming off mad at me.

c6jxas	2019-06-28 13:01:48	letsgoskinnydipping1	AITA for telling my Mom and StepDad they’re not welcome around my family anymore?	"This all starts about a year ago when my wife and I had our first baby. To give a good back ground my wife had a C-Section at 35 weeks due to severe preeclampsia, daughter was in the NICU for 10 days for monitoring, and to top it off my wife had a post partum hemorrhage where she was anemic for a short time after... 

After a couple months or so of adjusting to life with a newborn and trying to get my wife back on her feet after dealing with all this, my Mom decided she wanted to meet up and talk with me. She’s always had a way of manipulating me and having grown accustomed to it, I buy into it. She basically sat me down and said my wife is trying to keep her from seeing her granddaughter and that my wife doesn’t want her to be involved in our daughters life. 

I shared this with my wife and she instantly became pissed, 1.) because that’s not the case and 2.) because my wife has always gone out of her way to include my mother when she doesn’t have to. Wife even included my mother to be there at the hospital during the entire duration we were in the hospital and NICU.

Fast forward to now, almost a year later and having gone through numerous counseling sessions with a therapist I’m understanding that my Mom is spreading lies about us to extended family when we aren’t around, gaslighting us when we are around her and no one else is there, and then acting all normal when it’s a group of us together.

It’s damaging our marriage and we don’t want our daughter to be groomed by her once she starts to understand language and talk. We fear she’ll try to get our daughter to align with her thoughts and manipulate her as well.

Obviously I love my parents but the relief of stress that would come from cutting them out seems almost necessary at this point. AITA?



EDIT 1:  INFO ON STEP DAD

The most recent thing that has happened was me texting my step dad for relatives phone numbers and addresses who we haven’t seen in probably a year. We were trying to get invitations ready for our daughters first birthday coming up. He sent a text to me (meant for my mom I’m guessing) that read, “This was from ..... that’s going to be a bit awkward isn’t it?”

I called him out on it and that’s when he basically told me that these relatives have been feeling offended we haven’t been around, and that they’re worried they offended us somehow. After that my wife and I did the mature thing and contacted these relatives to see if that’s true.

Low and behold they were confused. Had never mentioned anything of the sort to anyone, made any comments, and even went as far as saying they completely understand why we haven’t been around since we are adjusting parenthood, new jobs, life in general, etc. they were incredibly nice and understanding.

That’s why I think he’s part of it, or at least being used my mom so she doesn’t have to do all the dirty work

c6jwr2	2019-06-28 13:00:15	thisisnotafakeplant	AITA for not wanting to go to my mom’s friends’ barbecue?	"On mobile, sorry for formatting.

Yesterday morning when I woke up my mom tells me we’re going to a barbecue. She doesn’t ask, she just says we are. This weekend. I, being an autistic homebody, don’t want to go. There will be kids, people I don’t know, and this is all being sprung on me at the last minute. The discussion ends. I haven’t said anything at this point.

Fast forward a couple hours and my dad gets home. We start talking about this barbecue again. I make it very clear that I don’t want to go. The conversation lulls once more and after awhile I ask if I could have a friend over next week. My mom says no because “why should I do a nice thing for you when you aren’t doing this nice thing for me?”

I point out that she’s being unreasonable, to which she responds with hostility. Eventually I ask my dad to go talk to her because she’s being *vague hand gestures*. This enrages her. She starts yelling at me while my dad is trying to get her to calm down, and then she starts giving my dad shit for not “having her back”.

My mom starts getting even more angry, and I comment on how she’s acting like an asshole. She tells me that I’m being the asshole. I ask the rest of my family if they think I’m being an asshole. She then says that everyone thinks I’m an asshole and is too nice to say it. I start crying. I tell her she’s being ridiculous. She is angry over a barbecue. She says it’s not about the barbecue, but refuses to elaborate.

She walks into the kitchen. I ask my dad to take me somewhere else and she refuses. As she’s coming out of the kitchen something I say makes her mad and she says “you know what [name]!? I’m giving up on you. You complain that I’m never around and then blow me off when I try to spend time with you. So fuck you [name]!”

Obviously in response to that I cry and cuss her out. My sister runs to her room crying and my dad points out that we’re both being fucking ridiculous, to which I agree. My mom goes outside for a cigarette and I start texting a friend for emotional support.

My mom comes back in and tells me to hand over my phone, which I’m using to contact this friend. I tell her that I’m just trying to talk to someone, and my dad agrees. He tells her that I’m just looking for emotional support and that she shouldn’t take away that stuff because she’s angry. She responds to this with “he doesn’t need his little friends feeding into whatever’s going on in his head.” She sits down again resuming her previous cold and dismissive demeanour. I start telling her I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve such a strong reaction, and she laughs.

Being laughed at is a big trigger for me, it brings up some of my worst memories. I tell her this, and her response? Laugh harder.

Tl;dr: my mom says we’re going to a barbecue, I say I don’t want to, get called names. AITA?

Also: I said that her calling me an asshole and telling me everyone else thought so too was effectively a form of emotional abuse, and she threatened to call the cops to “take me away.”"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	6.0	7.0	0.0	0.0
c6jwfk	2019-06-28 12:59:21	sexybananafucker	AITA for not tipping my weed dealer?	"Obligatory “I’m on mobile, formatting issues, etc.”

I live in the US in a state where weed is not yet legal and I smoke weed a handful of times per month. Because I smoke so infrequently, the time between weed buys for me is quite long. I recently moved about an hour away from where I was before, so the guy I had been buying weed from was no longer an option anymore.

Anyway, yesterday my boyfriend and I decided we wanted to smoke but realized we were out of weed. I text a coworker who smokes and ask if they know anyone who would be willing to sell us a few grams, and my boyfriend does the same. After a few hours his coworker gets back to him and says she could sell us some weed and we thanked her. 

Here’s where it gets a little tricky.

We offered to go to his coworker’s place to pick up the weed since at this point it was late (around 10:00pm). She said she could come to us, which was super nice of her, so we agreed we’d do that. My boyfriend mentions we should give her a tip, since she was coming to us and saving us the trouble of coming to her. I said we’re already paying her for the weed, and she wouldn’t sell it if she wasn’t making a profit. Plus, we offered to go to her to pick up the weed first so if it was really that inconvenient for her to come to us she wouldn’t have offered. 

He countered that we should still tip her since it’s not like she’s ripping us off or anything by overcharging us (the price was fair based on my experience buying weed from my previous guy), but still I argued that a tip wasn’t necessary because she must be making a profit. I explained that she must buy the weed at some kind of “wholesale” price that’s cheaper than the sale price, otherwise she probably wouldn’t be selling drugs. 

Although we never ended up agreeing, I said that if my bf wanted to tip her so bad he should, but I wouldn’t contribute. 

Like half an hour later she rolls up and she’s in the passenger side and her boyfriend sells us the weed. My boyfriend hands him like $5 and says thanks for coming to us, we appreciate it.

I still feel like I was right, but I also kind of felt like an asshole in the moment. So, AITA?

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I bought weed from someone. We offered to come to them to pick it up, but then they offered to bring the weed to us which my boyfriend thought deserved a tip. I disagreed. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	31.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6jv0d	2019-06-28 12:55:28	throwawyforaita	AITA for asking my manager to stop letting my coworker bring his son to work?	"I work in an open plan office, I'm in a small department on a big floor. I have a coworker and he's a very nice guy and I have no issue with him but every few weeks he brings his 4 year old to into the office for a few hours at the start or the end of the day (with the manager's permission). I asked him once and didn't catch the full story but it has something to do with his wife's work schedule not matching up with childcare drop off/pick up on those days. 

&#x200B;

The son is okay, not the best behaved kid i've met but not the worst, his voice is a bit loud. If it was just him, it might be fine. But my problem is that when the son is in the office, people love to play with him, even the people who don't work in my department will walk across the floor to play with him. And they make a lot of noise. They're constantly laughing, talking loudly in that 'baby voice', chasing him around. 

&#x200B;

I had a conversation with my manager today that went like this:

me: hey, \[coworker's\] son was here again today and it was kind of loud when i was trying to make a phone call.

him: really? I didn't find him that noisy. (For context, my manager has 3 kids.)

me: well, it was hard to make a phone call because of the noise, maybe because lots of people were playing with him.  doesn't it bother you that people in this department waste time playing with the kid when they should be working?

him: not really, I don't care what people do during the day as long as their work is done. (This is not true by the way. He's previously told people off to slacking off, being loud when other people are on the phone, etc)

me: okay, fine. Can't you suggest to him to sit in a telecon room when the kid is here or something? (we have telecon rooms you can book by the hour)

him: look, I just don't think this bothers anyone except for you. We are a family friendly workplace and I'm trying to make life easier for him as a working parent. When you have kids, you can also bring them in whenver you want.

&#x200B;

Look, he's right about how it doesn't bother anyone except for me because everyone else likes to play with the kid, the cynical part of me says it's because they would rather play wiht the kid than do their work. I just want to get my work done and go home. and i still think it's a double standard that I would get told off if I decided to come in an hour late without excuse, but you can play with a kid for an hour and everyone thinks that's really cute.

c6ju3x	2019-06-28 12:52:41	hopeless_hearts	AITA for telling my sister that I hate her because she wears my bras!?	"Let me first state that I am 17f and have to share a room with my sister 15f. We have never got on very well especially in these past few years. I have moderate OCD and to be honest I do blame her for me having it (at least as bad as it is now). I have a job which is my only source of income and she gets £10 pocket money from my parents every week. 

Because of my OCD I struggle to know what is 'normal' to expect from her and what boundaries there should be in terms of keeping the room clean. I also struggle with people touching my stuff because if they do then it's not in the right place and it can send me over the edge especially with clothes. 

Now the main problem is my sister stealing my clothes. She began by taking my socks (that I have to buy because I'm over 16 and my parents refuse to buy anything for me except meals I eat at home now) and wearing them almost everyday even though she has her own that my parents buy for her. This has since progressed to tshirts, jumpers, jackets and shorts that she will wear then leave at the end of her bed or put them back where they came from. This disgusts me and I have stopped wearing some of my clothes because she has left them dirty for so long that I can't bear to wear them. 

But worst of all she's started wearing my bras. It's unimaginable to me to wear someone else's bra. She has plenty of her own that my mum has bought for her and has already stolen my old ones that I no longer fit into. It's insane and I feel like my privacy doesn't exist anymore, I can't even own underwear without her wearing it and it's breaking me.

The only clothes of her own she regularly wears are her jeans simply because she can't fit into mine. She has enough money to buy her own clothes and I know this because I would buy all my own clothes on even less pocket money a week before I turned 16. 

She also uses my skincare products and makeup so much that I've started having to buy them again twice as often because I lose half the bottle to her. 

I've told her not to wear my clothes almost everyday but she doesn't give a shit. I've gone to the extent of hiding my clothes and makeup but she always finds them. 

I'm losing it with this girl and all she is to me is a fucking pain now. She is the reason I want to move out and I'll say it to her face. She disgusts me and my parents keep criticising me saying to leave her alone because it's ""just how sisters are"" but surely she's gone too far. I feel like I'm being driven insane.

TLDR: my sister wears all of my clothes and even bras almost everyday even though she can afford to buy her own. She refuses to stop no matter what I try and my parents are useless at controlling her. I'm losing my mind because of it."	Not the A-hole	0	0	114.0	9.0	0.0	0.0
c6jspi	2019-06-28 12:48:40	ricardillod	AITA if I wasn’t into another woman until my wife got jealous	"My wife(25) and I(28) have been married for two months. Just recently we celebrated one year of dating each other. The backstory: we met around five years ago. Always as friends but one thing led to another and we obviously had deep feelings for one another. 

After falling apart and blocking each in respect to our relationships back then, I broke up with my last GF and called up one of the best friends I’ve ever had. She is “the one that got away” for me. As I was for her. 

So needless to say I love her to death, but our marriage and therefore our relationship has become a constant state of fighting and making up. Almost daily. The peak of this being a girl at my new job. 

I got fired right after our honeymoon. Was lucky enough to get hired by a friend in his animation company. I’ve known about this girl for a couple of years but never really shared with her. Just so happens she lives in the same neighborhood and we struck up a deal that I’d give her a ride to and from work since her BF is away from town filming. I’ll admit I realized she found me charming and flirtatious, but quite frankly she’s known for being moody and not nearly as gorgeous or interesting as my wife. 

I knew I had to tell my wife, and I did nervously, since she’s been with so many shitty men. She asked for a picture of this girl And the immediate response was “oh, I didn’t know she was so hot!!”

Long story short this led to a whole slew of arguments and giving this girl at work a ride became an escape from the morning arguments. I love my wife but I can’t help but feel me feeling attracted to this other girl only happened because she flipped the fuck out. 

Since then I’ve admitted that I did feel attracted to her, but she’s not nearly as hot nor interesting as my wife is. It’s been a month and I’m over it. The “love” hormone ran out, which I knew would happen. And I’m calmly working on my marriage. But AITA for starting to like this girl after my wife got jealous. Or am I bullshitting myself and liked her all along?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	62.0	14.0	0.0	0.0
c6js2h	2019-06-28 12:46:56	Hammstercoffee	AITA for not wanting my sister back in my life	"So this story might be a bit long, and for that...I'm really sorry, I feel it needs a lot of context for the question..

To start out, I've recently let my mom back into my life at the begging and persuasion of my dad, who loves her and has been trying for 20 years to make their relationship work. My dad isnt my real father but stepped into the role when I was only 2 years old.
I cant remember my childhood up until maybe I was 12 years old or so because my mom was physically, mentally and verbally abusive to me. I'm talking sorts where she would hit me, scream at me right as she got home from work, and throw me across the room, verbal insults and blaming me for things I as a small child had no control over and even made me feel absolutely horrible for basic needs like food, clothing that fit and medicine when I got sick. I still feel like I cant ask for anything and that I'm just a burden. The physical abuse stopped around the time I was 12.

 My sister was also abusive to me. Stealing my things, hitting me, bossing me around, constantly berating me for calling the man who raised me ""dad"" since ""he isnt your biological father"" for years, sending me death threats online and even trying to strangle me when our parents werent home during one summer. If I attempted to fight back it only got worse. My mom would always take her side it felt like, and my dad would try to help me, but with things like that, it wasnt long until my dad was kicked out of the house since it was under my moms name I believe. 

At 17 I moved in with my dad and was able to get away from my sister, but my mom. She practically gave my sister her house and also moved in with my dad. Their fighting continued because he now lived on the same street as the rest of his family and she has some problem with that. And whenever they faught, she'd take it out on me verbally whenever it was just me and her. Eventually she moved back in with my sister because of the fighting between her and my dad.
I'm turning 22 soon and shes just moved back in and time and again my mom has blamed me for my sister not being able to move in too because I wont forgive what shes done,(Its not. It's because she has disrespected not only my mom but my dad and smokes pot, which is illegal in my state and can get my dad fired from his job!) My sister however, has never once apologized for a single thing shes done to me. My dad has stopped asking me to forgive my sister after the week or two she stayed with us after getting her wisdom teeth removed and pretty much treated me like a maid, but he still wants me to try with my mom, but I'm struggling with it...

TL:DR my abusive mom wants to have ""a good relationship"" with me when shes only ever tried when it comes to being with my dad, and even wants me to forgive my abusive sister too, does me not wanting that make me an asshole of a daughter?

c6jpxk	2019-06-28 12:40:39	throwaway13921213194	AITA for not wanting be around my sister-in-law because she's dating a married man?	My sister-in-law recently started dating a married man, she's not shy about the situation and neither is he. His wife doesn't know about it yet but by the way they're acting I don't think it'll take too long for her to find out. This has caused a lot of issues in the family as my father-in-law and mother-in-law both refuse to speak to her. Meanwhile, my husband and his older sister are certain that this is just a lapse of judgment on their younger sister's part and that soon enough she'll break up with her boyfriend. Because of that, my husband wants us to assure her that she can come to us if she has any problems because he doesn't want to push her away. Except I don't want to do that, I find it repulsive and absurd what she and her boyfriend are doing is terrible. The man has kids and a wife that have no idea of what's going on behind their backs and he's just proudly walking around with my sister-in-law like he doesn't care if they find out. While my sister-in-law goes around proudly stating that she's dating a married man and can't wait for him to get a divorce so they can get married. My husband keeps trying to convince me that she's probably going through something and while she has always been a very responsible person I don't want to stick around to watch this unfold regardless of the outcome. I truly despise what she and her boyfriend are doing because even if they don't stay together they still chose to be in this relationship at some point. I also hate how my husband and his older sister keep making it seem like their sister is in this unwillingly.	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6jok1	2019-06-28 12:36:45	dapperDave0	AITA for letting my dog scare bikers in the sidewalk	"Context: I bike on the street (Chicago, but not downtown so roads aren’t crazy) nearly every day to commute, and in my neighborhood almost every corner has a sign saying no bikes on the sidewalk. It pisses me off that some bikers feel entitled to speed down the sidewalks and expect everyone to move out of their way, especially since my dog hates bikes. On the street they are far enough I can keep him calm but on the sidewalk he goes nuts.

So what I do is not get out of the way and let my dog have enough leash on the sidewalk to get within a few inches of bikers and bark his ass off, and when they get mad at me I (im)politely remind them that they are breaking the law. If the main roads scare you then take the extra 5 minutes and take side streets. 

Obviously I don’t do this to kids/families, or people who should be on the sidewalk like rollerblades.

Edit: some things to clarify since I’m getting accused of putting my dog in danger. These are city sidewalks so speeds are around 10 mph. I also don’t give him 20 feet of line more like 3-4, and never enough to actually make contact with anyone unless they turn towards me. 

In terms of training him to bark at bikes, he used to bark if he saw one on the other side of the street or across 100 yards of grass. It took me about a year of training to get him to let bikes go but when they come within a few feet of me on the walk he gets upset. 

And I may be the asshole in this situation but I generally am not, so I have tried talking to bikers first and the usual response is “f*** off”.

My dogs safety is actually the reason I hate these bikers. I’ve spent a lot of time trying to train out the bike aggression and I doubt he’ll ever be alright with a biker within 2 feet of him. If they come up quietly from behind me and I can’t pull him to a safe distance to bark from he will react and may get hurt."	Asshole	0	0	83.0	23.0	0.0	0.0

So I was making the rounds in the park and I heard someone grunting, and noticed they had headphones on. I laughed, because I love when people sing along to music, and didn’t think anything of it.

She starts talking about how he was special needs and how her mother works with people who are. I pretty quickly realized my comment was unappreciated but tried to laugh it off as I do, thinking it was just a miscommunication.

c6jmr3	2019-06-28 12:31:34	Hachigoki	AITA for tarnishing the reputation of a friend that owes me a lot of money	"(Throwaway account) 

I'll try to keep this as short as possible, this has been going on for months. Ppl in this story : Me as me, G1 as Girl friend no1, and G2 for girl friend no2

&#x200B;

November 2018, I sold stuff around my house because I knew in January I had huge taxes and bills coming and needed to get money by then. I decided to sell an expensive piece of hardware (value around 1000$ currently) to G1 who desperately needed it, I was glad to help a friend. G1 struggled with money so I agreed to lower the price to 800$ (lowest possible), she agreed. 

&#x200B;

Key events :

* G1 needed the item urgently, i drove close to her and gave her the item but she didnt pay me because ""her card isn't working and couldn't get any cash ».
* Later, G1 says she can’t pay me because she scheduled a tattoo appointment in December and needed to save money for it. I foolishly agreed to let her pay after the tattoo. 
* On my Christmas vacation she asked me to buy 40$ of stuff for her (which she would pay for)
* Each months I remind G1 of the money. She finds an excuse everytime and I would foolishly say ""okay np"" when G1 ""promised to pay me next month"" and of course never did.
* January & the bills came, I resorted to ask my parents, they lend me around 1k $ for the bills and to survive.
* March, still no money. I skip lunches since January b/c i can’t affort it.
* Late March, she posts pics of her new salon nails, expensive makeup, and other things. I snap and scream at her that she has 2 weeks to pay me.
* She freaks out, tell me I’m ""only friends with her for the money"", tries to lie to me that we agreed on 700$, which I reply w/ screenshots of us agreeing on 800, she says I’m ""threatening her and she would go to the police"" because I told her «you have 2 weeks to pay» 
* She tries to give me back the hardware that she used for 4-5 months to avoid paying. I'm not a free rental service and tell her she still owes me $. She gaslights me for hours. Then she magically makes a transfer of 400$ in the minute. 

&#x200B;

To add insult to injury,i never got a ""thank you"" until she got caught, after sending me 400$ she gave me what felt like a fake apology you give went you feel no remorse.

I felt incredibly used and taken for granted at that point.

&#x200B;

In April, she paid the whole 800$ . I tell G2 about what happened with G1 and the money. She doesnt believe me and thinks I’m just exaggerating, and should forgive her. I angrily asks G2 why she's on G1 side and why she doesn't believe me, I tell her «G1 is a liar/manipulator», and that she should be careful because I don't want G2 to be a victim of G1's gaslighting.

&#x200B;

I felt really betrayed that G2's on her side and doesn't believe me, G2 told everything I said to G1. G1 sent me a HUGE message about me being a bitch, «threatening her» and ""trying to get people against her"". G2 and G1 blocked me everywhere and I can assume never want to talk to me again.

c6jlbr	2019-06-28 12:27:18	_XeduR	AITA for not helping out a longstanding client and a friend?	"My main source of income comes from developing mobile games, for my own company, as well as for clients.

&#x200B;

I have a longstanding client for whom I've done several assignments during the past 8 months. The first assignment was to develop the game that he had envisioned. Subsequent assignments were about making changes or adding new features. During these 8 months, we've gotten friendly, we've chatted and we've played games online on our free time.

I, as a fellow indie dev, have encouraged him to keep on pursuing his dreams. I've told him that game development is hard and only a few make it big, but if he truly believes in himself and his game, then he should keep on pursuing his dream.

During these 8 months, he hasn't tried to learn coding or practiced making game art, so he has always paid me or someone else to do them. My billable hours are around 200 hours and I expect that he has paid for around 60-80 hours of services from other people as well.

&#x200B;

Now, his game hasn't been the hit that he had hoped it would be, but he is still passionate about it and sees its potential. Last week, he heard back from a publisher who told him that they might be interested in publishing his game if he were to make several changes to it. He was very excited and asked me about making the changes. I calculated that they'd take me around 50-60 hours to complete. He told me that he had spent his savings on getting this far and that he couldn't afford to pay me anymore, but that he'd be willing to make a deal with me where I would be paid 20% of his revenue share until I would make 5 times what I would have charged for those 50-60 hours.

Having dealt with publishers before, and hearing that he had received ""a maybe"" instead of a signed contract, I was reluctant to agree to the deal he had offered me. This turned nasty quite fast with him asking me if I had only worked on his game to get paid and whether or not I even believed in its commercial viability. He pointed out that when he had had doubts about continuing, my words had convinced him to continue. Now that he had his best shot yet, I wasn't willing to help him out because I wouldn't be paid. He also said, ""aren't we friends too and not just a client and a contractor?"" and I said yes. I consider us to be friends too.

&#x200B;

So, had I not encouraged him, he would not have spent as much money. While I think that his game is cool and has potential, I do not have faith in any ""maybe we'll make a deal"" kind of deals from publishers, nor am I certain that if such a deal would be made, that the deal would generate enough revenue for me to actually make what my client had offered me. So, now that it really came down to it, I didn't have the enough faith in my client's, my friend's game and I wasn't willing to help him out any further because I wouldn't be paid, and without me, he won't have a chance of getting that publishing deal signed."

"I’m still living at home, 21, working now in the summer, taking a few summer classes before going back to college when it starts up again.  I work around 10 hours a day and when I get home I have 4 hours before I need to be in bed to sleep. 
My sister (16) comes down into my room and watches either pewdiepie, someone similar to ricegum, and Korean soap operas. (Legit, subtitled soap operas) for as long as she can. My boyfriend (21) also visits during the summer and they hang out basically because she forces him to, which he doesn’t care because he has sisters and gets it. 

Last night she had been in my room for the first two hours I was home and I had asked her to leave for my last 2 hours before I went to sleep. I was doing an essay on her laptop (mine is busted) which has been sitting in my room this whole summer since she never wanted it back/used it. She looked at me, threw a fit, and wanted to take her laptop. I let her because I can type it on my phone. 
The worst part is my boyfriend “stuck up” for her and was like “why does she have to leave? She cleaned your room and you’re kicking her out?” 
And he does this everyday. I don’t know how to get her to leave now without starting a huge fight between basically everyone. AITA?"	Not enough info	0	0	4.0	5.0	0.0	0.0
c6jg0k	2019-06-28 12:11:33	energeeon	AITA for getting my Math Tutor fired from his job?	"OK, so just some backstory, I study in a country that's extremely competitive about grades, with most students in my school having tutors in private lessons or in group lessons to provide clarification when the teacher cannot. My school is also quite a competitive one, with most finals being quite hard compared to other schools, in order to prepare us more for the actual exam. Naturally, I'm not the best at math, so I decided to ask my tutor questions that I had absolutely no idea on. Note that in my country, most tutors do not work by themselves but rather join a 'company' that specifically teaches the curriculum I am taking. These companies are extremely competitive and brag about their achievements in order to attract more students and take a lot of the revenue while the tutor takes a fraction of it. Tutoring fees here are quite expensive so I expect them to be able to teach me questions I don't know.

&#x200B;

So my tutor (call him A) teaches me math and he's actually somewhat decent in explaining some concepts I didn't underrstand before. To understand the exam questions better, I asked him to do 2 of them and explain it. A didn't really have an idea on how to do it. For the first question, he took an excessive amount of time fixing his mistakes to the point where it took 20 minutes. For the second question, he absolutely had no idea how to do it. He made me watch a 8 minute Youtube Video which didn't help me at all while he looked around in the textbook for the method. My school doesn't choose questions from the textbook. So he wasted around 40 minutes in an hour trying to solve this too and the lesson ended and I had to leave due to another class after. The paper consists of 7 questions in an hour, and he took the entire time trying to solve only 2 of them. 

&#x200B;

So next week, I come back and expect an answer to that question. So he actually does have an answer and explains it to me semi-decent and I ask him another question from another paper that I didn't understand. Again, he takes an excessive amount of time trying to teach this to me and wasted basically another lesson. So I get pretty frustrated and withdraw from this tutoring company. Normally, they asked me why, so I explained how  A was not able to answer certain questions. It wasn't out of revenge or anything, but rather disappointment and the fact I didn't feel that he was what the company was selling and what I was paying for.

&#x200B;

Since I pay for 1 month in advance and I had already paid, the next week I come back there's another teacher who told me that A wasn't going to be teaching me for the last 2 lessons. After I went home, I looked at the company's website and A was removed from their list of 'qualified tutors'.

For example “Can you be more quiet?” “No I don’t want to”.

He insults everyone around him but whenever he is insulted he files a bullying report on that person and cries. He will happily insult people’s disabilities, weight, issues at home. But if you dare throw anything back he acts the victim.

He nonstop exerts his physical size to intimidate and belittle people and lashes out at people for little to no reason.

I absolutely despise this person, and I hit my limit with him after he decided to start insulting the issues I am having with my family at home. So I brought up my phone and make a slew of anti-him memes and posted them on Instagram. Everyone already hates him so they joined in. He is now acting the victim and filing bullying reports on everyone who has taken part.

For context the main theme of the memes was him insulting others and acting like a bitch when insulted back.

Unfortunately as a young adult I developed anorexia nervosa. I'm in recovery now, but I'll be the first to admit that I'm still really sensitive to weight-related comments, even joking. To my family's credit, they've completely stopped with the insulting nicknames. Except for one, my mom still sometimes calls me ""cow"". 


Now to my mom this petname has nothing to do with weight. To her, it's about my eyes; I have really big, dark brown eyes like ""cow's eyes"". However, ""cow"" has pretty obvious weight connotations. I doubt most people would like being compared to a cow. I've spoken with my mom about how hurtful I find this name and she tries not to use it, but it's so natural now for her that she calls me it often without really noticing it. I point it out to her every time she uses it and she's always immediately guilty and apologetic. I feel like maybe I'm being oversensitive and I should just let it go when she calls me ""cow"". I know with all my logical side that the name is harmless, but the part of me that's still really vulnerable about my weight had a visceral hurt reaction to it.

- I work in a high security location so I would have to submit security access forms for her and have her escorted from the front gate to the function area and back because I wasn’t able to meet her. 
- I’m relatively new to the job so my wife hasn’t been to my workplace before or met any of the people I work with and it’s a very large number of employees.
- I would be busy the whole time and not able to introduce her to anyone.
- She has told me in the past she doesn’t like being around large groups of people.
- My wife doesn’t drive so would have to catch public transport to get there.
- We have a newborn.
These were the things that were going through my mind when I was thinking about the logistics of her coming.

So while trying to be honest about my concerns I ended up making the whole thing sound really difficult and unappealing. She really wanted to come and had been excited since I mentioned it but essentially I talked her out of coming without really meaning to.

I got back from the function a few hours ago and my wife posted what happened to a Facebook mum group she is part of. Nearly all of them commented that it was a huge red flag and I mustn’t have wanted her to come because I was hiding something. Now my wife is convinced I’m having an affair with a coworker.

I wanted her to come but I didn’t want her to be uncomfortable. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Months ago we've discovered that my mother suffers from mental issues. She thinks that our neighbour wants to hurt her 

&#x200B;

We realize that we cannot stay at that area anymore since it's what triggers her. On the same day we end up having to pack our things and temporary stay at our grandma's house. And boy was that horrible. My mother still doesn't sleep well. We tried to tell her that we are so far away from home already and nothing will happened but she just doesn't listen. Now every relatives in our house got involved and tried to visit and talk to her.

&#x200B;

I ended up being the one that have to take 24 hour care of her because she would suddenly sleep for 10 minutes and shook up like those zombies and start panic screaming. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward>>

&#x200B;

1. We have to move to my father's childhood home because my mum go cray cray
2. My sister having to quit her first job due to the long distant 
3. Everyone is traumatized, including my grandpa and grandma (those poor things)
4. My father's business isn't that stable before this and now this happens he don't even have time to handle this shit
5. I can't focus on my work too because of this very reason
6. Dad is not financially well so I'm the one that's paying for a lot of shit
7. Spent so much money on seeing psychiatrist
8. Spent so much time on all these bat shit crazy
9. All four of us family members having to sleep in one room because of the rush of moving into an old rundown house

&#x200B;

 And yes we did brought her to a psychologist. He never told us what the heck is wrong with her even after 5 times (around 2 months) of visits. Maybe he had his reasons but idk.

&#x200B;

 Why I hate her

1. She thinks that she is never wrong, she blame everyone else for what's wrong.
2. Her victim playing skills is top notched 
3. Her sorry is worthless, she would open the door and look at me and say sorry like I beat her
4. We made so much effort on making her feel better but she still thinks that she is the victim
5. May I quote that this is what she told my father that broke my heart. She said; ""You're the reason our two daughter suffers, you're the reason I suffer, you're the reason my parents suffer, you're the reason the whole world suffers."" after she said that my father immediately have the deadest face like he can die any moment
6. We are never enough for her, she always ask for more
7. I tried to help her so much only to be fade up again and again

Everyone always picked on him, except me. For years I knew he had some signs of being on the spectrum but my parents refused to do anything about it: I would beg them to take him to one appointment but they never did. 

It wasn’t until his high school got involved and saw these obvious signs that they suggested they run the investigation as long as my brother had an appointment (he finally did). Now at the age of 15 he has finally been diagnosed.

I feel like screaming: my parents cried when they found out but still treat him harshly - shouting at him because he can’t keep eye contact, etc. 

I’ve always been defensive of him - him and I are best friends and I wish I could take him away from my parents. FYI I don’t live in the same city. 

My parents got a dog recently, knowing my brother is petrified of animals (he loves pictures of them or animals far away). This dog is way too exited for my brother, he’s told me he hates that he can’t get a glass of water because the dog is around. 

I often bring up some ways to make my brothers life just a little bit easier but my parents always shout at me and say it’s none of my business. 

I understand that no one wants life lessons on how to raise their kids but they’re not understanding that they can’t continue being mean to him because of things he can’t control. 

AITA for continuously defending my brother? Am I actually stepping out of line?

I haven’t been to school for quite a while now for reasons I don’t want to get into. I have two friends who go to my class. Let’s call them Talia and Rose. I’m sometimes on call with Talia and Rose separately and we talk about shit friends talk about. One day Rose called me and told me she was playing truth or dare with a few people from the class, and that one of the guys(let’s call him Brad) indirectly admitted he liked me(I would add details, but I don’t wanna make this post too long and boring). I ofc became happy because hey, someone kinda likes me, that’s nice. At least I’m desirable to someone. 

(Rose lies a lot and I genuinely don’t know if it’s an addiction or if she gets a kick out of people believing her, or what it is. A few years back she lied about hearing my then crush saying sweet stuff about me which got my hopes up. She never admitted it was a lie, only years later when I brought it up again.)

A week or so later she told me that the teacher was checking attendance and I had a long line of [DIDNT ATTEND] aka the letter [A] for absence. A girl(Mia) asked why I had so much [A] and the teacher said “oh that’s another story”. Then she told me Brad looked at Mia really weirdly, and that he kinda zoned out afterwards. The teacher said his name as in to see if he was there. Brad didn’t reply and then the teacher asked him if he was okay. Brad said, “I was, but it’s just so annoying that Mia has to ask about u/omg-aaaaa-fuck, when she doesn’t know anything about her life or what she’s dealing with.” This sounds so out of character for Brad and I was really skeptical about it, so I told a friend, to get a second opinion and to vent.

I told Talia the story and what Rose told me. Of course I want to believe Rose, but it’s hard when it all seems kinda off to me. I told Rose that if she’s lying I would really like to know now instead of getting happy for something that didn’t happen. She told me she isn’t lying but that she gets if I don’t believe in her.

I feel like such an asshole because I don’t trust my own friend and I want to know if what I did was morally wrong or an asshole move, and how I could’ve handled it better. So yeah, AITA?"	Not enough info	0	0	56.0	17.0	0.0	0.0

My friend went to a Halloween party dressed in a black bin bag, ragged trousers, and a pillow underneath the bag. All together this was supposed to be a hunchback costume. However, my friend thought the costume wasn't up to his usual standards, particularly since so many people were confused as to what he was meant to be. When he voiced this opinion, I agreed with him that it could have been better. I wasn't trying to make fun of him or anything, and I probably could have phrased it better, but I thought that was better than trying to lie to him that the costume was good when he clearly thought it wasn't. 

When the rest of the group there heard about this, they were angry at me and claimed what I had said was very hurtful.

c6ixtx	2019-06-28 11:14:58	MadeInUruguay	AITA for applying alcohol on my son's cut hand?	"I work from home.

&#x200B;

I hear from my office my wife telling my 5yo (who was crying ""I WANT AN APPLE AND A BANANA CUT UP IN PIECES!"") to go grab both the apple and the banana and peel/cut them himself.

&#x200B;

5 minutes later I hear my son crying and screaming.  


I go to the kitchen to find my wife holding my boy's hand wrapped in kitchen paper. I assummed the worst, but looked at my wife and asked what happened: ""he cut his hand because he used the sharpest knife in the kitchen"" (a pairing knife he found in the counter.  


I gave her the ""are you fucking kidding me?"" look and she immediately went full defensive: ""it's nothing"", ""it's not deep"", etc.  


""Let me take a look"", I said and grabbed my boy's hand, removed the kitchen paper and, indeed, it was a 1mm deep, 2 cm long, superficial cut in his thumb/index finger web, nothing too serious damage-wise.  


She wanted to use some spray antiseptic (the ones you put on their knees when they scratch them on pavement or something) but I insisted and took my boy to the batch, placed his hand over the sink and applied alcohol over the wound, let it sit there for 10 secs and washed with cold water to calm the sting.  


My boy was OBVIOUSLY crying from the alcohol sting, while my wife was telling me how we never, in 8 years, have used alcohol to clean any minor wound, and implying that I was just being an asshole for putting the boy through such pain just for the sake of usin alcohol.  


I told her that never before the boy had cut himself with a kitchen knife that was sitting on the counter, possibly near the sink, dirt with fruit, etc. THAT's why I rather had him suffer for 5 secs and avoid an infection for a silly wound. As the father, I have every right to be concerned about the boy's wellbeing and take action, within reason, to prevent future harm.  


My initial stink eye reaction to her was because she shouldn't have sent a 5yo boy to peel and chop food by himself.  


Am I the asshole for my reaction and/or for using alcohol instead of just a spray antiseptic for my son's cut?

EDIT: OK, I was an asshole for taking over my wife. I let my frustration over the situation drive my actions.

- I now know alcohol is not the best option

- ""the boy"" is an affectionate way of referring to one's sons where I'm from, English is not my mother tongue. Still, I don't see the creepy/chilling factor in it

- There's many assuming stuff here and reading between the lines. To those: I would have appreciated if you asked for more info before drawing conclusions

- The ones crying abuse, or than I'm sadistic, etc. I find your train of thought hyperbolic and mental

- The only reason I didn't jump off my office when I heard my wife telling our son to cut the fruit himself is because I do tech/customer support. I can't just drop a call, a chat, a remote session, etc. Which is what I'm doing 80℅ of the time.

I was pretty shocked but put on a brave face and supported her. I was thinking about speaking up about my hesitation but decided I should support her.

As I walk up there's maybe 4 agents taking bags for people so it only took 5 minutes or. I'm next in line waiting for this guy to waive me up and he tells his buddy, ""damn they didn't even tip you?""

So instantly I'm thinking, is this normal? Do people usually tip the bag agents?

Anyway, I drop off my bag to the guy and he hands me my bag ticket and tells me my gate. Right as I start walking away I hear him say ""Oh wooow, really?""

But I'm thinking to myself, why would I tip the guy that has to walk 5 feet and put my bag on the conveyor? Is he assuming this is some ""expedited"" area where the workers are entitled to more since the line is shorter? 

Tipping these guys has literally never occurred to me since it seems fairly straight forward. I always tip Uber drivers because my life is literally in their hands. If they get me there safe then yeah you get rewarded for being friendly and doing a solid job. 

Also, just wanted to say it's 70°F and sunny so it's a pleasant day outside. 

Am I really in the wrong here or is this guy just trying to guilt trip people so he makes extra cash?

Edit: This is in Detroit, I'm originally from Chicago. So yes I understand tipping is understandable at certain areas all over the USA.

c6iref	2019-06-28 10:53:13		WIBTA If I told my mother in law she will not be allowed to see her grandchildren if she doesn't take care of her health.	"So first off, this is something I (21m) and my SO (21F) agree on. My SO's mom does not take any responsibility of her own life. She has type 2 diabetes and is fully capable of turning it around through diet and exercise, but puts minimal effort in doing so. She used to have to take insulin at night, but now it's moved to insulin after each meal. 

Basically, her diabetes is getting worse. On top of this, she hasn't had a job in over a year, and relies on my SO's father to take care of her. 

I wouldn't think much of this except there is the fact that she kinda treats him like shit and she's really good at putting the blame of her life being so shitty on other people or the fact that she has depression. When my SO or my SO's father tries to talk to her about changing she gets super defensive and then tells them ""it's the depression"". 

Now, I don't have depression, so I couldn't possibly know what it's like. I would guess it would be the feeling of emotionally  drowning constantly, but I just can't know. Regardless, I don't think it's right that she uses it as a crutch against her husband and an excuse for why she is the way she is.

 Anyways, lately she's been having health scares and it literally sucks the life out of her and her family. We're all really stressed out but she still doesn't seem to budge. She'll still buy chips and cake and eat it. So I'm thinking, if anything will get through to her that she needs to change, it may be blocking her from my future child until she finally takes responsibility, I'm really doing this for her and my child. I wouldn't want my child to be growing up around a ticking time bomb. But I'm also thinking that if my mother in law never changes and then one day passed away that I would have extreme guilt because she never saw her grandchild, so I'm kinda torn. Im thinking maybe doing it for a year and then regardless of what happens break the blockage. WIBTA if I pulled this move on my mother in law?

Update: Decided to not go through with it. My MIL needs help to change but I won't be able to do it. I sincerely couldn't think of anyway she would change besides a drastic measure like this, but if it means that I must talk to my child in the future about why she couldn't meet grandma then it's not worth it.

Me:"" Yeah it was really good! (cousin)s performance was really great!""

"Edit: i have got the impression that 'call out' means something violent? i am not english so i assumed that 'call out' meant approach someone or have a discussion with someone to try and resolve an issue. i definitley don't want to hurt this person, i just want to have a discussion with her about some of the things she has been saying as i'm worried about her as all this is extremely out of character and she's being very dismissive of people's problems.

I've been friends with this girl for about years now, and we've always been very close.

When I first met her, we were both 11, so I'd say that I know her extremely well, and we even lived withe each other for a couple of months. She's always acted much younger than her age (as in when we were 15 she would try and hang out with my nine year old sister, want to play imaginary games, and was extremely innocent/ sensitive) which I just kind of put down to her personality, and now we're older, she still acts like she did when she was 11, and claims that because she sometimes doesn't have the energy to act all bubbly all the time, she's severely depressed. As well as this, she compares my severe anxiety to her being an introvert, says she's anorexic because she acts similar to another one of friends (who doesn't even have anorexia, she has bulimia), and her girlfriend has mild tourette's, so out of no where, she's developed tics that are very obviously faked, that she forgets about most of the time. Another thing is that I have medical issues related to my periods meaning I have to see doctors monthly, and when I finally told her about this, the next day she told me that her periods are exactly like mine, and that she's incredibly depressed every time she's on it, and that she wants to start she wants to start the same medication that I'm on.

Also, now its June, she won't stop going on about how gay she is, and its almost as if its the only thing she ever wants to talk about. For example, the other day we were just at the cinema, when she yelled 'I'm gay and I'm proud, and I love my girlfriend' out of nowhere, which was incredibly uncomfortable as lots of people were staring at us, and had nothing to do with the conversation we were having (i'd just like to make clear that i'm not homophobic- i'm gay myself, i just don't like talking about it all the time). When I asked her to not yell really loudly in public because of my anxiety, she told me that she also has anxiety, and she's fine with it, so I should be too.

Another indecent that has happened multiple times is her posting on instagram about all these mental disorders that she has, very clearly to get attention and pity from her followers.

Its gotten to the stage where its impossible to talk about anyone's issues without her saying that she has it much worse than everyone else (even when someone came out as trans, she immediately told us she was demisexual and demigender which took the focus off the person coming out), and she's never been diagnosed with any disorder in her life. I want to call her out for it, but I feel like I'd be being a massive asshole as she's not actually harming anyone, and I'm really worried of the fact that maybe she does have some of the disorders she claims to have and I'd just be harming her more, and also that I'd only be really calling her out for my own gain to stop her speaking over everyone else's issues."

c6ihro	2019-06-28 10:18:36	jiratcha	AITA for not talking to my friends after moving schools?	"I’ll put a TL;DR at the bottom.

I (17F) have been suffering with depression and anxiety for the past 4 years. Diagnosed late last year. A whole can of worms that I won’t go into.

I joined my current school last academic year (that’s sophomore for any Americans, and I’m a junior now). Basically, one thing led to another and now I haven’t been in school since February. That’s 2 terms out of 3 that I haven’t been present in school, not including absences I took before simply because I was too scared/too low to force myself to go.

I’ve been friends with these two girls since Y11/sophomore year and we’re pretty close. Only thing is I was never one to really meet up outside of school very often (introvert + depressed + anxious, not a great combo) and the frequency of meet-ups has decreased since I stopped attending school. Now, when I look on social media/meet up with them once in a blue moon, they’ve got a new ring of friends that I really don’t feel comfortable with.

I’ve been accepted to join a new school in September (not sure if I’ll take the place or not) where I’ll be repeating Y11/sophomore year. I’ve told both of my friends about it. They seem pretty chill.

Only thing is, as I said, I’m not great with hanging out outside of school and am worried drifting apart. Also worried about them leaving me behind (going to uni while I’m going into Y13/senior year) if we stay really close. It’ll be hard dealing with that on top of final exams etc.

I’m worried that if I rely on them too much, I won’t make new friends at the new school. I’m also worried that if I try to stay in touch, we’ll drift apart really easily and our friendship will be reduced to polite conversations with nothing personal/meaningful being said.

I also feel guilty for not being there for them when they needed me and would rather they didn’t waste time during their last year of school (which is packed w stress thanks to the IB system) trying to accommodate me.

Should also mention that I have moved schools a few times before and it sucks watching your best friends turn into friendly acquaintances.

TL;DR am I the asshole if I stop talking to my (old school) close friends after switching to a new school? I’m not great at staying in touch and feel like a clean break might be easier for me to handle than a slowly dying flame.

edit: Should have put WIBTA, my bad. Question still stands, though.

We share stuff all the time. Sometimes we ask, sometimes we don’t. We annoy each other a lot with this but at the end of the day we don’t really care that much unless we wanted to use that item of clothing that same day. Rarely happens but whatever. 

So I have this skirt, it’s a pleated, school girl kinda skirt. I wear it specifically and exclusively when I’m “dressing up” for my boyfriend, in a schoolgirl kind of outfit. She knows this. I’ve had sex in it multiple times. Now she wants to borrow it for a “back to school” event/party. 

Obviously it’s been washed and she clearly doesn’t care that I’ve had sex in it - I just find it a bit odd as it’s kind of, specifically, a “sex skirt”, and I relate it to that. My bf follows her on insta and I know she’d take photos in it and upload them. So he’d definitely see her wearing it and I just feel a bit funny about my bf seeing my sister in something exclusively related to sex (with me), bc the whole vibe of the skirt and me dressed up turns him on - that’s the whole point. I trust both of them and know there’s no sexual attraction there, I just can’t help feeling like if I was going to let her borrow it, it’d be under the rule of “no photos on Instagram with the skirt visible” which makes me feel really controlling. I haven’t said yes or no to her question yet, and I won’t see her all weekend as I’m going away with my bf. 

I also feel like it’d maybe ruin the purpose of the skirt/reduce the reaction he has to me in the skirt if he knows my sister has worn it, and I’ve let her. It’s something I bought for him as I knew he would like it. 

I know it’s just a piece of clothing but I feel odd about it. So, idk, AITA?

EDIT:
So I just wanted to thank everyone who took their time to reply, I wasn’t expecting to get many responses!
To answer a few things mentioned in the comments:

I spoke with my bf today and he did say he would find it weird to see her in it, and would prefer she didn’t. I told her no, and explained my reasons. 
A lot of people had suggested to take the skirt with me so she couldn’t wear it anyway - great advice but unfortunately by the time she had asked I was at work, and leaving straight afterwards so I didn’t have the skirt with me. 
She ignored the fact I said no, and is wearing it anyway. Although she hasn’t posted on any of her own social media, I only found out as I have one of her friends on Snapchat and she filmed her dancing in it. - I’ve messaged her angrily now so if anyone wants an update to that I’m sure it’ll be interesting."

I  wondered why she did this ,asked to her friends what did i do wrong. They didn't tell me why too. This happener months ago . A few days ago one of her friends finally texted me why. Because she felt sorry for me. Turns out that she didn't like me but she thought i liked her ( I did like her but i didn t say anything or imply it) .

c6ifq4	2019-06-28 10:11:08	SuspiciousLook185	AITA for making fun of a girl who smiled a me in a sensual way?	"Hey guys, obvious throwaway account 185 here.

Yesterday I went out with a couple of friends and we decided to spend the night wandering around our city and a bigger city near ours, so we could grab dinner in a nicer place than whatever our city offers.

The only problem being that we couldn't go to the bigger city with one of my friend's car but it was no biggie, we could still go there with a bus.

So we get there, we grab our dinner, we have a nice time, everything goes great and eventually we grab the latest bus available to get home (so at around 12 AM). As soon as we sit in the bus, a group of girls around our age (i'm 19) sits in front of us, but only one of them can directly look at us.

The bus starts and obviously me and my friends star chatting in a ""bro manner"" but nowhere near loud, but then I notice that the girl in front of us is looking at me.

Initially I thought we were being too loud so I started talking a bit more quietly so my friends would do the same.

But she was still looking at me, like proper eye contact.

Now, I'm not that socially awkward and I think that I'm able to look or talk with a girl without problems, but her way of looking at me was kinda freaky.

She looked at me one more time but this time she was licking her lips while looking at me dead in the eyes. 

Ok fuck it. I know I'm gonna get the ""you're gay ahahah"" jokes but at 12AM and in a random bus that kinda freaked the shit out of me, at least enough to trigger my anxiety.

Whenever I get in this kind of situations where I get a bit of anxiety it's usually noticeable, because I become more quiet and I look way too much to the ground, with that Jim Halpert smile on my face.

So I discreetly told one of my friends (thinking back at it, maybe the wrong one) what that girl was doing and he started seeing it too and eventually we started making jokes about it, again as discreetly as possible, but my friend (being the most exuberant of us) got a bit too loud and that girl clearly noticed what we were doing.

The look on her face changed completely and stopped looking at me, if not to give me and my group of friends a disappointed (or angry) look.

I know that, if the genders were swapped, she would have called the police on me but I still feel like shit for making her feel like crap. 

It almost looked like we were a group against that girl.

So yeah, am I the asshole for making fun of her?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"So me and my girlfriend are buying a house and the process is taking a lot longer than expected so she has a job but doesn't really have anywhere to stay so my sister offered to put her up for the time being.
A really generous offer that has helped us out massively she stays there 3 days a week and with me 2 days a week (I'm in the military and have a very small room so it's not practical for her to stay with me more)

She's been staying with her for about 3 weeks and I go round once a week mainly to see my niece and nephews and have dinner with them. 
So last night we're sat down and she starts mentioning that we need to pay for some meals and buy our food which I'm happy to. We've offered to give them money before but they've always declined. Then she mentions the fact that a few weeks ago when I was round I went to the shop and whilst I was there got a beer for myself (I was driving so just got the one) when I returned she mentioned that it was selfish I didn't get her one I honestly didn't even think, I poured my sister half and thought that was the end of it. So she brings it up and says I was really rude and selfish and then we proceed to argue because I'm surprised she's held onto it that long and start bringing up other times I've slipped up she said at Christmas we went to the pub and I didn't buy a round. I felt terrible because I really appreciate all they're doing and how they're helping us out we try and babysit whenever they need us to and help out with the kids as well as day to day but she was upset that I didn't bring flowers or a gift when I come for dinner. I didn't really understand if we've offered some money and they've refused and was quite hurt that she bringing up all these times I've messed up. I ended up saying sorry and didn't want to fall out over a beer and accepted I should try and do more but I still can't help but think she overreacted. 
Now I feel like I've been really selfish and horrible for the past 6 months and now things are awkward with my sister.

Went out and got a beer didn't buy my sister one and she got angry and started bring up six months worth of things I've done wrong."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	15.0	15.0	0.0	0.0

c6iafg	2019-06-28 09:52:22	ChillyyCanadian	AITA for ignoring/not wanting to be around my friend?	"
I've been friends with this girl for roughly two years now, at first we got on really well but recently we've started to grow apart. It all started when I got one of the twelve main leadership roles at my school. She seemed a bit distant at first but got over it. It's now the next year and I've become deputy head girl. When I first got deputy she was like ”oh you don't really deserve this, why did they choose you?” and a few other rude comments. Just a few months ago she began calling me gay/lesbian when she knows for a fact I'm not. We even have a gay friend so I don't understand where this is coming from. ”omg! you are so gay! you act so lesbian.."" I recoiled by calling her a b**** and saying (in a mocking tone) ”omggggg! You are so gayyyyyyyy!” I realise now that wasn't the smartest idea. I talked to her about stopping with the name calling at a sports game and she agreed. A few days later I was joking around with a friend and accidentally touched my their butt. I apologised and she seemed fine but then my friend said: ""I know you told me to try and stop them from calling you gay but I can't when you do that..”. I lost it. walked away and have been distant ever since. if I had a problem with the other people calling me gay (they never really did) then I would have talked to them personally. the reason why I talked to her specifically was that she was the main person teasing me... Also from this experience I now have minor trust issues, I hang out with a group of guys I know won't judge me. 

So reddit.. AITA?

c6i8y9	2019-06-28 09:47:18		AITA for stopping my SO from shaving his head?	"I'll be honest, I don't find bald men attractive. Some men can sport them (IMO my SO can't), but to me they never really looked attractive. But this is my own personal preference. My SO's hair is recently thinning, he used to have very thick shiny blonde hair. It doesn't look off, when he doesn't get a hair cut for about 3 weeks it still looks very good. 

He has been telling me he just wants to shave it all off and be bald as he said 'its bound to happen anyway'. I told him I know its bound to happen but I want to extend the fact that he still has hair. He whines about it everytime he needs to get a haircut, I tell him to go ahead but don't expect me to like it/find it sexy. So he has never went through with it.

We've  been together for 8 years and I always make sure I remain attractive for him, keep my physical appearance in check and what not as I do think it is important for a relationship that physical and sexual attraction is still alive and well.

We went to a small bbq with his friends and I overheard him talk to a bald friend of his about how he wants to shave it all off and that I am the only reason he hasn't done it yet. 

The friend told him I was being a b!tch and that he shouldn't let me control whatever hairstyle he wants just because I don't find it sexy. I stepped in and joked that I'm the one who has to have sex with him, I have to find him attractive, no? 

They laughed awkwardly and moved on from the conversation.

On the way home, I told my SO, once he goes bald 'naturally', I will accept it and won't make a big deal out of it. It's just that for now, since he still has a 'head full' of mildly thinning hair, I'd appreciate it if he would keep it.

He said he gets it but his buddy has a point. 

I don't think he does, but maybe he does, I'll let you guys decide."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6i8sa	2019-06-28 09:46:32	Pqowieuryt1819	WIBTA if I told my (19M) girlfriend (18F) to not call me about when she is high	" 

Sorry for bad formatting on mobile and first time posting on this thread.

So my girlfriend and I have been dating  for almost two years I would say and it has been going well. About a year ago we started long distance but it has still been good.

Starting about 4 months ago she started drinking and getting high with friends, this wasn't that big of a concern to me because I know the friends she's doing with and it is very controlled. I can tell she isn't addicted, she just  wants to have some fun like a lot of highschool or college kids do. I have no problem with her doing this, especially because she has never broken my trust. However there's just somewhere deep within me that doesn't want to constantly have the conversation of ""how was your day?"" ""Good I went smoking and drinking with some friends"" so I told her to just not tell me when she smokes or drinks from now on. Just tell me other details of the day because I don't want to hear about that part. 

She asked me if I wanted her to stop because I didn't want to hear about it. I told her that I'm okay with her doing it, as long as it doesn't get out of hand and we talk about other things besides that in our conversations. Well here are where things get a little annoying, she's gets very emotional when she is drunk or high and will call me and spill all her emotions out. For example she will beg me to call then she talks about how she doesn't think I love her and she's scared I'll leave her because I don't love her enough. She mainly feels this way just because of the effect long distance has had on our relationship. She will also still tell me about her experiences after she's sobered up knowing I don't want to hear about it. Her reasoning for this is because she never wants to hide anything from me and wants to tell me everything

Now I would be okay with this because of course communication is really important and I want to be the person she can always come to no matter the circumstance. But this means that I'll always be hearing from her when she's drunk or high talking about herself being drunk or high when I told her I don't want to hear about it. And also she will call my very late at night sometimes to have these discussions. I'm working  full time over the summer and also studying for my college classes for the upcoming semester because last semester I did not do very well. Sometimes she will call at 3am and wake me and have a 2 hour talk and be so emotional I can't just hang up or say I cannot call. So I'm wondering. WIBTA if i just told her that from now on I'm really sticking to what I told her, I don't want you to talk to me about your drunk or high experiences, and if your having emotional conflicts or anything talk to me when your not drunk or high. I still want to be the person she can rely on and talk to but I'm curious if doing this would make me the asshole.

c6i825	2019-06-28 09:43:45		AITA for judging and being mad at a friend for being a bad artist.	"Okay so I am good friends with my mothers friend, I am 20 and she is in her late 30s. She has recently been making and selling cards, portraits and beach towels all of her own design, this would normally be fine and dandy but the art she creates is somewhat awful, her proportions are off, she uses cheap art materials and it shows also when she does digital art it doesn’t look professional at all, she colours out the lines or doesn’t colour the thing properly, everything she does seems rushed and that no love or effort was put into it. 

This all started when I introduced her to an art program called procreate, it is a drawing software normally used on an iPad. For my Christmas last year I got an iPad Pro and an ample pencil, that is all I got as they were both together £800. I was very excited and thankful as my mother doesn’t make much money and she got it for me when I asked for it. Not even a week after introducing her to my iPad she gets her own iPad and an Apple Pencil. 

I have studied art for several years and I still struggle to call myself an artist, she has not studied art in her life and proudly calls herself one. I’m not saying that you have to study art to be a valid artist but you must at least have some interest and maybe look into it. Her sister is also an artist and has graduated art school, she has the same opinions as I do but my friend ignores her and gets mad when she is approached about not having studied art or even taking lessons in how to draw properly. 

I don’t know if I’m just jealous, but it’s really starting to piss me off that she is making a lot of money selling her not so great art while I have laboured over learning the fine details of fine arts and I still get less than two commissions a month."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6i553	2019-06-28 09:32:43	CuriousStellar	AITA for telling my best friend she needs to get her life back on track	"So…. I (22F) have a best friend (25F) whom I've known for almost four years now. We're studying the same subject and have been going along pretty damn well. Usually, we're chatting every day and see each other at university pretty often.

Now, she has a few problems in her life: She's more or less floating around aimlessly, not getting any closer to reach her Bachelor Degree, nor  getting a job (though she does want one, I know that), nor really working on her weight (which I know for a fact she is pretty damn unhappy about). She is lacking discipline and doesn't believe she can reach her goals because of that. Also, she has some depressive tendencies, tending to shut herself in when everything gets overwhelming. I get it, because I've been there too, and it took me a while to get to a place where my life is going in the right direction. The only difference is: I have my family around and my boyfriend to push me in the right direction, while she is pretty much on her own with this shit - her family is on the other end of the country and she doesn't really have anybody else to push her. Needless to say, I am really worried she might end up just giving up on herself and never reach a really happy place.

So, last weekend, I decided I needed to do something. So I asked her for a serious talk, where I told her how worried I am. That she needs to get her life back on track now. I tried my best to be polite about it and not just throw accusations - I did offer her my help, mentor her more or less. She agreed on it and I worked out a plan which I thought would be helpful. This included doing one weekly and seven daily To do-lists per list so she has an overview of what she needs to do, and share those with me (we are having a shared OneNote notebook for that). My hope was that splitting her big problems into small, chewable pieces would make it easier for her to both do the things she needs to do and feel like she is doing something rather than just floating around aimlessly. I did always ask her whether she is okay with this, whether she thinks this is helpful, told her she can opt out of it if she feels it doesn't get her anywhere, and that she should tell me if something is wrong.

For the first two days of the week, it did work. She did her list and we talked about it. But now, since Wednesday or so, things do have changed. We don't chat as often as we used to, she didn't do her list for the past days and barely reacts to my messages. She didn't show up for the course we're both attending today and doesn't react on my calls or messages. I wonder if I wronged her, pressured her to much or acted like an asshole unintentionally. Maybe I overstepped her boundaries and she feels like she can't be honest with me.

Obviously we've been taking photos of all the stuff we see and we still check up on social media every so often.

My mate has been uploading photos to Facebook of each week individually, so 8 weeks of photos. A lot of these photos include me and so my family have been seeing them etc.
My mate has told me on multiple occasions that his family are getting pissed at me for not uploading any photos of him.
I do have a few reasons for this:

1) Generally I don't upload photos to Facebook. I use Instagram but it is very much my vanity indulgence. I have been putting photos on there but not many with my mate.

2) I have concerns about posting on Facebook because of my extended family seeing my tattoos. Especially my Catholic Grandad and my father's side of the family.

3) My mate doesn't want his photo taken. He says he doesn't want to look like a tourist so he hasn't taken any selfies and refuses the offer when I ask if he wants his photo taken with the Acropolis in Athens or the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul for example.

c6hzhy	2019-06-28 09:11:04	coconutcakepls	AITA I broke my moms ‘priceless’ statue and replaced it without her knowledge?	"My mom has had a ‘priceless’ piece of art in her kitchen for years. It’s a Nepalese statue of a guru, and it had a beautiful turquoise inlay and gold exterior. It was always fairly light however, and she kept it near the entryway sort of like a blessing since she’d concerted to Hinduism a few years back and she gets a lot of peace from it. 

She always says she found it in a garage sale and she took it to be valued a couple more of years back and it was (apparently) worth somewhere in the 15-20 thousands of dollars range. 

Mom went on vacation to Ireland last month with her boyfriend and asked me to come and housesit for her. I accepted and asked if it would be cool if I bought my cat, which she was happy about since she likes cats. They were gone for 1 month and in that time unfortunately my cat managed to drop and severely dent my moms statue. It fell from a height and it was my own carelessness because I hadn’t moved my cat.

I immediately tried to fix it but it’s a large dent and I felt awful about my mom finding out. I found an EXACT replacement on eBay (it was very very VERY pricey, but definitely not priceless) and I purchased it with expedited shipping. 

When it arrived they both looked, weighed, felt the exact same except the newer one was a lot shinier. Before she came back I scrubbed her entire house down and used that as an explanation as to why everything including the statue was so shiny. 

Thankfully she hasn’t noticed the difference yet but I feel really guilty. I hid her original statue in her basement where I know she NEVER goes, because I just felt too guilty to throw it out.

He's amazing but he has the most annoying, shallow friends. They're all art school students who believe they're better than everyone else. Oftentimes they act like high school bullies and gossip behind one another's backs, which is immature and disgusting imo. Also hypocritical, given that most of them are also LGBT and have been bullied at some point.

For instance, they call every gay guy a f*g regardless of whether he's comfortable with that or not. They used to do that with me too until my boyfriend called them out, though I'm sure they're still doing it behind our backs. Why? Because they can't go a second without gossipping. The other day, I had to call out a dude in our WhatsApp group for revealing deeply personal information about a classmate of his (that he's a virgin), shared with him in confidence. Just to score easy points and start drama.

Given this, would I be the asshole if I broke off contact with my boyfriend's pals? He does hang out with my friends, so I don't know if that'd be hypocritical. Tbh he also admits they can be annoying, but he doesn't want to distance himself since they're his only close friends."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c6hwod	2019-06-28 09:00:21		AITA if I throwaway 6 friendships over drunk comments. Even though I got genuine apologies.	"I’m a Muslim. But because I’m Afro-Latina and don’t wear Hijab, people often forget that. I still dress modestly, and do what I can to avoid being viewed sexually/objectified. My Muslim girl friends are the same way. But that’s pretty hard to do when I have a really large chest. I can’t wear the same shit my friends wear, because it looks sexual.

I also have a close group of guy friends who know my values and I can honestly say I’ve never felt objectified by them. When I went swimming them in ball shorts and a tshirt, they didn’t blink.

So my girl friends and I went to a house party that one of my guy friends were throwing. I literally always wear a jacket even in this hot ass weather. But my friends said it’s a “Hot girl summer” so we took off our jackets. I was wearing a long sleeve off the shoulder top.

At this party I’m talking to my guy friends and some other guys I went to HS with. One of my close guy friends just randomly says “bro, you’re boobs bounce so much when you talk. Didn’t hear word you said”. I was so uncomfortable when he said that. But every guy in the circle, including my close friends laughed like it was the funniest shit ever. I felt embarrassed and degraded so I walked out.

In a bit my guy friends caught up with me and asked if I was good. I said I was pissed. They all said it wasn’t that deep.

One friend said “90% of us don’t even see you sexually, so no one was really objectifying you. You could take your shirt off and you won’t blink”

Then two guys (including Jason) started repeating “ya take your shirt off”. That made me even more upset. Again they all told me it wasn’t that deep and to relax. It’s just banter. I was vexed and just went back to my other friends.

When I went home, I sent them a paragraph in the GC talking about how their comments made me feel. I was reconsidering my friendship with them.

The one guy who made the first comment apologized to me and said He knows how much I value my religion and modesty and he’s sorry for disrespecting that. He doesn’t get losing our friendship over a drunk comment.

Another guy apologized saying that he really does see me as one of the guys and sometimes forgets that I’m NOT one. He doesn’t think we should cut each other off over drunk comments.

Another friend said I was upset with him “for no reason” because they never even said anything.

But for me, the common theme in the apologies is that they all think it was just “one dumb comment”. But for me, it was so much more. It was embarrassing me, and disregarding my values. Obviously these boys mean the world to me, but I do have my female friends who would NEVER make me feel that small. But at the end of the day, they did apologize.

I have already finished my first year in college and they'll be dropping me off for my second year of college. My parents want to do a family trip to a theme park that is relatively close to my college campus, a lot closer than it is from home. I really just don't want to deal with the headache that is a family vacation of 8 people, who are all related (AKA at least every 20 minutes people are arguing). Another major reason is because my younger brothers (8th & 9th grade) had been doing drugs this last school year and it has been draining me, emotionally, worrying about them and I find it hard to be around them at all anymore. My parents said that I was wrong to be trying to exclude them (which to be fair I did offer to just exclude myself from the trip. But looking back, maybe it just sounded disrespectful instead of helpful) and that either I be a part of the trip or I drive all my stuff back to college myself (which I honestly am capable of, it just would likely really create a rift between me and my parents)

&#x200B;

Also quick note: This is really the first time I have had much disagreement with my parents, ever. I never got in trouble growing up and they've always seemed to have valued my opinion. Not really sure how we got off the same page.

&#x200B;

So AITA for not wanting to do this trip?

Then he criticized me for mentioning that I spent most of the previous day napping. Which, it's none of his business how I spend my time. I had spent over 15 hours and multiple full days with the other kid to try and get our coursework done, and I had repeatedly consulted help from teachers etc and most of the information they had given me had turned out to be entirely wrong.

Yawning, for the record, is totally involuntary and can also have to do with stress and hunger. Those were the two primary things I was feeling after having not eaten since breakfast that day and being held in for my whole lunch to deal with this.

c6hs50	2019-06-28 08:42:10		AITA: is my mother selfish or am I?	"My mother and I live in separate countries and sometimes I feel we come from separate planets. 

When I was 18 I moved from Latvia to UK. I wanted to run away as I hated everything there: constricted opportunities, “walk over bodies” hunger for money and status, cunt cult, men’s superiority in relationships and opinions, never ending status flashing, nepotism. But more, my two families were always in friction, bitching behind each other’s back, but always in front of me, each pulling me in a separate direction in life: my alcoholic father, bitchy stepmother, step brother and half sister vs strict, but loving nan, always working mom, bully brother. 
Also Latvia is a tiny country of 2 million people, so everyone kind of knows everyone, so I didn’t want to be stuck in a echo chamber. 

Through the last years at school I worked in a nightclub as a barmaid, not many people knew it, but I loved it, and I finally had my own cash, my own decisions. At the beginning of uni (I had a scholarship) my mother announced it’s time for me to seriously start joining her business (we tried that before, but she’s too bossy), while my dad got me a job at hospital to do “health and safety” with him. I already HAD a job, but nobody gave a shit, I was to leave it. So I had enough and left, went far away. Gave 2 days notice to say that I’m exiting the country: I just couldn’t face the relentless berating, that was to come, if I would have given them more time. I’ll give you few topics to sample “you’re an idiot”, ”uni”, “how can you do this to us”, “selfish”, “heartless”, “bitch”, “ungrateful”. This was 12 years ago...

Over the years I’ve tried to go back twice a year, but we argue every time. My mother wants to hear how everything I have she has given me, I want her to let me speak, and hear me out that my childhood was not sweet. I don’t need an apology, I just want her to stop peddling the happy childhood stories to all who could listen, in front of me, it just offends me. I stay quiet while she does it, smile, but it’s just like a button that gets pushed and pushed. She never engages in the stories with me, it’s like she has “happy flashbacks” but the rest never existed. Then she wants me to clean her house, help with gardening, do errands and chores. She never has any time for me when I’m there, and nobody ever comes to visit me in my home. “You’re flat is/was too small”, “you live(d) in a shared accommodation”, “there is only a small spare room in your apartment”. Then get a hotel, if it doesn’t suit!

So my mother yesterday, after our last fight a month ago, announced that “I’ve achieved what I wanted, she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore”. I’m hurt, but on the other hand I’m definitely feeling “fuck you bitch, grow the fuck up, you’re my mother not my daughter!”. Tears fall down my cheeks, but then I’m like “I’m stronger than this grown up baby!”. 

AITA?

I haven’t seen my brother in two years (he’s 37 and a hardcore meth addict, he is also violent and lives four hours away). He had four kids who he had basically abandoned due to drugs. His favorite song of all time is What I Got, by Sublime. My entire childhood that song has reminded me of him. As an adult, his two older kids are now teenagers and apart of my wedding. It’s important that they are incorporated into my wedding because I am VERY close to them. Their father is NOT invited. I chose a specific song to dance to with my nephew (the son of my drug addict brother. He is now 17). I chose to dance with my niece (who is 15) to Love Is What I Got by Sublime. The song for my nephew reminds me of when he was a kid and I think it brings us close. But everyone in my family is calling me an asshole, saying that since my brother is not invited, I should dance to Sublime with my nephew and NOT my niece. I think that’s sexist. Plus my niece LOVES that song and it think it will bring her closer to her addict father in spirit.

c6hqze	2019-06-28 08:37:22	Dctreu	WIBTA If I called the cops on guys who shout outside my flat all night despite their situation?	"Hi.

So I'm taking some really important exams this weekend and week: three six hour marathons with an hour's oral presentation at the end. And I live in Europe so there's a heat wave on at the moment. Also as I live in Europe there is no AC in my tiny flat, I need to leave the windows open all night to cool the room down so that it is livable during the day. I have a cat so I can't exactly leave it sitting in 40° C heat for five days in a row.

There's a spot down in the street which is really good for rough sleepers: it's pretty quiet and sheltered, so there's usually someone sleeping there which is no problem. These past few days, a group of guys have been sleeping there though, getting drunk or high and having huge shouting matches all night (like they start around 2 am and it doesn't stop until 6 am or so). My windows are open, it wakes me up and I can't sleep. Tbh, even with the windows closed I can hear them.

If you ask them from the windows or by going downstairs to keep it down, you get shouted back at, laughed at, sworn at or just plain ignored and if anything they get louder after that.

Now, I really don't want to call the cops on these guys. These are five or six black guys, they're rough sleepers, might be migrants (I don't know). The police here are often violent and racist and God knows what might happen to these guys if they pick them up. Police killings of black people, while not on a US level, are frequent here. 

But if I can't sleep on the four nights before my exams I'm fucked, and there's a lot riding on these. There doesn't seem to be any way to reason with them. I've thought of threatening to call the cops, but if they carry on and I don't they'll know I'm bluffing.

Writing this has pretty much convinced my that I am the asshole if I call, but does anyone have any other ideas?

c6houh	2019-06-28 08:28:13	phuzzeenuts	AITA for asking the previous owner of a car to fix it	"Hey everyone, here goes.

I bought a car from a friend of a friend about three weeks ago. The guy was a mechanic and came highly recommended. He was asking for 5100€ for it, but said he was going to knock 100€ off the price if I changed the windshield myself. He also offered to change the plastic cover from one of the headlights since it was clouded, and the pulley wheel for the a/c compressor since it had a busted bearing, all for the price of the car. I did not negotiate the price or anything, nor did I ask for any of the above, he offered to do these things of his own accord. 


This is where the fun begins. A week later I rang him up and asked him if I could leave him the car over the weekend to fix all of the above. He agreed and said he could do it.  When I went back to pick it up, he had only done the headlight, not the pulley, and said it would be a 1 hour job one of the following days when he got the part. Few days later I call him up to ask about it (considering it’s summer and scorching hot), and he says he doesn’t have time, but gives me a phone number of another shop. I ring them up, but they say they don’t have time either and send me to some other guy. I ask the previous owner if the recommendation is good and he says to go ahead.

I get to the guy, I leave the car, he orders the parts, and starts working on it. A few hours later he calls me and says “listen, I tried taking the bolt out but it wouldn’t budge. I have to get the pneumatic pistol in there but it’s risky, should I go ahead?”. I ring the owner and he says it shouldn’t be a problem. I tell the guy to do it, he tries, and ends up rounding off the screw. I call the previous owner back and tell him, to which he replies angrily that the guy didn’t know what he was doing, and that’s not how you take that part off.

When I got my car back I texted the previous owner about the whole shabang, asking for help, and telling him that the guy who he sent me to suggest a new compressor altogether. He throws a fit along the lines of “well it’s not my fault they had no idea what they’re doing, you can’t ask me for a new compressor, if the engine broke down would you be asking me for a new engine too?”. He ends it by saying bring the car back, I’ll give you the money back and that’s that. I try telling him that I followed his instructions to the letter, and I’m only asking for what he offered, if it would’ve been literally any other part, I wouldn’t have had an issue, since it’s a previously owned car and I risk I take myself. I kept insisting that he holds up his end of the deal, and eventually he caves and says he would ring me on Tuesday to tell me when and where to go, to make sure there are no issues, but that I would have to pay for the parts myself. Not the best outcome but it beats the hell out of not having any air conditioning.

I feel like I bullied him into doing it and his reaction hinted at me being an entitled prick, so I figured I would get a second opinion. So AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	13.0	9.0	0.0	0.0

I'm a 25 year old male and grew up in a small town and only had like a hand full of friends.  
One of these friends got his first gf like 8-9 years ago. He was my best friend for some years but after school I kept moving and he stayed in our home town so we are not as close anymore. However I have known him and his girlfriend for a pretty long time (10years) and I really like both of them. In October of last year they broke up. His gf called me and was crying and said that they broke up and she was the one who decided to end things.... I was shocked because I was so sure they are gonna marry one day.  
Fast forward to today: I'm still friends with both of them. However I see the gf a lot more frequent. Two days ago we were meeting up to chill and talk and she told me a lot of sexual stuff. After some digging I found out that she was cheating at one point in her relationship.   
When I got home I kinda cried my eyes out because I felt so bad for my old friend who has been cheated on. I fucking hate cheaters, why would you do that? Have the balls to end things and fuck around afterwards...  
Yesterday MY gf and I were on the phone for some hours and I told her about all this. (Yes I'm allowed to tell her) I told her that I don't want to be friends with a cheater and I'm not gonna see her again. My gf was becoming more and more defensive and said it doesn't have to do anything with me. She didn't cheat on me so why would I end the friendship because of that. She didn't harm me in any way. I was getting really angry that my gf is kinda ""supporting"" a cheater.  
Now my question? Am I wrong? Am I the asshole? Is it wrong to end a 10year old friendship because someone cheated on her partner.

So from my perspective I really can't see what I did wrong here. From asking her out until receiving the check, I intended to pay. After she offered to pay, I thanked her and allowed her to pay.

The next day I woke up to angry texts. She said I put her into an awkward position, forcing her to pay the bill. I asked what she wanted me to do differently. Apparently I should have argued/insisted that I would pay. My friends agree with her. Now I'm wondering if I should just apologize and pay her back.

My sister recently graduated from high school. Her GPA was a little low which was surprising because she has always been a very smart and hard working student. Top of the class and all that.

She had always wanted to go to college in another city but all of this changed after she graduated. She decided that rather than go to a good college for which my parents agreed to pay the tuition for, she would go to the local community college. I was a little surprised at first but didn't say much since I myself went to the same one.

I decided to have a little talk before she finalized any decisions and she finally confessed that the reason she did so badly was because of her boyfriend. And wanting to go the local community college was also because of him. It seems that he is rather dependent on her and he will only go to college if she's with him and can study hard if she's with him.

I was honestly very dumbfounded to hear about this. This was the first time I've heard of something like this.

Just some context but- my BF has been best friends with M, his best friend, for roughly 6 years now.

Recently M moved out to my home state where my BF moved not to long ago in an attempt to search for better job opportunities.

Due to M moving into BF’s flat, I tend to run into him a lot now & it’s been about 5 weeks since he moved here. He and BF share a room due to there being not much room (but that’s another story). Obviously BF & I hang out whenever we get the chance as I go to college out of state & we don’t see one another for months at a time. M has grown increasingly clingy and aggressive over that time, with multiple things such as: being particularly touchy feely with both me and BF when he is drunk, demanding we respond to his text messages while we are out but growing passive aggressive when we do, throwing literal tantrums when we all play Smash together, refusing to talk to us when we make dinner for him, making particularly hurtful comments toward us when we cuddle, complaining constantly how he has yet to lose his virginity while also being extremely picky and worst of all hitting my boyfriend when he gets upset. 

Now it isn’t a close fisted ‘hit’ but more of a slap. Even so, the first time I saw him do this was a few days ago after he had done something particularly unforgivable to me (I have PTSD and his behavior literally caused me to run from the flat, he later apologized and my BF claims he was sobbing but I still can’t stand to be around him) but seeing him literally HIT my BF is just forgivable. I’ve spoken to my BF about this and my BF has made it clear that he is getting tired of it too and hopes that with more space M will relax- he also expressed to me that he knows M struggles and is adamant on the fact this behavior will relax as ‘he was much better then he was back in [previous state]’. I don’t want my BF to choose sides as I know he just wants M and I to get along- I can’t ask him to choose asides either as that just isn’t right.

Now I understand that mental health issues can cause us to act irrationally but truthfully, I am ready to put my foot down. My BF is currently going through a rough time so I likely won’t bring it up to M now just in case it caused more stress, but I want to make it very clear to him (perhaps a bit harshly) that he needs to get his shit together.

TLDR: BF’s best friend is acting extremely inappropriately to my BF and myself, WIBTA is I brought down the reality hammer?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

My parents want to host an international student to stay in my room while I’m away for college. They would be sharing the one bathroom that my parents and my two siblings use, and to be frank, that bathroom absolutely disgusts me. When I go back home for the break, I just deal with it because I grew up in that house, but over the years the bathroom just got worse and worse. The paint on the walls are peeling, there’s some mold in the corners of the room, the tiles on the floor are dated and ugly, they don’t match the equally ugly tiles in the shower tub area, the “white” bathtub itself is stained brown and dark gray somehow, the wooden window in the shower suffers from water damage, the water in the sink tastes sour, and there’s mold growing around the faucet of the sink. I could go on, but I think you get the point.  The room that’s supposed to make you clean just makes you feel dirty. There’s more problems with the house itself, but the bathroom is the absolute worst room. 

My parents are going to be making money off of this unaware international kid and it makes me furious. They just see this poor kid as money. I know that he’s going to be paying a lot of to stay with my family and I think he’s getting ripped off. The very least my family could do is renovate the bathroom since I know they have the money to do it. I just think they have this illusion where the bathroom is fine because they’re just so used to it.

While trying to convince my mom (through text) to fix the bathroom before he moved in, I started pointing out some of the things I mentioned above since she kept saying the bathroom is fine as it is. It seemed to be getting nowhere so I finally just told her that the bathroom is flat out disgusting and she needs to get it fixed. She never replied to me since. So AITA?"

Throwaway, this is a legitimate post, My mom and step dad have been married for 4 years, my dad passed away when I was 10. I am 17 by the way. He’s never been that rude or anything it’s more like we just talk when needed and don’t have that much of a relationship which I’m okay with. I was having a shower and took about 20minutes. After I came out after getting dressed he came to my room and starting yelling at me saying why did I take so long for and why wasn’t I answering him. I seriously didn’t hear him since I play music on my Bluetooth speaker when I shower. I apologised but he kept going on about it ,so I started talking back to him/became a bit rude and told him to shut up and stop making a big deal about it and that I didn’t hear him. I know I shouldn’t have, He got mad and came towards me and tried to grab my arms, tried to hit me and pushed me off the bed, he told me to get the fuck out of his house and that he hates me then started smiling. My mom then came in and just told me to “calm down “ I told her that he grabbed me and pushed me onto the ground and she doesn’t believe me and says that I’m lying. I have bruises on my arm and even took photos. She didn’t even say anything to him and didn’t care when I left which hurts because I’d never lie about this. No texts at all. I then left crying etc and I’m now at my brothers house. I don’t think my step dad wants me to live there anymore and I don’t really know what I’m supposed to do. I know that I should’ve just let him have his time to complain and maybe if I just kept quiet this could have been prevented.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6hawv	2019-06-28 07:34:33	Nameless606	WIBTA if i back out if being out of being a groomsman in my cousins wedding last minute and ignore him.	A bit of a background. My cousin (19M) and I (19M) have practically been best friends our entire lives, ever since he started dating his Girlfriend now fiancé 4 years ago he has been a bit distant with it only getting worse. We used to hang out or at least talk a few times a week, now I’m lucky if he even responds to my messages even though I know for a fact he sees them as his fiancé has told me countless times he sees them but just ignores people’s messages. Basically the only time i hear from him Is if he needs something besides that its dead silent. Anyways to get to the point, My cousin and his fiancé have both stated many times if i ever need anything to ask and they’ll help. I often refuse help if i can because i hate relying on people due to things in my past which my cousin is aware of but I didn’t really have any other options so on Tuesday i asked them if one of them could take me to work as i had an early shift on Wednesday it was at 8:30am I know that’s not really early but i work nights because it’s when i have transportation available, They said that one of them would take me and that was that I figured i could rely on them but i was wrong, Come Wednesday morning i get ready for work and try to get ahold of them both at 7 only for them to both ignore my multiple calls over the next 40 mins. They were both online and active on Facebook so after multiple calls i gave up and ended up calling my aunt who was asleep and not pleased with being woken up at all just so I wouldn’t risk losing my job Since then i still haven’t heard a thing from either of them they are both online all the time and have looked at my missed calls but both have not said a thing not even a simple excuse or even an apology. I haven’t had a shift with my cousins fiancé yet but I’m dreading the next one i do because honestly I don’t even want to be near her or my cousin. I feel hurt and betrayed, its to the point where I feel like I shouldn’t put in the effort i put into our friendship anymore when its clear I’m the only one trying. My cousin is never busy as he is currently jobless and has been for months all he does is sit at home playing games so it’s clear he just didn’t care enough to keep his word. Mu cousin has been there for me in the past but honestly everything else that’s happened outweighs it all so after this current situation and just with the way things have become over the years has caused me feeling fed up with it all. I’m supposed to be a groomsman in his wedding in a few months but I really don’t even want to anymore, There’s no reason I should waste money on a wedding for someone who can’t even put in the effort to be real friend. I want to make him understand how he’s made me feel so i want to back out of being a groomsman or even going to his wedding and just stop talking to him for a while. That’s about it so my question is WIBTA if i just back out last-minute and ignore him like he’s done to me.	Everyone Sucks	0	0	43.0	34.0	0.0	0.0
c6hakw	2019-06-28 07:33:21		WIBTA for cutting contact from my parents?	"Am I the asshole for cutting out my parents?

Tl:dr parents are old school korean, heavily religious, moved out at 18 became my own person and can’t seem to retain any sort of relationship with parents anymore due to how far I’ve grown apart from them 

Apologize in advance I just typed this on my phone.


Growing up I had serious self esteem issues. I hated myself and was constantly under distress because of social anxiety. Recently I’ve been trying to understand why I felt this way all my life. I could be wrong, but after doing some research I realized a a lot of it had to do with the way my parents raised me (requiring blind obedience, comparing me with other kids who were better, criticizing my innate abilities, yelling at me when they could explain to me my homework, etc).


My parents also tried forced me to go to church in order to “set me straight” ie fix all my problems but it only made me question my parent’s credibility as authority figures and reasonably intelligent human beings. One day I asked my parents with all seriousness if I could see a therapist, because at the time I was starting to realize my social anxiety was at its peak, and I had so much trouble with simple things like making conversation or starting homework as I desperately wanted to avoid the feeling of failure.

Fast forward to a few months after barely graduating high school. I joined the military at 18 realizing I had no future, no self-esteem, I was literally living in the basement just playing video games hating myself and feeling trapped. The military hit me pretty hard, it forced me to grow up rather quick, and best of all, I began to adopt my own set of values and have a very positive outlook on life. I decided I wanted more in life, so I finished my contract and started college. I’m about to do my last year and hardly ever spoke to my parents since. I visit them once every couple of years, just to be nice...but every time I do, I get this feeling that they aren’t comfortable with my set of values. I think this because one day my mom asked me if god was important to me and I said, “no, not at all.” She didn’t say anything after that but the look on her face seemed like it was saying something along the lines of “well, I tried, looks like you’re going to hell.” When I talk about my friends, they don’t like the fact that I hang out with white people,anyone who isn’t korean as they’re very xenophobic. I’m sick of their old ways and just want to live my life without having to cater myself to avoid friction whenever I visit them. 

Basically, I just want to be able to move on with my life without feeling coerced or obligated to spend time with people that I feel have absolutely zero positive impact on my life."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6ha9n	2019-06-28 07:32:18		AITA for telling a friend that her Plan B pill didn’t work because she’s overweight?	"A week ago myself and 3 other girls friends went out to lunch . During the lunch our friend Nancy started complaining about her pregnancy. She got pregnant for the first time and it was completely unplanned . In fact she tried to avoid it because she took the morning after pill . Now Nancy is a nice person but a bit self involved and likes to complain a little more than the average person . She is really into Eastern medicine, doesent like doctors and is what I like to call a “half in half out anti Vaxxer ” . You see Nancy constantly  talks about how the medical system keeps us sick and western medicine doesn’t works and how vaccines “probably do cause autism “ but she never really commits any further than that . In fact she had a flu shot at CVS just last year but I digress . 

So back to the dinner Nancy is going on and on about how miserable and sick she is and didn’t wanna have a kid anyways (she’s changed her mind and although she likes to complain I know she’s very happy now that she’s having it) . She knew Western medicine doesn’t work and it’s all bullshit and this just proves it because if it did she would not be pregnant because the Plan B would have worked . Now that she’s processed all this she recently finalized her choice and she definitely will NOT be vaccinating her kid .... after that I admit my right eye started twitching a little . I told her that’s ridiculous and she can’t just put every other child around her in jeopardy because on a beliefs based on the fact that a morning after pill didn’t work for her . She got upset and said I’m trying to imply that she’s stupid and I said thats not true but she’s planning on acting irresponsibly. She asked if I’m so smart to tell her why wouldn’t a pill that’s supposed to be 99% effective didn’t work. At this point I was wound up and replied “because it’s only 95% effective and also completely ineffective if you’re a overweight” . Everyone gasped and she just stood up and said “So you’re calling me fat ?!”  

(Let me cut in here to say that Nancy is by no means obese but she is a bit overweight and constantly complaints about her weight ) 
I said “No not FAT .... but it is ineffective if you weight more than 175 pounds which you do .... I’m sorry you are slightly overweight for your hight you admitted this before . Now you’re going to put your and other kids lives in danger claiming western medicine desent even work when In fact you didn’t even read the label of what medicine you’re taking “ . The lunch finished up pretty quick after this as you can imagine . Now my friend are telling me that I acted like an asshole and need to apologize . I did text her an apology after she wouldn’t answer me call . I apologies for discussing her weight in public in front of other people or hurting her feelings but that I 100% stand by my disappointment in her not wanting to vaccinate her kids . My friends are saying that I’m overstepping my boundaries by giving her my opinion on her not vaccinating her kids .

c6h9lz	2019-06-28 07:29:50		AITA for telling my friend that I didn't know why my other friend was depressed?	"I'm in my senior year of college, and despite having had about a dozen close friends just a few years ago, there are only two that I still talk to daily ever since I transferred to a college near my hometown and started commuting. Let's call them friend A and friend B. The three of us have been close friends since high school, and while we all now live in different states now we keep in touch through a group chat and playing online video games. Friend B was my best friend at the time, though we'd drifted apart over the past year. He's lost a lot of my respect after cheating on his girlfriend and getting drunk and saying hurtful things to me a few times. 

&#x200B;

One day I was talking with friend A, and he mentioned that friend B had been posting tweets that made it seem as though he was depressed. I said that I didn't know see why he was depressed, and that we hadn't been in contact much so he hadn't told me why. I pointed out that friend B had just graduated from college, was living in an apartment with his friends, had a trust fund of $50,000, and sleeps with multiple women every week as reasons why I thought he was doing well, and why I was surprised that he was depressed. Maybe not the nicest thing I've ever said, and maybe I could have been more sensitive, but I didn't think what I said was all that bad.

&#x200B;

Apparently friend A had told what I said to friend B, and now they both no longer want to talk to me regularly. I asked friend A what was going on and according to him he did it because he thinks him (friend A) and I were both spending too much time playing video games together, and that we were wasting our time by doing so. I asked the obvious questions like why he didn't just ask to spend less time gaming with me like an adult, what telling friend B what I said had to do with friend A and I playing too many video games, and why what I said was considered so awful that it caused such an extreme reaction in friend B. He never gave me a solid answer to any of these questions, avoiding the questions in favor of saying that he did it ""for my own good"" and because it was ""the right thing to do"". 

&#x200B;

I contacted friend B, who am I was closer with despite spending less time talking to him recently. He told me that he no longer wanted to talk to me ""ever again"", and asked why I said what I said. I told him it was because we don't talk much anymore and he never told me that he was depressed or why, and that from what I did know it seemed like he was doing well. I told him I never said he wasn't allowed to be depressed, only that I didn't know why. This didn't satisfy him, and they both decided that they wouldn't speak to me for the time being. I told them how confused/disappointed I was by all of this, and how I expected them to be mature enough to talk to me about their problems instead of acting like children. I realized that my trust in them was irrevocably shattered, and decided to tell them not to contact me again, ending two five year friendships."	Everyone Sucks	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Aside from being a bit concerned from this unexpected announcement i was happy for her, she even said he would come to my country to visit, and from that i was further wierded out that someone she met online was travelling to another country after just a week of knowing each other.

Fast forward a week she calls me one day to ask if bringing a ps4 from the US was legal and if it worked, i said ""there is no problem, but we have no money for that"" as it is true. She just told me it was for curiosity and hung up.

Today she tells me her boyfriend is bringing presents, very expensive ones and im starting to get uncomfortable, as from her choosing of words it was clear it was a ps4 this guy bought. At this point i told her i felt really uncomfortable reciving such a gift from a total stranger, as i feel he is trying to buy afection from her or trying to use it as an excuse to then use as an advantage. She told me it would be ungrateful to not recive it as it was alrady bought, i am mildly upset at her from disregarding my ""we dont have money"" and still going on with the whole present thing. He arrives today and I dont know what to do. 

I dont want to be ungrateful, but i cant help but feel uneasy and uncomfortable about it.AITA?

c6h3ua	2019-06-28 07:09:59	ailurophile_foxglove	AITA For Correcting People When They Talk About My “Step-Dad”	"My apologies if this story isn’t very interesting, I’m having trouble sleeping and this is all I can think about for some reason. Also I’m on mobile yada yada. 

To start off this story I should first mention my biological father. He’s BARELY been in my life from the ages of 7 to 12, so about five years. However, in those five years I probably only saw him about 20 times, that’s all I really needed to know what kind of a person he is. Long story short, he isn’t a good person and I realized I didn’t need someone like that in my life. 

So then comes my mum’s husband, we’ll call him Bill. I have no real problems with Bill. But there is one thing that prevents him from being my step-dad. We have literally NO relationship. By that I mean we don’t hang out together, do any sort of bonding, hell we’ve only ever talked to each other a handful of times and he lives in the same house I do! It’s not that I don’t like him, it’s just that we literally have nothing in common except for my mum. 

So here’s where the question comes in, AITA when I get people telling me he’s my step-dad and I correct them when:
1.   We don’t have a father/daughter relationship
2.   My mum doesn’t particularly want us to have a father/daughter relationship
3.   These people haven’t even thought of if I even wanted a father figure in my life 

I like Bill and that’s what I call him. Bill. Because that’s who he is. He’s not my step-dad. He’s my Bill. AITA? Am I being offended too easily? Should I bother with the correction as it might seem rude or go with making myself more comfortable?

EDIT: Thank you all for commenting these past several hours. I’ve come to the conclusion that for the most part I’m not being an asshole, but shouldn’t get offended by people referring to him as my step-dad as long as they aren’t trying to impose a sort of relationship onto us by using that title. In the future I’ll probably let things go more easily. Thank you for helping me on my journey to be less asshole-y!"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6h2fx	2019-06-28 07:05:25	ArcheryAsshole	AITA for calling the police on my neighbors who were shooting a bow and arrow in the backyard?	"Actually, are we the assholes because the story involves both my wife and I.

As a little background, we live in a nice neighborhood in the city, but the lots are small (~5000 sq ft). The backyards are nearly completely separated from each other with 6ft high block walls on 3 sides. The backyards are on a hillside, and the last 5 feet of of the ""wall"" isn't a wall, but a wrought iron fence. Here's a [shitty drawing](https://imgur.com/a/RNEZEbM) to help you visualize.

The other parties are the neighbor's adult kid (NK) and neighbor's adult kids girlfriend (AKG) who live there as well. 

My wife was in the backyard with our dog (who likes to run up the hillside where the section of wrought iron fence is) when she heard the someone shooting a bow and arrow. She asked over the wall (you can't see over it) if someone was shooting something but she was ignored and laughed at. She then came and told me, and I climbed up the hill to see that they were shooting a bow and arrow at a straw target. Some of the shots were missing and ricocheting towards the section of wrought iron fence, posing a potential hazard to our dog.

During this time, my wife had gone inside and called the police, who said they would send an officer out. The officer comes out, tells us that they can't tell people what to do on their own property, but says she'll go talk to them. The officer talks to them, but doesn't come back to tell anything.

We then hear the neighbors calling us assholes and saying things like ""who does that?"". I know we have to live next to them, and I don't want a fued, so I go over there to talk to them to try to save face. I lie and say we called the non-emergency line to find out the legality of shooting a bow and arrow in one's backyard, and that we told them not to send an officer, but they sent one anyways. I then apologize for the officer coming out and disturbing them.

I also point out that the archery is a safety concern because we have a small dog who hangs out by the fence and may fall victim to a straw arrow. I ask if we can work together to put up something more substantial, even just a sheet of plywood, to make things a little safer. 

They seemed amenable, and thanked me for coming over to talk to them, but also said it would have been nice if we had just come talk to them in the first place. I think I agree with them - calling the police was a bit overkill. I didn't want to contraindicat or undermine my wife, however, and as the police were already in their way, me telling her it was overkill wouldn't have accomplished anything anyways.

After some outsider perspective on whether I’m TA here.

Info: Myself and my partner are both students earning roughly the same amount of money per week.

Recently myself and my partner booked ourselves in for dinner at a nice restaurant and went to a fancy hidden cocktail bar for drinks after. My partner brought cash out for dinner and had asked me if the amount she brought would be enough. I had told her I thought it would be and we head out for dinner.

At dinner we both bought our own drinks as we were there early before getting food and some more drinks each. We went and paid for our own dinners and drinks and split the bill before leaving for the cocktail bar. At the cocktail bar we both had some more drinks, I had beer and she had some expensive cocktails ~ 3x the price of my beers. We were having a great time and when we went to pay the bar staff said they don’t do split bills so I grabbed the tab and we left. As we were heading home my partner asked how much he drinks were and I told her, and asked if she could send me the money for her cocktails when she gets paid next, this was about $60. She then brought up how it would be nice if we shouted each other sometimes as that is a nice thing to do for your partner. I asked her if she meant for me to of shouted her dinner and the cocktails and she didn’t say yes but her body language inferred that she thought I would have paid our whole anniversary dinner. This made me feel like a cheapskate even though it was never discussed that I would pay for dinner and in the past we have always paid our own ways.

 suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere they're broken up, and he's already going out with the first girl, Jenny, who, it turns out, he was actually texting whilst out with Sarah, instead of talking to her at some points. Which is a real asshole move in mine and my friends opinions.

c6h0pt	2019-06-28 06:59:46	Mambarii	AITA For becoming distant towards my family	"Hi, reddit! This is my first post and I'm writing this on my phone at 2am so I apologise for any spelling errors. (I'll fix them at some point)

I am a 17 Non-binary (they/them) who has a lot of trouble with anxiety and low self esteem. I'm not the best at communicating.

My family (mother, father, younger sister, older brother) is quite right leaning and have a lot of issues with me being Non-binary which doesn't help the low self esteem.

I ended up completely snapping and distancing myself from them after a conversation with my dad about how being LGBT is wrong, how I'm going to hell, and how I'm sick in the head.

For the past few weeks, I've been in a very bad place mentally and want nothing to do with them, so I've been completely disconnecting myself from them. After a few days of doing this, I got several comments.

I didn't go out to play a board game with my sister and father so I was yelled at, and my phone was taken away. My mother thinks I spend too much time online, and my brother doesn't speak to me anymore, considering it a betrayal that I came out to them.

I  don't play many family games with them due to how much we argue, I don't sit through movies we watch without getting on my phone or just trying to sleep if the lights are off, I spend most of my days in bed, and I eating has been a difficult task, but I'm doing better.

They've been calling me a jerk, a bad sibling, a bad influence, and have had several rants aimed at me about how I'm wrong for distancing myself and have stopped going to church because my religious beliefs have taken a bad hit due to my parents calling me a sinner.

I have almost completely held myself up in my room, seeing no point in leaving because I do not want to spend time with a family I don't enjoy being around.

c6gxj2	2019-06-28 06:49:06	notcoopy	AITA For not wanting to travel 7+ hours to spend time with my girlfriends family for sometime multiple days at a time multiple times a month?	"A little backstory to start: My girlfriend and I have been dating for 3 years come September and have very different opinions on visiting family more then once or twice a year for major holidays.  In reality we have hugely different opinions on the idea of family at all. 

Now let me start this by saying that I in no way shape or form hate my family or hers. In fact when I’m there it’s usually fine and the days go by quick as anything but it feels wrong sometimes. While she would drive up there multiple times a month if she could I have no interest in interacting with them for the most part. Like any family they are fine in bursts, especially like my own, but after a while I find myself itching to get back home to the familiarity of my routine and what I do yada yada.  Now the tissue translates to my family as well but I feel my mother understands that I want my own space and life while her mom takes it as an insult almost.  

Now in reference to the title, we went to Disneyworld for our birthdays like we do every year but no less then a week and a half later she was begging me to come spend a week in Orlando with her family at Disney. I declined of course and she of course took it as a don’t want to spend time with them. Fast forward two weeks and we’re going to Nashville, a seven hour drive from Pensacola FL, which I am dreading terribly for 4th of July which is literally a week away. We’re leaving the fifth. Am I wrong to feel this way about my time? Or is it part of relationships that I’m just not good at. In my mind I guess I can’t comprehend wanting to spend that much time with family at all for a holiday that’s a week away. I think I’m the asshole but is it normal to want to spend so much time away from our lives?"	No A-holes here	0	0	324.0	75.0	0.0	0.0

c6gv2o	2019-06-28 06:40:56	1234aita2341	AITA for not attending womensmarch?	"Sorry if some of the English isn't perfect I'm not a native speaker and I had to translate the texts that where sent.

My Mother asked me per text if I would join her at the women march. I answered with the following:

""No, sorry. I think there are a lot of good and important reasons to fight for but a few things that come with the demonstration make me feel uncomfortable.""

Her response was this:

""Your small minded, stuck up view that stands in conflict with the real problems of the women around you I will remember this. And that a me asking something of you is worth less than your under worldly ill-informed tenacity""

So after that I didn't talk to her for 2 weeks (I don't live with her I'm an adult) I'm pretty hurt about what she said.

Yesterday after work I visited her and we talked about the whole thing. She said that she was expecting me to attend and when I said I wouldn't she was deeply disappointed and therefore her comments were justified. She said I should have put aside the things that make me feel uncomfortable and jump over my shadow to support her. I said that I don't think I owe her the attendance at a political rally and even if she is disappointed that there is no reason to attack me on such a personal level. She said she would not apologize and I don't think I did anything wrong.

&#x200B;

Edit:

For clarification some of the things that made me not want to attend:

\-I don't like demonstrations never have been, not planing on going to one

\-Some of the organisers are extremists imo (destroy patriarchy/kapitalism etc.)

\-There was a flyer for men how to act at the womens march i.e. walk behind the women, lay low if you're a man etc. I don't think this is healthy

\-I belive in gender equality but I don't agree with all the policies demanded (i.e. 30% of x department of a company needs to be women)

&#x200B;

Edit2:

No contact for two weeks means: we normally speak per phone or text once a week we didn't do that and there where no attempts of her to contact me that I ignored. I visited her yesterday because she wrote that she wanted to meet and I agreed."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6gu4a	2019-06-28 06:37:39	Picassocurro	AITA for telling my dad that I hate him?	"Me (20F) and my Dad (61M) are living alone together. My dad and my mom had a divorce last year, my mom took my little brother and I stayed at my dads house. It was a really awful and disgusting divorce, because of money etc. My dad always had enough money, hes an architect. So, since the divorse everythig went REALLY down. He has to pay a loot of money to my mom and brother, plus he lost many projects in his job = no money at all. 

Little info: My mom and dad always had drinking issues, my mom more than my dad, shes still into it. My dad did a lot better, but since my mom is gone its much worse. So they had a really aggressive relationship, even with us kids. But I always loved my dad, I was always his fan. My mom never liked me, idk why, I didnt see her for a few months now, its like I dont really have a mom.

So on, like I already told I live alone with my father in our old house. Its really big with a garden, but with a lot of stuff in it. My dad is kinda a messy. And his stuff is EVERWHERE. I am the only one who is cleaning, cooking, doing the laundry, buy stuff at the market blablabla. My dad is doing NOTHING because hes a fucking lazy ass (He works like half a day and I go to school from 7:00-17:00) and he thinks this is stuff only women do. You know it was always ok for me because I am still in my education and have no job, so this was my ""job"" and I could get always money from dad when I needed it. Fine.

But since the last few months my dad is a monster, he yells at me when I have no time to do something for him. Hes complaining that I do nothing and stuff like this. And I mean the fuck I do everything in this house and Im his daughter, not his wife. 

&#x200B;

Situation: So today in the morning I was late for school, I said bye and he asked If I could go get something for him after school, I said no because I really have to do tons of laundry in the evening. He yelled at me ONLY 1 MINUTE!!!!

I said nothing and I did go to school. I was crying in my car and in the school, so i wrote him a really long sms about how he is treating me and making me sad every fucking day. So yes, I told him that i HATE him and much stuff like this. That he should go to a psychologist for his aggressive attitudes and stuff. I was really really upset, so it came to this long sms.. He answered that this was too much and I could move out. I new some type of response like this would come, but I really was hoping of a sorry or something like this.

&#x200B;

So question: AITA for telling my dad that I hate him? Pls tell me your thoughts about my situation. Right now im in school holding my tears back and writing this post.

c6gtxc	2019-06-28 06:36:59		AITA for lying about the cost breakdown of a mural?	"I have a full-time desk job, but enjoy painting, and pick up the occasional commission. I don't have a business or anything, so most of my paintings are done for friends, family, or friends-of-friends. I also don't have a set pricing structure, and usually just accept whatever I'm offered, if its reasonable.

A friend of a family member contacted me recently, asking if I could do a mural for her. I agreed, but when she asked how much I would charge, I didn't really know what to say, since I normally don't price my own work. I felt it would be unprofessional to tell her ""whatever you're willing to pay me,"" so I said I'd take some measurements, calculate the cost of paint/labor, and get back to her.

I could easily figure out the cost of paint, but had no idea how to price my own labor. After doing a bit of research, I came up with an estimate that I believed was reasonable. However, I didn't know what her budget was (she wouldn't say initially, probably because she didn't want to lowball me), so told her that I could bring the price down if necessary by using ""cheaper paint."" I let her know that, if she had a certain price in mind, I could find a different paint to fit within that budget.

That was a lie, since I have no intention of buying a different type of paint. If she suggests a different price, my plan was to just accept it (as long as it's above the cost of supplies), meaning any price difference would actually come out of the labor.

I mentioned this to a family member, who argued that I should have just told her the truth, because (1) as someone she ""hired,"" it was wrong for me to lie about the cost breakdown, and (2) she would be under the impression that a cheaper price gets her a lower quality mural, when there's actually no difference. However, I thought it would be inappropriate to tell her that ""$[initial-eatimate] is how much I want you to pay me, but $[cost-of-supplies] is what I'd actually be willing to do it for."" Plus, since she seemed hesitant to lowball me, I didn't want her to feel bad for suggesting a lower price if my estimate was too high.

"I am in charge of the technical aspects of designing something, but getting contracts in place, suppliers approved, and parts ordered is this other guy's job.

Now to his defense, he is newer to the company than I am (though he has 15+ years relevant experience) and has to do stuff for a bunch of engineers and not just me. But the problem is he never actually seems to do what you ask him to unless you prompt him every few days. He's forgetful and doesn't seem to ever understand what is priority (i.e. June duedates should be prioritized over December ones). 

I've gone over before to talk to him and asked for an update on something from weeks before only to discover he had never even sent an email out (he still had the post-it on his computer and would have seen it every day).

So here is the AITA part. I have deadlines to meet. Dates that I am being held to. I'm less than a year at this company (fresh out of college) and don't want to look bad to my bosses. I wanted to make sure I don't look incompetent or like I'm not doing my job well, but the only way I could see to do that was to completely throw this other guy under the bus.

Here is what went down. My project manager asked me about the slipping deadlines, and I explained my problems with this guy (I've made complaints to my boss about not getting the support I needed before). The difference this time is that I was documenting exactly what I asked the guy for and when, what the guy said he would do, the date of every time I've asked him for updates/reminded him, and every issue or problem that comes up. 

I didn't originally make the list to try and blame him or get him in trouble, mostly just so I could juggle what I needed him to do without forgetting anything (I document everything because I'm otherwise forgetful). But I told my boss about the document and that I had all the dates and requests I had made and that I could send it to him if he wanted to see. He did.

I sent it to my boss and now I've overheard my boss talking to his boss about how bad of a job this guy is doing. I've overheard my boss asking other people about problems with this guy. The guy has been called in to several meetings with management as well.

So AITA for sending my boss explicit proof of the new guy doing a poor job to excuse myself of blame. Is there a better way I could have handled this situation?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1435.0	252.0	0.0	0.0

About 3 years ago when my family and I moved to a new town we took a couple friend of ours out to dinner. I personally had the worst service of my life. 

There were 7 of us in the party. 4 adults and 3 kids. I was the DD so I was not drinking alcohol. It was August and hot outside. We sat on the patio and had drinks and food at a well known kinda chain in our area - this place is in the PNW and has maybe 10 locations. 

We are having a good time. I ask the waitress for a refill on my soda and water as I had drank both of my glasses while others had drank their beers and what not - my kids had small kid drinks. The waitress continues to refill the beers and kid drinks but never my water or soda. The drinkers had 3-4 beers each, the kids had 2 refills each. I got nothing. I asked at the same times as everyone else. I’m not a monster. It got to a point where I was drinking the 3 beer drinker’s waters because I had nothing. We got our food. Still no refills for me. We were there for and hour + and the waitress never refilled my glass. I was pissed and thirsty. I paid for dinner and left a measly 5% tip. In the bill was a comment card which I was rude on. The next day I called corporate and complained as well -  as I should have at least gotten as many refills as the kids. 

I hadn’t been back to this restaurant since that occasion since I never heard anything back on my complaint and I won’t spend my money where it’s not appreciated. But yesterday I had to go for a work meeting. Table of 10 - the waiter was very good about keeping our glasses full. Meeting guest commented about the great drink service - waiter says they had a horrible customer a few years ago who made a big huge stink about drink service and now corporate will send “spies” to make sure the staff refills drinks in the most timely manor with out having to be asked. Obviously I hear this and think I’m probably the horrible customer he’s talking about.

c6go2l	2019-06-28 06:17:14	tZipia	AITA for asking my wife to not get my name tattooed on her?	"We have been together for 15 years this December. Like all relationships we have had our fair share of ups and downs, but are still very much in love. She is my best friend and I’m hers. I couldn’t imagine my life without her. So why wouldn’t I want her to tattoo my name on her you might ask, well that’s a much longer story. 

&#x200B;

However, for as long as I can remember I’ve been dealing with depression, anxiety, social isolation, poor self esteem and loneliness. I didn’t know how to talk to people about my feelings or even truly understood what I was feeling. As I grow older, my anxiety and depression has continued to grow stronger. Not really understanding why, I really started to reflect heavily on my life, which is pretty amazing to be honest. I have a loving wife, amazing children, and a pretty good job. Still this monster continued to grow. After a lot of self reflecting and conversations with my wife, I’ve realized that I suffer from gender dysphoria. 

&#x200B;

This came as a shocking revelation, though there have always been signs. I’ve always enjoyed wearing female clothing. I’ve always felt more connected to females, and most of my friends are female. Even though I’m happily married to my wife, I’ve always been sexual attraction to men. These things have always lead to a feeling of shame. I can remember when I was around 5 years old, my parents caught me trying on some pantyhose. They had a very long conversation with me (yelling actually) about how wrong it was. Since then I’ve always had feelings of shame. Not allowing anyone to know that I enjoyed being girly, as it was shameful and unnatural, until I told my wife 8 years ago. Typing this it seems silly now, but I convinced (or fooled) myself that I was a normal guy. It was normal for men to want to be female (still to this point honestly don't understand how they couldn’t). I debate this with my wife, whom says most men don’t feel this way. It has been a long road to get where I am today and my wife has been 100% supportive of me.

&#x200B;

I plan on being married to her for the rest of my life. I can’t imagine ever being with anyone else. I don’t know if I will ever transition. However having my current name tattooed on her, would be a constant reminder to me of my male self. She stats it would be a good thing to remember who I was, but all I can think of is the fact there will always be people to remind me of who I was and who I never will truly be. I also feel like I’m corrupting her perception of who I am or in the future who I was. Which I’m not. I myself would see that as a total asshole move, and even told her she could get my name as her tattoo, but I still have a hard time coping with it. We’ve talked about her getting a symbol to represent me as a tattoo. I know that’s not what she truly wants, and with everything that is going on, I can’t help but feel that I’m being selfish.

I would have no problem with this, except for the fact that I have two toddler-aged cousins. I don’t necessarily dislike kids, although I do not want them myself. 

Unfortunately, when my cousins are at a family gathering, the attention tends to go towards them. I normally don’t care, since most family gatherings are Christmas, Thanksgiving, and the 4th of July. But this really just kind of made me upset because this party was for me after all. I understood that they would be there, and I was understanding until I saw what my parents were making. They were making hot dogs and burgers, two foods that they know full well I dislike, and won’t eat.

In the end I ended up walking around and making small talk with my older cousins who I’m pretty close too, but they like to focus on the toddlers as well.

After the party however, my Mom asked me why I was being so antisocial and quiet at the party and I told her it was because I felt ignored compared to my younger cousins. She said that I was being selfish, and that they are just babies(they are both three btw) so they want more attention, which I know. I also told her that they made food for my party that they knew I didn’t like.

c6gihn	2019-06-28 05:59:04	fredreeder	AITA for telling my wife that voice phone calls are an imposition?	"First off, my wife is old school.  She can operate the TV remote and the land line, but not much else.  She has a bottom-tier android phone that is fully capable of doing text, email, and other wonderful smart phone functions, but she refuses to use it for anything but voice.  Even so, she ""doesn't know how"" to even get her voice mail, never mind use text or email.

She is constantly phoning everyone to chit-chat with them about mundane things.  Myself in particular.  All the time.

Yesterday she got upset because she called my cell and the home phone land line and I didn't answer either one.  I was doing what I told her I would be doing, painting the fence.  It's not like you can drop everything to answer the phone when you have a paint can in one hand and a paint brush in the other.  But I did it anyway, and called her right back.  ""Why didn't you answer??!""  I explained the dilemma and she just didn't get it.

Today, I broke.  She called me (interrupting me from what I was doing, once again) to ask me to forward a photo she liked to one of her friends.  I dropped everything to dig up the photo and forward it to her friend.  Almost before I got done, she showed up at home.  Didn't even stick around with her friend to enjoy the photo.  I gave her the third degree about how rude it is, what an imposition it is, etc., to interrupt someone with a voice phone call about such a trivial matter, and then not even stick around to follow up on it.  

This is 2019, not 1990.  IMHO, unexpected voice calls are a rude imposition on others.  If you call someone by voice, it better damn well be important enough to have the recipient drop everything that they are doing to give you their immediate attention.

To me this is a foul in public however I just ignored it and put my earbuds in. 

After a while I made a phone call using my earbuds. Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.

I was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. 

She said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. 

I said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we wait for the plane and I will do the same. I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds.

My father said he would pay for my secondary education, but ended up changing his mind 2 months ago. For reference, that is almost unheard of in my family. He still expects me to call him every week since the child has to call the parents. Personally, I couldn't care less about talking to him for now since this is the second time he has done this.

For background, the first time was exactly like this one. He agreed to pay for studies and ended up changing his mind with no apparent reason. Without his financial support I had to move back home and break up with a girl I really liked.

The financial part is no burden to him.

c6gg61	2019-06-28 05:51:25		AITA for not being proud of my kid	"I’m going to try to be detailed but also keep it within the 3,000 character limit.

For some context, my spouse (A) and I have saved up for a college fund ever since our kids were born. Each of our kids get the same amount of money towards their education. So the kid in question (B) would not face debt. I will also keep this gender ambiguous. I may use they/their/they’re pronouns when describing one person.

B is 19 and will be 20 this year (they took a gap year).

Earlier this year, B finally figured out what they wanted to do. They want to go into physical therapy. But instead of becoming a physical therapist (PT), B wants to become a physical therapy assistant (PTA). That is just an associates degree. They start a PTA program this August as they have been accepted into one.

I’m disappointed. B has so much potential and I think they are underachieving. 

I even asked B if they are depressed or something, and they said no. They just took a while to figure out their career and they can join the workforce sooner, spend less time in school, spend more time with their patients, and it keeps their options open. They can go onto being a PT, but if they end up wanting a career switch 20 or 30 years down the line, it’ll be easier to do it. For the last point, I asked B if they really want to do PT then. B said that yes, they do, but they don’t know how they’ll feel about it 20-30 years from now.

I think B is just being lazy and being an underachiever. 

A, my spouse, is not happy with me and said at least B found a career and is working towards it. A also said that B has valid reasons to want to be a PTA instead of a PT.

But I think B is really wasting their potential. They could live more comfortably and wouldn’t even have to be in debt. B was also a straight A student all throughout high school and was enrolled with the local community college during high school. They even took 200 level courses in their freshman year! They could make an excellent PT and even had to have PT in high school due to sports injuries. I’m not sure why B is wasting their talent and potential.

c6gfg9	2019-06-28 05:49:01		AITA for evading weekend work as a freelancer?	"So I'm a freelance photographer by night, cubicle guy by day. Photography is my passion and ideally I'd like to work full-time as one at a newspaper, but finding a stable, decent paying job at a news org these days is tough. Two years ago I got a freelance position at a paper and i've been doing it to varying degrees of frequency. Some weeks I have about three assignments, some weeks I have none. It's more for the passion and building a portfolio than the money, at this point.

About three months ago new management came in and staff was trimmed down. The paper's staff is mostly freelancers, with one or two staff reporters and photographers. It was always like this, but now it's reduced to a skeleton crew instead of a decent amount of people- and that skeleton crew is mostly freelancers.

Because I work 40 hr weeks at my day job, and photo assignments take up a good bit of time, a while ago I came up with a rule that I don't work weekends. Part of work-life balance and whatnot. Editors have been trying to goad me into working a weekend but I always go away with a firm 'no'. If they want an excuse, I say I'm busy: I never really am, though.

Recently Ive been getting a feeling that their annoyance has been increasing, and eventually they'll say something, but I've always thought that a freelancer, by definition, makes their own hours. The pay does not justify working on a saturday and annoying my wife by not spending time with her, and in my opinion, they dug their own hole by having such a thin staff. If they want me to be on their beck and call then they can give me an offer of employment-but they won't.

On the other hand, I'm lying to them. I could easily do it, and the cash is measly but better than nothing. On top of that, I've proven myself to be one of the more dependable people with a good track record of quality work, and I feel like by evading weekend work that reputation is eroding. While they struggle to put a paper out, I'm sitting on my ass playing video games on the rationale that, again, personnel problems are not my problems.

So AITA?

TL;DR I don't wanna work on the weekends and lie sometimes to get out of working in an understaffed workplace, but I'm also a freelancer with a day job who has a life and I technically don't have to"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c6gf2u	2019-06-28 05:47:41	Starsandlillies	AITA for being upset with my(19f) cousin?(17f)	"A little backstory here: my cousin has been planning to go to college an hour away from our hometown. She asked me to move to the town her college is in so she won’t have to live in the dorms, and so her parents won’t have to worry about her being far away. I agreed because I’m in a vocational college and will be able to start my business there and possibly do pretty well (it’s a big college town with 4 colleges within miles of each other so plenty of college kids wanting beauty treatments). I’ve been seriously planning these last few months to uproot my life and potentially begin my first true business venture into the world. I’ve tried talking about this seriously with her for a while, but I keep getting 1 word replies. Finally today she sends me this long message about how I probably shouldn’t get “too attached” to the idea of moving to this city because she feels she’s “being led by her heart to other options”. I’ve been planning and budgeting everything out to be moving next summer and now I’m just stuck with plans I might not even need anymore. Mind you, we’ve been talking about this 1 course set plan for 2 years, and just now as things are getting serious she’s blowing me off. When I was venting to my relatives about this, they went off on me that she’s just a kid and I shouldn’t have been taking her so seriously and that i should’ve known better than to trust her. AITA for being annoyed with her? Should I have known better?


INFO (edit 1): 2 years ago I was 17 and she had had her parents help her convince me to moving to this city. So it wasn’t just us making these plans, her parents also had talks with me about how they were worried about her being far away alone and said it’d be a great opportunity for my business. (I already had planned to go to my vocational schools by then, I’m kinda a “you make a plan you stick to the plan” person)"	No A-holes here	0	0	20.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

"Okay so I live with my mom and she doesn't like the fact that I have a boyfriend, so is my dad but he accepted it when I refused to stop seeing him(important to know). We'll be moving to a new city next month and he and I are bummed about it but we're willing to give long distance a shot. So we're trying our best to cherish every moment we have together.

&#x200B;

I sometime sneak him inside our house when I'm home alone and we just hang around and watch movies and play and I sneak him out before mom comes home. Now, we have nosy neighbours and I know that they will rat me out to my mom if they see him so the thought of even sneaking him in and out just fills me with stress.

&#x200B;

I was home alone the other day and he asked if he could come over. I said no. He asked why and I just said I wanted to be alone. He got upset and started saying how I'll be gone soon and that it will probably be the last time he'll come over. I explained why I wanted to alone and the situation with neighbours. I said we could go out the following day since I had errands to run anyway and he began talking about how I'm always an hour or so late when we plan for a meet up. In my defense, it's because I always have to convince my mother that I'm meeting with my best friend and if I show her that I'm in a rush, she'll be suspicious and won't let me leave.

&#x200B;

In the end, I just told him that I'll be running my errands by myself and blocked him since I didn't wanna hear from him and I wouldn't want to say things I don't mean. I unblocked him after cooling off but apparently he blocked me back so \*shrug\*

I'll call my ""good friend"" Becca.

&#x200B;

Becca and I had a small conversation on Discord (which is the only connection I have with her) and at the end, she ended up blocking me and left our group chat. I don't want to go into much detail about what we were talking about as I don't want to embarrass her but basically, I wanted to talk to her as we haven't talked online for 2 weeks and she was reading her ""comics"" and she (what I thought she was jokingly saying) says that she wants ""**NO** interruptions"" and I jokingly say back is a ""no"" and right after log off as my wi-fi wasn't working well. An hour later I come back and I see that she got (again, I thought) slightly angry and left the group chat and when I try to add her back I learn she blocked me. 

&#x200B;

The next day (Last day of school) I try to talk like any other normal day and Becca completely ignores me and same with all of our mutual friends. Our mutual friends still kinda said things to me but not much. I'm completely confused, very upset and crying a little as I lost many friends and I was overwhelmed with emotions. But the whole time another good friend of mine was comforting me (I will call her Softie). Softie was good friends with Becca, almost best friends so when  Softie told me that Becca blocked her on Snapchat and kinda stopped talking to her I was a little shocked.

Turns out that Becca actually started hating Softie for some reasons that I do not know as the person who told me all of this (who I'll call Anisa and is best friends with Becca) didn't know. From what softie told me I'm almost positive that she did not know the reason why Becca started ignoring her which means Becca didn't bother telling her. 

&#x200B;

Hours later after all of my crying, I contact Anisa for more information. Turns out that Becca whole time thought I was controlling and our conversation on Discord pushed her over the edge and cut me out of her life. And again, I never knew. 

After I learned this, I apologized to all of me and Becca's mutual friends for being controlling.

They want to borrow my camera (Sony a7) to practice (since it is the type of camera they want to purchase). I said yes since I want to help them learn!

I know how rough planes, airports and cruises can be with expensive equipment. Since my friend has never dealt with lenses before I'm afriad they'll detach the lens from the body and let sand, dirt, or water in. 
I texted them back immediately telling them if it would be cool if they borrow my camera after their trip and practice then on.

The issue:

So sometimes my 7 year old just wont listen! She's a really smart, thoughtful kid, but it seems she really likes testing her boundaries lately. I can ask her to be more respectful of my parents (who help tremendously!!) or not to mess with some of my belongings, or things at her grandparents house, and she just completely disobeys me!! It's super frustrating but I try my hardest not to lose my temper and yell. I try and figure out what she was thinking but, its usually something like ""I thought it'd be fun"". Its been a drink spilled on a computer she's not supposed to touch, my daughter losing a bunch of cards from my wallet and painting over the few that I found around the house, taking tons of feathers out of our pillows and just generally leaving a mess. I can go on...

The typical consequences are her cleaning up any mess shes made herself and stuff like no tv, no dessert or an early bedtime. Our typical routine is a bedtime book at about 15 minutes of cuddling.

If my daughter is in trouble, she doesn't get a bedtime book and I'll lay down and with her while I'm tucking her in, give a hug and kiss and leave the room. Que the endless crying a wailing! She goes on and on about how she feels so thirsty, hungry, scared or lonely. She cries ""I want my mommy!"" Over and over and it makes me feel terrible!!

I generally feel torn as a parent. If I give in, which I have before, the same behavior continues even after the standard 15 minutes of cuddling, so I wonder if I should just leave her to fall alseep on her own, with just a kiss and hug and explanation to her that if she wants her regular routine, she has to listen to her elder family amd respect other peoples property, even though it takes forever and she cries herself to sleep.

On the other hand, it's sooo damn hard to hear her so upset!!!

Well, it ended up getting left there, and by the time we went back to look, it had already been taken by someone else. Now  Carl thinks I should pay him enough money to buy a new board full price. I think that he isn't taking enough responsibility for it because we went and left together, so he should have noticed his board was missing and not blamed it all on me.

So basically, I’m [19F] wondering if I’m being a crazy, clingy person or if my boyfriend [19M] is being... unnecessarily hard to communicate with? (idk)


 I wanna start this by saying no, I don’t demand instant replies to anything, and I totally get the feeling of just not wanting to reply, even if you like the person, even if you’re not busy. But this has been bothering me a little bit for... almost our whole relationship (almost 3 years). I’ll text and ask, for example, what time he wants to get together the next day. And I’ll wait for like 3-4 hours sometimes for a response. Which sometimes I’m alright with, but if it’s midnight and I’m tired and want to know if I have to set an alarm to be able to get up in time to see him tomorrow, it’s  a bit frustrating. The other compounding issue is that during these times when he isn’t replying, I see him online (not stalking, just seeing that he’s liked things on Instagram that were posted more recently than I sent the text in the “liked by” thing, or seeing that he’s online on steam when I go on myself, or sometimes he’ll even respond in a group text but not to me). Being an anxious person, if I’m already having a bad day, my mind jumps around to all of the fun “wow he cares about all this other stuff more than me” conclusions, which I do realize is my own fault and not his, but I know that if he was like me (and he knows I’m anxious) I’d try to make sure I wasn’t causing any of that. But I know that this part about anxiety isn’t really his fault, it’s just a little additional frustration.


I have asked him before if there’s a reason why, and he claims not, and says sorry and he won’t do it again.... and then he does. But maybe it isn’t really that bad and I’m being an asshole for asking that he reply soon?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

And on top of that, she's never met him in person. She met him in Facebook or Twitter.

When she told me about him, they'd been dating for three months. I tried to convince her to break up with him, but she refused. I then tried to ignore the situation and not be involved, but she became less careful with me because I knew and talked to him in front of me over Skype or whatever.

All of the people at school who I've asked say that they feel uncomfortable about Emma's boyfriend. When I asked them what I should do, they suggested to tell my parents. But, when I asked them what they would do if it were their siblings, they didn't answer the question. 

Emma has lied to my parents and I've had to lie for her too. She acts like it's not a big deal for me to lie, but it is. I don't want to betray the trust of my family, but I also feel like I'd lose her forever if I didn't. Emma and I have had a rocky relationship for the past two years. I feel like a terrible sister.

It’s a very fancy sort of wedding and for months while she said we had designated colours/styles for saris during the ceremony, reception was more or less up to us. Recently (3 months until wedding), she said she would like if at least there could be some coordination between the outfits for the bride/groom parties to fit within her colour scheme. No problem. My BF (best man) went out and bought his suit with her approval (black) so that he could pair his tie with whatever colour I picked within the theme. 
Cue to today (1ish month b4 the wedding), where I get a message saying that she doesn’t have time to explain why but I will HAVE to wear a black dress to the reception to match my bf’s suit. I work retail and have a family wedding to go to 2 weeks after. Buying 2 dresses is out of the question and black is not appropriate for the other wedding. 
When I questioned the reasoning behind the sudden change and explained my situation she said she “doesn’t think she needs to explain herself to me”, and that her “6k photography needs to fit with her vision”. 

I’m very confused as I’m the only one in the bridal party being asked to wear black (everyone else is wearing one of the wedding colours). I’ve always been told wearing a black dress to a wedding is a faux pas and everyone I talk to seems to think it’s weird.

I had made a trip to my old place to pick up some things. A 2 hour round trip, its summer where I live, so it's a long day. But I just got a few boxes nothing heavy. I get back to my parents and unload my car. I'm carrying the last box upstairs and all thays left is my keyboard. My mom comes and asks to help, shes been working in her office until this point. I say no thanks, I'm almost done, please dont bring up the keyboard.
She is now angry saying I never let her help with anything and that not everything is about me and how I want it. The truth is I dont let anyone help. She thinks I just dont let her help because it's her. but I let everyone else which isnt the case.
I dont like owing people, especially her. She holds it over my head instead of it being a nice thing. Later she'll come to me saying oh I helped you with that so you owe me now. And frankly I was pretty much done and my keyboard was expensive and I didnt want something to happen to it so I didnt want her carring it up the stairs. 
For anyone to help me they have to do it without telling me. (I've explained this several times in the past, but anyway not the point). I try to explain I want it done a certain way and I'd rather just do it. She responds by saying that I'm always like this. To which I say, and I quote, ""mom I haven't lived with you in 4 years, you have no idea what I'm like"". I then bring my keyboard to my room.
Later I go apologize try to explain why I didnt want help again, and ask her if she wants dinner. She responds with do whatever you want I'm not eating. So im like okay, and I go and cook dinner for the rest of the family. She then comes down to eat and proceeds to complain about dinner. I finish eating and leave to calm down and that's basically the end of that. 

Edit: forgot to add I also had a therapy appointment that day, it was really emotionally draining as I hadn't gone in like a month. So my day was physically and emotionally tiring. And my mom was aware of this.

c6g3vx	2019-06-28 05:12:29	CallMe-LemondBishop	AITA for constantly confronting my best friend’s toxic girlfriend?	"TLDR my best friend’s (20M) girlfriend (20F) is emotionally abusive towards him around me (20M) and I can’t stand it and get into arguments with her over it while defending him, possibly creating more issues for him to deal with in his relationship. 

My best friend, his girlfriend, and I all went to high school together and they’ve been dating for a while. She is extremely emotionally abusive and manipulative towards him. For example, she insults him about his hobbies and demands his constant attention - during a guys night she’ll constantly call and text him and get mad at him for not spending time with her, even though they’re together a majority of the time. She picks fights with him over the smallest things and also guilts him into paying for all her dinners and Ubers. She has ruined trips and hangouts because of this behavior and I would rather not see her but she comes as a package deal with my best friend and I don’t want to give up on my friendship with him. 

Frankly, I feel that I am in my right to defend my friend and don’t feel that I am an asshole for doing so. What I feel like I might be doing wrong is the frequency with which I get into arguments with her and potentially putting my best friend in a hard spot. For example, last week the three of us got dinner and she was back on her usual bullshit so I got into an argument with her, she ran out of the restaurant and my best friend ran out after her. I decided to leave afterwards and felt bad that I created a mess that he had to deal with. Apparently she also has been picking fights with him over the fact that when I argue with her he doesn’t come to her defense. 

I have talked with him about this multiple times in private, he agrees that her behavior is bad but doesn’t want to give up on her. I can’t just step aside and watch her emotionally abuse him but I don’t know if I’m going about it the right way. So reddit, AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Bethany was a good friend of my girlfriends for a long time. Bethany and my girlfriend were also good friends with another girl, Amanda, who went years back.

Amanda and Bethany had a huge falling out over something pretty seriously bad that Bethany did. Obviously, my girlfriend doesn’t want to talk to Bethany anymore after this and tells me that she doesn’t want me to talk to her either. We disagree here, as I say their problems are none of my business but I digress.

Whenever I would see Bethany in school (high school) she would say hello to me and I would say hello back, and I thought nothing of it.

Then one day I was with my girlfriend walking through the halls and Bethany says hi to me and I say hi back. My girlfriend is visibly angry at me for saying hi to her and tells me this, we begin to fight as I tell her that even though I think Bethany did do wrong, I still think that it doesn’t involve me and that I should still be polite.

My girlfriend believes its about principles and that I’m in the wrong.

"To explain, me and my girlfriend live in the same city have to commute to work via train one city over. Usually, I take the train at a certain time and save her a seat when she gets on at the next stop. If I miss the train for whatever reason we take the next one which comes in another 10-12 minutes. 

One day, her friend (we'll call C) comes in the morning since she has a morning shift that day. So C and my girlfriend are dropped off at the station by C's Dad in order to take the first train. That day, I miss the first train and ask my girlfriend if they could wait for the next one. I'm told they can't because C would be late for work if they waited for me on the next one. I think, ""Alright, that's cool I don't want to make anyone late.""

After I get off, my girlfriend texts me ""We're waiting for you at the food court"" (The main station has an underground food court). I wonder why my girlfriend said ""we"" but I make my way to the food court anyway. I see my girlfriend and C waiting for C's order and immediately I just feel lied to.

Me and my girlfriend walk away and she asks why it seems like I'm upset. I explain that if you had time to get a ""second"" breakfast why it was so important to not wait for me, and she gets upset at me and says I was being inconsiderate of C and selfish.

c6fxn2	2019-06-28 04:53:38		AITA for pressuring my friends?	"Me: Male 31 

Roommate A is my best friend from high school. Gay

Roommate B is his best friend from college. Female, my longterm fuckbuddy

The problems developed recently, within the past several months, when I started recognizing and understanding how my personal feelings for roommate B had evolved. I realized that I had genuine romantic feelings for her, but felt certain she would not be interested in a relationship. Despite that, I felt that if I continued to keep these feelings to myself it would be disingenuous to her, be very bad for my self-esteem, and just cause a general distraction to the both of us. The more pressing issue was that I knew everyone could already tell I had feelings for her, I was just the last to accept it. At this point I wanted to address the elephant in the room.

For months leading up to the recent events I was continually putting subtle pressure on her that was moving us in a romantic direction (not intentionally). Things like talk about my relationship history. I asked her to be my date to a wedding I was going to. She initially accepted before backing out later. The final straw was when I just outright told her I had a crush on her. That started a two-month streak of her not speaking to me. And then she started bringing her dates home. 

The tricky part is with roommate A. In the two months that elapsed since roommate B stopped speaking to me, I've been depressed. I have often gone to him to express my frustration and I think it put pressure on him to be in the middle of a situation he has said he doesn't want to be involved in. I fully appreciate that and don't want to involve him, but it's been difficult for me to not feel like he is condoning roommate B's treatment of me by continuing to be her friend and make plans with her while distancing himself from me because I've been a selfish and depressed jerk.

The day before my birthday after a couple of days of what felt like my roommates avoiding me and over the course of an afternoon I got liquored up on bourbon, got in a fight and threw remaining said bottle of bourbon against a wall. After that I drove drunk to a friend's house where roommate A followed me, scared out of his mind I was gonna get in a wreck. I then said something so personal to him that it caused him to run home in tears and he hasn't spoken to me since.

The question isn't if I am an asshole, but am I the only asshole? I've realized how selfish I've been in putting my own emotions ahead of the peace and stability of our house and I know how I have put roommate A in an awkward situation. But for the past 2 months I've had to endure someone I live with pretending I'm not in the room and for the past 2 weeks the rest of the house has joined her. Over the past week I finally got a job, passed a couple classes, and had a birthday. This should've been one of the best weeks I've had in years, but my best friend didn't speak to me on my birthday."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6fxjz	2019-06-28 04:53:24	lastdollardisco	AITA for asking people to turn their phone off if they hit me up for some phone charging time?	"A little context, I work in a bar that has live bands 7/365. It's a very beautiful place so lots of people take pictures, snaps, 'gramming every facet of their night out. Because of this people always run out of battery and ask if my venue has a charger. We're a small family owned bar so we don't have excess novelties such as charging stations and the like. If someone comes up and asks to charge their phone if we can accommodate it we always do. Since these people in need will be parted from their phones I always ask that they turn it off. 

For me, it's utilising an opportunity to charge their phone for a bit so they can continue on their merry way. It also gives someone else a chance who are in the same predicament to get zappy with our electric sockets. Lately I've been getting incredulous looks at my request. I even say no to people putting it on aeroplane mode. I thought that was being a bit anal though. I just feel like it's totally unnecessary to have your phone running all these apps you wouldn't be using whilst it was charging. 

Are they choosy beggars?

c6fxem	2019-06-28 04:52:59	karasnady	AITA Told my friend to not hang with us	"a little backstory. i was in the 1st year of highschool and we had a transfer student that came from another country but was born here. so she was a bit withdrawn when she came here and i honestly never cared about new comers. i was pretty close with my group of friends and didn't need new friends. and it looked like we all agreed on that . ( we were group of 7 friends. 3 of us were interested in shows,anime,games and stuff like that . the other 4 liked stuff like that but weren't really into it like the other 3 . i was from those 3 with two friends . i will be referring to my other 2 friends with F1, F2). 

so she came up to F1 and showed him that she was interested in anime too.and F1 overreacted hugely.i was like cool/meh

so she starts hangs with us a lot. i mean everywhere and all the time in school. without making any other friends, which i knew was bad cause the girls in our class can be a bunch of bitches, and that i was well aware off, so they started annoying her and reached the point of bullying cause she was only friends with us and not any other girls in class. which i  understand the way they were thinking didn't agree with them but understood where they are coming from, but that was something she kinda ignored, and i was fine with it if she was , but here comes the another problem. my group of friends started not liking her to hang out with us and long story short, they started being rude to her (ignoring her running away from her, being rude when talking to her ) and this is where it all went downhill, my other two friends F1 and F2 started doing the same, and i didn't understood why they did that Tbh and for me i didn't mind her hanging out with us. she was alright for me, so now she is getting bullied by other girls for being friends with only us , and while my group of friends were going to eventually start bullying too or so i thought at the time, and i actually didn't like that , i didn't want her to have her highschool life turn into hell while i stood still, so in my group of friends when something needed to be done or said, i mostly did it,sadly, but this time i didn't want to,untill the final days of highschool,i went up to her and told her to stop hanging with us , didn't explain my reasoning behind it i decided to look like the asshole because it would better for everyone, while it actually kinda hurt me to do that to her but i thought that's for the best, and she told me ok and stopped hanging with us , the reason i did that in the final days of school , is the fact i was moving to another school, and i knew if i didn't act thing would get 10 times worse when i am not here next year cause i kinda kept my friends from going all bully mode on her,fastforward year and a half. i talked to F2 which i kept contact with him cause he is my best friend, so i asked him how was she doing and he told me she made goodfriends in school and they stopped picking up on her, so AITA ?"

c6fxbe	2019-06-28 04:52:41	Probablytheassh0le	AITA for refusing to clean other peoples litter any longer?	"I have lived in my condo complex for 10 months now. It is a nice area, however there is a university quite close so majority of occupants are now university students, and some of them are quite messy. 

I live on the ground floor, with my “front” door leading into the hallway, and the back door leading into the ground floor balcony that leads into the back courtyard. Not long after moving here, I noticed an issue with litter. The litter always ends up on my balcony, and I’m not sure if it’s someone above me or beside me, but anyways litter happens on a near daily basis. 

For 10 months I had always just grabbed any litter (usually Pepsi cans, wrappers, etc) and tossed it away or recycled it. However, after becoming overly frustrated with constantly dealing with someone else’s trash, when I walk my dog in the morning and night, if there is any litter on my balcony I now kick it out of my balcony into the courtyard. Possibly petty, but honestly I’m just really sick of dealing with other people’s litter. 

This evening, a well intentioned girl saw me kick a Coca Cola can away from my balcony and into the courtyard. She understandably thought it was mine, so she asked me if I was planning on picking it up. I let her know that it’s not my garbage, and no I don’t plan on picking it up as I’ve cleaned someone else’s litter for 10 months and that I’m honestly tired of doing it.

She left it at that, and went on her way. As did I. Nobody actually called me an asshole here, but I can’t decide if I’m a petty grump for refusing to deal with a little garbage, or if I’m in the right here. 

For some extra info I should add that two things:

1) I have tried to convince condo management to put a garbage in the courtyard to no avail. 

2) I have put a garbage can outside my balcony in hopes that people would just put their garbage in there. I wouldn’t mind tossing a full bag of garbage once a week, what grosses me out is actually touching someone else’s garbage. It didn’t resolve the issue and my garbage can was stolen after a few nights (going to assume positive intent on that one and figure that someone thought I put it out there for free).

"So this happened at about 830ish while I was at work on my break. I checked my phone and see a message from my roommate asking if I can give her roommate a ride home and that she already told him I would since I'm giving her a ride (wtf???).

Background time: my roommate doesn't drive and sometimes I give her a ride home when she has a late shift and buses aren't running.

Back to the story: I have never once met this coworker and this is the first time I've heard of his existence. I told her that I didn't really appreciate that she offered without asking me first. Then I asked where he lives. Opposite side of town from us; technically a different town altogether. All in all it'd be another 30 minutes of driving. Fuck that. I could ask for gas money but that's not really the issue. Don't know him, not comfortable with that, also lives very far away.

I was just about done working a double shift and I was not liking the idea of having to chauffeur for someone who aparantly can't plan ahead. And yes, I checked this fact. This coworker did nothing to plan for the fact that they did not have a ride/bus; they get the schedule a week at a time.

My roommate begins guilt tripping me. Saying if I don't give him a ride he has to walk for an hour in the rain. Honestly, that gets a whopping boo-fucking-hoo from me. And it wasn't even raining. It just might have rained.

So she's pissed at me. I ask if he's asked other co-workers. Aparantly not. I'm the first person he goes to?? Someone he doesn't know know , let alone even work with? What. What. That's not how... No. Just. No. So she gets him to ask around and evidently a coworker there lives near him and can give him a ride. But nevertheless...I wouldn't have given him a ride.

My kids and their cousins all dislike Dave because he is a jerk.

I could go on and on with case after case, but the one event that fed me up was last the 4th of July. On top of making both of my daughters cry, he stole my son's Pokemon cards.  

There were a few cards that in sum were worth over one thousand dollars. My son was 13 at the time and was out of the Pokemon phase, and so we didn't realize they were gone. Nine months went by before we realized.  The story of how/why I know is lengthy, but I know he took them and by the time I realized it was too late to address it. 

The way I see it, he stole over 1k from my son and I will not have him over to my house. The problem is he is back in town and my house is the place for the 4th. Our families all come over for a picnic and I don't want that fucker over.  My wife, on the other, is stuck in the middle.

I was doing research on what are the correct living conditions for them. Fast forward two months my sister,mom, and dad, take me to get a corn snake. They had two in stock and I decided to get the slightly bigger one. Out of thin air my sister decided she wanted one, I told her that was not a good idea and you need to learn more about them. My parents said “it’s fine it’s not like she’s gonna kill it.” Fast forward 4 weeks and i found out my sister has been neglecting it. I mean she still feeds it but she has no idea what to do. I tell her she has to handle it or else it will become defensive and try to bite if u try to hold it because it’s fairly young. So she says FiNe and goes to handle it. Low and behold it ducking bites her. Now my parents are forcing me to take care of both snakes and to handle both and I tell them “I told her not to get it, it’s not my problem, I don’t want to get bitten.” But they are still making me do it. I was only prepared to care for one calm snake, not one calm snake and another that tries to kill me when I pick it up. AITA?

SO my girlfriend and I enjoy plants and one day about a month ago I was talking with her about Venus fly traps and Carnivorous plants and how i would like to get one. In the next sentence I expressed how as much as I would like one I wouldn't be able to care for it or have a good spot for it in my room. With that about a month goes by and here we are she tells me that she had bought me a present. For more context I am the person who expresses to everyone that I don't really like receiving presents because I don't want others to waste their money on me especially on something I don't want or don't need. So I ask her what is it and she tells me excitedly that shes gotten me a Venus fly trap and here's the question.

Am I the asshole for getting upset that she bought me something I expressly told her I did not have the ability or space to take care of. I obviously thanked her for it anyway because I am happy that she thinks about me when she is out doing her own thing, but is my frustration justified because she always does the opposite of what I ask?

Also to add more context shes the kind of person who even though I ask her not to do things does them anyway and doesn't understand why I get Frustrated.

c6furz	2019-06-28 04:44:27	revelved	WIBTA if I stop making music with my friend?	"So recently I’ve been realizing my dream of becoming a musician by writing and producing my own music. While I do most of my work alone, I have one friend (we’ll call her B) who I work with pretty closely, to the point where we have a song that’s about 55-45 me and her. Us making music is about the only time we interact as friends, but we’re on good terms.

While I do want to keep making music with her and I enjoy it, the problem arises in our social circles. We met through my ex while we were still dating, and she and my ex are both a part of an *extremely* tight friend group, to the point where they have a name for this group and tell one another everything. I dated my ex, met this group and B, and then we split up. I became friends with another member of the group and became close to them, to the point where they considered me a member of their group, and then got back with my ex, but again only after becoming friends with them first, and always valued their friendship first. They were the ones that showed me that making music was possible, and we had plans to all make music together. 

When we broke up again, they went back on their statements that we would be friends “even if you broke up”, treated me pretty poorly and basically forgot about me, save for B. But now every time I see her I can only think about them, and knowing she still actively is around people who treated me like garbage and sharing personal projects with them makes me uncomfortable. So WIBTA if I stop working with her because of this?

c6fu8y	2019-06-28 04:42:58		AITA for pressuring my friends?	"Me: Male 31 

Roommate A is my best friend from high school. Gay

Roommate B is his best friend from college. Female, my longterm fuckbuddy

The problems developed recently, within the past several months, when I started recognizing and understanding how my personal feelings for roommate B had evolved. I realized that I had genuine romantic feelings for her, but felt certain she would not be interested in a relationship. Despite that, I felt that if I continued to keep these feelings to myself it would be disingenuous to her, be very bad for my self-esteem, and just cause a general distraction to the both of us. The more pressing issue was that I knew everyone could already tell I had feelings for her, I was just the last to accept it. At this point I wanted to address the elephant in the room.

For months leading up to the recent events I was continually putting subtle pressure on her that was moving us in a romantic direction (not intentionally). Things like talk about my relationship history. I asked her to be my date to a wedding I was going to. She initially accepted before backing out later. The final straw was when I just outright told her I had a crush on her. That started a two-month streak of her not speaking to me. And then she started bringing her dates home. 

The tricky part is with roommate A. In the two months that elapsed since roommate B stopped speaking to me, I've been depressed. I have often gone to him to express my frustration and I think it put pressure on him to be in the middle of a situation he has said he doesn't want to be involved in. I fully appreciate that and don't want to involve him, but it's been difficult for me to not feel like he is condoning roommate B's treatment of me by continuing to be her friend and make plans with her while distancing himself from me because I've been a selfish and depressed jerk.

The day before my birthday after a couple of days of what felt like my roommates avoiding me and over the course of an afternoon I got liquored up on bourbon, got in a fight and threw remaining said bottle of bourbon against a wall. After that I drove drunk to a friend's house where roommate A followed me, scared out of his mind I was gonna get in a wreck. I then said something so personal to him that it caused him to run home in tears and he hasn't spoken to me since.

The question isn't if I am an asshole, but am I the only asshole? I've realized how selfish I've been in putting my own emotions ahead of the peace and stability of our house and I know how I have put roommate A in an awkward situation. But for the past 2 months I've had to endure someone I live with pretending I'm not in the room and for the past 2 weeks the rest of the house has joined her. Over the past week I finally got a job, passed a couple classes, and had a birthday. This should've been one of the best weeks I've had in years, but my best friend didn't speak to me on my birthday."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6fttw	2019-06-28 04:41:40	theterrorthatflaps	AITA for getting super choked at my family for not coming to my store opening and still not showing up months later?	"So.. I know I'm an emotional person as a rule, but I like to think I have become sophisticated in my aging approach.  But please, let me know if AITA here:

In short, my husband and I opened a store that is the first of it's kind in the Province/Country, we had been waiting months to open, and we were super proud of our accomplishment.  It has never been easy for me to ask for things of emotional importance from family - I would often work hard to not be a burden, or trip over myself for some of their attention - I was a bit of work in my youthful days, I suppose I felt indebted and all-in-all their approval has been very important to me.

Don't get me wrong, I've definitely gotten varrying levels of telephone support from family - and pops was a full on consultant through the endeavour - I am not terribly hard up on emotional support with my hubby as he is amazing, I'm mostly just a bit abandoned feeling as I live away from my family and they don't exactly include me (break the weekly phone dates I try to make, forget the tablets so I can facetime and be part of the event, maybe they are silly ideas on my part anyways), but I know they try in their own way (include me on the conversations they have of stuff they're going to do without me, and I AM invited).. you know ""woe is me"" stuff.

So yeah, of course I really wanted them there for the opening - or maybe the grand opening a few weeks later - or maybe even when they could a month after that.. they live a 5-6 hour drive away, and I not only could they stay with us, there are many affordable accommodations about. I definitely communicated this through flat out asking some, trying to come up with dates with others, and then full on passive-aggressive/agressive-agressive commentary.

We're 3 months in and still nothing, each day that passed made me feel worse, not even the google reviews I asked for.. nothing... and I totally  broke - I communicated my devastation, how I felt that I am not getting the support I essentially expected from family.  I was probably a total butthole about it in retrospect - using terms like never and always... 

And they totally don't get where I am coming from - like at all - they literally don't see what the big deal is, will come when they can - and think that my expectations are unrealistic... but still won't set a date or a plan.. and I have literally seen all of them go on a vacation in the time we have been open.  These people have flex schedules or are retired.. but maybe vacations just throw your life for a loop?

I guess.. I guess I am just heart broken and want to stop crying.. or maybe just stop putting my value on whether or not my family is prioritising my hard work and accomplishments.. 

So anyways AITA for getting super choked at my family or what?  Help me suck it up."	No A-holes here	0	0	249.0	19.0	0.0	0.0
c6fshd	2019-06-28 04:37:37		AITA for taking stray cat to shelter	"About 3 months ago, a literally starving stray cat showed up. I started feeding her and giving her water. I have a cat, After a month of this, weirdo next door neighbor claims that she is his cat that he has been using to sell kittens. I gave the cat back physically and ½ hour later she is back. I keep feeding her, put out a little cardboard house for her. It becomes obvious she is pregnant. I worry this cat will contribute more to stray feral cat problem in our neighborhood and she will continue to live shitty life in servitude to “owner” who sells free kittens for money. 

Bleeding heart that I am, I bring her indoors because I think she might give birth soon. Roommate is cool because he likes her and says neighbor is ahole. I pay for all supplies. Roommate lives upstairs and rarely has contact with her, but he likes her a lot. Suddenly he starts making noises about neighbor bringing a lawsuit against HIM and that it’s conflict of interest because neighbor is student at college he contracts at. I told him I would take all responsibility and it’s been 2 months of care without further contact from neighbor. 

I tell roommate plan of letting cat give birth and taking everyone to humane society (I am flying by seat of my pants here). I have no intention of keeping her or babies. I again claim total responsibility and agree he ""knows nothing"". He says he is cool as long as his name is not involved and there is no way to trace anything back to him. I think I am doing my part, reliving burden on shelter, providing loving home for abused kitty. I let people at work know I have pregnant cat and people state they want a kittens. Keep roommate informed.

Tonight we suddenly had blowout and he says it’s not ""our"" place to decide the cat's fate. He says put her outside and call animal control. I ask what difference is between taking responsibility and finding homes for kittens and spaying the cat before releasing her back in her neighborhood versus calling animal control is, and he gets hostile. He claims that neighbor will sue (?!) and it's a conflict of interest for his job. He uses the words ""me"" and ""I"" a LOT and when I call him on this stuff he tells me to lower my voice and calm down. I tell him that I will take the pregnant cat to the shelter tomorrow and he pulls the old, ""well that's on YOU ThrenodyT"" shit.

I pay for everything for the extra cat. I pay 2/3 of the house rent. I can find homes for kittens or get them to the shelter along with mom, but that's ""not my decision to make morally"" apparently. I feel ill and shitty. I plan on dropping pregnant mom off tomorrow at the humane society, but I feel like shit."	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So here’s the story..  about 9 years ago my mom stops by my house when I lived close to my parents . She had a letter with her she wanted me to read . Come to find out I had a sister that my mom had given up for adoption. My mom grew up in Germany after the war ( she was born before the war) . She met my father while he was serving in Germany but he left and told her he would be back for her so a year later he returned  and they dated and got married during the time he was gone she had my oldest brother (everyone knew about him) . Ok now it’s time to back up before she met my dad she had my oldest sister who was adopted my a military family and they moved back to the states hence the letter and her finding  my parents. My parents visited her after they talked. She came up to visit and we really didn’t hit it off to good. 5 years ago my mom past away and she came up for the funeral her and my other sister are close I’m not close to my real sister because she started some shit with my wife . After my mom passed away some rumblings began to come out from my cousin in Germany about another brother who was given up for adoption. So back to today and the text from my brother he tells me there is another my 2 sisters did the dna testing and he came up a match as a brother. I’m in my 50’s and I really don’t feel like I care.

I (16f) have been talking to (not “dating”)  this guy (17m) for about 6 months now. But i’ve known him for a very long time. There’s been a lot of flirting & things from both sides, & we’ve shared our feelings with each other, so obviously we both really like each other. Now, i know you’re probably thinking that this is just a shallow problem & we’re arguing over some minor thing like him looking at another girl’s ass. Well, it’s not that simple. Or at least i don’t think it is. 

He is a drug addict. No, not weed. It’s opiates. Pain killers. & he has seriously, legitimately considered heroin. He thinks that this will help him get over his depression, & i have tried explaining to him that this will not help him, but he just ignores me. I know i can’t fix this problem, so i’m done. I’ve given him all the advice i can, but he isn’t following it. 

All he really talks about is how much he hates life & wants to die. He is a miserable person. Although i haven’t said it, I love him. Not even in a relationship way anymore. Just in a close friend way. I don’t want him to feel like this, but i can’t help anymore. I’ve tried my best. & he’s also on medication & seeing a therapist. 

Not to mention that i feel like i’m being manipulated or used at times. He always says shit like i’m such a “confidence boost” for him. & that he knows i’ll be the one to help him “get over his drug addiction.” I know it’s manipulative, but i’ve never called him out on that. 

He also constantly talks about his ex, but that’s besides the point & so minor here. 

Now, we’re both homeschooled, so most of our relationship is over text. But, we live in the same town & we see each other as much as possible, just not as much as a typical high school couple would. 

I’m about done with him & he knows how I feel, as i’ve told him multiple times. He just keeps doing the same old shit. I don’t feel like explaining my feelings to him anymore, & i just want to drop it & “ghost” him. I mean I have him left on read right now. 

& everyone around me is begging me not to talk to him again. My best friend, my mom, my dad, & especially my sister. 

My only dilemma is FEELING like the asshole for leaving him at one of the lowest points in his life.

c6fnwv	2019-06-28 04:24:03		AITA for not letting wife put breastmilk on my sunburn	Fairly self explanatory but just got in a fight with my wife, the love of my life, because I didn't want her to put her breastmilk on my sunburn. I got way to much sun and asked her to put aloe vera on it. We have a 8 week old perfect little girl and my wife is on all kinds of mommy forums. in one of the forums she was told breastmilk will heal my sunburn so she said she wanted to put it on my burn instead of aloe. I refused and asked that she just put the aloe on. she started getting mad and insistent and when I still refused she then accused me of being against breastmilk. I explained to her I am very pro breastmilk and not only that but I am so very proud of her for breastfeeding our little girl. it's honestly impressive and I do not know how she does it because it's an exhausting task.  I just do not want her putting the milk on me. I am not comfortable with it because I want a scientifically backed remedy not something a lot of moms believe in. so am I the asshole for not wanting her to put her breastmilk all over my back and chest? If I am the asshole then I will reconsider this. also I am upset I upset her I just am in a lot of pain, the burn is past red and almost purple and looks like it will blister and want to do something that may help not just be used as a trial.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c6fk6p	2019-06-28 04:13:31	coyjewishpartygirl	WIBTA if I keep my ex coworkers tips?	I started a new job a little over a month ago, during a time when this restaurant really needed more staff so they kinda did a mass hiring. I got on well with another waitress, let’s call her L, and we hung out one time outside of work before she unfortunately got fired (it’s a very fast paced environment and she just wasn’t a fast paced person.) We texted a few times every once in a while after that but not much until one day during the week she invited me to a party she was having that coming Saturday. I said I’d go and that was that, fast forward to Saturday during the day my manager and I are talking about our weekends and I mention that I’m going to L’s house tonight. My manager says great you can drop off the last of her cash tips she earned before she stopped working here, and gives me $50 with L’s name on a paper on it. So that night when I got back from work I texted L to make sure she was still having people over. She never answered me and I just fell asleep. The next morning she apologized for not answering and said she forgot she told me to come over and never really organized the party and ended up just going away for the weekend. I told her it was fine but we should get together soon and told her I have the last of her tips to give to her. I asked about her availability the coming week and she said she’d get back to me but never did. It’s now the end of the week, WIBTA if I just pocketed the money?

"Edit 4,284: Hey everyone, /u/ProperYam gave some GREAT advice on talking with my friend about preserving the surprises my girl has worked hard on planning including wrapping the gifts and not discussing anything directly party related that I shouldn't know about. I appreciate the insight from everyone and hope y'all can tell my main concern here is maintaining the element of total surprise that my daughter is going for when planning this, since every other aspects of our lives I'm the one who plans and pulls them off. I edited the post to remove some of the things that aren't really essential to the topic at hand, as I can be rather...wordy on occasion.


---


Edit: y'all I'm not mad at her. She didn't realize what she was doing. Its that I'm afraid she will continue to mention things my daughter is doing to try and surprise me (as some of the gifts my daughter overheard her mention were apparently things that she had gotten for her baby brother and wanted to be a surprise). My daughter, being an emotional teenager, was upset that her surprise was spoiled and that the large box she rushed to get wrapped so I wouldn't see was spoiled by someone who didn't have the tact to not read out gifts before the party. I just am weary of talking to her this next week in case she slips and says something again and hurts my kid.

-*Original Story*-

*TL;DR: Friend reads out the purchased items on my baby shower registry, even though I distinctly stated I didn't want to know what my gifts were before unwrapping them. Daughter, planning party, was very hurt that surprises were ruined.*

Today I was talking to a friend who asked me what I needed for my baby shower next week. I told her I haven't looked at my registry because I'm waiting til after the shower til I see what I get. This is important. So I told her diapers, wipes, and onesies, and we discussed cloth vs disposable 

She then goes ""well someone already got you the bassinet you wanted"" and tried to keep listing things that were shown as purchased. WTF???

I interrupted her and told her ""well I haven't looked because I didn't want to know until the shower.""

And she goes ""my bad, I didn't know."" 

Wtf? I just said I didn't want to know. And....Isn't that the point of a baby shower? To be surprised? I wonder what thought process led to her deciding to spoil the surprise of what I'd gotten, a full week before my shower? I don't necessarily think she revealed the gifts to spite me for me not asking her to plan my shower. I just think she wasn't paying any attention to what I was saying. She generally means well but ..doesn't think.

.....

Previously, she seemed upset that I didn't ask her to plan my shower, when I didn't actually ask ANYONE. The first person to sign on was my 13 yo daughter who asked my permission to plan it, then enlisted the help of others in my life. Appropriately, etiquette-wise, I haven't been involved in my own shower at all. The entire thing is a surprise to me, as it should be. I don't even know the theme. I don't want to know until the shower what I'm getting. This is daughter's party for Mama so I'm letting her run with it. I don't care; as long as my daughter is happy, I'll be happy. 

I'm not sure if I have decided I'm not talking to her til after the shower lest she ruin something else on my registry.

---

So I (28 M) live let my sister (26 F) live with me in my small apartment.  She is unemployed and has never really held a serious job and has never graduated high school.  I take care of her since our parents wouldn't let her live with them anymore.  So she came to me one day and has been living with me for the past 5 years now.  I pay for everything including the internet, electricity, food and building maintenance.

All her time is spent either on her computer (which I'm using a throwaway because I don't know if she goes here) or on her PS4.  Usually her day consists of waking up late after I leave for work and then messing around until I get home and have to prepare dinner for her.  Sometimes in the middle of the day she orders pizzas using money she took from my wallet while I wasn't around.  Occasionally she's used a credit card that I keep around for emergencies to buy micro transactions for some dumb mobile game she's playing or to buy some anime nonsense.  Which her room is full of toys and other junk like that.  After that I had to close that account.

The only way I can get her to leave the apartment so I can have some down time is when I give her money to leave me alone, so she'll stop calling me at work whenever something is wrong back home.  Sometimes when I'm coming home from work I stop by a McDonalds so I can browse Reddit on my phone and I don't have to come home to her.

One time I tried offering an ultimatum to her.  Either find a job and pay rent or move out.  She considered the proposition for a bit, but gave up shortly after and resumed doing what she does now.  So I'm pretty much back into a corner because I know if I kick her out she's just going to come crying back to our elderly parents to deal with or try to shame me in front of our family for ""being a heartless brother"".

---

Edit: Great responses guys, but I'm getting kinda tired and have to sleep to get up in the morning.

---

**Edit 2**: I notice some reoccurring questions/things around here so I figure I might as well address them all in one go.  Or things I might not have been clear about since I typed this late when I was tired and angry.  Or there could be things I could offer more context on.

> Why would you put up with this for so long
 
Originally the situation wasn't that bad, admittedly it was actually kinda fun in a way back then.  I can't say that we never shared any good moments living together.  At the end of the day I can't say that I really hate her.  I love my sister and maybe that's why I've been so lenient.  I wrote this mostly from a place of frustration to vent admittedly.  

Initially living with her was kinda alright.  She mostly kept to herself and that's why I put more of a blind eye on her than I should have.  The first few years started off pretty good.  Back in 2014, I didn't put very much thought into it being a optimistic 23 year old.  When you're in your early 20s you view the world with more rose tinted glasses than you would care to admit.  We've always lived together as siblings so it was kinda second nature that I assumed our living arrangement would be similar to how it was when we were children.

Now that I look back on writing this.  It's more like a compilation of things that annoy me over the past 5 years rather than things that occur very regularly.  I don't vehemently hate living with her as much as I make it sound.  I'm just kinda worried in the long term what our actual plan is going to be, now that we're getting older and doing this is not as viable as when we were in our early 20s.  

Everyone has their breaking point and I suppose this one was mine.  This type of relationship can be quite trying at times.

> What about the money?

That seems to be the thing I see a lot of people see as the main source of contention.  The mobile game thing and pizza was really more of a one off thing that happened once and was kinda done from there.  Really the money is not as big of deal as I made it out to be now that I re read what I wrote.  I really don't care about the dollar amount itself because it's relatively small, more so was mostly a setting boundaries kinda thing.  

The reason she knew about the credit card was because I told her about it.  I said it was used to pay for things that are urgent or to top up online accounts that have depleted.  In reality the cost of all those micro transactions were negligible, as it didn't really put that much of a dent in my finances.  When it happened I said ""fine, but this is all you're going to get in the form of entertainment for the next year"".

> Do you really sit around McDonalds on your phone?

Yes, but I mean TBH really it's an occasional thing when I'm having a really bad day.  I don't do it every night, sometimes I go to a local sports bar.  It's pretty cathartic.  But I don't think I'm the first guy to ever do that.

> Are you actually going to evict her?

The way AITA makes you write titles makes it seem more urgent than it really is.  The reason I wrote ""would I be"" is because it's just an idea I've been considering in my mind as a long term possibility for the greater good of both of us.  At the end of the day I want what's best for my sister and I considered this as a tough love sorta resolution.  I'm not really settling on this as a concrete solution, yet.

> The ultimatum

This wasn't a one off thing more like we've tried to come up with a realistic plan over time to get her employed at something.  At first it we were thinking about how to re enroll her in some sort of school.  Then I realized maybe we're going about this the wrong way.  Some people have difficultly learning in certain environments, maybe it's not for everyone.  Now I'm emphasizing to her get some sort of high school equivalency.  We're, or at least I'm, considering different avenues to take.

> Is she really going to try to go back to my parents or out me in front of the family?

I realize I said ""I know"", but actually that was more of an offhand comment I made about what could possibly happen.  I'm not certain what would actually happen, but I figured I couldn't rule that out as a possibility."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
