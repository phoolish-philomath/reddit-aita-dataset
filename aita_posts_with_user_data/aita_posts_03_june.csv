bwkaoi	2019-06-04 03:58:39	nessie-the-cello	AITA for wanting more independence with my medical condition?	"For context, I'm a 19 year old diabetic living with my parents. My condition requires me to take insulin injections with food as well as a daily injection around bedtime. 

When I was away at college I was fairly good at remembering to take my doses on time and had few issues with needing reminders to do them. If I did, I'd ask a friend to remind me if they noticed I hadn't done it. Since I've been home, my parents have been on my case about when I take my insulin and how to treat my blood sugars. I understand that they're coming from a good place, but I feel like the constant reminders are making me more reliant on their assistance and less on my own ability to care for myself. Last week, after discussing with a therapist, I asked my parents to cut back on the policing and to let me do my own thing. Today, they started doing it again, and when I reminded them what I had asked, they got upset that I was being ""too difficult"".  AITA for asking them to back off? I know they're just trying to be there for me, but it feels like a lot."	No A-holes here	0	0	36.0	17.0	0.0	0.0
bwkan8	2019-06-04 03:58:34	amIafuckboy	WIBTA If I slept with a woman I know, knowing things are about to get serious with someone else?	"Exceeded the character limit, reposting.

We have 3 players
Me 28F
""Rachel"" [30F] (married, poly, and fully aware of the situation with Kevin)
""Kevin"" [29M]

I am bisexual, but lean towards men. While I've fooled around with women, I've never actually had sex with a woman. This is an experience I'd really like to have at some point. Rachel and I have been friends for a couple of months, and have talked about hooking up. The only thing stopping us has been the fact that I basically feel like a virgin and I'm nervous.

Rachel and I were going to hook up last Thursday, but her kid got sick so she had to cancel and stay home. I ended up meeting Kevin for drinks, we had been talking for a few days on Okcupid. Kevin and I hit it off immediately. We work in the same industry, share similar values, hobbies, and taste in music, and the conversation flowed naturally. We went out again on Saturday, and are going to a festival this coming weekend together. It feels like there's a chance for this to develop into something real.


Kevin and I talked about what we are looking for in a potential partner (not necessarily with each other, but potentially). Some notes from the conversation:

- He is strictly monogamous, and looking for something strictly monogamous.

- He said he doesn't expect me not to see/talk to other people while we're getting to know each other...but only brought this up as he was backtracking after saying he can't get to know more than 1 person on an intimate level at a time.

- He has expressed interest in me, but not in a ""love bombing"" sort of way.

- He views sex as an intimate act, and really doesn't enjoy casual sex. He wants to wait until we're a few more dates in, and made it very clear his intention is to date/ get to know me and he is looking for a relationship.


I know things with Kevin could still flop, it's all still brand new, but if it does go well I don't want that ""what if"" in the back of my mind forever, which I did experience with my ex. I'd like to experience sleeping with a woman at least once. At the same time, if Kevin were to find out about it, I wouldn't want him to be hurt by the fact that I slept with someone else while things were beginning with us. While I don't plan on advertising it to him, I also wouldn't lie about it if it came up.


TLDR I have been talking to a woman I'm friends with about hooking up and finally getting my first true experience with a woman. I haven't gone further than fooling around. We had a night planned to hook up, and then she had to reschedule. I went out with Kevin instead, and we get along amazingly. I see real potential with him. He has been pretty forward about liking me and having the intention to date, and is generally looking for a monogamous relationship.

It was a horribly long trip that I didn’t really enjoy and wasn’t looking forward to because I absolutely hate California, but I did it for him.
Anyways, we had agreed that on the way back, I would travel with my sister and help her move near us, and he would drive home alone since he has to be back at work on Wednesday. I didn’t really like this plan because I didn’t want him driving alone, but we talked about it and he said he was okay with it.

So he left this morning, and I expected him to be halfway home by like 2:00, but instead he decided to take a 4 hour detour to Calexico to visit more family without telling me and the only reason I knew is because I was looking for my phone on find my iPhone and noticed his all the way down there. I decided to give him a call and he still didn’t tell me where he was just that he was “visiting family”. I didn’t confront him on it at that moment because I didn’t want to cause conflict while we’re apart, but I am so ready to blow up when we meet up at home(edit: just because I want to right now, doesn’t mean I actually will. I confront things calmly). I’m also really hurt that he didn’t talk to me about it in the first place, I would have been okay with it, but the fact he went behind my back just makes me feel awful and like he can’t talk about anything with me like I can with him.

My mom says I shouldn’t be mad and that it’s not a big deal, but I feel like I should be. I talked about my plans with him, he should have the decency to talk about his with me."	Asshole	0	0	402.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

My high school lets out at 3:15 and is located 30-45 minutes from our house. My brother's school lets out at 3:00 and is right by our house. My grandmother and grandfather (on my mom's side) are only a couple minutes away from us and they are retired. My parents just recently divorced, and my brother and I live with my mother most of the time.

**Situation:** Due to my parents' work schedules, my grandparents pick us up from school. My grandparents will pick up my brother first since his school is close to their house. This makes sense in theory but by the time I get picked up, it will be 4:30. My grandparents have told me that my brother isn't waiting outside when his school lets out at 3:00. He is usually hanging out with his friends inside and comes out when he's ready. By the time we get home, it's around 5:30 since we're now stuck in rush hour traffic. 

I've complained to my mom about this before and that I don't think it's fair. Because of my brother, I have to sit at school waiting even longer to get picked up. All my friends go home so it's just me and some of the older kids I don't know. She said she's doing the best that she can and I need to get over it. I just think that my brother should be outside around 3:00 so I can get picked up before 4:00 and we'll be home by 4:45, not 5:30. I've talked to my grandparents and they just say, ""That's your brother!"" like I'm expecting too much of him.

I don't know what my mom is going through with the divorce so maybe I'm being the asshole. I'm going to go crazy if I have to do this for another year until I can finally drive!"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Fast forward 2 years, I was now out to my parents & brothers. My mom got a call from my aunt & she was asking my mom all kinds of questions about my sexuality, & mentioned that my cousin had told her that I’m bi. My mom used to be part of an anti-LGBTQ+ hate group & is very homophobic, fortunately she never kicked me out of the house but it was & still is really hard. Apparently a bunch of my relatives now know too. Like what if I hadn’t been out to my mom yet?! She would have found out that I’m bi through that phone call but my aunt didn’t even bother to think about how it affects me. I wasn’t ready to come out to anyone else in my family yet either. And my cousin is the one who told my aunt when I specifically told her not to tell anyone?? I was supposed to be the one to come out when I was ready but they took that away from me.

bwk2b3	2019-06-04 03:33:35	nate_rausch	AITA if I don't let my fiance get her ex' dog?	"First six months of dating I didn't hear anything about a dog. Except once when she had a dog to walk and I was told it was her and her ex' dog, that was now living with him.

Starting about 6 months into the relationship the dog suddenly changes from being her former dog to being hers in her mind. I never want to have a dog, and never wanted one and I had I known it would have been a dreal breaker. The conversation is repeatedly had, perhaps hundreds of times over the coming 6 months. I decide to draw a line before we got engaged and said that it was actually a thing where she had to choose me or the dog. She first chose the dog, then next day changed her mind and chose me. We're now a year and a half in, and we keep having the same discussion over and over again, and she is trying every avenue and never giving up.

My reasoning for not wanting a dog is that my life isn't set for having the responsibility right, and neither is hers frankly. We travel across the Atlantic on a monthly basis. More deeply I just don't very much like having dogs, although I do in a sense think dogs are great to play with. I sort of see dog owners becoming dog people, where that is the primary thing about them. It is also a large and daily responsibility that greatly restricts what you can do. And from my perspective it is for nothing, it's like a having a child that will never grow up past 3 years old. In addition to not wanting to have a dog, I also don't want this particular dog, which is her ex' dog by all practical purposes (for the last 3 years).

Anyway, despite many ultimatum conversations, she kind of just keeps pushing. Bringing it up again and again, every other day or so. I am trying to help by finding other ways for the dog, but she is effectively sabotaging those efforts. Over the many negotiations I have given into many other things I didn't want to do, like she can visit the dog (which means visiting the ex) as she wants to. And the dog can stay with us some weekends and holidays here and there. I've also opened up the opportunity for getting  dog when we have kids older than 2-3 years old, if they want to. All of these concessions were given in what was at one point an agreement. But she sort of just sees it as a temporary win while she keeps trying to convince me to have a dog.

We seem to be getting nowhere. And whenever I try to draw a hard line again, she kind of concedes, but just keeps the pressure on. It is getting quite frustrating to me to have the same argument over and over again, when my stance on it has been so clear so many times.

From her point of view she of course is a caring person who loves animals, and her former dog in particular. She also when given the choice will choose me, but does not feel obligated to stay on such a decision, and just see it as a sort of temporary set-back. She is upset at me for not accepting to want to have a dog.

My argument for why I am not the asshole is that I have been clear since day 1, but she first gave the impression that she didn't have a dog or had until our relationship was quite mature. My other argument is that we have had the conversation to the end several times, where I have said clearly that this is a dealbreaker for me, and she have then decided to choose me over the dog, but then repeatedly renegotiated. 

At this point I really have no idea what to do. Everything except the dog situation in our relationship is good and I do think that without this one conflict, we would be getting married quickly.

My daughter \[17F\] has been dating her boyfriend \[18M\] for 11 months. I like the boyfriend a lot, but I've always had a few rules he and my daughter have to follow:

1. no being home alone together
2. no closing the door if they're in a room alone
3. absolutely no sleepovers

Now, my daughter's boyfriend got in a bad four wheeling accident last month, and he had some pretty serious complications with one of his legs, so he's been in the hospital for several weeks. I've been much more lenient than usual while he's in the hospital – I let my daughter stay with him overnight sometimes – because 1) it's a very emotional and scary time for both of them and 2) them being ""alone"" in a hospital isn't the same as them being alone at home (nurses are always coming in and out of the room, they can't sleep on the same bed, etc.)

The boyfriend is finally getting to go home from the hospital in a couple of days. He'll be able to take care of himself if he absolutely *has* to, he's not completely helpless, but he lives alone in the country with his grandmother, who's pretty old and feeble, so it'd really help him out to have someone else around for a couple weeks (especially someone who can drive). It's summer and my daughter's out of school, so she and her boyfriend are begging me to let her stay at his house and help him out until he's a little more stable. They mentioned their idea in front of the boyfriend's grandma, and she perked up and seemed very excited about the possibility. I think she'd really like to have help, too.

The problem is this, though: I'm not comfortable letting my daughter stay at her boyfriend's house, especially for such a long period of time. I've always been very set in my no sleepover rule, and it would feel really weird to let it up just because the boyfriend's leg is broken. I'm not stupid - I know a broken leg won't stop them from having sex, and I know my daughter will sleep in her boyfriend's bed even if she says she'll ""sleep in the guest room"".

My dad and I never had a good relationship. My mom left him and took myself and my older brother when I was 5 (I'm now 28) due to gang and drug relations, and abuse. Things I never knew about until I was older. I went from missing him and never understanding why, to hating him with a passion in my early teen years. My mom never talked bad about him once, despite all the pain he caused her. When I was 15 we moved back to Canada to live with him, and it was pretty rocky for some years. He figured he could go right back to where we were when I was 5. I refused to show him the respect he demanded because in that whole 10 year span that we were away from him, he knew where we were and never once tried to get in contact with me. We get along now, but I still have my walls up and won't ever let them down. My mom doesn't seem to understand why I can't get over it. She is always nagging me to call him on his birthday/fathers day or just whenever. I do call, sometimes, but not often. He never makes any effort into calling me, I should add. Recently he battled colon cancer, and I don't really feel anything for him. My mom of course, still on me to call him and see how he's doing. He is currently staying with her during his recovery, so I do see him when I visit, and when I call my mom I'll be on speaker phone so I will say hi. We chat when I'm visiting, and I give him hugs goodbye etc. I've got a busy lifestyle so sometimes I don't keep up with calling my family. In all fairness, they don't really make any effort to call me. If I do call and it's been a while, I get the whole ""haven't heard from you in so long!""

As we're paying for our food, I DO see a 50 on the eftpos machine, but all that registers in my head is ""woops, that's more expensive than I thought,  I'm not letting bf pay for all of this"".

So now we're walking to the car and I'm counting up how much I owe bf in my head and I'm about to transfer him some dollas when he says ""I think they just charged us 50c by accident.."" I say no way, I defs saw $50 on the screen. He checks his account when we get in the car and yep, they only charged us 50c by mistake.

She was a wonderfull woman and will be missed. I don't know how to describe her loss any other way than that and I can't even begin to imagine the pain this is causing her children (my mother, my 2 aunts, and my uncle). 

At the end of June I will be getting married. Everyone who would be attending the funeral was invited to the wedding. One of my grandmothers children suggested that because we will all be togther anyways we should have the funeral the Thursday before my wedding. At first they wanted to do it the day after but after some discussion it  was decided Thursday would be better. I am not ok with this for multiple reasons and feel that my opposition does not need a justification, although I have no problem expalining it to my family if it comes to that. 

Ive talked to my mother and she has no issue with me trying to have the date of the funeral changed. The only other relevant information I can think to bring up is part of the family will have to travel 10-12 hours to attend the funeral if they drive or 3-4 hours  if they fly. 

This is obviously a pretty delicate situation so before I take any big stands i need some feedback. WIBTA for demanding my grandmothers funeral not take place two days before my wedding

My partner and I regularly visit a local “ale house,” and typically visit every Saturday night. It’s sort of like a Buffalo Wild Wings if you made BWW classier with less focus on sports, and more on beer. Not fancy, just comfortable. The last few times, we’ve had a common issue pop up and we aren’t sure if we’re in the wrong.

For starters, this restaurant is open until 2am on the weekends, but because of the location they’re pretty dead after about 6pm. My partner and I usually show up around 6 or 7, and then leave at around 9 or 10, usually there watching a hockey game or whatever they have on the TVs.

The last three times we were there, we had our server come up to us around the 2 hour mark and essentially apologize, say they’ve been waiting for us to leave and that they’re trying to go home. They politely ask if we’d like to close our tab or have another server take over. 

The first time, we were almost done anyway, so we closed. The second time, we also closed but weren’t necessarily done but just chose to leave. This last time, we asked to have another server cover our table...and she didn’t show up until we asked a manager.

Normally, I’d just chalk it up to coincidentally ended up being a server’s last table of the night. That’s fine. It happens. But it’s obvious they’re also trying to rush us out, so we aren’t sure if they’re just being pushy or if we’re in the wrong.

Obviously, we’re still buying drinks and food during this time period. Maybe not as frequently as they would like, but our bill is always $50+ each time. Not only that, but we are literally surrounded by empty tables.

AITA for keeping the table? Or are the staff just being impatient?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bwjsd7	2019-06-04 03:03:58	gretane	WIBTA if I put a note on a neighbor’s haphazardly parked car and told them to move it?	"Hi there! First post in this thread. 

I live in a very stereotypical Western US stucco suburb. Closely packed houses that all look alike, you know what I mean. 

I live at the end of a blind turn through a residential area (think paved street, no lines), so I prefer to back out of my driveway in a specific direction so I can always keep my eye on the turn in the road. For whatever reason, my neighbors always keep this one car parked along the curb in front of their house—perfectly perpendicular to where my car is parked in my single-car driveway. They have a much bigger lot than mine and could very easily move their car along the curb 10 feet in either direction (or even do something as buckwild as using their own driveway for their own car).  

I’m not sure why this car is still parked in this exact space on the curb, especially because a few months ago the car was totally sideswiped (remember that blind turn???) They installed a camera but did not move the car, leading me to think there is some reason they feel the need to have the car parked RIGHT THERE. 

But I gotta say, the number of times I’ve almost rammed my car’s back end into the side of this car... it’s a little high. Sometimes the car won’t be there for a few days, I get used to being able to turn out, and then BOOM I see it suddenly one morning in my rear view in the nick of time. Regardless, because it’s a tiny street that barely technically passes for a two lane... it can literally take me an entire minute to get out of my driveway in the mornings between finagling around this parked car and keeping an eye out for the crazies zooming around the blind turn.

I want to leave a note telling them that I feel bad because I keep almost ramming into their car—like at least once every other month. I also regularly have friends over and ALWAYS have to warn them not to hit this car on their way out—there have been noteworthy close calls.

This incident took place two Christmas's ago. At that point in time I had already been dating my SO for about 4 years. I was invited to come over and have xmas dinner with his dad, mom and a couple of siblings (whom are all over 17 by then.)

Everything was fine until I decided to go for a walk to smoke a joint. It's what I do when I get anxious and it helps me calm down. I made sure to leave the house and walk down the street when I did this.

When I came back, I was immediately reprimanded for ""smelling like smoke"" and daddy-o demanded to know what I had smoked. Now I'm not one to lie, so I told the truth. I am/was not ashamed of my use of cannabis.

He immediately began yelling at me, getting in my face and telling me ""DON'T COME TO MY HOUSE ANYMORE IF YOU CAN'T RESPECT MY RULES!""

I asked how I did this, and he claimed I smoked in his house. I was shocked, honestly. I was called a drug dealer, a drug addict. I was told I was the reason their son is ""doing bad."" 

And the best part? I then had to sit down and have dinner with everyone, while mom and dad bombarded me with questions about my choices in life. I felt utterly defeated but I didn't cry. I defended my beliefs and finally was able to leave when a brother offered a ride.

Now, two years later, I still haven't gotten even a tiny apology or admittance of being terrible towards me. I was never anything but civil to them and I feel very betrayed to this day. My SO always asks me to go with him for his family events and I always refuse. Every time I make the effort (I have visited again 3 times after xmas) they all make it a habit to ignore me, or be complete self-righteous asses towards me.

In order to do this, she cheated on him with another guy. Now this other guy literally had just been released from prison. She is not dating this new guy per se, but is spending a lot of time with him. Also worth mentioning, this co-worker of mine is batshit crazy, unpredictable, and super unreliable. She just told me not long before all of this that she wanted to get her tubes tied because she hates children and would never want to be pregnant.

Now onto the rest. I am 9 months pregnant currently. Today, while her and I were in a patients room, she casually points to my belly and says ""I can't wait to get to that point"". In which my other co-worker asks ""what does that mean?"". She proceeds to tell us all that her period is 4 days late and has a big grin on her face, anticipating excitement and congratulations from us (didn't happen). So our patient asks ""oh are you trying to get pregnant?"". Her response was that ""no, we are letting whatever happens happen. But I think u/maggoo was trying!!"". I responded to that by saying, ""no I was not trying, we were also letting whatever happens, happen. But I've been married for two years and want children"".

bwjpnb	2019-06-04 02:55:59	kawAdamz	AITA for being picky about other people's volumes?	"So, I've always been really noise sensitive.. I think it has something to do with my ADHD. Loud noises give me this feeling of anxiety that makes me feel like I'm going to burst. However, I try never to portray this sense of urgency to others for fear of appearing rude. 

Let me give you some examples. 

1. I am a h.s. teacher, and I find it absolutely unacceptable for students to play any type of video or song aloud, even if it's a movie day or something. Sometimes even if their head phones are in, but the music is loud enough to hear, I immediately have to find the source of the noise and ask them to quiet it. 

2. When I am watching a show or movie on t.v., sometimes my roommate will watch Snapchat videos at a blaring volume. She has acted annoyed when I ask her to turn her volume down. 

3. I'm a light sleeper, so if my roommates are watching TV or listening to music loudly (on a weekday) I will have to ask them to please turn it down a bit, or I truly will lose hours of sleep.

Am I the asshole for imposing my noise issues on others?

My brothers think I'm being bitch but I'm so tired of her saying that. We get he has cancer so no need to remind us every time you need something. Another example, she wants the whole family to drive 30 miles to see my grandparents and my uncle and his kids even though my grandparents spent the weekend at our house and just left this morning. Once again, she said her dad is sick and that my grandmother cries about his diagnosis so the least we can do is drive 30 miles and stay the whole day with them. He got diagnosed a few months ago and of course I feel bad for everyone affected by this.

&#x200B;

I live in a university dorm, and we have 1 kitchen per floor, there are about 80 rooms per floor, some double, some single. the kitchen only has 1 stovetop with 4 burners, so the kitchen is always hectic. I went to fry an egg for dinner today. There were 4 pots on the stove, 2 claimed by people sitting in the kitchen, 2 unclaimed. I asked around and no one knew. So I took one off, fried an egg, and put it back on. I did bump into the owner of the 2 pots as she was coming in. In the bathroom as I was brushing my teeth, the owner approached me and called me asshole for doing it, and it ruined her whole dinner as she had to throw everything away. My 2 cents on this:

1. community kitchen, you left, no note or telling anyone about your stuff
2. she took up 2 stovetops and the oven, which is like 3/4 of the cooking equipment in the dorm minus the microwave
3. and it certainly did not ruin the dinner, as the 2 pots were just plantains boiling. and only 1 pot of plantains were taken off, then put back on, the other stayed on the stove the whole time
4. as to why I ""didnt go to another floor you asshole"", I had my condiments and eggs in the small corner of the cabinet in the kitchen I managed to secure on day 1."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	13.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

bwjm6d	2019-06-04 02:45:52	tretasforever	AITA for asking my mum to pay me what an uncle offered my sister?	"To keep things short, I (33M) have a sister (25) and we were both raised alone by my mum (50). 

A year ago, me and my girlfriend finally got a down payment on a house, and we moved in together. We had to resort to loaning from the bank and fortunately her fathers.

Today I discovered that my mum asked an uncle of hers if he would give my sister a big terrain for her to build a house with her boyfriend. Something like a 10000-15000$ terrain. Because he's quite old, he's about to give it to her as a gift, not because he knows or likes my sister, but because he likes my mum (her nephew).

I got mad at them both, because it felt very unjust. At the time of my house hunt she only offered to loan me 1k, saying she didn't have any more money at disposal. She had some 35k in the bank, but didn't really offered to withdraw it, likely because of the good interest rate she has.

When I confronted both, my sister was quickly to say she was againt me asking for anything because I was to blame for not doing the same... asking mum to ask that same uncle. But I feel it's shallow and stupid to be asking for that sort of thing to a family member were not that close to even. Specially since my mom has another 4 siblings, and would maybe create unnecessary tension between them.

She also says if the uncle actually gives it to her, its between them, and my mum wouldn't have anything to do with it, so it wouldn't have anything to do with me as well.

My mom didn't really have an answer to my issue, she just felt she didn't do anything wrong, just didn't remembered at the time that she could do this.

I feel this is very unjust, and not so sure I'm being unreasonable by asking my mom to make things right with me. 

Am I an asshole for asking her for the money the terrain would be worth, or should I just let this be between them?

Is a bit hard to forget how different she was towards helping me.

*Update: most replies make me think I made too much emphasis on getting money from this. honestly, I just wanted them to acknowledge that getting one a 15k gift while loaning 1k to the other was unfair.*"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

Many people in my wife's family don't speak english that well and her mom doesn't speak any other than a few phrases. She can barely order food at a restaurant and can't really do much without a family member with her. Generally i speak with my wife's family in spanish. My wife's mom sometimes calls me when she can't get ahold of other family members asking me to translate when she's doing basic errands or has some sort of issue with someone who can't speak spanish. It's getting pretty annoying having to deal with it so i told my mother in law that she needs to learn how to speak english. I told her I'm sick of dealing with her shit because she can't speak english, she's been here for 8 years she should be able to speak english by now, in comparison i taught myself spanish and portuguese within a year and russian in 2 without even living in the countries that speak them. This honestly shouldn't be that hard. I gave her sources that i've used, duolingo, mango and provided dictionaries. I've even told her about ESL classes she can take.

Many people in my family are upset with what i said. They said what i did was incredibly disrpesectful and that I'm flaunting my white privlege by doing this shit and I'm acting racist. Somehow telling someone you should learn the language of the country you live in is racist. They went on about how I'm a racist trump supporter and whatever. Nobody in my family is on my side on this issue not even my wife and I'm wondering where i went wrong. I was incredibly polite to my mother in law and i explained that i'd help her along the way but she needs to become independent. I love her and my family they're all decent people but she needs to learn to speak english as do the rest of the family.

  
EDIT: i am aware that the US does not have an official language, stop pointing that out everyone fucking knows that. I'd also like to rephrase something, when explaining the situation to my MIL i didn't tell her ""I'm sick of dealing with your shit"" i told her that it's getting frustrating that I'm being used as a translator at random parts throughout the day and i want you to be independent and be able to do what you need to do without one of us as a translator in a really polite and respectful tone"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I mentioned in a previous post that when they first met things quickly moved to him staying at our apartment pretty regularly even without her being there. A whole lot of drama ensued and I ended up back at home and not on speaking terms with my sister and her bf. A month goes by and she starts acting like nothing happened when she comes over to visit so instead of being the only person who was upset I let it go and moved on without really patching things up. It was awkward to be on “ side hug” terms with my sister but whatever I’m at an age where my family drama exhausts me and I try not to blame my family for being assholes bc we all have our fair share of trauma. 

Anyway, he popped the question she said yes and I said congrats. To be honest really don’t like the dude. I personally think he made himself too comfortable in my apartment. He’s half white half Hispanic and my family and I are full Hispanic. On more than one occasion I’ve heard this guys make racial slurs or tell racist jokes with the excuse that he’s mixed so he can’t be racist. He openly admits that his own mother is racist. My sister is paid fairly well for her job. He on the other hand has been looking for a job since I’ve known him. And he now prefers to drive her nicer car over his own while she is at work. In my opinion he found the jackpot on tinder and is trying to tie it down. I’ll admit it bothered me for a while but I’m leaving to another state for college soon so I dont really care to invest too much energy into something to suddenly and so riddled with red flags. I kept it too myself to avoid the drama. 

The day after their engagement we celebrated my brothers graduation from college and my sister and her now fiancé made a huge scene at the end because we didn’t seem happy for them. I’ll admit all I said was “congratulations” to my sister. I felt that, it was sufficient since we were at a party for my brother anyway. 

My sister and I always planned to be each other’s maid of honor but I’m thinking of telling my sister I dont want to be apart of her wedding party at all and i think it’s just best that I attend as a guest instead. She always accused me of not being happy for her but I honestly don’t think I can bring  myself to pretend I support her marrying this dude. I obviously want my sister to marry the best man out there and I want her to be happy but I cant believe she can’t excuse so much of his behavior.

"A year ago, my friend was in a tough place, living with her then boyfriend who was physically abusive and manipulative. He wouldn't let her get a job, and so she could not afford to move out on her own (both her parents were deceased and she's not close to her relatives). He also made her pay half of the rent using her student loans. As a result, she took out bank loans on the side and racked up a pretty sizable debt.

As soon as their lease was near its end, I told her to move out. I ""gave"" her $5000 as a fresh start and told her she could take her time repaying it in whatever amount was comfortable after she got stabilized with housing and a job, but if the worst comes to worst, I could afford to write it off as a gift.

She had a rocky transition, using motels and AirBnBs until she finally secured an apartment. She had a really difficult time with job interviews while being treated for PTSD. Recently, after 5 months of futility, she finally landed a job that looked promising (not great pay, but above min wage). About 2 weeks after, I reached out to check how she's doing, and she said she's finally making more than she's spending, but very anxious about losing her job (even though work seems to be going fine and she's on good terms with the manager). I asked if she was ready to start repaying some of the loan on a regular basis, but she said she doesn't feel confident, and she still owes about $3400 on her line of credit and maxed out her student loans. She wants to at least pay off the line of credit to save her credit score, but that'll take 8 months.

I reminded her most people her age have student loans too, and our agreement was to start repaying once she had housing and a job. She then started having a breakdown and had to be taken to the hospital for what sounded like a panic attack. I know she's not faking to make an excuse, but things have gotten complicated and now I feel really bad."	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I currently live in a 4 bedroom apartment with 3 other people. We all have separate leases and it is a constant price for rent each month. We agreed to have our utilities bill split up 4 ways at the beginning of our lease which worked out great and was about ~$30 each a month. However, for the past few months one of our roommates ‘moved out’ due to him not getting along well with another roommate but still has a lease and just stays with their boyfriend.
Here’s where the issue is. For several of those months he continued to pay utilities as agreed. But recently our other roommate (whose parents did the credit check for our electric company and who we send the amount to every month) stopped charging the moved out roommate for utilities.  I realize he doesn’t actively use up electricity while he is gone but his plugged in devices still contribute to the bill and the amount we owe doesn’t really change depending on if he is there or not. 
Without his portion of pay the rest of the 3 of us contribute 10 more a month. This doesn’t seem like a big amount but considering my allowance per month is $850 (yes I still get an allowance at 19 because I am a student) and my monthly total for rent/utilities is now $610 I am only left with $240 for my other bills, gas, food, and entertainment fund.

I need a new laptop as my current PC has slowed down quite a bit, so I'm thinking of switching to a macbook pro (MBP) which I trust won't slow down over the next 5 years at least. But my savings aren't enough to buy a MBP, so my parents have agreed to loan me the money, which would be added to the sum of money I'm borrowing from them for college. After I start working, I'll then pay them back in instalments.

But a MBP is very expensive and I'm not entirely sure that it won't strain my family's resources. Right now my mother is unemployed, while my father makes about US$52,600 (excluding government savings plan deductions). I have a 15F sister in secondary school, and my parents also have to pay for supplementary tuition as she's struggling with her studies (probably US$300 monthly). Plus, they're sponsoring my driving lessons, which would add up to about US$1,500 in total.

Every time I ask, my parents would tell me not to worry about money, but lately their tone has become more and more hesitant. E.g. before they used to say ""money is not a problem,"" whereas now they say ""it's a lot of money, but we trust it'll be a worthwhile investment"". They're Chinese, so they're the kind who'd act like money isn't an issue even if they have to cut corners in their (and my sister's) life behind my back.

So WIBTA if I go through with this deal? The MBP will cost around $1,220 excluding applecare+."	Asshole	0	0	373.0	300.0	0.0	0.0

So I am currently a senior in High school, and my aunt recently just started working at my school this semester. She is one of the nicest aunts anyone could ever ask for, and she is always, ALWAYS too polite.

One day me and my closest friend since kindergarten were walking in the hallway when my aunt passes us, she didn't see me, but as she passed us my friend turned to me and literally looked at me and pushed his finger against his nose to make it look like a pig. He was poking fun of my aunt because she does have a nose that's perked upwards. My aunt and I are really close, and she told me a lot about how she was bullied alot at school for her complexion, and because she was an immigrant who came to canada from korea when she was really young, so her english was not always great. I turned to my friend and got really mad and said ""thats my fucking aunt"". He didn't believe me when I said so. He said to me ""Haha good one, theres no way you're related to that pig. \*random talk random talk random talk\* - dude I've been sucking up to her and giving her sob stories about how I was bullied so she would go easy on me for homework and tests"". I was so mad, I called her name ""hey, aunt ASDF"" , she turned and said ""not at school please, but hi!""

My friend apologized and turned bright red, I walked away.

I really want to tell my aunt what happened, but he is my best friend. He has helped me with a lot, and even financially has gotten me out of tight spots, he has been there for me and my family. I also don't want to bring it up to my aunt because I know she is gonna ask me what he said, and she will force it out of me. I really don't want to make her relive the past and hurt her.

Our cousin helped my sister get a massive internship at a prestigious medical center, but my sister says she’s too depressed and wants to quit the internship.


My sister is a very independent person, she generally doesn’t want/take advice or assurance from anyone. I can only do so much to get close with her before she reacts and tells me off for prying or for harassing her. I know she’s hurting but I can’t help her, she doesn’t want me to help her. The only person I really know that could even do something like this would be my Aunt or my cousin.


I miss my cousin. I would trade anything to have her back, but I just got so frustrated hearing her say she’d put all the work our cousin out into getting this opportunity for her behind her. I’m only 15, I can only do so much, I can’t schedule therapy for her or organize an intervention, my mom is uncooperative and still recovering from the loss. My dad is willing oblivious to the issue and will remain to be oblivious until we’re both gone.


Would I be the asshole if I told her she was wasting the work of our cousin? I don’t want to hurt my sister but I don’t want to have what’s impacting her now ruin her future."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My wife and I share a townhouse with another couple, a 21 year old dude, and the wife's friend.  My wife and I are in a peculiar position at the moment and moved in because we planned on staying only 4-5 months, and the couple that owns the townhouse are friends of ours. Or so we thought. My wife and I have known everyone in the house for about a year, so we're all well acquainted with one another.

The husband, who we'll call Dan, considers himself a bit of a neat freak. His wife, who we'll call Danielle, is quite the opposite. Dan sells cars, and Danielle works retail. The baby of the house is Tyler, who just turned 21 and has lived with Dan & Danielle since he was 18. Danielle's friend, Emily has lived there for about 2 years. Everyone was cool with each other.

For the last two weeks, we've all been avoiding Dan & Danielle. Dan does nothing but bitch and moan. When he doesn't have something to bitch about as soon as he walks in the door, he finds something. I could rant about all the shit going on, but it just boils down to Dan gets upset when people don't clean up after him. He's one of those ""Man of the house"" type guys. You know those ones. Those dudes who still believe in gender roles and make subtle chauvinistic and misogynistic remarks at it about women. 
But, he projects it onto everyone in the house like he's better than us. So, Emily and my wife and I are moving out next month. My wife and I have been planning on going nomad, so we're staying with Emily for a month before we get on the road.

Where we're moving to is just down the street from a local library. I got the idea from an r/askreddit post about people who called numbers left in public places. Specifically, a comment about a flyer left in a coffee shop asking for the best Wookiee impression. This guy doesn't Reddit, and I don't think I'll ask for Wookiee impressions. But I do want to leave his number in random coffee shops and the like around the country as my wife and I go along our travels.  There will be prize money."	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So my friend, and roommate, Carl, is dating another (less close) friend of mine, Jenny. They've been going out for about a year. Both in their early twenties. I found out he cheated on her with a girl off tinder. I heard him having sex with a girl and saw a girl who wasn't Jenny walk out of his room. I confronted him about it and to my surprise, he fessed up right away. I told him what the fuck was wrong with him- he has a beautiful girlfriend and wants to throw it all away. She's my friend too, and I don't want him to keep getting away with this and have her be even more hurt down the road, so I tell him: ""Well, she's gonna hear about this.""

Well Carl started to freak out. He said that was breaking the ""bro code"" and ""how could I""? I remind him my parents went through a divorce from this same kind of situation. I do not tolerate cheating, especially if it hurts a friend. But then my friend stoops lower. He said he will give me $500 to not say anything. Now here's the amazing part. I am in quite a bind financially. I am behind on rent (we are in a college town place where rent is per tenant, not collective) and a month behind on my car payment, on top of mounting credit card debt. I'm honestly getting destroyed by late fees and interest, and my situation is only getting worse. I still tell him no, though. He \*then\* ups it to $1,000. It's really not a huge amount either- his family is wealthy, and I know he inherited a sum from his grandparents not too long ago. I then compromise on my morals at this point and tell him I will think about it.

WIBTA if I accepted the bribe? I get it's wrong, but now I have a chance to get caught up financially and not have to lose sleep on any more financial issues. My parents aren't wealthy either, and it would be great for me not to have to keep nickel and diming them anymore. Would it be worse if I took the money and told her anyway?"

I ended up going back to my bedroom in tears and she texted about 9 times, saying that she owned everything and that I was a terrible baby and brat.

I think she would understand if I said that, however, I still want to give a ticket to my dad’s GF, Tammy. Her and my dad act more like a married couple than a boyfriend and girlfriend, and they also live about 100 miles away from me, so coming to my graduation would be a big deal for them because it’s pretty far away and I don’t see them very often. I really love Tammy like a stepmom, but I don’t see Robert in any sort of stepfatherly fashion, he doesn’t try like she does. My father also has some pretty severe mental issues and it is difficult to control his emotions without her, and I feel that graduation is the sort of emotional event that would make her presence necessary.

Long story short, I made a mistake while driving with my friend in the passenger seat (no there was no likelihood of a crash or anyone’s life in danger - if you’re curious I turned when I was supposed to give way but the other car gave way to me so I turned) and when my friend brought it up I promptly apologised and said I didn’t realise I had to give way. She kept repeating “but it’s the the rule” over and over. Every time I replied saying “yeah I get it, I didn’t realise that”.  However she repeated it around 6/7 times and at that point I got annoyed and said drop the conversation or change the subject but she refused to and kept pushing at it. I raised my voice saying drop it and it was awkward for the rest of the car ride.

I sent an apology text that night about losing my cool and I shouldnt have done that but would appreciate her dropping the convo next time cos I got it the first few times she said it. 

She didn’t respond to the text at all but tried to casually talk about how my day was etc. so I brought it up with her asking why she didn’t respond to my text. She stated that it’s because I don’t want to talk about it? (Clearly I did if I brought it up) and she wants to drop it. We didn’t talk the next few days and she then messaged asking how I am. I was open about it and said I’m not happy with how she handled it and she was insensitive and all I got in reply was a “yeah fair I didn’t respond to your text” but didn’t respond to any of the other issues. 

I was annoyed to the point where I replied with a further explanation of what went wrong and why I’m hurt (incident and how she handled it after) saying don’t bother replying to this message if she sees nothing wrong with it.

One of them (let's call them A) yelled at me, saying ""This is why nobody likes you."" After A said that, I left the room we were in and we had a solid 3 week period where we didn't speak or acknowledge each other. 

After a few weeks of silence, I decided to 'be the bigger man' and apologize to them. We became friends again until the end of December, where the whole ignoring situation repeated itself.

It started one day in class, I noticed the other friend (B) wasn't talking to me even when I was talking to them, and if they did respond they sounded bored or distant. So I naturally stopped talking, assuming they were having a bad day. However, when A came into class, B perked up immediately and they started chatting, ignoring me despite the fact I was right next to them.

I didn't think much of it, and we went to our next class (we all had the same schedule). We were in drama, working on our big production coming up later that week. The teacher asked us to split into groups of three to run lines, and they ignored me and asked someone else in the class.

And I haven't spoken to them since. It's been almost 6 months since we've talked, but I still feel like I've done something wrong or that it's my fault the friendship ended because I didn't try to save it.

I'm not exaggerating at all, he actually finds a way to make this weird cuckoldry thing a topic of conversation every time I see him and with everyone else he hangs out with.

We're all in university and he mentioned asking on the university subreddit if anyone wanted to hang out one night when we were all drunk. I wake up the next morning hungover and browsing the sub and then see a post matching his description of his post the night before. I click on it and see people in the comments calling him a weirdo for his post history, so naturally I looked and what I found was just too fucking good I honestly started laughing out loud reading through his post history. He claims to have cucked people before in conversation, but his reddit post history is full of nothing but him asking for bulls to come plow his gf (now ex gf) over months and him making fantasy posts (hopefully) about being cucked in weird subreddits. 


Everyone is pretty weirded out by him constantly bringing up wanting to cuck people and I think this is just too poetic to not share with a few close friends.

Their 2yr old is...a real little shit. They don't discipline him (they have tried but eventually just give up) and as a result, he hits back or screams the house down for hours until he gets his own way. The 8yr old on the other hand is a gentle giant, he's soft spoken and timid yet he still gets the arse end of their anger and frustration.  

Not only is their 2yr old clearly the golden child but there's an obvious set of rules for one and another for the other and the favouritism is blatant - the husband's parents also enforce this but I will not go into that. We'll be here all frigging night otherwise. 

Lately I've been noticing a lot more her husband talks to my nephew like he's a fucking idiot ALL THE TIME. It's like he can never do anything right. Instead of teaching or showing my nephew how to do XY and Z he makes him feel like an idiot for not knowing it instead. Are you kidding me? He's a kid! He's still learning everyday just like we are and they need to learn from us! I'm not sure if he just doesn't know how to talk to his kids or he just treats him differently because technically he's not his own but it's incredibly infuriating and I'm concerned for my nephews wellbeing. 

Obviously there's a lot to take into account here such as their own mental health and their own battles and kids of ALL ages are difficult (not saying my nephew is an angel either) but how can she let this happen? Does she not think that how you treat your kids now shape the people they become? 

So WIBTA? Should I just mind my own business?

Last summer I got a dog named Dexter. This was discussed far in advance with the roomie, and he was fully onboard with it. Dexter is a good dog, if a bit ornery; but occasionally he can have issues with other dogs. He gets along great with my girlfriend’s dog, my parents’ dog, and a few other dogs he has met - but he usually doesn’t like small dogs and he’s gotten into a few spats at the dog park before (so I no longer take him there).

Roomie has decided he wants to get a puppy, which I am 100% okay with - provided we set up a meet and greet first with the puppy he finds and my dog to make sure there won’t be any issues. I don’t want my dog to be responsible for harming or potentially killing the puppy, as Dexter has never been around an adolescent dog before.

I told roommate this, and explicitly stated that if there were any issues that Dexter gets to stay because he was here first. My roommate did not like this and found it very unfair.

So what say you, AITA?

Edit: I should clarify some things. 

1) Dexter is not a problem dog in my opinion, but he did come from a shelter. I’m not sure what his past was, but he gets nervous around other dogs. This can culminate in aggression if he feels threatened enough, but he gets along with probably 75% of the dogs he meets. I don’t know or even think Dexter would kill this dog, but I want to absolutely sure that isn’t a possibility.

2) My wording was off, but my roomie does *not* think he should have to take the time to set up a meet and greet if he doesn’t want to.

3) My title is misleading. I’m fine with roomie getting a dog. I am not fine with it being a dog that my dog doesn’t get along with. I feel this is reasonable, roomie does not.

Now that a decision has been reached and this won’t unduly influence the results....

for a good majority of my life, my sister has had it out for me, always wanting to push my buttons and annoy me. she belittles me and cause me mental stress, im sure she knows this. of course as we’re getting older it’s slightly dying down - though it still happens. we’ll put it as - for the greater part of my childhood and teenage years, she’s made it her mission to push my buttons. i haven’t gotten along with her for a while.

unfortunately, this isn’t the only reason i want to keep my distance. on a few occasions she’s sexually harassed me. one example of this is her shoving her ass in my face while i was trying to get to a vending machine in a hotel. obviously i’m disgusted and don’t want to be assaulted by my own sister. it’s fucking gross. these “situations” she puts me in have happened more than once.

recently my mom told me that she wishes i was nicer to my sister. this is really all i can disclose on a throwaway.

One of my roommates (Henceforth as C ) has been spiraling and reached out about wanting to go inpatient this morning. I have issues when people come to me about sensitive things like that and I tend to shut down so I had our other roommate (Henceforth R ) come down with me to his room to talk to him. Long story short we ubered with him to the intake place around noon or so. They only let one guest in at a time so she went and I kinda just chilled in another area waiting for her and for updates.

 Around 4:30, R and I leave to go get food as we hadn't eaten all day. Later on R's boyfriend G comes to join us at like 6.  Keep in mind I had stated that I was tired and wanted to head home several times because I was tired but said I didn't want to leave right then, most of those times I mentioned that were before G came if I remember correctly. My memory is shit in general, this will be important later.

7 rolls around and we all head back to where C is at inpatient, he has been waiting there all day because they are still trying to find a place to put him.

She goes in. G and I remain outside. I'm getting really tired from the emotional drain and a bit anxious so I tell him that I want to play video games and that I'm going home.

It was my understanding that we wouldn't switch off and that she would come out when visiting hours are up, none of this was directly stated.

I'm home and around 9:30 G and R knock on my door and they are upset because I left. I tried to explain that I was tired, G interrupted and said that was not what I said and that I said I wanted to play video games. Which I didn't see a problem with seeing as I had also stated that I was tired. I tried to explain but they kept interrupting me. R tells me that C wanted to see me so she went to come get me and that when she came out that I wasn't out there and they wouldn't let her back in, and now he is going to be sitting there all alone all night because of this and that he's on a 72 hour hold so he can't even just leave or be transferred anywhere because they don't have beds and that I am going to have to explain this all to him tomorrow morning when he calls us."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bwiwi5	2019-06-04 01:34:43		AITA for disliking an ig page my boyfriend used to follow?	"So my boyfriend and got into an argument the other day regarding a page he used to follow on Instagram. This may sound like the typical jealous insecure controlling girlfriend thing but hear me out. 
MY VIEW:
When we first met I made it VERY clear to him that I don't like porn, or anything with explicit sexual content. I’ve been like this as long as I can remember.I’m not a porn watcher. And Instagram pages that objectify woman just aren’t my thing. It’s definitely not going out of style anytime soon, but I believe that I have a right to not be around something that makes me uncomfortable. I know I’m different so that’s why I made it such a point BEFORE we got serious to explain to my boyfriend how much hurt those things have caused me in the past and for that reason I choose to live my life away from it. 

He was following a friend who is a photographer on Instagram. He is a very talented photographer and I do not have anything against him as a person. If this is how he makes his money I totally respect that.BUT the only subject matter of these photos are half naked woman. Why in the world would he think I would be okay with him following a page like this? I’ve stated my views on things like this in the beginning of our relationship. And he AGREED on then. So where is the confusion? 

My boyfriend is a good guy, and a very supportive friend. Anytime a friends release a new song or new piece of art he’s stoked for them and their success. He doesn’t have a wandering eye, nor does he have the want to follow ig hoes etc. so why can’t he support his friend by following his page even if he doesn’t actually “like” any of the photos. He feels like he “lost a friend” which I think is ridiculous... what “friend” bases your so-called friendship off a social media follow? That’s some backwards ass 2019 logic if you ask me. 
MY VIEW 
He knows what he signed up for. When I meant explicit content makes me uncomfortable. I meant it. And even if this photographer is his friend it doesn’t matter to me. That logic doesn’t make sense to me. Just because this guy is his friend why does that mean everything we’ve discussed doesn’t apply because oh it’s his friend? Um no? He doesn’t follow any other pages like this because he thinks it’s trashy and agrees with me on ig models etc. but oh because this guy is his friend that somehow changes the content? No..
Also I do think there’s other ways he can support his friend without having to look at his content. Even my therapist asked what catastrophic events happened because he unfollowed his friend? Literally nothing! His friend never said anything, never contacted him because of it. And in all honesty I believe he doesn’t even know my boyfriend unfollowed him because he has a lot of followers. If this guy was truly his friend and had an issue with my boyfriend unfollowing him wouldn’t he just call him and ask? I think real friends would understand.

bwivf9	2019-06-04 01:31:40		WIBTA if I sought a job I now want to quit.	"Greetings everyone, last summer (2018) I decided that mowing lawns was not enough money, so I talked around looking for a decent job. A friend recommended me a job that had apparently really flexible hours, a relaxing workplace, and often you get paid to sit and do nothing. I was stoked about the job!
       One problem with me that I have discovered is that, without being cocky, I literally need to be keeping busy and not sitting down all the time, hense why I love mowing lawns. I wasn't really worried about this job though. So I do the interview and it went fantastic! So I got hired and started getting certified at what I want to do. Got certified and then saw the schedule. Jesus Christ. I can't work this day and this day and that day. Just to give some backstory I am a 1st chair instrumentalist in my local band and I am really really busy all the time. 
       And to top it off it seems that the hours are not as flexible as the fine eye may see. The really huge problem here also is that I got offered a contruction job with a relative. I love building stuff and have always been an ""outdoorsie"" individual. 
       So if you put yourself in my shoes what would you do? Would you last the summer and then not work the next. Or put in your two weeks and leave? I just feel horrible about the situation because if I quit everyone around me will hate me. My coworkers hours could get super messed up because of me."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

She recently ordered some maternity dresses which were sort of provocative. I mean like, so skin tight, that you can see the outline of her belly button in some of them.  You can see the outline of every body part (breasts, ass, thighs) and her bump sticking out clearly. Even though she's not revealing any skin, because of the way her body is shaped  (thin with big tits and hips, with the belly bump) it makes her look quite sexual. I don't want her to attract the wrong kind of attention because I know how men think, and there are some weird people out there with pregnancy fetishes, etc. I do notice other men looking at her when we're out and it makes me uncomfortable. Also, in our culture, the bump is supposed to be covered otherwise it could attract the 'evil eye'.  She shows her bump on purpose, and I'm questioning why, it's almost like she knows she gets attention and enjoys it. I don't want my wife/unborn baby to be sexually objectified by random men so I told her she should dress comfortably, and modestly and now she is upset with me. AITA?	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bwiu0q	2019-06-04 01:27:48	AHHaSpider	AITA for pretty much shutting down on my date because she brought up a former sexual partner?	"So last night me and this girl that I had started dating recently went out for a fun evening. We went outdoors, grabbed some food and headed over to a bar. At the bar we both ended up running into a lot of friends when I came across my friend, we’ll say “Jeff”. me and Jeff sidebar while she talks to some of her friends. Once we get back together she says, “So.. you know Jeff?” “Oh yeah! We used to work together and blah blah blah. Do you know him?” She then Starts this story about how they were talking to each other at one point and about a date they had. We’re both very sexual people and had done our rounds with many partners before we got together so I already assumed the story was going to end with, “we hooked up.” 

That is indeed where it went but her phrasing... she goes on about the date and how he came over and, “Fucked me.” ... what... not saying, “We had sex,” or “we hooked up” or even “we banged,” I would have been fine with that but no, she says, “Yeah so later that night he came over and fucked me.” She continues on about how he ghosted her and things fell off.  But I lost all focus. For some reason that specific way of saying it put me in a weird tailspin. I got quieter and only started having conversation with people that approached our table and I started to keep it light with her. I felt so weird after hearing that especially since he was at the table right behind us and you could just feel how awkward it was around us. 

She then (I guess noticing my mood) said that the sex was terrible and that she faked it most of the experience. I don’t want to hear details! I don’t care if it was bad and you’re trying to make me feel better I just don’t want to know! We finished our rounds and went our separate ways back home. I don’t care that they hooked up it’s just the way she put it. I gave her a half hearted hug and she gave me a peck on the cheek and I went home. 

She messaged me today saying I didn’t have to act like that in the situation and that I should just relax because it was like 3 months ago. AITA for getting “weird” about the situation?

EDIT: so consensus says I’m the asshole. And ya know, I’m cool with that. This is clearly a personal  hang up of mine that I let get in the way of a fun night with someone I really like. I just need to grow up and if I say I’m ok with being open about those things, I need to be open to it all I guess? Idk still kinda on the fence myself but I’ll take the judgment. Also, we’re fine! It was one little tif and we’ve both gotten over it since then.

EDIT: funny enough since even my last edit, there’s been a surge of NAH. Thanks for confusing me everyone.. haha but I think people are forgetting the alcohol that was involved. By the time we got to the bar we were both about a 6 pack in(from our time outdoors) 2 margs(when we ate) and another “fish bowl marg” each and two shots(that we took at the bar. In all honesty, I’m going to chalk this one up to alcohol being a big factor. She was probably drunk and had no filter, I was drunk and had no rationality to the situation. I think in each others eyes we both just kinda messed up."	Asshole	0	0	848.0	69.0	0.0	0.0

So I've been working for this construction company for about two months now and its a pretty shitty place, they're ignoring their paying customers, their creditors aren't getting paid and their employees are barely getting paid. Every payday, which I was told is a Monday but is actually a Thursday, I need to ask them where my pay is and our Construction Manager still hasn't been paid from last Thursday.

That's, not my issue today as I'm looking for a new job and hope to be out of here in the next couple of weeks. No, my issue is something that happened an hour ago. Yesterday I had my phone plugged in (Samsung s9), once it was fully charged I unplugged it and left my charger on my desk because I thought 'everyone in this office uses an iPhone, even the bosses kids use iPhones, no one will need this and even if they do they'll ask for it'. So when I came into work this morning I checked my phone to see if it needed charging as its been playing up recently and not staying charged, nope its all good but let me just keep my charger close just in case.

I look over to where I put it yesterday afternoon and it wasn't there. I immediately ask a couple of people and they say that they haven't seen it, I also check my desk and my drawers pretty thoroughly, nada. So I sit down silently seething and pissed that someone stole my charger. an hour later my boss walks in, and I ask him if he has seen it.

""Oh yeah, I think I have it"". He then proceeds to go into his office and grab it and give it back. No apology and no explanation as to why he has my Samsung 9 charger.

The two of them REALLY didn’t get along at first. We did the whole keep them separated and sock thing, waited weeks to introduce them, the whole nine yards. When we did introduce them there was a lot of hissing and aggression. 

Currently they’re doing a lot better. I’ve been working really hard on that. Sometimes they get into cat fights but they’re easily separated and it never gets too vicious. I really think that ziggy is just learning Otty’s boundaries since she’s a super energetic playful kitty and Otty is lazy and prefers to relax. The other day Ziggy was actually grooming Otty. 

My husband however, thinks we need to give up Otty. He says he thinks Otty isn’t happy here and that he’d do better in a home as a solo cat. But given that they’re improving every week,  I kind of suspect that my husband doesn’t want to deal with Otty. He meows a lot, gets into stuff he shouldn’t, and sometimes doesn’t make it to the litter box. And as mentioned before he’s pretty drippy and he loves to rub his face on ours so that can get kinda gross. My husband always gets mad at Otty for everything and has a preference for ziggy. 

I’m super bonded with Otty and I love that tiny creature to death though, so I might not be objective. Am I the asshole for keeping him even though they don’t get along yet?

C started to take sides with V on EVERYTHING. Literally the answer could be 2 but if V said it was 3 it was 3 to C. NO. MATTER. WHAT.

Around a month later,   V got more toxic. V started to avoid any sort of question and point the finger at someone else, no matter the severity of the question. I tried to keep in contact for 3 months, but as soon as V said this exact sentence (we were playing uno fyi) “YOU only reversed it because I was going to win before (random person) won you b****”

I LOST MY MIND. 

I texted V a paragraph about how crappy V has treated us and that I was sick of it. I said that I was done pretending and just said bluntly “you are a manipulative a**hole.”

bwipw8	2019-06-04 01:16:26	Thatlilone	AITA for calling a girl a cockroach after she 'jokingly' throws it away?	"My friend and his gf of a few months came by for dinner and drinks this weekend along with my fiance and a couple other mutual friends. At some point I took off my wedding and engagement rings so I can cook and get chicken all over my hands (salmonella is bad kids) without worrying about them. After we eat and dishes are placed in the sink I reach blindly for my rings  since I always put them in a specific notch in the counter and only feel one.

Cue panic. I asked everyone if they've seen the wedding band anywhere or if it got knocked off the counter and it got to a point where I was on all fours on the ground hyperventilating while me and our friends searched.

I showed them all a picture of it in case and the gf goes ""oh that thing? I thought it was foil I threw it away!""

Record scratch. Dafuq? Everyone was staring at her and I'm pretty sure my face was changing colors more rapidly than metal under a blowtorch. She starts giggling and points at the trash. The trash is about half full of food prep stuff and puppy pads because we have a disabled French bulldog that literally cant control his bowels so yeah. Pads.

""What it was an honest mistake! You left it with the other food stuffs and I was just trying to help!""

I asked if she was serious and she shrugged and repeated that it was just a mistake and the ring would most likely be sitting on top of everything. Cursory glance said nope. My saint SO offers to dig it out and I was too furious to say anything so I just nodded and glared at her. My friend (the bf) helps him too and they do end up finding it after nearly puking from the dog doo. After they wash it off they place it on a towel to dry and the gf still kept saying that she accidentally mistook it for foil.

I turn to her and in a calmness that afterwards left me shaking and lightheaded said ""You need to leave now, before I crush your face because I ACCIDENTALLY mistook you for cockroach.""

My friend and her gasp and our other friends kinda stared at each other and back at me.

Gf bursts into tears and storms out. My friend follows her after an angry glare at me. Our other friends told me I took it too far and maybe she was just playing a prank etc. They even mentioned that it was because my wedding band was not that expensive it wouldn't have been a big deal if we lost it. My SO asks them to leave too as I am about to lay the wrath of God into them.

So reddit, am I the asshole here? Did I overreact?

**Tldr friends gf throws my ring away ""accidentally"" so I tell her to gtfo before accidentally confusing her for a cockroach.**

**Edit: lots of comments to muddle thru so I'll add one here.**

Thank you to all the comments even the ones saying iata. I recognize that threatening violence was not okay and I regret that part but if I'm an asshole for comparing her to a disgusting pest I don't want to be right.

Some clarity as well - she NEVER apologized which is why I dont think it was accidental. She was chuckling and snorting while my SO and her bf dug through dog shit and food peels. She knew she fucked up because she didn't make eye contact with me at all while they were doing it either. Even her bf doesn't think it was accidental after I talked to him today, but that it was harmless and we didn't really lose the ring and I shouldn't have called her a cockroach.

The ring, although inexpensive is sparkly and does not look like foil. It was absolutely insulting that my friends thought it was a non issue that they thought that I can just buy a new one if I had actually lost it. I'll post a picture in a bit to clear up confusion.

Edit 3: last edit for the night Here are the rings put together: [http://imgur.com/a/zqfKYr1](http://imgur.com/a/zqfKYr1)

Thank you to everyone with different perspectives. I'll say it again, I shouldn't have threatened her, yes it was in the heat of the moment but her smug laughing face pushed me over the edge. Not an excuse. Maybe I'm biased to not think my ring separately looks like foil but really its seeming less and less of a mistake when you consider that putting foil in compost makes no sense. She could've tossed it in the other two bins but she put it in the one we told them only food scraps and biological wet trash goes into. Like they've been to our house before. The bf is still going to be my friend since honestly I don't blame him for the things she chose to do. That's her agency. Not my problem.

&#x200B;

EDIT 4 FINAL EDIT. (will be adding to this as I read through)

I have read through most-ish of the comments so I will try and answer multiples of questions here and also some clarifications.

1. *Why are you wearing your wedding ring if you're just engaged?* \- My fiance and I went shopping for wedding bands together after he gave me the engagement ring. When we found one that remotely fits, we took it home and pried it open wide enough to fit the engagement ring, and I wanted to wear it already and he agreed.
2. I am also a girl, they were at my house.
3. *Why is there poo in the kitchen trash?* \- We have 3 bins in the house. 2 of them are open air, one for recycling, the other for non-recycling. The poo pad + compost bin is metal and covered and double bagged. We've had our disabled dog for around 6 months and this is the method that has worked for us because it's a hassle to run outside with drippy poo pee pads 3-5 times a day.
4. I recognize IATA for threatening violence. I do not feel bad about calling her a cockroach.
5. *Why are you focusing your question on calling her a cockroach when you should be asking about the ""crushing her face"" deal?* \- At the time, and even now, our friends thought that the cockroach bit and telling her to leave was the bit that went too far.
6. *How do you know she did it on purpose?* \- She still hasn't apologized, even if it was accidental. She did not throw anything else away because I throw everything I don't need away as I cook. She has been to my house many times. She has seen my rings together on my finger often. **Also, if she accidentally threw away some 'foil' she wouldn't have recognized that she did from seeing the picture.**
7. *But you found it so why are you still making a big deal about it?* \- If I didn't reach for my rings at the time and they left after dinner, we would have thrown away the bin and it would have been lost forever.
8. Thank you to all the people that say my rings are beautiful.
9. I didn't even realize the title said ""it"" until this morning, sorry about that.
10. *Why do they even know the value of the ring?* \- We found them separately on Etsy and got both pieces for a bargain and bragged about it when we got them.
11. *What is the stone in the engagement ring? -* Alexandrite. It changes color depending on ambient lighting.
12. We will be investing in a ring saucer to place my rings in when cooking to mitigate any future incidents.
13. *How long have you known these people? -* The GF has been around for 7-8 months and we have hung out many many times before and during my engagement. The BF has been a close friend for around 10 years and no, I am not cutting him out. The other 2 guests are acquaintances that I've known for about a year. 

I am pretty sure I missed something else but [here is the dog tax of Jackson](https://imgur.com/gallery/8Bol5WA) that some of the people have asked for. I will keep trying to respond to the comments but this really blew up. Thank you for your perspectives.

I've known here for about 2 years now, and for a long time she was one of my closest friends. I'd hang out with her and a few other people after school and we'd all have a great time. Eventually, I started dating one of the girls in the group, and the other one got mad and left. F was still my friend, but she wouldn't stop flirting with me. I started making it obvious that I didn't want to be friends and eventually i just blocked her (for more reasons than the flirting but that's a different story) anyway, a few weeks ago I was trying to get a shift covered and I texted her asking if she could cover my shift. She actually never texted me back. I was pissed off, but whatever, i wasn't her friend anyway. Well she sends me a text today asking if she could take my shift next friday, because it's her last day and she wants to close.

bwinpx	2019-06-04 01:10:36		AITA for wanting to eat dinner by myself occasionally to for alone time?	"Background:
My (24F) GF (27F) have been dating for close to two years. We live together and have two dogs. I would say our relationship is super solid. We do have different personalities. She doesn’t need a ton of alone time and I would describe myself as an ambivert. I’m outgoing and get energy from social situations, but sometimes communication can seriously drain me.

Jump to today:
Yesterday I worked on the house for 10 hours as we are renovating. She was home yesterday during and we had a nice late dinner after I finished working on the house. I feel like we spent a fair amount of time together this weekend. I planned and bought us tickets on Saturday for a beer festival. So it was a good weekend! 

I work as an academic advisor and had a super draining day today working with lots of students. So when I got home today I was a bit cranky. I was so drained. I spent about two hours hanging out with her and the dogs talking, cuddling, and watching tv. 

I can tell when I need alone time, but sometimes I begin to dread it because we’ve gotten in arguments before where her feelings get hurt that I want to eat dinner alone. I don’t know why but eating meals alone is something I’ve always done that helps energize me. I’ve always been an independent person so I was used to eating alone much of my life. I get food and read articles, the news, sometimes just do social media, or read a book. 

We’ve eaten dinner together for at least the last 7 nights. So tonight she asks about dinner and I mention how I am craving Sushi or Chinese, which she doesn’t really like anyways. She offers to go and I say that I would rather go by myself to get alone time and zone out after a hard day. But I would also be happy to get her food on my back. She gets upset that I want to eat by myself. She thinks that it she’s my person she should energize me and I should want to spend time with her. I try to explain how it’s not personal and I’ve always needed alone time. That I like spending time with her. Her feelings are hurt and I’m left feeling like I’ll never get her to understand how she makes me joyful but I will literally always need maybe 1/9 dinners to myself. When I ask her if she ever feels drained by people she says no. So she wouldn’t get the whole alone time thing. 

I love this woman with all my heart, but it kills me that she gets hurt feelings by something I can’t helped. I tried to explain it’s just how my brain works. But maybe there is something I am missing. AITA here reddit? 

Tldr; spent lots of time with the GF this weekend. Had a draining day at work. She gets hurt feelings when I want to/go to dinner (1/7-9 nights a week) by myself and zone out."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bwinfb	2019-06-04 01:09:46	throw3333adsfas	AITA since I asked a friend to move out	"Sorry for the formatting.. ya da ya da. English is my first language so all the grammatical mistakes are on me.

&#x200B;

I recently moved to this new city so I don't really know a lot of people here. I live in a studio here (Important later). A friend of mine, let's call him Jon, is moving to this city too. He would've come a couple weeks later but since I don't know anyone, I convinced him to come about 2 weeks earlier, crash at my place, party and finalize his housing situation in this new city. He found a new place which he liked. It was available like a week later, so he would be staying at my studio for 3 weeks (1 week extra than what we discussed initially). Not ideal, but ok.

&#x200B;

Now after 1 week, an emergency happened. Another friend of mine (let's call him Bob) got kicked out of his apartment for reasons which are not relevant to this post. I've known him for 3 years and he really needed a place to stay. Like REALLY REALLY needed it. He recently got fired so he has no income and getting a temp airbnb would stretch him really thin. I asked Bob to move in with me temporarily. Now, since I live in a studio, there is no way 3 people can stay there. So, I asked Jon to move out (giving him a week's notice) at the date he was originally supposed to move out on. Jon got pissed saying that he'd have to spend a ton of money on airbnb for the extra week. He claimed that he would have only moved to the new city after finalizing the housing to avoid paying this extra cost and only moved to the city earlier based on our discussion. He was totally unsympathetic to Bob's situation when I know that he can afford the airbnb for the extra week while Bob can't.

bwik6z	2019-06-04 01:00:53		AITA For being rude to my boyfriends brother?	"Terrified of being judged, but I want an unbiased opinion or as unbiased as it gets from info told from my POV.

So, my boyfriend and I have been dating for three years and are in our late twenties. Solid, healthy relationship. I worry about my BF, primarily his relationship with his family. Most are great.

But his brother is an entirely separate issue. I had a huge bias against him due to his previous drug use (and subsequently putting my BF in dangerous and compromising situations when he was a child.) However, I acted polite to him when I met him. After all, people change. I noticed pretty much immediately that the brother is the type to go on for hours about himself, cut you off when you’re talking and literally walk away when you talk about yourself.

That’s not a problem for me because I have never said spoken about myself to him in the past three years. I’m surprised he knows my name, honestly. Still, I tried to engage with him in a friendly manner. However, one day he tells a bunch of us that his only “real family” is his wife and kids. That deflated my boyfriend a bit because he adores his brother, and the comment hurt him. He even voiced to me that he felt like their relationship has been one sided over the past few years.

So, during the last family get together, I made it my job that he couldn’t get in a word edge wise all day. He’d start going off an a rant about something regarding him and his life and I’d jump in with a topic of conversation that derailed his. I’d cut in to ask his parents about their wedding day, or ask his wife about how she’s liking work. I turned my back to him and tried to get everyone talking but him. It got so bad that he eventually got up and left the room to sit alone.

Once he left, my boyfriend was a lot more social and their grandma commented that he could finally get a word in now that his brother wasn’t there. 

When we went home, my boyfriend commented that everyone noticed that I was shutting his brother down at every turn. He told me he deserved it, but now I’m worried that I had no right to be rude because I’m just the girlfriend. AITA for being petty in a situation that doesn’t really involve me?

bwijlw	2019-06-04 00:59:25	Taylorgbb0	AITA for walking out on my job without telling anyone?	"About a month ago I was a barista for a small chain bakery (they have like, 3 stores). The job was pretty fun and I do believe I was a good employee. I was the only barista the company hired who could do things like latte art which they used for their promotions and did the rest of my job skillfully and effectively. Things started going south when two of my coworkers left. I was wondering what was wrong and the 
Patissier told me that the company was going under which made sense considering I was paid 9$ an hour and we'd only sell maybe a 5$ item every two hours. However that's not even what really made me left. One of my roommates had, in short, lost his mind again and admitted himself back into the mental hospital he was formerly admitted at. I told the manager to tell the owner that I could no longer afford to pay my rent since we now had to pay our roommates rent working only 15 hours a week. I knew they had hours to give since two people had literally just left. She then told me ""well we give out hours depending on how hard working the employee is"". I told her that if I don't have at least 20 hours on my schedule next week that I literally wouldn't be able to afford working there. She said, ""I'll see"" and sure enough, only 8 hours the next week. I checked indeed and sure enough they're hiring new people ""willing to work 20-25 hours"". I literally did not come in for any of those hours, blocked my managers, and got a new job immediately. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	72.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

bwiiqs	2019-06-04 00:57:04	badfriend766	AITA for being strict with the rules, with my mother?	"I had no idea what to call this post so let me explain. Also just got off work so sorry for grammar/spelling.

Im 24, and got a labor job right away out of highschool, it pays very well and has great benifits, becuase of this i was able to buy the condo my parents where renting at the time, i told them to keep the downstairs part, id live in the upstairs. I agreed to charge them half of what the other guy was charging, becuase i just wanted to cover some neccesities, not make a profit of my parents. 

We live very independently, on my wishes. Everything we have is seperate, and although we visit eachother everyday, and after work i have dinner with them some nights, for the most part i like to have a fair bit of privacy.

When i first bought the place, i made 2 rules clear, they were not ever allowed to enter my area unless i was home and gave them permission and they where not allowed to guilt trip me if i didnt want company (sometimes its becuase i have other plans with my GF/friends, or i had a long day at work). No matter the reason they had to respect that.

The first few months was good, they followed the rules, and i enjoyed spending more time with my parents than i would had i moved across town. But the rules started to get broken more. At first it was my mom using the emergency key to get into my home too do laundry, clean up, and do dishes. I told her i appreciate it but i like my privacy, and it stopped. Until it started up again but this time she was doing those things and borrowing stuff (mostly pots, pans, food products/ingrediants they forgot) 

They always respected the 2nd rule, but the 1st one was always trampled over, until last night. Last night my car was in the shop, and they must have forgot becuase i was laying in bed, post sex with my GF, and i heard the front door open, went to check and they are in my kitchen, casually doing dishes. I walked in half naked and politely asked them to leave. But that wasnt the end of it.

I went down later that night and told them if they didnt start respecting rule 1, i was raising rent back up to what it was before, and that im dead serious. I used this as a threat becuase my parents are not poor, and i know they could still afford it, i just know they wouldnt be able to afford as many luxuries as they have recently been buying. 

my parents didnt say anything, but i got a mile long text from my brother basically calling me a huge dick, and telling me to respect my mother.

bwii8y	2019-06-04 00:55:30	klael2481	AITA for not wanting to leave my house before divorce finalized?	" 

Hello,

My wife and I are going to get a divorce (we just got married 7 months ago), She has three kids that are not mine. She refuses to live here with her kids with me in the house. The reason is because she says she does not feel safe. She feels I make the kids 'uncomfortable' and she is afraid I'm going to talk to them in an 'uncomfortable manner'. The reason for this is because once we decided to get a divorce I told her oldest daughter that I was going to need the key to the car that we bought her back so that we can sell the 14,250 dollar car we were going to give her for her birthday. The title is in my and my wife's name, and we both split the cost. So essentially I am owed 7,125 post divorce or we sell the car and split the profits.

Her two youngest kids can stay with their father until school is out and then either stay there, or stay with their grandparents, (either set) or stay with the aunt(s)/uncle(s), whatever. The oldest can either stay with grandparents, or go to her aunts which she was planning on doing anyway, or stay with her father.

I am legally allowed to stay without a court order (which she is going to try and get) so while I am legally right am I the asshole?

bwign0	2019-06-04 00:50:59	crumpetstufferoonie	AITA for waking up my passive aggressive room mate by mistake	"AITA? I got in late from a day out, home
maybe about 10:00pm? I ate and watched a movie, and then showered and tidied my room a bit, probably until 1 am. This room mate has a hectic schedule and needs her sleep. I guess I was not as quiet as I could have been, but I wasn’t intentionally being loud. 

It’s just that the walls are very thin in this house and my room is echoey bc of hard floors. I feel like I can’t do norwl activities without this room mate hearing me. I can’t listen to music or watch a movie on low volume, she asks me to turn it off - that’s fine every once in a while and I’m happy to oblige. But it does suck that I can’t do normal things in the room like type or open drawers or talk on the phone. Once she asked me to talk quieter when I was on the phone to my brother in the afternoon.

So I guess I’m not being loud - but operating doing normal tasks in my room. I think some closing of drawers woke her up and I heard her say something through the wall, which alerted me she was awake. Then later I was moving my wallet and coins fell out by mistake. I heard her say “oh my god” and sigh really loudly through the wall. I just feel like that was passive aggressive, esp with her other sometimes passive aggressive tendencies in other situations. I understand that she’s frustrated bc she needs sleep but I feel like I should be able to do normal activities in my room and she should be able to realise that I’m not trying to wake her up on purpose.

bwideb	2019-06-04 00:42:16	Lockeyy20	WIBTA if i stopped talking to a friend with autism over his girlfriend?	"Context:

We are in grade 12 and graduate this year. Back in late 2018, he met a girl who is in grade 10. They seemed to kind of hit it off, and got together. 

My friend, who i'll call John, seemed to stop talking to me and our other friends. Not entirely, but he definitely slowed down talking to us.

So.. fast forward to around Christmas time, and I get a message from him that basically says:

""she fucking cheated on me man how the fuck could she do this, im heartbroken etc.""

So, I tried my best to be supportive, but i'm not the best when it comes to that kind of stuff. 

They separated, and she was not happy about that, claiming that she didn't cheat, that it was all a big misunderstanding etc.

He doesn't believe her.

(Side note, he told us that she would take his phone from him, and some messages were her actually. A few times he actually threatened to break up our friend group if we didn't stop messaging him so much. So.. put 2 and 2 together..)

 But.. she cheated and he was done with her, right? 

Today he told us that he was going to just take a 'him day', and get some stuff ready for grad. We basically tell him to have a good one.

So, me and my other friends go to our school gym only to find him making out with his ex. When he sees us he kind of flies off the rails and calls us creeps, & stuff

(him freaking out like that is common)

After, he came to me and apologized saying he was only trying to impress his girl by acting tough.

I was upset that he lied to our faces about what he would be doing, and that he snapped at us for literally being in his presence. I basically told him that I wasn't in the mood to deal with him and that he should message me later. 

So he messages the gc, the convo:

Me:""John, she literally cheated on you before, and hurt you. She cut you off from your friends, don't be a fucking idiot. Please, we care about you too much. She has so many red flags man, come on.""

John:""true friends would be happy for me, you guys obviously hate me.""

""i love her and all you guys want to do is tear us apart and im fed up.""

""I guess you guys must hate her or something?""

So... him suddenly going from ""I want to apologize, and still be friends"" to ""YOU GUYS ARENT TRUE FRIENDS AND YOU HATE MY GIRLFRIEND"" suddenly is pretty suspicious.

After trying to talk sense into him a bit more, I've given up.

I told him to not speak to us anymore. This girl who was literally trying to force him into leaving us behind and only focusing on her, was the girl he got back with.

To me, it seems like he chose her over us. 

Does that make me an asshole?

It's not the fact that he has a girlfriend, it's the fact that she was almost abusive, wanted to end our friendship with him, tried to isolate him, etc... and then he gets back with her? It feels like all these years, were for nothing. It makes me nauseous.

But.. part of me says im an asshole. That he cant help it with his autism, and we're basically some of his only friends, and we'd be abandoning him.

bwicf5	2019-06-04 00:39:23	ZaiaFantasy	AITA for expecting my friend to make sure her dog behaves?	"I have a friend, let's call her Jane. Jane has a dog named Sparky. Sparky was a rescue 6 years ago and is now 10. She was raised in a puppy mill and abused and is generally a very sweet dog. 

However, because she was abused my friend never disciplines or trains her dog. She's not awful but she loves food. She's constantly underfoot in my tiny apartment kitchen and I'm afraid of her getting hurt and finally instituted a rule that she's no longer allowed in the food room and have trained her myself to follow this rule despite asking Jane to take responsibility for it and why. Alternatively, she will constantly beg and jump up on the couch when people are eating trying to get to plates. While not a huge issue, it's still something I feel she should take responsibility for. After all, it's her pet. If we leave our plates she will hastily jump up and try to get to them. I don't feel like it's unreasonable to expect her to not try to get people's food while they're eating or if they get up to go to the bathroom, etc. Otherwise, I have no problem with Sparky. I just want Jane to be a responsible and considerate pet owner.

Jane, by the way, is completely in denial about her dog's behavior and will make jokes about her bad behavior and makes excuses. Her logic is that since Sparky isn't biting anyone or pottying on the carpet she's a model dog.

Admittedly, our last argument was about this same issue. I was attending a large con for the first time and have anxiety issues and the stress of dealing with the dog would have made them worse along with large crowds and unfamiliar territory. She went off then about how I was attacking her and hate the dog, etc. 3 of us that know her pitched together and got a hotel room. We invited her because she doesn't have a lot of money and when this argument went down she acted like she was entitled to the room despite her pet sitter falling through (an original agreement for the room) and did not seem to care how this would affect me. Her last words to me at the con were ""Next year I hope you can open your mind and allow Sparky"" which just floored me since Sparky was never the issue. She honestly just didn't care about how I'd feel. She seems to think her dog is an angel. She's not bad, just not disciplined at all.

We see each other twice a month for a weekly game night with some friends and tonight she asked if Sparky can come. I said, once again, that as long as she watches out for her dog and makes sure she minds her manners I was fine with her coming. This launched her into an entire tirade about how I was freaking out, her dog is old and shouldn't be made to behave, and how obviously I don't like or welcome her pet. I ended up with a knot in my stomach and a near anxiety attack for being badgered about asking for something I consider reasonable.

AITA here? Is what I'm asking unreasonable? I feel like if this issue continues I'll lose an otherwise decent friend. Though, admittedly, I'm losing a lot of respect for her now and might end up losing her anyway."	Not the A-hole	0	0	276.0	10.0	0.0	0.0

We talk about what we’ll do with her or how we’ll get dressed, how we’ll pose on photos and stuff.  We literally planned all that stuff 2 months before the prom.

There is this guy Tom, which Mary had a crush on 3 years ago. And he was getting close with her. In the prom morning, in our class group chat, Tom randomly texts “is my date ready?” and Mary texts back “yep, on my way there!! See you tonight:)” and of course, I’m like “wtf?”

I text Mary on what was that about and she goes “Uh yeah sorry Tom asked me 2 days ago and I didn’t want to break his heart you know, so I said yes. But I’ll hang out with you too! I promise!!” Ouch.

The idea of Tom and Mary makes me happy since she had a crush on him first. But the fact that she took me for granted and couldn’t refuse him made me really hurt and felt like I was her “backup”. I went to prom and didn’t talk to her (she was busy hanging out with Tom anyway)

Then, Mary and I sat next to each other in a table with 15 people and chatted. I had to get up because a very close friend of mine (ironically who asked me to prom but I denied because of Mary) arrived, I went and had a chat with her for 1-minute max.

I come back, and Mary is sitting with Tom. Tom, sitting on MY seat. I go “Uhm, I was just sitting here??” And Tom goes “But you got up.” I look at Mary like “is he being real” and she says “nothing we can do about it” and laughs. At that point, I’m super done. I go to another table even though my other friends tried to convince me going back there.

This is the part I regret. For the rest of the night, Tom decided to go and have some fun with his friends, Mary was alone. Everybody else (including me) was having the time of their life dancing.

Seeing Mary being left alone hurt me. But I was also angry at her for ditching me like this, I just went and had a very good time.

2 years have passed and we’re still best friends. It makes me sad that we didn’t get to have fun at the only Prom we would have. So I wanted to ask this community as well, thanks for reading!"	Not the A-hole	0	0	171.0	92.0	0.0	0.0
bwi9do	2019-06-04 00:30:51	RealPorkyBrand	WIBTA if I shared a photo of a child online in an attempt to satiate my curiosity?	"My grandad passed away last month and today my Nan was sorting through some of his things that are in the garage. Mainly it's stuff like tools, model airplanes, junk, and some painting equipment. Amongst the things, there was a photo of a very young blond boy. On the back of the photo it says, ""Jensen, 2 years."" The boy in the photo could very well be 2 years old. Neither my Nan or I recognise the boy in the photo. He's not in a school uniform, but the photo is in a very similar style to a school photo - dark blue cardboard frame with an oval hole to see the photo and 'Tempest Photography' written in gold around the edge of the oval. The boy is wearing a light blue denim shirt with a small brown teddy and a white t-shirt visible underneath. He has a bowl haircut and blue eyes. 

We'd like to know who he is and that's the dilemma here.

I know that recently there was a bit of a discussion about someone posting the photo of the girl and a man outside the Notre Dame before it set on fire. The argument being that it's wrong to make someone go viral just to quench your curiosity. I'm double cautious because I'm hopefully about to start teacher training in September and if people did have a problem with me sharing the photo, it could end up coming back to bite me on the ass. There could also be issues regarding GDPR, although I'm not sure finding a random photo on your own property and then posting it online would breach those. Additionally, my grandparents have only had this house for 15 years, so if the boy in the photo is 2 years old then he'd only be a maximum of 17 years old now; still a child. If it went viral and I tracked him down, he might not be best pleased at having his baby photo all over the internet.

So yeah, WIBTA if I shared this kid's photo just to find out who he is (and why my grandad had his photo in the garage)?"	No A-holes here	0	0	1316.0	73.0	0.0	0.0

Its pretty hypocritical considering she told me she had not self-care at a time cuz she was very depressed so she just had sex in highschool. Then again she says how different she is as a person, and how much she improved.

bwi7vy	2019-06-04 00:26:47	languagelover17	AITA for distancing myself from my friends?	"I just spent a year studying abroad. There were six of us who hung out, and two are John and Jane. 

I found John rude, inconsiderate and selfish. i.e, it was a friend’s birthday and he insisted we meet a half hour early and then woke from a nap an hour past the agreed time and then didn’t come at all. No apology. 

Jane and I were close. We hung out and texted constantly. However, she was very needy and anxious and used her anxiety as an excuse to be just as flakey as John. I let it go mostly because we connected so well. 

Group time got less fun because no one listened to each other, talked over others and were late to everything. I adjusted my expectations, but some things were hard for me. When a friend came and I wanted to introduce her, we planned to meet at a place all of us went to every Friday and no one came after an hour and a half. Another time, there a was a new girl whom I invited to dinner and they were cliquey, told inside jokes, didn’t try to talk to her. 

Finally, three weeks before home, I couldn’t do it anymore. It was tiring to hang with them and it was hard to watch Jane make decisions without listening to logic (she asked for my advice always and then would do the opposite) So one day I didn’t text her. The group chat planned a couple things and I didn’t go. I wasn’t rude, just stopped engaging. 

John asked me 4 days later if I was okay, and I replied yes. I knew he and Jane were together and I think it was her asking why I wasn’t texting her. I go out of town the next weekend and two weeks later, Jane texts me, “I feel weird. I feel like we’re almost leaving things are weird between us.” I say that I didn’t go out with them because I don’t drink much (she knows this) and that I was gone the weekend before (she knew that). She says “but you haven’t texted me in 17 days.” I said she hadn’t texted me either. 

“I’m not the one who fell off the face of the earth.” SHE NEVER TRIED TO TEXT ME IN THOSE 17 DAYS. Why couldn’t she text first? I would’ve responded.

We had a goodbye dinner and a couple people couldn’t go, but it was nice. We went to the movies too and John was there (Jane cancelled at the last minute) and I was done at that point. I didn’t make a lot of conversation and left when it ended. 

I’m home now and today John texts me (paraphrasing):

Hey, I want you to know that we’re disappointed with how you left things here and we think it’s really rude. It strange that you made these friends abroad and now have nothing to show for it because you burned the all the bridges in the last month. I don’t know if that’s normal for you or what but for us it was really strange. You just kinda disappeared? 

He didn’t say who “we” is. Of the other group members, one friend I didn’t know well, one I had a lovely goodbye tea with, and one I asked for a lunch date before leaving, but she cancelled at the last minute. I think he means he and Jane, but he didn’t say, nor did she text me herself.

The same thing happened the previous year where I was won the award. No one was there for me except for my mentor, bf and bf’s family. No one even cared I won. 

Cue tonight, my brother is having an award show at his high school. He told us he wanted us there since he’s nervous he won’t win anything. Everyone is running around getting ready and fancy. Parents are going despite having to work later tonight. Siblings and grandparents are going as well. 

I however refuse, especially since it’s awards like Perfect Attendance and Class Clown. Why should I have to go, when no one was there for me? Fuck that. So they leave while I’m making myself dinner, since I know they won’t bring anything back for me. 

Mom is currently blowing up my phone about how she’s disappointed, bro is really upset, and they went to my school award shows. They did not. Dad is saying the least I can do is decorate the living room and bake a cake. Bro said he understands but still wanted me there. 

My friend said I’m being a jerk and to be the bigger person.

bwhxgb	2019-06-03 23:58:32	Bridgetsdow90	AITA giving 7 days notice - no lease	"Hi,

I moved in with 2 girls last November. They sub let to me and I never had a lease so my lease is month to month. My issue is that for the last few months, they have become quite hostile towards me and the environment is now very uncomfortable to live in. When I first moved in, they knew I was quite introverted and loved my own company.

But a few days ago, they had an ""intervention"", with me where they said it's not okay that I spend all my time with my boyfriend, at the gym or with my friends. Which to be honest is not that much, I love being alone.

These are some of the rules they made for me at the intervention, I'm not allowed to close my door ever, even when sleeping, I have to spend most of my free time with them, if a housemate has a day off, I have to be readily available to spend time with her as she put it ""I was off last Saturday but you spent the day with your bf, I was absolutely distraught, i had to turn the radio and TV on to keep me company, its just not okay"" I have to let then know my whereabouts etc etc. 

I am extremely bad at confrontation so basically agreed with everything they said and left feeling absolutely awful. I have been avoiding them ever since. I had to babysit Friday but they made dinner and I wasn't there so they had a massive issue with it and started ignoring me. I just feel so stressed and awful and so I found another apartment today, a house share, with my bf and another couple, completely last minute. Anyway, as I'm not on the lease, I have no contract, and the deal is that the new person I find, pays me my deposit.

So as I am not at home today and wanted them to know straight away, I text them and really nicely put that I had been offered another apartment, I'm really sorry its such short notice but I will be moving out on the 10th, the day my monthly lease is up and they are completely ignoring me. It is short notice but I have no lease, and I already have over 100 applicants lined up since the ad went up a few hours ago. 

Because they haven't replied, I'm just extremely anxious right now and to be honest scared. I didn't want to leave like that but I felt I had no choice and I thought me moving out would make them happy, I move out the 10th and someone moves in the same day and pays me the deposit I originally paid the girl who's place I took.

I guess I just need to know AITA?

We’re semi-close with each other’s family. Her uncle who could moreso be a brother due to how young he is is getting married in the coming months. Her uncle was raised by her very well off grandfather, and due to him being born later in her grandfathers life, he was spoiled. 

Needless to say they have expensive tastes. They’ve had 2-3 formal, catered parties already celebrating their engagement. For the wedding we are invited as a couple, but we’ve been told that it is strictly a black tie formal event. Meaning I would have to rent a nice tuxedo and she would have to buy a very nice dress just for one day (apparently you aren’t able to rent those types of dresses). 

Now we’re both the stereotypical broke college kids. We just had to spend a lot of money on summer courses and rent to stay in the city near our school. And we can only work part time low wage jobs during everything. 

Now, when I heard it was black tie formal and that I would have to rent a tux I was a little upset as a full tux averages at around $200. And her dress would be about the same. To require that everyone in attendance be that dressed up seemed unreasonable, but, it’s their wedding. They can require whatever they want. I just suggested that since we don’t really have 200 to be spending on an outfit we’d wear for one day, that we should not attend. 

She wasn’t too upset but she pushed back a little and said that we can’t just “not attend”, and we’d be seen as assholes. My questions is, am I the asshole for suggesting we don’t attend the wedding, simply because of the financial aspect?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	23.0	9.0	0.0	0.0

My (18f) sister and her boyfriend are both 20. They spend every second together, so my sister is very close with his family. I, on the other hand, have never met the family before and have no connection to them. The boyfriend has a toddler brother, 2 or 3 years old. Now, I love my sister, but for the love of God she does not shut up about this kid. I like kids a lot, but every single conversation I've had with her for the past few months has involved her talking about him. Everything from ""he said my name cute yesterday"" to ""let me tell this 10 minute story about how he shit himself"".

My sister and I have a pretty strained relationship, so I tiptoe around her a lot. When it first started happening I began to say something along the lines of ""idc"" but she became immediately defensive and yelled at me saying this was her life and if I wanted to be a part of it I had to listen to her so I backed off. I dont fake enthusiasm like everyone else in my family, instead, I just smile and try to change the subject.

The big problem is that now shes started sending me pictures and videos of him constantly. Also, shes home from college so I have to see her and talk to her more. I know it will start an argument if I tell her I dont care about the kid and would like to talk about LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE, and I think it will make me an asshole.

bwhu9m	2019-06-03 23:49:30		AITA/WIBTA for feeling upset with colleagues?	"Keeping this as vague as possible on the off chance any of my colleagues browse Reddit.

Background: I work in a job that is not retail/restaurants/banking, but is still heavily public oriented. I'm one of a team of 3 at our location (multiple locations in the area.) Me, H (colleague,) and L (manager.) I have a great work relationship with them both.

We're open morning/early afternoon hours three days a week; the other two days we're open for longer and later (evening when we close.) 

On occasion we will host local events at our location on one or both late nights. Usually such events mean H will stay past closing time to make sure everything is shipshape and lock up, since it's part of their job, while L (unless they stay to help H) and I leave right at closing.

We were supposed to have one such event this week. On that day H and I were both scheduled for long days (\~9 hrs; we both work PT and are picking up some extra hours this month within the reasonable limit.) H was going to stay after while I left at closing. L has to go to one of our other locations to work, so it's just H and I all day.

What made me so upset was this:

I overheard L and H talking at one point today, but didn't really pay attention to the convo, though I did hear my name mentioned. A little later, after they had finished, H and I were talking and I asked them what they and L had been talking about and mentioned that I had heard my name. (Nosy, I know.) H told me that the event later this week had been canceled - first I had heard of it - and because of that they had asked L if they could leave an hour before closing instead of working such long hours (no other reason given), and L said yes.

So, this means that I am now pulling the slightly longer day and closing up alone instead of H. I don't mind that on it's own, but what upset me and prompted my AITA/WIBTA:

***L and H made this decision on their own, just the two of them, without asking me if I was OK with it or looping me in on that convo - letting me know the event had been canceled and that H was asking if it would be OK for them to leave early instead of staying until closing.***

bwhu6t	2019-06-03 23:49:17	moolamoola7	AITA for wanting my husband to spend some of his inheritance on me?	"Under unfortunate circumstances, my husband of 3 years recently received an inheritance from his grandmother. It is significant. Not quit your job money, but you don't really need to worry about being hungry or homeless ever money.

We have separate finances, and intend to maintain separate finances. We are both debt free with good savings, and make good money. There is no real financial need for either of us.

He does intend to use some of the money for ""us"". When we move a few hours away later this year (both jobs are portable), he intends to buy us a house outright. That said, I will then spend the next 20 or so years paying that money back. We have already worked out a repayment plan. I am appreciative, however, that I won't have a mortgage and be paying the bank interest on my half. [Edited to add: I would be on the deed at 15% or so ownership at first - the amount of cash I can contribute to the purchase from savings. We would probably update that over time. Where we live you can hold property in percentages.]

Recently, one of the smaller investments matured and he had an influx of cash. About 1% of the inheritance. I semi-joked about using it for a honeymoon. We never had a honeymoon due to life circumstances, and we have had a rough 18 months caring for his grandmother. We could use the break. We were her only local family, and were present through treatment to the end. He responded that it could be his half, and I'd have to save up mine. 

Honestly, I hadn't thought of him treating us to trip until it just sort of stumbled out of my mouth. I don't think I would have even thought twice if he had responded in jest. But the response wasn't a joking one and while it wasn't meant to be overly negative, it was just very clear to me that he doesn't see that as something he would do. It just really sat funny with me, even though this is his money and I really don't consider it mine.

And now I feel like I was the asshole here for even suggesting it, or thinking that is a way he should spend his money. 

To be clear, i could probably save up an equivalent amount in 12-18 months if I'm careful so his suggestion wasn't unreasonable. It isn't as if such a trip is out of reach. And yes, he would prefer I spend less, save more in general.

"So lately, and more especially this last month I had a lot of health issues (appendicitis, ovary cyst, conjonctivites at both eyes and a throat infection) and my best friend who I thought would be there for me has been MIA at first for no reason but two weeks ago her rabbit died. As soon as I got informed I texted her and called her everyday to make sure she’s okay but at any time she did the same for me or cared about if I was feeling better. 
I had to go to the emergency alone (way before her rabbit incident) but she said she couldn’t  be there- but i learned later that she just went to the bar with her friend.

So, I just got a tonsillectomy, nasal endoscopy, and partial uvulectomy, giving me very bad throat pain when swallowing, eating, etc. This morning, I was very tired and as of 1 o’clock, I hadn’t eaten anything, which is bad when you’re trying to recover from this kind of surgery. I hadn’t taken the pain medicine so my throat was aching and my dad told me to come eat the oatmeal he made for me. I then went down there and asked him if I could take my steroid after a couple bites to numb the pain as it gets worse the more you move your mouth. He said ok, and I ate a couple bites before asking him to then take it. He said I’d have to eat some more because I have to have food in my stomach with the steroid. I agreed, and ate a couple more bites, took the steroid, and waited some time for it to settle in. At this point, the steroid was not helping me and my pain just kept on getting worse. Making it almost unbearable to eat. I said this to him through a text to speech app from my phone because it’s what I use when my mouth hurts and don’t want to talk. He starts to get agitated and tells me that I’m not going to heal if I don’t eat, which I respond to that this is worst my throat has felt since the surgery, because it was. He argued with me constantly, saying that I was being a spoiled brat with me crying in front of him because of the pain, I tried to bargain with him and ask him to let me take the stronger pain medicine and continue in a bit, which he responded to with no. He tells me that im ungrateful for him making the oatmeal and him trying to get me better, which I know he is, but he was pushing me too fast I think. Anyways, he walks away and throws the oatmeal in the sink, and tells me to go to my room, which I do. He says that im wasting the expensive food that he bought for me by not eating it, (because he did) and that I should be more reciprocal to the help he tries to give. Am I being ungrateful? (The asshole)? Note : I think most of you can assume i am a teenager, if that matters.	Not the A-hole	0	0	142.0	33.0	0.0	0.0

Okay so first some context: Our uni's library has a reservation system where you can reserve any pc for 4 hours at a time. Every day I reserve the same pc for the same 4 hours (14:00-18:00)  recently it was our exam week so I spent a lot of evenings in the library but since most of my friends weren't there I ended up eating with 1 close friend and his study mates for almost 3 weeks straight.

Usually what happens when I arrive at the library someone will be sitting at the pc I reserved and I'll politely ask them to go find another pc since I reserved it. Yesterday though one of the study mates I had been eating with was sitting at the pc I reserved. He knew I reserved that pc every day so he knew I would kick him from my pc once I arrived or so I thought. 10 minutes after I kicked him my close friend told me I was an asshole for taking the pc and I should have just taken a different one since one of my ""friends"" was using that pc (the library is completely full near exam weeks and if I managed to find another pc the odds were I would be kicked myself disrupting me from precious study time)

Afterwards I got some snide remarks from his study mates that were sitting in the same area all day and I haven't been invited to join them for dinner. In my opinion what I did wasn't wrong but since they called me an ass I thought I would ask it here.

also friends is between brackets since I don't really consider him a friend (he is a nice guy but I only know him for 3 weeks so yeah) but my close friend did use the word friend.

So reddit, AITA?

Edit: also keep in mind that in our uni it is perfectly accepted to sit at a reserved pc until the person that reserved it shows up. (if he ever shows up)"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Ever since I started university last year, my mom has been trying to control me in many ways. I figured out that she made me heavily financially dependent on her, she wouldn’t allow me to get a job during high school, & forbade me from getting a job in university until I was in my third year but always threw it in my face how other kids my age were already working. I’m guessing she didn’t like how I moved away from her (40 min) to my dorm. She made these rules that I had to be in my dorm by 8 pm, I wasn’t allowed to have anyone in my dorm because (that rule was made after she FaceTimed me and saw my friend & I playing Just Dance in my dorm & said she never gave me permission to do that), I had to visit the her every weekend, not once did I ever stay the weekend at my dorm, etc. 

She overall was just very toxic, used her money to her advantage against me. I really wish I could write everything she’s done but character count. She’s been extremely toxic to the point I was so close to cutting her out of my life about three times, the last time was when I asked to stay the weekend with my friends, and she yelled at me told me to come home immediately and yelled at me even more. She has this mentality that blood is thicker than water. And she admitted to intentionally not showing me life skills, and making me dependent on her during that night. Also said, the day I don’t come home on Friday is the day she cuts me off, and she will win and I will lose because i will be struggling all my life without her help.

She said I wasn’t allowed to get an apartment until I was 21 nor a job but I broke both of those rules since I did get a job & leased an apartment with my friend and sister. She only wanted us to live in the dorms so we lied & said the apartment was owned by university (they eventually bought it but considered off campus). She still wants me to come “home” every weekend from Fri-Sun/Mon & I am not spending 1/4 of the month at her house when I’m paying $900 for an apartment. She also believes that I’ll live with her next summer because she probably thinks that I don’t have a lease and that it ends in May when it from August until July, & I’m not living with her toxic ass. If she wants to see me, she can come over to my city for once. 

So WIBTA if I told her that I’m gonna visit her when i want and not abide by her rules and that I’m not going to live with her during the summer and break my lease or even then pay $900 a month just to live with her and not in my apartment, & that she can’t tell me what to do and that I’ve had enough her of because I am a 19 year old who doesn’t need their mom controlling their life? 

Edit: I’m mostly asking this because AITA if I show any ungratefulness for the things she has done like pay my phone, give me money when needed, and a laptop? Am I being disrespectful to her or whatever?

bwhmxa	2019-06-03 23:29:56		AITA for having resentful feelings towards my wife because she expects me to handle a lot of the chores such as cleaning the house etc because I work from home???	"We’ve been married for a few years now, and this has been a hot button issue for a while. Whenever she comes home from work, and the house is “dirty” and the chores aren’t done, she will instantly have an attitude with me. It’s subtle.. and sort of in a passive aggressive kind of way. (The kind of vibe that you pick up on after being married to someone for many years) When she gets home, she will often snap at me...”Have you fed the dogs? Have they been out? Why does it smell in here? The house is dirty, and so forth.... I get really upset when she does this, and we will end up fighting and not speaking for the rest of the night sometimes. 

So here’s the thing. I work in sales, and I work from home. I’m often on call, and travel all over the city for sales appointments. My schedule is often unpredictable. I do have some down time during the day. And I will often sweep and mop the house, or clean the bathroom. In fact, most days I do clean the house. I’ve noticed that on those days, she’s a little “less” upset when she gets home... but a lot of time, she won’t even acknowledge it, or will point out spots that I miss. This is another hot button fight issue. When I do clean, it’s always not up to her “standards” so she doesn’t consider it “real” cleaning.... this upsets me very deeply, because I feel like she doesn’t appreciate it. She will say things like, “I know your version of cleaning” she will often refer to it as not even considered cleaning because I miss the corners of the walls, or I don’t sweep under the couch, or behind the dog crate. In her mind, because I missed this stuff, it’s “fake” cleaning..

She makes 45k annually, and I make between 80-90k per year. I could understand her reasoning if she were the breadwinner here, but that’s not the case. I am the breadwinner, and I am expected to handle the chores because I work from home. The other day I got really upset and told her She needs to stop having a shitty attitude and being rude to me when she gets home from work every day. There was a fight obviously.. am I the asshole?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We've been dating for almost 3 years now, but it still makes me uncomfortable that he wants to put something so permanent about me on his body. I pretty much told him that while I loved his tattoos I wasn't really ok with him getting one that was so obviously about me.

He told me that he wasn't really asking permission when he told me about the tattoo and since it was his body, his vote was the only one that mattered. To be fair, I would be really hurt and upset if  my boyfriend told me to change the way I dress or to get a tattoo. I would probably love any other tattoo on him, but I feel like I should get a say if he's tattooing what's essentially my name.  


Edit: I've gotten a mix of NAH's, NTA's and YTA's which is telling me I should probably talk to him tonight and understand better why he wants this tattoo specifically. I love him and this is not something I want to give him an ultimatum about."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bwhl55	2019-06-03 23:25:01	mezhgorye	AITA for asking my boyfriend to pay rent when he has a separate apartment?	"I’m 26F, he’s 35M. We started dating around 8 months ago and decided to move in together since the lease on his apartment is ending. I own a house and asked him to pay a portion of bills similar to what he was paying for at his apartment. We’re not splitting our finances 50/50 and would only be splitting my mortgage and utilities. I’d still pay fully for homeowner’s insurance, property taxes, and so on. In total, the amount comes to around $400/month, which is a GREAT deal less than what he’s currently paying for his apartment solo.

The issue is his lease ends this month and he moved in two weeks ago. I asked him to move in early so that he would have enough time to sell his leftover furniture, clean his apartment out, and handle miscellaneous tasks without the stress of needing to be in the apartment while he was moving.

I brought up a couple of days ago that since it was the 1st of the month, I thought that I would receive payment from him for June. He laughed at me and said that there’s no reason for him to start paying his portion as he’s still paying for his apartment for another month. Then he brought up that for the last 6 months, I’ve been living with him and he never charged me any rent.

This was a huge surprise to me as it was the first time he had ever brought up the topic at all. He lives around 5 minutes away from where I work, so Monday morning I would pack a bag with clothes for the week and Friday night I would come home. I never kept anything at his house over the weekend and lived entirely off of what would fit in my backpack. I considered it to be more ""staying the night"" repeatedly since we both wanted to be together as much as possible and it made sense for me to not drive as much throughout the week.

He has an amazing job where he makes over six figures a year, has hundreds of thousands saved for retirement, and the amount I’m asking for one month would be minor compared to how much living together will save him in the long run.

His mom (Bev) is very important to him as she raised him by herself. She makes questionable decisions at times and therefore their relationship has been up and down, but she's a good person and good mom and it means a ton to both me and BF that I have a relationship with her. 

Rewind a few years, BF's ex cheats on him, manipulates him, ruins many of his friendships by spreading untrue rumours. These events caused him a lot of anxiety and depression which he still deals with today, mainly trust/abandomnent issues. He works hard at it but it's still a struggle, super heartbreaking for me to watch. Recently, she contacted him and tried to manipulate him and badmouth me (He stood up for me, shut her down and blocked her on everything) 

Bet is very aware of what this girl did to her son. 

So one day I'm on Facebook and ex shows up under ""people you may know"". I shouldn't have clicked her profile, but i was honestly just curious and was only gonna take a peek. I see that she and Bev hang out still (recent photos together), Bev comments on ALL her photos ""You're so beautiful!"" ""So proud of you!"" ""Miss you!"" and ex still refers to Bev as ""Mom"" in her comment replies. I am floored. I was hurt because honestly it isn't a great feeling to have your BF's mom still besties with his ex, but whatever, i can get over that. I was hurt for my oblivious boyfriend (doesn't use social media) and how his own mom could do that behind his back. 

So i sat on it and debated whether or not to tell BF. But I just HAD to tell him, I felt it in my bones. Still not sure if it was the right decision. And he was so effing hurt and angry, he felt like his own mom betrayed him. So he talked to her about it and told her this can't go on anymore. He didn't tell her that I found out about it, but i think she put two and two together cause one day a while later she gets me alone in the car with her and has a FULL breakdown. She explains to me that she's just a really forgiving person and has known ex since she was a teen, but that she loves me and wants me and my BF to be together, not ex. She was so upset and told me she didn't want me to hate her or think she's a bad person. I told her I didn't think either of those things but that I was hurt myself and also for my boyfriend, and that I want to have a good relationship with her.

 Bev and I are on OK terms after our talk, and she and her son are also totally good again. But now I feel like a huge asshole cause she felt so bad, and also like I'm controlling for calling out who she speaks to, which is truly none of my business. BF is on my side with all of this and has made it very clear to me that i did not damage his relationship with his mom, but I still feel like I did and it makes me sick. So torn.

bwhh91	2019-06-03 23:14:25	justgarcia31	WIBTA if I went to a baseball game instead of hanging out with my coworkers during free/down time at a conference I'm heading to this week?	"I have been working at my current IT office for almost about a year now and will admit that I don't have close relationships with the people I work with. Even during a meeting last week, one of my departments head supervisors said ""I'm glad we're not one of those offices where everyone is overly nice or nosy with each other - like where people just randomly pop into our space and ask about our weekend or evening plans everyday or other \[personal\] things like that.""

It was an interesting comment as this same supervisor seems to get offended/likes to give us shit when there are low turnouts for volunteering/team activities like staff lunches or happy hours. I will be honest and say that I am not the most social person in my office, but I have made multiple attempts to talk with my coworkers about their personal lives and just can't seem to break through. They're all fairly nice people and I'll engage during activities like happy hours or lunches, but my staff always likes to talk about work or other interests and they don't really leave room for conversation (these conversations tend to turn into these awkward series of story-telling where everyone tries to one-up each other). For example, most of them like gardening, but rather than having a casual conversation about it, it instead turns into a ""my garden has X, Y, and Z"" and then someone will respond ""Huh, well mine has A, B, and C"" and so on.

Anyways, we are all heading to a conference in Chicago soon and from what I heard from my coworkers, my staff attempted to go to the Lincoln Park Zoo as a group last year but never did due to time constraints and so everyone just kind of did their own thing after no group plans could be made/decided on ( a couple went off to a bar, some went sight seeing, some went back to the hotel to relax). This year, we are expected to land in Chicago earlier and will likely have more time during our first day to explore the city. Being a baseball fan, I noticed that the Chicago Cubs are going to be in town and think it would be cool to catch a game. No clear guidelines have been discussed about how ""free time"" works, but if there are any mandatory plans, I would obviously follow through with them for the sake of not getting in-trouble. However, if there aren't mandatory plans and someone tries to make plans, I'm asking if I would be the asshole for declining to partake in those (non-mandatory) plans and instead do something on my own. I know that it has the potential to look bad, but also, after my supervisor's comment last week about being thankful for not being personal with us, I don't see the problem in going off an doing my own thing, especially if the plans being made are not mandatory.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I am heading to a conference in Chicago this week and want to know if I would be an asshole for going to a baseball game by myself rather than following through with (non-mandatory) plans to hang out with my coworkers"	Not the A-hole	0	0	492.0	63.0	0.0	0.0

For some context, I'm in a friend group consisting of 6, including me. We're all teenagers. When june started, i posted about 4 posts about pride month, along with a few other non pride related things. My friend group began discussing how cringy it was, to which one of them responded ""Its ironic, there's no way he couldn't be self aware about how much of a fag he looks like"". The posts i made consisted of a picture of a pride flag and acknowledging pride month, the next was one along the lines of ""happy june to all the homophobic celebrities and politicians who are still in the closet"", the next one was a picture of a rat, with its anatomy being labeled with things like ""support for trans people"" and so on. Finally. The last one was just a doge, with the caption ""doge says trans right"". I dont find anything wrong with any of that, but they thought it was incredibly cringy.

 We got into a discussion where they asked me if i would support my girlfriend if she came out, i said i would. They then proceeded to call me a fag and other slurs. This isn't a new thing either, they all like to call me and eachother shit like that all the time, personally I'd prefer a friendship where we weren't constantly calling eachother offensive slurs, but they didn't care that much.

bwhgko	2019-06-03 23:12:42	raccoonbutter	AITA for yelling at my brother while he was on FaceTime with his friend and then snapping at his friend?	"Title. I didn’t raise my voice or anything, but I was very obviously angry. 

Context:
We are (1/2) Middle Eastern and live in a fairly conservative area. His friend is white. (I’m not sure if that really matters.)

All the kids in my brother‘s friend group have an “edgy” sense of humor. (I do too, and I think most of the things they do are freakin hilarious. I just have limits as to what I think is appropriate.) They’ve all decided that playing the anthem of a well-known terrorist group (you can guess which one) is their new favorite joke. 

My mother (who is not middle eastern) has already told him to stop it on several occasions. She made it very clear that she does not think that this is something to joke about, but he doesn’t seem to understand why. 

I heard him playing it on the piano and laughing about it with his friend. (I can recognize it at this point because I’ve had to hear him play it so many times.)

I’m not gonna lie - I got really mad. I marched out there and I told him to stop. He just laughed and his friend mocked me. I told him to hang up the FaceTime so I could talk to him, but he refused. 

So I told him that he might think it was funny to joke about this, but it absolutely was not. This group tortures and kills people - it’s not funny. This group ruins lives and terrorizes innocent people every day. 

I kept telling him that it’s not funny, but his friend said “actually, it is kind of funny.” So I told  him to shut it and keep out of my family’s business. (I think that might have been an asshole move, I actually really like that kid. He’s a little bit insensitive at times and he has a habit of butting in to other people’s conversations, but he’s actually really cool.)

So I told my brother that people like his friend might be able to laugh and move on, but we don’t have that luxury. People already look at us like we might cause issues because of where we come from. I feel like we need to handle issues like this with extra care and sensitivity. (Even though I think EVERYONE should.)

My dad is really upset with my brother - he has to deal with discrimination all the time and he kind of feels like my brother is shitting on what he goes through. I’ve had a few incidents too, and I hope my brother never has to go through that.

I feel like maybe I should have waited for him to be off the phone but I don’t know if the conversation would have ever happened if I did.

I moved in with a new room mate on May 1st (a childhood friend) and things have been going pretty well. There are some things that are meh, but one that I brought up with her was how much toilet paper she uses. We both brought 8 rolls (16 total) and as of today have 1 left. A 12 pack of toilet paper usually lasts me a good 4-6 months, and we blew threw that in under 3 weeks. When I brought it up she make a comment about how she was a girl and girls use more toilet paper because they sit down to pee. When I was living my old apartment, my girlfriend slept over 3-4 times a week for almost a year, and I didn't notice any extreme use of TP.

I get that toilet paper isn't that expensive, but I was brought up not to waste economically or environmentally. I went pee and there was 1/4 roll of toilet paper left, and my room mate went pee after me. I went back in to brush my teeth and the old roll was empty, with a new one on the stool that had a few sheets missing. I don't get how someone would need over 25 sheets of toilet paper to go pee. We share a lot of common things like dish soap, hand soap, etc. But I was considering telling her today that if she is going to be using 15 rolls a month, she's on the hook for buying her own toilet paper. She has no medical condition that requires massive toilet paper usage (that I know of). So guys, am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	396.0	181.0	0.0	0.0

We live in South Africa and it's currently very hard for young people to find decent well-paying work. He depends on us for all of his income. We give him 2 allowances, a food allowance and a personal allowance (for video games, going out etc). His food allowance is R2,000 a week (like $140 US) and his personal allowance is half of that. Anyway, earlier this month (2 days after we paid him) he comes to us asking for food as he'd already spent his food allowance. We were quite annoyed, as it would be nearly impossible to spend that much money on food in only two days! We got into a huge argument and we kept pressing him. It turns out he spent it all on vinyls (the entire Primal Scream discography) and CBD-infused vape juice. Needless to I was livid! I told him for the next two months he'll only be getting half his usual food allowance and absolutely no personal allowance. He screamed at me and called me a bitch.

I won't get into the details too heavily, but she ultimately decided on quality instead of quantity of life. It has been a heartbreaking reality for her and my family almost beyond bearing. The oncologist stated that on the route she chose, she is looking at 3 to 6 months.

Enter my quandary. I found out recently that I am pregnant. Very VERY newly pregnant. I haven't been to a doctor and even under normal circumstances we (my husband and I) wouldn't tell anyone until I'm outside of my first trimester.

I do not want to tell my mom period. The agonizing reality is, the odds of her being here when the baby is (hopefully) born are very unlikely. Her health, both physical and mental, are stretched to the max. I do not want to make an impossible time for her even more impossible. However, I can't help but feel extremely guilty about withholding that information. Or rather, about lying about it.  

And for what it's worth, what I believe of souls and the afterlife... She will know this baby regardless.

"We're in our late 20s and had been dating for 7 years before getting engaged. Honestly, his parents have always been kind people and I love them, which is why this issue has been even more surprising and made me resentful. I'm from a low-income household, while my fiance's parents are extremely well off (high-income New Englanders). Fiance and I are fortunate and also make good incomes for our age. Fiance's younger sister got married 1 year ago, and fiance's parents paid for a very nice wedding for her, to the tune of $40-50k; she makes a decent income (\~$45k), and her now husband and husband's family are also affluent. Sorry, all of this financial context seems relevant.

Anyway, future in-laws (FILs) recently told us that they would not be contributing any money to our wedding because ""we make enough money."" Fiance was a bit taken aback by how firm the statement was and pointed out that his sister had her entire wedding paid for. Their response was that she didn't/doesn't have the same kind of income.

Now, we **never** expected them to pay for the full thing, and are fully aware that we 1) have good incomes and 2) have had more years to save. If they had offered, we were even prepared to divide the cost somehow. However, that's not the case. I'm definitely not in the position to say anything, and fiance is upset but not willing to rock the boat. I can't help but feel resentful and have probably been noticeably colder to FILs.

We are active military moving for work and needed to sell the house so we could use our VA loan for the next house. We still have to leave on time no matter what happens and will now need to figure out other financing options as well as continue to pay the mortgage. Additionally they requested various things for the inspection that cost us money. 

To add to the moral argument, their employer was their son in law who was recently shot and killed in a road rage incident. 

AITA?

EDIT: Once we got home we looked over the contract and spoke with our realtor. The buyers never officially gave a reason to back out that meets a valid reason to do so per the contract. Even though we did some research into the claim and it all appears to be true. All that said and done we think we are going to let them go and give the full earnest money back. We felt like we would sleep better doing so. They setup a GoFundMe and this seems to be our donation. Hopefully the Karma God's see it and the next buyer takes full asking price or better.

"Daughter in quotes because she's biologically not my daughter, I only raised her as if she was until she was nearly 5. Then me and my first wife finally divorced and when she wanted to do a paternity test I found out she was conceived during an affair my wife had with some College teen (she was 26-27). So suddenly I had no argument to get custody for her, even though I got custody for her older brother. I didn't see her until she was like 14 and wanted to really know me and her brother, but since then we never had real active contact, as me and my wife live far away from her and her mother and I didn't want to make it so complicated for my new family. It's hard to explain to be honest and I certainly regret and think about it a lot.

Now she graduated from a really good College and I should be proud of her and I definitely am, but even though I got an invitation and flight tickets from her I decided not to go there, so last week I sent her the tickets and the money they costed and some money as a graduation gift with a letter that I appreciate it but can't be there and that she should spare the effort when she gets married or even for birthdays. 
I just couldn't do it as I didn't want to meet all of her real parents families and especially not her mother as it would've been a really atrocious and anxious situation and I didn't want to do this to me and also herself as she would've had to do a lot of explaining which isn't appropriate in this occasion. It should've been about her and not about our totally disturbing family structures.

I didn't talk to her ""brother"", so my son, yet, but I suppose he was there as they got close in the last years without me being involved and while I won't see her often anyway, I'm still keen on being someone she has positive connotations to if you can say that and I really fear she still could be upset."

My mom has known for at least 4 years, and has never been accepting. She told me that the day I do anything to transition - getting surgery, changing my name, taking testosterone, etc. - I would be kicked out of the house and not welcomed back.

She's getting married in August, and is making me be one of the bridesmaids and wear a tight-fitting dress, which I've explained to her multiple times that it makes me extremely uncomfortable and dysphoric. However, I agreed that at her wedding, I would wear the dress, go by my dead name, and not say anything about being trans (despite the fact that most of my family knows by this point, and most are accepting), despite my own dysphoria. It's her day and I want her to be happy.

There's a transgender clinic at my local hospital, and I made an appointment, since I'm an adult and can do that now without my mom's permission. When I went, they told me that I can start taking testosterone within the next month. This was way sooner than I expected, and this is something I've been wanting ever since I found out it was possible. I had no idea it would be that easy.

I promised my mom that I wouldn't start testosterone until after her wedding, but even if I start after, she'll still kick me out. If I start this month, by August the most noticable difference will be my voice cracking and being slightly lower than normal. My follow-up appointment is in around 2 weeks, and I can start testosterone on the day of the appointment if I so choose. WIBTA for doing that?

My husband is upset about the classmate trying to ruin this for our daughter and possibly the 4-year-old should he find out from his sister. Next Easter, he wants to leave an actual trail of rabbit pellets (aka poop) in the house instead of jelly beans or chocolate candy like some parents do.

I asked my current bridesmaids to be in the wedding in February of 2019. All of my bridesmaids are friends that I have had for years. While we were planning, we threw around the idea of having it 9 hours away. I ran the idea by them to get their opinions before we settled on anything. I asked them what they thought, if they were comfortable with it, and okay with the extra costs of traveling and staying at a place there. I listed out all of the cost they would be responsible for berfore hand, which is $50 for their dresses and $140 TOTAL for a hotel room for 3 nights. This is all they would have to pay for the whole shabang.

I told them that they would not have to pay their rooming fees until the day before we checked in to give them time to gradually put aside money. 

A few weeks ago one of my bridesmaids contacted me saying she was going to be unable to pay for her room besides $50 of it that she is asking the other 6 girls to spilt between them because she just took out loans for school, is paying rent/utilities, and her gas to drive down there is too much but she really wanted to still go. I told her I understood and that these things happen & I would take out the money from my paycheck and set it aside for her and I would cut back on some things to make it work for her. She seemed really embarrassed and apologized for even asking. 

These past few weeks IMMEDIATELY after I agreed to pay for $90 of her room (on top of everything else i’m paying for myself) she posts pictures of her buying outfits from a fancy boutique, getting her nails done every week, and constantly going out clubbing and staying in hotels. She does this often, which is why it surprised me when she asked for money. It rubs me the wrong way that she’s spending all of this money on trivial items & then asking me and my other bridesmaids to foot her bill. It comes off disrespectful and that my wedding isn’t important enough for her to save $140 over 6 months. I talked to my fiancé about confronting her but he said I shouldn’t since I already agreed to pay it and shouldn’t be petty and throw it in her face.

My friend of almost twenty years has had a rough life, and to condense it down, she's both scarred from emotional abuse and she falls on the spectrum (important), both of which make her very very conflict avoidant, while also having supreme difficulty expressing her feelings. 

A couple of years ago, she hooked up with a guy, and long story short is that they had an on again/off again relationship up until now. The first time they broke up was because she didn't want kids. They took some time apart and he came back willing to compromise on that. The next time was because of communication issues, and I can't express enough that he has no tact because he broke up with her during her grandmother's funeral because he didn't want to deal with the emotional crisis. So stellar guy, right? 

He came back one last time thanks to my friend's mother reaching out, and that ended messily because she'd managed to find and lose a separate boyfriend between then, which summarized in him basically calling her a whore even though they weren't together at the time, and from there I thought it was done. (And to mention from the start I had managed to become friend's with him because he seemed pretty decent at the time, which turned into me being their translator because he was hasty and she has a hard time expressing, but I've since cut ties with him after defending her. I know that I can't always be there to help her, but this was when I was around or was actively sought out, not accompanying them to everything.)

So cut to now I learn that this sack of waste has reached out to her again and they are now friends. Except, he's making her wildly uncomfortable by lingering on subjects they argued about in the past, picking her apart for certain mannerisms, touching her when she doesn't want to be touched, etc... But this is in between the bouts of fun times they share and I feel like my friend is using this as a means to justify not telling him to go kick rocks in flip-flops. It just so hard to hear about and she's so genuinely upset when she does come to me, it makes my heart hurt. She's like a little sister to me. I want to say something so badly to get him out of her life forever, so would I be the asshole if I went and did this?

My (18M) family has been planning a summer long trip to a European city for a couple of months. My dad told me he would pay for my flight to and from my home airport and the destination city. 

When I found this out, I shared the news with my friend who was also planning on traveling to Europe this summer and we started planning a trip together. Our itinerary keeps us in North Africa and the Med./western europe. 
We are completely prepared to pay for every expense incurred on this trip outside of the flight that I had a commitment from my dad on. 

The flight is bought, reservations are made and now my stepmom is objecting to destinations on the itinerary and questioning the length of time we are going. My dad is saying that since the expense of the ticket was shared with her. She has some say in how the trip goes down and he’s pushing me to compromise where we go and for how long. 

I feel that I should be able to proceed with my trip as originally planned. I do not want to compromise and I don’t feel like I should have to because I am paying for everything that I’m doing and I’ve reached the age of majority. To me, this feels like giving someone gas money and telling them that if they go anywhere except for their job — you’ll pump the gas out of their tank.

EDIT: This is not a vacation. This is a work related trip for my dad that I would accompany him on for a period and then leave once things get intense.

bwh792	2019-06-03 22:48:14	dedmanspartywastaken	AITA for not wanting Satanic imagery in my wedding?	"My fiance (m/38) and I (f/30) have been together for 12 years and are now engaged and planning a wedding. He's left most of the planning to me, which is fine, since he says that he doesn't really have strong feelings one way or another about the smaller details of our pending nuptials.

However, ONE of his expressed desires is to include some ""Satanic"" flair to his entrance with his groomsmen; hooded robes, swinging candles, ominous music, a prayer to the dark lord (or whatever). I have TWO problems with this:

1. My side of the family is Catholic. I am not (I'm agnostic), but this would raise some serious questions for my family who has never known my fiance to be into the devil. I want them to remember the wedding as a fun party; not as an introduction to my fiance's alleged ""dark side.""
2. What's more annoying, HE IS NOT EVEN A PRACTICING SATANIST. He likes Satanic imagery and thinks it's cool and anti-establishment (I think it's a leftover relic from his rebellious teen years) but he is not actually involved in anything related to the occult on the day-to-day. It's like he wants to have a shock rock concert to ""impress"" our guests. He likes Satanic values (be true to yourself; be committed to the here and now; be independent) and listens to Marilyn Manson and Ghost BC. That's the extent of his ""devil worship.""

So this leaves me in a tricky spot, because of course I want my fiance to include his personality in the wedding, but I don't want my family to be taken aback or upset by this quite unusual and provocative entrance. I don't want it to be the key take-away.

I've expressed as much to my fiance and he got really offended and upset that I don't support his idea. He thinks I am being controlling and am making the wedding more about me and my family and not about him, the groom. He claims I don't care what he wants and would rather he by unhappy on our wedding day than get the ""single thing"" he wants. While I get that (but still think it's kinda immature), when weighing the costs and benefits, it seems like he would get a smaller benefit of having a ""fun"" entrance than the general cost of my comfort (it's MY wedding day, too!) and my family's enjoyment.

I felt guilty and got him custom Baphomet cufflinks for his birthday to wear at our wedding hoping that would make up for it and show a willingness to compromise on my part, which he was very excited about and grateful to receive.

Recently, he requested that we put a pentagram somewhere on our wedding invites. Of course I said no to that, too, for the same reasons above. It's inflammatory and I don't want family focusing on weird devil shit more than our wedding as a whole. He got all sulky about it.

AITA for saying no to any of this? Should I give him more leeway instead of considering my family's comfort and beliefs more than his happiness and pseudo-beliefs?

&#x200B;

Update: I showed him this thread and he thinks I ""misrepresented"" him and continues to think that I am in the wrong for not letting him do what he wants because he wants it. He conceded months ago about the ceremony thing, but I made this thread because he continues to think I am in the wrong for not letting him do what he wants, including the recent request to add a pentagram to the invites.. I asked him to explain what the Satanic Bible means to him and didn't receive much except that it was significant to him as a teenager and he still likes some of the tenets. He still defends the idea that he's a Satanist, even though I've been living with the dude for years and have never seen it.

&#x200B;

Info: My family is not devout Catholic, they were raised Catholic and that's their default religion. While I don't think they would be SUPER offended, I do think they would not approve on reasons similar to my own. They are also all highly educated (as am I) and while tolerant to other beliefs, they would definitely wonder why THIS belief in THIS way on THIS day. I talked to my mom about it and she is NOT THRILLED by his ideas, either.

He isn't doing it to purposely provoke/upset my family. He is just adamant that including some Satanic stuff would best express who he is on his wedding day. However, if they are bothered by it, it would be their own fault for not being tolerant and for being judgemental (oof).

&#x200B;

Note: Yes, I understand him at 26 getting with an 18-year-old is questionable. I had just started college when we met at work and I pursued him because I thought he was really awesome. He had been in two long-term relationships before me, and I had only dated my high school bf. Maybe that does indicate some maturity issues on his part; I don't know. Age gaps have never been a big deal to me so long as the partners are evenly matched in other ways."	Not the A-hole	0	0	172.0	42.0	0.0	0.0

I didn't ask for anything, he was simply being generous. I turned the bottle to check the ingredients, it was a reflex. I felt badly as soon as I did it, but it is a habit of mine. I am not super concerned about calories or nutrition, but I am careful about the ingredients that I take in. I figure that if I eat anything, but eat moderately and if I avoid foods that are more manufactured than grown (or raised), I am OK. It was a diet iced tea and I noticed that it had aspartame. I wouldn't buy something with aspartame, but I decided that it would be rude not to drink it. My friend got pissed at me and told me to quit checking the ingredients and just take it.

So last week my dad texted me and asked if I would be interested in a paid internship offered by the department of revenue in my home state (my dads worked in the dept of rev for the past 20 something years) . As a broke college student, I of course said yes because the pay was good and the hours were better than anything I was getting at my current job

So I called the guy my dad put me into contact with, and he told me all about the program and even began the application process with me then and there. All I had to do was submit a resume and he would take care of the rest. 

A weekend passes and this morning I woke up to a text from my dad saying that I wouldn’t be able to get the position because HR set the deadline for applications a month ago. I’m extremely annoyed because I feel like that’s something that the guy i called should have told me, as he’s responsible for hiring people for this internship program.

"Last June, while I was parked innocently and correctly in a Dunkin Donuts parking lot, one of the employees was moving a donut rack outside.  It was caught in the wind, fell, and damaged my car.  

&#x200B;

Whether my car was hit, and whether DD is responsible, is not in question.   The store manager has admitted DD's liability, on tape.  Their insurance has offered a very small settlement.   It's a settlement I'd strongly consider accepting if it was connected to a promise to correct their faulty equipment.  Their insurance maintains that it was a ""freak accident"".

&#x200B;

My position is that it happened because DD  chooses to use unsafe equipment, that puts employees and customers at risk.   It was caught in the wind because it's a box kite on wheels.    It took a wind speed of less than 15mph to push it over.  Even if the employee had caught the rack and ""saved"" my car, he'd have had to put his body at risk to do so and would have (at least) had bruises, or sprained his arms or hurt his back.

We both finished up our 2nd year of college, her having graduated from community college so she invited a few of her close friends after coming back home from being upstate. I went to the party, lot of fun, and I’ve been talking (mostly through text if that matters) to her a lot now since she’s been back.

I don’t have a ton of people outside of close family to vent about my mental health and such, so after she had been back and talking to me for a week I asked her if I could vent a little bit and she said no problem. I talked about recently losing my job, struggles with college and motivation/uncertainty etc and little bit into talking she straight up tells me the discussion is making her uncomfortable and she doesn’t want to talk about it anymore. I said that’s fine but why she said no problem then, and she said she was lying to make me feel better and can’t really relate to what I’m going through. I was a little upset but didn’t really feel it was worth it to say anything.
 
Not really sure whether or not I have a right to be upset or just feel like a dickhead and I was just being presumptuous.

So my boss has a history of getting people fired or bullying people to quit. She always manages to fabricate something out of nothing and recently, I got tired of it. For the sake of this story; we will call her Jennifer. About three months ago, we got a new hire who I will call Monica in this story. These two started to clash heads instantly. Monica is the type of person to call out petty behavior (gossiping, etc) and Jennifer HATES it. Monica questions her authority and actively questions her judgement. About three weeks ago, I came into work and I heard Jennifer discussing with another co-worker (who was hired out of sheer nepotism) about how Monica needs to “go” because she’s intimidating and aggressive towards her and doesn’t feel safe. She then tried to rope me into this conversation and tried to get me involved. When I got off work, it was really weighing on me because I don’t think that someone should be fired (AGAIN) because they don’t fully agree with every stupid thing Jennifer does. So I just came out and told Monica everything that I heard and when Monica went to HR, Monica was able to see that Jennifer had started to file a work place “harassment” claims against her. Since I’ve done this, Jennifer has turned most of the people I work with against me (I seem to have done or said something new each week) She has called me “snitch” and continues to run her mouth. But when all is said and done, I feel slightly better knowing Monica didn’t loose her job.

bwh1yv	2019-06-03 22:34:23		AITA for arguing with my SO about our kids toys?	"For background, we have a young toddler and a baby.

We are currently staying at my MIL place. We will be moving in the near future but this is where we've been as of now. She has a den in her home she has never really used and so we have taken over that room as where we hangout with the kids. I am a SAHM and this is where I am with the kids almost all day unless we are out and about.

The den is where pretty much all toys are kept. Let me be clear... My kids do NOT have a ton of toys. They have the literal basics. And they only occupy one small corner in the room. If you were to step into the den and look you can barely even see majority of the toys.

So today my SO says there is way too many and he wants to put some in storage. He insists our toddler doesn't play with half of them. As the person who is the primary caregiver and around our kids the most.. I know this isn't true. He plays with pretty much everything he has, on rotation. Also I need as many distractions as I can get because both my kids are under two years of age and when baby needs me it's good to have some resources.

He states it's not our home and we shouldn't be cluttering it with toys. His mother never came out and said she had any problems with it at all. And in my opinion they do not occupy barely any room and are hidden away. I got pissed off and argued about it with him. I feel like he is robbing our kids of a proper childhood.

He himself has an odd childhood and I know he did not play with toys much. He seemed to grow up fast and skip all that,from stories and things he's told me. I feel like now he is taking that mindset to our kids and I'm 100 percent not okay with that. I had an amazing childhood, played with a ton of toys, I want my kids to enjoy being kids Damnit. I feel like he is just dictating this situation and I disagree.

He now is implying I do not care about his opinion and mine is the only one that matters and acting like I'm the bad guy.

Here’s a little backstory. I used to work with this friend, let’s call him Chris. Chris and I worked with each other when we were in high school. We were both 17 at that time. Over time we talked, eventually became friends and hanged out frequently outside of work. He soon after transferred to my high school. And now we have the same friend group. A year later, we all graduated and I had to move to a different city for college. He stayed behind because he wanted to attend a school that was closest to him. I’d come home and visit for the holidays, though we kept in touch through text and social media. I met my then gf, now fiancé (this is important later on). I brought her home after my first year was done, during the summer, to introduce her to my family and my friends. She would come home with me to visit my family during Christmas breaks and our friend group got together a few times over the break, so she was with us. Both Chris and her got along very well, whenever all of us got together. 

So now this is where he started to show signs of being clingy. I’m studying in major where it’s really time consuming and can’t be messaging every single day and I told him that and he said that he understood. If I didn’t respond to his text, he would send a bunch messages on insta, twitter, you get the idea. I told him again that I’m not able to because of studying. He said that he understood again, figures. This would happen every now and then and his response would be “sorry” and “I won’t do it again”. 

Present time- I had just graduated from college and moved in with my fiancé. I proposed to her a month ago and we had just announced it on social media a few days ago to share the news with our friends and family. Chris saw it and went completely ballistic sending me a shit ton of texts saying “You’re replacing me with that bitch” and a whole lot of other name calling. That was the last straw. I told him that I wasn’t “replacing” him or anyone for that matter. I said that he was being overly clingy, I no longer want to be friends and keep in contact with him anymore. After I told him that he said I was the asshole for saying that. 

When I told my fiancé about this she said that I did the right thing for cutting him out of my life. Earlier today I told my friend group about this whole situation and two out of five of them agreed that he was the asshole, and I wasn’t. While the other three are saying that he wasn’t the asshole, that I am and shouldn’t be “choosing my fiancé over my longtime friend for being clingy”

bwgzsn	2019-06-03 22:29:03		AITA for trying to make a profit from my best friend?	"A couple of months ago a dude hit me up asking if I wanted to buy some weed. He made me an offer, but then said if I bought some other things, he’d drop the price of a half ounce of weed from $120 to $90. Pretty cheap for a half ounce, but it was pretty shitty weed anyway.  With the other items, it brought the bill up to $200. 

Now I wasn’t really looking to spend anything near that, but I wanted some party favors for a bachelor party, so I figured I’d take him up on the offer, figuring I’d sell half of the weed to someone for $60 to make a little profit back. 

So I call my best friend, ask him if he wants to buy a quarter for $60. I tell him it’s not the best, but where we’re from, that’s still significantly cheaper than usual. I tell him the guy is coming over and I’ll hit him up after. 

Annoyingly, he barged in unexpectedly in the middle of the deal, but that’s not really relevant to the story other than he had a chance to see and smell the weed before agreeing to split it with me. He agreed, I paid the guy and he left. 

After nearly a month, my friend hadn’t paid me but had been smoking from the baggy. He hit hard times and kept saying he’d pay me, yada yada. Eventually I started to worry if I’d ever see anything for it, and decided to just cut my losses and ask for $45 instead of the $60 we had agreed on. I told him that’s what I paid for it so just give me that and we’re cool. I never even saw that as we agreed on a barter and made a trade for a piece of furniture I didn’t even want or need. 

So after nearly a month and a half, my friend is constantly calling me an asshole for trying to make money off of him as we are best friends and he would never do that to me. He won’t drop it. He’s middle manned for me many times, and as far as I know hasn’t made money off the deal. I’ve also middle manned for him in the past too, but in my eyes, this deal was different as I bought a bunch of shit thus lowering the price of the weed and was hoping to make some money back from the deal.  I don’t think I did anything wrong by offering him a bag of weed for $15 more than I paid for - especially since I never even saw any money from the deal let alone a profit, but he disagrees. He think I’m an asshole for merely attempting it.

bwgzcb	2019-06-03 22:27:52	ombregiraffe	AITA for not wanting to go with my Maid of Honor to pick out her bridesmaid dress?	"I'm getting married and having a small wedding in August. So far one of my bridesmaids and my Matron of Honor (my sister) have picked out and bought dresses. I bought a pre-owned dress online for myself. I told them what color to get and basically gave them free reign as to the style, just as long as they ran it by me before they bought it.

My Maid of Honor so far has sent me a very sparkly silver dress (not green, like I requested) and has asked me to come with her to an appointment at a bridal shop in Philly (an hour away, not too far but still, a bit of a drive) so she can try on the bridesmaid dresses they have. I don't want to go because I have a lot of stuff to do for the wedding still and work has been crazy busy lately, so any free time I get feels precious to me. I tried to gently tell her I'd prefer that she go by herself or just get one online, but she was upset about it and got pretty passive aggressive (this was via text). 

Also, just for some background on her, I told her I wanted to have my hair done a certain way for the wedding (just in conversation), and when I asked what style of hair she wanted for herself, she said ""same"" as in...the same hair that I'm going to have. She also at one point said (jokingly) that she wanted to be the center of attention. Her on-again, off-again boyfriend and her have been together(ish) for 8 years now and he shows no signs of commitment, so I think part of her is sad that I'm already getting married when I just met my fiancé less than two years ago and she's still not engaged.

bwgyt2	2019-06-03 22:26:22	SICKLEAVEPTO	WIBTA for faking sick to use up all my sick leave time before I leave my job?	"I'm leaving my job to start a new one in approximately a month. The offer is signed and official and I'm just waiting on the background check to clear. Once that clears, I'd put in my two week notice and by the end of that notice, I'd be starting at my new job the following Monday. So this entire span of time, from background check to day 1 on the new job, is a month.

I have about 80 hours of sick leave saved up and will have about 120 hours of PTO upon leaving, which will be cashed out to me on my last paycheck. It's only PTO cashed out. I told a friend (who doesn't work there and has no ties to my job whatsoever) about my plan to just intermittently fake sick or say I'm taking care of a sick loved one for the next few weeks to use up that time. I really enjoyed my time with my last employer, my manager is a cool person, and I don't want to burn bridges before leaving even if I have no foreseeable plans to reapply in the future. But I'm also already pretty mentally checked out and would love a break without using my PTO before I transition into a more demanding job.

My friend told me I was an asshole for this because it'd be obvious I'm just faking sick to avoid working for the time being, and that once I drop my two weeks notice, my manager will realize what I was doing and it will harm my last impression. They said I'm also creating more work for other teammates - we work in silos for people *outside* our team so that's not the case, although obviously if my manger or someone outside my team had a request for me I wouldn't be around to get it done. My friend countered, saying I'm creating a general burden by faking period, and that it's just overall unethical and that I should do my work for the full time I'm being paid. I feel no emotional attachment to corporations and believe at the end of the day I'm still just a number to them, but accepted it's possible this does make me an asshole.

I'm not required to explain *why* I'm sick, and feel entitled to that unused time I earned as an employee. I could spread it out to pretty much take off two or three days every week for the next month. WIBTA for using it up even though I'm not sick?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bwgxtp	2019-06-03 22:23:57	LuckyCharms285	WIBTA if I quit my job AFTER getting my bonus?	"Hello all. Firstly, I’m sorry if the formatting is really weird. I’m on mobile. 
Secondly, I’m in a little dilemma with my current job. I’m working as a secretary/receptionist for a new company that I WAS going to work for full time when I graduated from school in August. I’ve recently decided against it for many reasons, and mostly I just don’t think it’s the right fit for me. Next month I’m getting a bonus for working there a certain amount of time, and as much as I do like my job, I’m not getting paid enough for what I’ve been doing. I make $9 an hour which is just a tiny bit above min. wage. Not only have I been a receptionist, but I’ve been taking on so many other duties and basically managing the place because my boss is out almost constantly. She leaves me to do everything pretty much, but will still only pay me $9 an hour. And because I’m in school a lot, and the hours that we’re open and working totally conflict I’m not getting all that many hours. She asks me to come in early and stay later and fill out paperwork, which is making me miss a lot of school hours. At first I wasn’t saying no because I was planning on staying there after I graduated, and I wanted my boss to see me as hard working and dedicated, but now I can’t afford to miss more school and she gets upset when I say no. I’m currently looking for new companies that I can possibly be a receptionist for, until I’m done with school and I can then work full time in a higher position. I have a few interviews set up and there’s a chance I’ll be able to get a new job soon. Now like I said before, I have a bonus coming up. I would like to stay until I get the bonus and then put my 2 weeks in. I do feel like the asshole doing this because it would basically be like “Hey, thanks for the bonus. Also, here’s my 2 week notice.” But on the other hand I’ve been doing so much more than what was in my job description and I’ve been underpaid for it, and I feel like I deserve the extra money. I also feel like this might be just a silly situation and I’m over thinking it. But anyways, would I be the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	37.0	10.0	0.0	0.0

Passed a cop doing a good 20-30 over the probably 30mph limit. Knew I was busted and took off before he had a chance to react. The road was not winding, so I ended up pulling behind the nearest gas station and me and my friend walk into the station. Cop happens to pull a guy over in a really similar car - same color, different model into the front of the station. Friend and I try to kill time in the station, but there's only so much time you can spend in a gas station with a cop out front and not seem suspicious to the cashier. At this point the cop is removing some stuff from the car out front. Don't know what it is, but this guy has something in the car's trunk that the cop is placing on the ground. I tell my friend to walk to the next gas station next door (thinking in my panicked state that because the cop saw two people in the car, he might recognize one of us - nevermind he obviously mistook a car with one guy in it as his perp), and I get my car and drive out of the gas station to the next station. Cop is so engrossed in searching this guys car that he doesn't see me. Felt bad, but what could I do, walk up and say sorry sir, but I was the guy that ran from you.

Her biscuits weren’t cooked all the way through. Her dining room also didn’t have any kind of cohesive flow, it was just randomly put together.

He texts back:
“Mountain biking isn’t a sport retard”

Not knowing why he called me a retard, I get a bit heated and texted back
“Chess is a sport so why not retard”

I probably shouldn’t have called him a retard but I did. He goes on a tiny rant about how it’s only a sport if you compete. I finally lose my cool and just told him:
“Why are u so angry?”
“On god u have daddy issues”

This is something I know, he sometimes jokes about his dad not being in his life so I wasn’t very hesitant to say something like this.

Then He gets angry and says something along the lines of “yeah I’ll just call my dad and tell him to raise me mb bro”

This isn’t like a one time thing either. I would just be trying to have a fun casual conversation with him but then he shuts me down with insults and pessimism right away. We get along but his negative attitude really pisses me off. This time I finally lost my cool.

bwgre5	2019-06-03 22:08:21	chubby_cheekster	AITA for being suspicious that my twin might date my ex?	"First post on mobile you know the drill. TL;DR at the end

Backstory: I (17m) have a twin (also a guy) and we've been really close throughout our whole lives as we don't have an extensive family. Up until the end of last summer after working at a summer camp, he has become entitled and looks down upon me on almost everything. He become more bearable during the winter and now it seems hes back at it again. 

Here's the problem, there is his girl (16f) who I was friends with for a while and a couple months ago I developed feelings for her. I ask her out, she says yes, we hit it off, all was good. That was the case until recently when we made plans to get together again in a couple of days. The day comes, she avoids me and leaves me on read. In the afternoon she starts to make plans right to my face contradicting the plans we made prior. I thought she forgot about that day or didnt want ti.I didn't have the courage to ask her in person which one it was so I texted her exactly 

""Hey!! Did you forget that we were hanging out today or...?""

 ""If you did we can try tomorrow :)""

Her response:""don't be passive aggressive.""

When she sent that I tried to talk to her and she just ran away and glared at me. I tried to explain I was confused about today and if she forgot. Like usual she left me on read. I was extremely confused and a little hurt by what just happened. The evening she texts that she ""...didnt forget, she  didnt want to be around me""  she never answered any of my questions, only ghosting again. When the time came that she planned, no one went but my brother. I would've went,but she was still mad at me apperently. Long story short she broke up with me that night, if anyone wants to know why, I'll put it in edits.

*SIDE NOTE* Ever since the breakup happened he gets very defensive when I mention my ex

Fast forward to a now, her and my brother have hung out almost every day at the park for hours, even the whole day one time.  My friends don't like her at all (for reasons that include the breakup and others), and I'm talking to them about it currently and they agree what he's doing is shady, but I need to know. AITA?

bwgplt	2019-06-03 22:03:57		AITA for telling my friend I am uncomfortable with his PDA?	"Throwaway bc I don't want this linked to my main.

I (21F) and my bf (22M) were invited to my friend's (21M, let's call him Joe) dad's cottage for a board-game weekend. Also there were Joe's gf (22F, let's call her Mary), father and father's SO, and Joe's older brother.

Backstory: My bf and I (been together for almost 5 years) have known Joe for 8 years and Mary for 12. They have been together for around 7 years, and are currently living together for the summer. We were all in the same group in highschool, but Joe and Mary go to different universities than my bf and I (and each other their universities are currently ~2 hours away), so we all have not hung out together recently. I talk with Joe regularly, but Mary and I drifted apart in highschool and only occasionally talk.

Joe and Mary like close physical contact, (rubbing each other's backs and playing with hair). I don't mind this because my boyfriend and I do this too. However, there were a couple of instances where I was uncomfortable:

My bf had just gone to bed, Joe and I were sitting in the living room on our phones. Mary comes in and sits on Joe's lap, despite at least 2 other open seats. We sat there for about 3 minutes before heading up to bed.

My bf and I felt like we needed time to ourselves, so we went into the room we were given to snuggle. After around 30 minutes we came back down, and Joe and Mary were lying on the couch in the living room, with Mary almost completely on top of Joe. My bf suggested a game, and Joe and Mary looked at each other, shrugged, and made no attempt to move. I then suggested that my bf and I play the game in the connected dining room, partly because I was uncomfortable, and partly because the remaining seats were not arranged in a way good for playing the game.

My boyfriend and I are pretty quiet people, so we didn't ask them to move in-the-moment. I could not find a time to pull one of them aside and discuss that I was uncomfortable, and I did not feel comfortable jokingly asking them to stop (in case was passive aggressive).

After we all got back to our respective apartments (my bf and I live together), I texted Joe to tell him that I was uncomfortable with the PDA mentioned in 1 and 2. I also said that I realize that they don't see much of each other, and am 100% fine with back rubbing and hair-playing.

His response: ""Noted, but I think that we didn't do it that much, and that I wouldn't have been bothered if it were me.""

Me: ""Which is why you were doing it. You made no attempt to move (in 2), so I left the room because I was uncomfortable.""

Joe then sent, ""Going to bed. Night."" I asked him something this morning, and he replied but was curt.

I feel as though Joe doesn't respect my opinion, while also feeling bad about asking them to change the way they behave.

TLDR: Told my friend that I was uncomfortable with some of his and his girlfriend's PDA. He now seems pissed off at me."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bwgor8	2019-06-03 22:01:59	forestgrreen	AITA for not telling my friend she cheated	"My former classmates and I decided to have a party recently but because we are only 8 people (alternative private school) we all brought some friends. The party took place last Saturday to Sunday. I decided to bring Lucy, who loves parties, and Gab, who just realised the girl he loves doesn't like him and needed distraction. We had a lot of fun because most guest had never seen each other and will probably never see each other again due to long distances between our residences. This was an occasion where everyone could let loose, get drunk and dance horribly bad without being judged (no one is 18 yet so clubs aren't really an option).

The problem with the whole thing is what Lucy did that night. Half a year ago she met her current boyfriend and fell in love with him. I listened to hours and hours of her crying about not being with him and when they actually got together one month ago she was over the moon. She is very in love with her boyfriend and uses ever second not occupied by anything else to talk about him. I belive her bf feels the same way but I have only met him like two times.

At the party she got really dunk and so did Gab. He was totally crushed and talked about how bad rejection feels the whole time, my drunk self was very annoyed with that so I left him and Lucy alone with a few of the other kids. When I came back about half an hour later I saw Lucy and Gab making out and I was shocked. Lucy seemed so in love with her bf. I decided to stop them but they left in to a room together as a reaction, I followed but they just ended up throwing up side by side in the bathtub and going to sleep on a sofa.

When we woke up the next morning and I talked to Lucy she mentioned that she does not remember anything from the moment she had drunken her fifth drink. I belive her.

I also talked to Gab and he said he remembers kissing someone but not who. I don't really belive that but he is not the person to gossip.

Now to my dilemma: I did not tell Lucy what she did because she would have been crushed by this. I know how much her relationship means to her and that she would not be able to continue it knowing what she did. I also don't know her boyfriend and because of that I care about Lucy's happiness more then her boyfriend's.

Am I the Asshole for not telling my friend she cheated because it would upset her?

bwgoqe	2019-06-03 22:01:56		AITA for getting sick of my husband objectifying me	"Me and my husband have been married for 1.5 years and were together for another 5 years before then.

I’m not sure exactly when it started bothering me, maybe he didn’t used to do it before, but I now find it so irritating when he constantly speaks or acts in a way that I feel objectifies me.  

I’ll be doing something completely innocent and he will just come over and grab my ass or my boobs or pull my bottoms down to show my butt.  Often he’ll just randomly say something like ‘I really want to fuck you’ and look me up and down in what I see as a really leery way.  When I’m getting ready in the morning and I’m not fully dressed it’s even worse, and then when I ask him to leave me alone and let me get ready he whines that it’s my fault for ‘teasing’ him - the way I see it I’m just getting ready for my day in my own home.  

In terms of how often this happens, this is every single day multiple times and it really doesn’t matter what I’m doing.  Sometimes it’s constant and he can’t seem to talk about anything else and I personally find it exhausting.  It’s the opposite of a turn on for me.  It puts me off the whole idea of sex sometimes because I feel like it’s a chore he’s nagging me about.  And it also makes me feel like he doesn’t respect me or my personal space - I feel like an object.

Part of me understands that this is his way of showing he’s still attracted to me and wanting confirmation that I’m attracted to him too, and I understand that.  But we’ve talked about it so many times and I’ve begged him to stop doing it and I’ve explained how it makes me feel.  He doesn’t really engage too much in these conversations, and he might do it less for maybe a week or even a few weeks after we talk about it but ultimately his view is that he can’t help it and after a while I feel like we are back to square one.  He said to me a few times that when he has a boner it’s uncomfortable, and I don’t understand that.

Now if we didn’t have sex much I would understand it more, but we have sex I’d say on average 3 times a week, but more than that when we aren’t working long hours in our jobs and actually have more time to spend together.  (I think we’d actually have sex more if he didn’t act like this, and I’ve told him that but he doesn’t agree.)

bwgmw1	2019-06-03 21:57:49		AITA for now allowing my husband's nephew to stay at our house?	"This is a throwaway account.

My husband's nephew currently lives in Toronto, and is Canada on a student visa. My husbands nephew has a fake college degree from India and only took a one year course in basic accounting and his having hard time finding a job related in his field so he can gain residency. He decided that he was going to move to our province where he doesn't need a job in a related field and can work at any job for two years and receive his permanent residency.

My husband decided that his nephew would stay at our home until he gained his residency. My husband also wants to give him a job and his own business because he knows that very places would hire people that are on their student visa's due to the amount of paperwork and hassle involved. I don't really care about him hiring his nephew for his business, but I do not want him staying in our home. Though my husband works hard and makes a lot money, he doesn't help around the house at all. He works ten hour shifts a day, and usually doesn't get home until after 8:00 PM. Since this is the case, I am the one that does all the household work for our family (We also have two kids, one is in University, the other is in high school). I don't mind doing this at all and it doesn't effect me in anyway, since I only work around 20 hours a week at a part time job. My problem with this is that when my husband's nephew is going to stay with us I know that I would be responsible for cooking food, doing his laundry, giving him rides around the city for things he needs to get done and etc. I proposed the idea of letting him stay with us for a week and while he looked for his own place in the city, but my husband for absolutely against that. He brought up the that my niece stays with us and he doesn't have a problem with her staying. I bring up the fact my niece pays rent ($400 a month), helps around the house, does all of her own cooking and laundry, and that we had an extra room in the basement for her. (She is also only staying for three months because she is about to be married and will move in with her husband then.) If my husbands nephew were to move in, he would be sharing a room with my son in high school (my son doesn't want to share his room) and will not be paying rent because my husband thinks it's not right for him to charge his family rent.

Anyway we had a huge argument about it and I made a stand. I said I was not going to allow him to stay at our house. My husband is basically already giving him a job and he his parents back in India make more than enough to support him if he has any financial troubles. (His family has millions of dollars back in India)

bwgm4z	2019-06-03 21:56:08	polaropposite5	AITA for respectfully messaging my sister about her tirade in our family group text and about her wife asking to use my SSN?	"On mobile. Formatting might be wrong but here goes. 

So my little sister N, lives in AZ with her wife M. 

M, texted me via N’s number last night asking me if she could have my SSN so her sister could get a job. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable and basically a no. 

Then in our family group chat, N texted saying how she was going to basically stop talking to us because we’re judgmental and always critical of her decisions. And that we basically don’t care about her. Previously she had texted about having a job interview and my little brother asked a question about the place she applied at. However, the text was jumbled and a lot of it didn’t make sense. In the past I have suspected that M was responding to some texts acting like she was N. The only reason why I suspect this is the word choice and some of the sentences being grammatically incorrect as far as word usage. M’s first language isn’t English. Hence why I suspected this. I figured it was M, some of the tirade due to the fact that I denied her request to use my SSN. 

I texted N saying how she always plays the victim and makes it seem like were mean to her and don’t care about her. When in reality, she will lash out at us. Mostly via texts with incorrect sentences and what appears to be broken English. I also said that she was wrongs for saying we don’t care when just under a year ago they were in Chicago and wouldn’t drive the 1.5 hrs to see us in Milwaukee because M said they didn’t have time. Same thing in AZ when we all lived there when she couldn’t come and visit. Cause M was busy. Though when she did come over M day outside in her car and would start honking after 5 mins of visiting us. I love my sister but sometimes her wife is just controlling and weird.

"TL;DR: The doctors told my mama she had six months to quit smoking or they're not going to help her with pain meds. She can't drive and depends on others to buy her cigs. WIBTA If I told her I will no longer buy her cigarettes in 6 months?

My mother has been smoking for 30+ years and has a shit ton of health problems.. Fibromyalgia, diabetes, and depression are just a few to start off with. She was referred to the Mayo clinic last year but refused to go because she doesn't like to travel.

I moved home last month (single, no kids, transferred jobs) to help her around the house and try to get answers from other doctors around here. Her favorite doc added Wellbutrin to her meds a few weeks ago, but she quit taking it cold turkey for days later bbecause it spiked her blood sugar.

Next appointment (last week) was at a pain management clinic. A few years ago, my mama was prescribed Norco after her mastectomy and she said it was one of the only things that helped her hip/back pain. She wanted a new RX for it, so she went to the pain mgmt clinic at a local hospital. They told her that nicotine binds to the receptors that Norco uses, so that even if they give her a RX for it, it's not going to be as effective unless she quits smoking. Therefore, they gave her six months to quit smoking, or they'll no longer prescribe her pain meds.

SO... WIBTA if I told my mama that I refuse to go to the store and pick up cigarettes for her after Thanksgiving? She's almost unwilling to even try... She told a friend of hers on the phone today that she didn't know if she ""could, or even wanted to quit smoking."" 

Why should I waste my time driving her around to doctors' appointments if she keeps doing THE EXACT OPPOSITE of what they say to do? But then again, I do believe she's really addicted/depressed, and that's hard.

So, WIBTA if I told get she's on her own after Thanksgiving?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	784.0	27.0	0.0	0.0

Both me (M 15) and my friend (M 15) are 9th graders and we take the same art class. Lucky for us, the teacher put us at a table together in the class, so we sit pretty close. We are very good friends and rarely get in fights. Until one day when we had to start a new art unit. For our final project, we had to make a self-portrait, but both of us are Muslims so we can’t draw ourselves. The teacher said we can draw anything else from nature, so we sat at our seats, thinking of ideas. All of a sudden, I get this great idea for my project and I happily said my idea to him. I told him that I wanted to make a bald eagle with the flag of America behind it and I guess he thought it was a good idea as well. So I go to my teacher to confirm my idea, and when I come back to my seat, I see my friend looking up a picture of a bald eagle. I asked him why he looked it up and why he isn’t finding another idea, and he said something that he can take my idea if he gets and prints a picture before I do. He walks away and in my mind I’m like wtf I literally said the idea and asked the teacher first if I can do it, and I thought he was joking, so I let it slide. Soon, he comes back and guess what that guy just did— he printed out a fucking bald eagle. I got pissed immediately since it was my idea to do it and he thought it was okay for him to print it out. I talked to him about it and he said that he printed it for me. At this point, I’m relieved and get back to work. Then, at the end of class, he comes up to me and says that he can’t find another idea, and he said this-“Hey, I can’t think of another idea. So I’ll stick to MY idea of the bald eagle.” Rewind a sec. My idea? MY idea? (Sry I don’t know how to bold text but I’m talking about the word my) After he said this, I immediately got mad at him and started saying things like “screw you” to him. He laughed it off, but boy, that was no joke to me. It was literally the best idea I ever had in that class, and I felt so good of coming up with a great idea when all my other ideas were shit. I got really mad at my friend, and for the next couple of days, he kept saying that I stole HIS idea and this made me even more mad. I even asked the other three people at my table and they said that the bald eagle was my idea, but he keeps brushing it off saying that I’m salty about it. My other friends were split saying that I shouldn’t be mad at this while others say that I don’t lie and that my friend should stop. So AITA in this situation?

His brother died in a drunk driving accident almost 15 years ago. His family mentions the brother a lot. I feel like my boyfriend (middle child) is second fiddle to him.

So much so, that my boyfriends nephews talk about the brother as if he’s there. Even saying things like “oh I just saw “brothers” ghost” or “look I inscribed ‘brothers’ name on my new guitar” and boyfriends mother supports this and thinks it is cute and funny. 
Am I the asshole for wanting some closure for their poor family? I personally think it’s wrong the nephews (5 y/o and 7 y/o) talk about him, because it seems like they talk about him to get attention.

bwghwv	2019-06-03 21:46:00	panda_farmer	AITA for sticking to my guns and insisting I bring my kids to the airport for their first out of state visitation?	"My ex and I are in the middle of a divorce, and he has moved across the country to the east coast whereas my kids(6and 4) and I live in California.

We have basically settled everything regarding custody and our dissolution, and the kids are set to travel to his state in about a weeks time for summer visitation. He is flying out to meet them, and will be flying back with them. Ex is responsible for travel fare, ect as per custody order.

This is the first time in their lives they will be away from me for longer than a weekend, and I won't see them again until Aug. 1st. For the past month or so I have been hyping them up for this trip, telling them all the fun things they will do and how their dad misses them and ect, basically trying to make this seem like the greatest vacation ever. Which, for them, it is. For me it is harder, but I know it's what's best for them.

In the process of all our talks about the trip, I have promised them that I will take them to the airport and see them off, and will call them daily (once again per custody order), and that they will have a blast. Ex has the option to call the kids daily as well, has only called them 3 times in the past month.

Ex informs me today that the kids plane will be leaving one day later than the agreed upon date(which actually falls under my court ordered time), and that he will still be picking the kids up as agreeded and keeping them in town over night couch surfing at his relative's house and will take them to the airport.

Bare in mind I am the parent with the car seats, my children's house is here with their beds, and I've promised them I will take them to the airport.

I inform EX of all these points and remind him that actually, legally, I get them until the end of that day, so unless he wants to pick them up at 12:01 the next morning, I will be taking the kids to the airport and basically to back off. Its an 8 hour difference between 12:01 and when the plane leaves, is this really a fight you want to have right now.

The conversation devolves into him calling me petty, saying I'm a drama queen and I'm interfering in his relationship with his kids. I tell him I won't be bullied into breaking my promise to the kids and after a lot of back and forth the convo ends with him agreeing to meet us at the airport. He ends the convo by telling me the kids will figure it all out one day and they aren't stupid?

The whole situation has me pissed off, but I did not devolve into name calling or anything like that. I just kept reiterating that I would be taking them to the plane. So, should I have backed off or am I the asshole?"	No A-holes here	0	0	837.0	179.0	0.0	0.0

I had been landscaping for this guy for about 8 months and he taught me a lot and was a good mentor. He didn’t pay me much but I worked with enthusiasm most of the time. We got along pretty well and I thought of him as a friend and an ally. I struggle with substance abuse problems but I’ve  been sober since August however the last few weeks I worked for him I started using kratom. To make a long story short, I reversed over a stop sign and broke down and told him I had relapsed. Sobriety is a theme of our relationship so he gave me an ultimatum to either tell the people in my sober house or he would fire me. I changed my mind about telling them a few times, and in preparation for him firing me, I found another job that I was really interested in and that would pay more. I finally told the sober house and told my boss that I was going to take this new job as well. Upon hearing this news, he told me he would try to sabotage my future and that he would make me pay him back every cent in damage I had caused. I agreed to pay him and also offered to work two weeks which he declined. So yeah, I understand relapsing under these circumstances is bad. Running over a stop sign and leaving a gas cap at a gas station is careless but does he really have a right to sabotage my life over this? I was offered a better job and I took it. It wasn’t great timing but I was burned out on the landscaping job and didn’t want to work 60 hours a week every week all summer.	Not the A-hole	0	0	211.0	51.0	0.0	0.0

My partner wants me to take two weeks off back to back after I've agreed to one week. In the proposed additional week, I've been offered 4 days work (dusk and dawn activity surveys), these offers aren't consistent and I'd rather take those than go on holiday, AITA?

My partner notes I never take holidays in the summer (previously I was a greenkeeper, so summer is for work not holidays) and I say she is unwilling to take holidays in the winter.

We have a baby due in December, so I wish to earn as much possible this summer to contribute for the nursery and other costs. However, my partner feels this will be our last chance for a summer together. We are at different points in our lives but at the same age, we both recognise each others goals but naturally want different outcomes.

Edit; after the proposed holiday, I will start a summer placement which is full time but pays minimum wage. Each activity survey take between 2 and 6 hours but pay 2.5x minium wage, hence my desire to take the work."	No A-holes here	0	0	2595.0	234.0	0.0	0.0

"Hey Reddit, I am moving out of my current apartment tomorrow. My family and I have lived here for 2 years. Everything was going fine when we first moved in and for about 6months to a year after. But after we had been living here for about a year the neighborhood, the building, and management took a huge down fall.
We started to notice that our new upstairs neighbors would play their music super loud. Sometimes so loud it would rattle stuff in the kitchen. The biggest problem was the bass. Holy shit the bass would wake up us from sleeping. Sometimes so loud we could hear the words of the song through the floor. So we would called security have them go knock on the door and it would turn off...but only for a awhile and then BOOM back on again but louder! 

So we started to complain and tell management about it, they said they would talk to the tenant and take care of things (this is about the last 6-8 months). We have (had) a resident service manager we’ll call him Todd. So we contact Todd about the noise issue and specify it’s the bass that’s bothering us. He said he would talk to them. The music still happens and nothing has been done about it. We do this for about a month an half to two months. Finally my grandma had enough of this and called Todd out for not doing anything in which he replies “She (the tenant) does not think she is doing anything wrong or playing her music too loud. She doe not think she is the problem”. At this point my grandma and I had lost it. We have had enough of this. We just stopped complaining about it because nothing was being done. 

It got really bad again a about a month or two ago and we went to go complain to management again to only find out that Todd is no longer with the complex (my guess he was fired) and management had finally started to listen to us (somewhat). So with all of this backstory done and so much more I have written, WIBTA if I wrote an angry letter to the upstairs neighbors and put it on there door before I leave?

TL;DR My upstairs neighbors are terrible, play music insanely loudly during quiet hours waking us up, stomping around when we call security, and management did nothing. I want to leave a note for them letting them know how awful they're being. WIBTA if I did?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

bwgeyv	2019-06-03 21:39:17	Fix_42	AITA when I don't want to drive my sister around?	"TL:DR at bottom

Backround: My older sister drives her boyfriend's car because she doesn't have one, but it is in the shop. On Mondays I have work from 1-5, it's the longest shift I have all week (I am in school too) , she knows this. She also knows that I put in my two weeks notice last Thursday and so I am trying to be a good employee so I can use this job as a reference. 

What happened: My sister texts me Monday morning and asks if I can take her to her dentist appointment at 2 . I tell her I am working and idk if I can or not. I then talk to my boss and get them to be ok with me working an hour later to get the same amount of hours in so I can drive my sister.

Fast forward to the drive to her appointment, it's about a half hour and so we get talking. The fact that I have to go back to work comes up and my sister is shocked that I wasn't planning on driving her back. She gets very upset because,""Why would I need a ride there and not back!"" Well idk maybe BECAUSE I TOLD YOU I HAVE WORK AND YOU ONLY ASKED FOR A RIDE TOOOO THE APPOINTMENT (sorry this all happened a few minutes ago and I'm still salty). I suggest she do homework in the lobby of our dentists office (family friend he wouldn't mind) while she waits for my mom to get off work and pick her up. She says she doesn't want to wait and how she has done stuff like this for me in the past (she hasn't unless you count taking me to the ER because I couldn't walk and mom was out of town). After a while of her pressuring me I give in and tell her I will wait for her appointment to be done. 

So AITA for not wanting to drive her back from her appointment and instead go to work?

Sorry for formatting or spelling errors, I'm on mobile.

TL:DR ; sister asked me to drive her to her dentist appointment during my normal work hours then got mad when I told her I wasn't going to drive her back from her appointment."	Not the A-hole	0	0	107.0	35.0	0.0	0.0

Now, my fiancé and I have been planning our wedding and I have had no intention on inviting my parents from the start. They cut me off 5 years back after my now ex girlfriend had our child. We were barely out of high school at the time and were way too young to raise a kid on our own, my ex said she wanted to go to college and we broke up, so I raised my child by myself with no help from anyone in my family except my older sister. My sister has always been good to me and I know she wants the best for my son and I, but recently she’s been pushing to try to get me to reconcile with our parents. I’m very against this as they made their feelings very clear before and I have no reason to associate with them anymore. She’s been pressuring me to invite our parents to the wedding, I told her no countless times. One day, she invited our parents over to my place without my permission, she caused far more problems than she was trying to fix and I’m honest to god tired of it all. I haven’t spoken to her since she pulled that stunt and now I’m not even sure if I should invite her to my wedding because of what happened. I’m not sure if this is something that can be fixed before the wedding but I feel like I can’t trust her enough to invite her after what she did. Even though my fiancé says it’s okay if I don’t invite any of my family, I can’t help but feel guilty, I’m also afraid his family will think I’m an asshole for leaving my own family out. (His family has very strong family values and they’re all very close.) Am I being an asshole for excluding my family? Is excluding my sister going too far?

I’ve hung out with my best friend for probably 4 days and she also leaves a little bit before I do. Anyways, she wanted to hang out today or yesterday and told me last week about it a couple of times. I said that if I had time then sure. Another friend wanted me to come over yesterday for a last min birthday thing so I decided to do that and didn’t text her. Today, I also decided to hang out with another friend and didn’t tell her.  She just texted me that she’s hurt that I didn’t text her at all and that she thought we’d spend at least some time today or yesterday together since we talked about it and because she’s leaving Wednesday. I dont see the big deal because my time is so limited so I didn’t apologize for it. I have a few friends that want t hang out and I can’t make everyone happy. 

I should mention though that this Spring I had a huge blow out with another friend that turned into a lot of drama at school. My best friend was one of the only persons to reach out and she actually texted me every day during this among some other things.

We already have a daughter who is 3. My fiancee confessed to me that she's very upset about the timing of this pregnancy because she doesn't want to be showing or dealing with pregnancy symptoms on our wedding day. She's one of those ""dreaming of her wedding forever"" people and was upset that she wouldn't be able to wear the dress she picked out and felt she wouldn't feel beautiful on our wedding day. I suggested that we postpone the wedding, as we'd only deposited on a venue at that point, and they'll let us keep our deposit so long as we rebook at the same place. We decided to postpone until next summer.

Most of our family is supportive of the decision, but my parents in particular are upset because it will cost them about $100 to change their flights, and, (this is more their main reason) our daughter is getting older and they feel that she will start to be more aware that her parents aren't married. She's starting school soon and my parents are convinced that she will be bullied and treated differently by other kids and their parents because we aren't married, and that she will be ostracized. Their basic point is that we should just get married to avoid even the potential that this could be an issue for her as she starts preschool. They feel that my fiancee is being selfish and not considering our daughter in this plan. We live in a pretty conservative area, but we're sending her to a ""hippy dippy"" preschool which we're thinking might self select out some of the more conservative families.

A little back story. My mum had mental health issues. Bipolar to be exact. She could be harsh and cruel. But mostly a good mum.

I just turned fifteen and we argued about something to do with my room being a mess. I also refused to let her borrow my ps3 so she wasn't happy. I told her i wanted my dvd player back.

I came into my room and shed cut the plug off the power cable to my tv. I screamed that i hated her and began throwing things around my room. She came into my room smiling, threatening to call the police. I told her to do it, and shifted my arm. I had several dozen cuts along my forearm. Even now i remember it was bad. Black scabbed cuts from my wrist to my elbow. I still have the scars.

She asked if i did that to myself. I told her i had and i wasn't going to stop. She laughed and said that i could do it as much as i liked and i was no longer her problem. She gave me two minutes to leave the house.

I threw a book at my bedroom door hard enough to leave a hole in it. I sobbed and got my ps3 and some clothes and walked into the kitchen. She demanded my keys and i threw them on the table. I left and she slammed the door in my face.

After a couple weeks she had to tell the council i wasn't living there. She had to move out eventually because of the bedroom tax. She got into debt with the landlord. She lost her deposit which meant she had nowhere to go. She stayed for a year, accumulating debt before moving in with her boyfriend.

Pretty much, they were both at fault for the lack of communication over prom plans. X never wanted to go because her friends had dates and she didn’t but still decided to go. Now I get that, it isn’t the most fun but walking into a situation already thinking negatively doesn’t help. It could of been solved by them being honest and communicating, but neither did that so the friendship ended (and quite badly). I see how both are at fault. They both complained to me, X being much meaner about Y. I’ll be honest, X can be unnecessarily cunt-ish at times so I tried keeping a middle ground by not agreeing with either of them. Y truly doesn’t care about the friendship ending, she doesn’t mind at all. X was hit hard because now she only has three friends, and has made it clear she doesn’t like Y at all. I know Y doesn’t care if I remain friends with X, she’s told me that. 

I’ve made plans to hang out with Y on a specific day to attend a presentation that’s essential to her graduating high school. X asked me what I was doing on that specific day so I was honest and said I would be hanging with Y to simply see her since I haven’t in months, help her get prepared for her presentation and visit my old teachers (I graduated last year). Unlike with other people, it’s easy to see when X is annoyed through text. X definitely wasn’t happy with hearing that I’m hanging out with Y and is now being a bitch to me about it.

Y has been a great friend of mine for three years, and is simply a good person. X is very dismissive, and doesn’t realise she kinda sucks at being a friend sometimes. For example, if X asked how my day was and I responded that it was bad, she wouldn’t ask what happened or offer any reaction- she’d immediately go on to talk about her own day. I felt this was necessary to include because she does lack at times and I’m not even sure if she realises she’s being rude. I want to talk to her about that but given her reaction to me remaining friends with Y, I have a feeling she won’t take it well. I know the friendship will eventually end but for now it won’t, so I digress back to the original situation.

6 months ago around Christmas time, RF asked me out on a date and realizing her intentions in the way that she asked me out of the blue. I kindly messaged her that I understood her intentions but that I don't feel the same way about her. She was naturally upset about it but was ok that I wanted to remain just friends. During this period GF was the one that supported RF while RF was recovering from the rejection.   


Now it's been half a year later and I had developed feelings for GF over the past couple months and decided to ask her out. Liking me as well she intially said yes but after telling RF about it as they're good friends and she didn't want to hurt RF, GF is now starting to regret the decision and is thinking about saying no.

bwg896	2019-06-03 21:23:27	graduationAITA	AITA for not explicitly inviting my sibling to my graduation?	"My older brother has not communicated with me in months because I did not respond to a text of his (\*more detail below), despite my reaching out to him multiple times since then. Over the holidays and before he cut off communication, I had mentioned the date of my graduation to him (where I believe invitation was implied) and he entered it into his phone, with the intent of getting more details closer to the date. We live in different states so I didn't have the opportunity to see him in-person beforehand, so because he wouldn't even respond to small-talk texts, I made the assumption that he would not spend the time/money to attend my graduation. I would have obviously preferred to have him at my graduation, but at the same time don't think it's a big deal that he didn't attend because it's just a graduation ceremony (i.e. not a wedding or something major). My parents attended, and had asked my brother multiple times beforehand if he planned on going - to which he replied along the lines of ""no, because I wasn't given the details."" When I got wind that he probably wasn't coming, I didn't press the issue or reach out to him regarding it because a) he had been ignoring me up to that point and I thought my above assumption was fair, and b) it's just a graduation ceremony. While I did not give him additional details (exact time, place, etc.), he did know the date and could have just asked my parents (or me) if he really wanted to attend. I've never explicitly not invited my brother to anything, so there was no precedent for him to believe he was unwelcome. I also didn't send out any sort of invitation (by mail or email), so he was not excluded in that way either.

&#x200B;

\*A few months ago, my brother and his gf bought tickets to an event and, knowing that I would be interested, asked if I wanted to go and bought me a ticket. I flew out before the day of the event and stayed with my parents (my brother's apartment is rather small and I had work for grad school). The day of the event, my mom dropped me off at his place, I went to dinner with him and his gf before the event (he paid and I did thank him), attended the event, stayed at his place that night, and we met my parents for breakfast the next morning. I went home with my parents (because all my stuff was there, I had more work to do, and they would be taking me to the airport the next day) and that afternoon, my brother texted me asking if wanted to hang out. I didn't see the text until later that night (likely because I was doing homework? I honestly don't know), when it would have been too late to do anything, so I didn't respond. ~~I did text him the next day, letting him know I was on the plane and thanking him again for taking me to the event.~~ He has not spoken to me since. I believe he thinks I am being ungrateful for inviting me/buying me a ticket (please note that I did tell him how fun the event was and thanked him multiple times) and that I purposely ignored his text. I personally think this is ridiculous, as I am frequently on both ends of no/delayed responses to text messages.

&#x200B;

EDIT: grammar

EDIT2: Sorry, I looked back at my texts - I did not text him from the plane, but did thank him again later via text. I did not address the fact that I missed his earlier text, which I probably should have done. But I also don't think it warrants completely cutting off communication with me.

bwg7w6	2019-06-03 21:22:40		AITA for not wanting to watch my wife’s uncle’s kids?	So my (22M) wife (21F) has an uncle who is the same age as she is. He has two boys who are 2yo and 6mo old. Her uncle and I are friends, but neither my wife or myself are particularly fond of his wife. The children (mainly the one who is mobile) are often messy, destructive, and the older one loves to terrorize our cats. My wife and I live in a mid-size apartment with two cats. I do the majority of the cleaning (she’s a nurse and works more than I do), and I like to keep the apartment looking good. When her uncle needs a sitter, it requires my wife to drive and hour to pick them up, and then an hour to bring them back. While they’re here, I’m incredibly uncomfortable because I do not like or want children. I’m not comfortable disciplining someone else’s child, and HATE when they come over. To be fair, I don’t mind visiting her uncle’s house and being around them, mainly because it isn’t my place. WIBTA for asking my wife to go there to babysit rather than bringing them here?

bwg6eo	2019-06-03 21:19:03	bluebaripie	AITA for cutting one of my childhood friends out of my life and not including him?	"Bit of background. When I moved in 2nd grade, I made friends with all the neighborhood kids. We all kind of grew up together, and have remained close up through our college years and into our 20s. 
 
Except one. 

This guy, Kevin, has always been off. Was a weird kid, didn’t really understand social boundaries. Whatever, we were all kids and it didn’t matter. My brother is on the spectrum so I’m used to odd behaviors. 

However, maturity did not hit him like it should’ve. His whole personality is “I’m gay and I like Japan”. He tries to force his way into situations as best he can, is very entitled, and believes he can just say whatever he wants. We usually brush it off cause there’s nothing we can really do about it. 

We used to go to a lake house every summer and hang out (not including Kevin). The family who owned the house sold it, so we haven’t been in a couple years, but I wanted to put together a little throwback trip for us before we graduate from college. We were discussing at a grad party when Kevin forced himself into the conversation and said “I’m invited to this too, right guys?” And we all just kind of looked at each other and went “sure ok whatever” with no real intention of inviting him. 

He continued to interrupt me to bring up bad shit from my past, including when my cats were put up for adoption in a shelter without my consent and adopted out and I’ll never see them again, as well as other past traumatic events I’ve lived through and actually developed PTSD from. It seemed like it was almost fun for him, because he would giggle while saying things and was almost trying to trigger flashbacks.

He has said some outright awful things to other people as well, like jokingly (read: maliciously) asking “Hey, how’s your mom doing?” to someone who’s mother died of cancer the year before (yes he knew about it). I should have stood up to him more but everyone dismisses it because that’s just how he is.

There’s a point where I can no longer take being an emotional punching bag because someone else either cannot or will not control what comes out of their mouth. 

He has never been checked for anything because his parents just don’t care, even though there’s so much wrong with him that they complain about him to other parents and say they wish they had someone else’s kid instead. He legitimately has not been taught right from wrong and is allowed to just do and say whatever completely undisciplined and I feel bad but I cannot do it anymore. 

I refuse to be around him. He invited himself everywhere, but I am putting my foot down and not allowing it. Some of my friends said I am being a little over dramatic, as this might cause a rift between my family and his and in turn possibly some other families.

So I decide to go inside and see where she is, and she's just casually hanging out in the basement with my older brother. I said ""this is why you left me sitting alone?"" And she was just laughing about it like ""oh well we were just eating hot cheetos and talking about college"" and I told her she's rude. The rest of the night was a little awkward but we hung out yesterday and we were fine.

I'm still pissed about it though. Not only does she leave me hanging but she could have at least texted me and told me to come to  the basement where she and my brother are."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

A little bit of backstory, my bio dad is a raging alcoholic and he is missing. My step father is my real father, he raised me, loved me, and provided for me (and my siblings but they are irrelevant here). He and my mom broke up when I was very young but he stayed in our lives as a father and a friend of my mother, he couldn't have children of his own due to cancer that left him sterile. We moved away when I was 10 or so and after that had some, but not much contact. He eventually met someone new and I didnt hear from him. I was too young to understand what was going on and I just felt rejected and abandoned. Last i heard of him the cancer was back so for all i know he could be dead

I know this might  seem like a validation post to some but there are reasons why I think I would be the asshole, I haven't spoken to this man for many years, 
For all I know he could have started a new life with a new family, who am I to barge into that. why would he want me back in it.

My main fear is getting rejected and feeling abandoned again.

I'm engaged and I want to invite him to the wedding,  maybe if we were to get our relationship back the way it was he could even be the one to walk me down the altar (unrealistic i know but it does'nt hurt to dream) 

So the question is WIBTA if I contact him, I wouldn't tell him walk me down the altar immediately, I just wanna get back to the man i viewed as my father for so many years.

So my 10 year old brother is a fortnite addict. He plays during all his free time on my own (M 18) playstation, which i have no problem with. 

The thing is that our television is in the room next to mine and he often goes up early on weekends to play because he is young. But when he does this he plays with his friends and he screams and swears very loudly, waking me and often my girlfriend who sleeps at my house during weekends. He is also very loud when im trying to study which is not helping. There is no point in telling him to be quiet because he will forget immidiately and start swearing and screaming in no time. 

My mom tells me to let him play early in the morning because ’he has nothing else to do’. 
I tell her that he needs to learn how to compromise. 
She tells me that him starting to play and scream at 10 in the morning is compromising for him. 

Noone wants to see my side of the problem so I’m thinking of removing and hiding the playstation because I bought it and its mine.

bwg0yx	2019-06-03 21:06:11		AITA - Don't Support My Daughter Going to Pride This Year	"I don’t support my daughter going to Pride this year.  

ATA - Last year my daughter wanted to go to Pride Houston, she had JUST turned 17.  My wife chaperoned a few of her older friends that do not have as supportive parents.  Keep in mind, we do not live in a big city or in Texas.  So – my wife, young daughter, her gf and 4-5 slightly older kiddos in the big town for Pride Houston.  Just the parade.  They had a good time.  They had a great time.

Before Pride last year I had discussions with my sister and her wife, I at least had one viewpoint of Pride that I could understand - The celebration of suppressed sexuality from a generation ago (obviously longer than that, but let’s agree to have a time reference) of humans that would be put in jail for liking a man; killed for liking a man; abolished; kicked out of society.  A chance for them to come out and say, this is who I am.  I feel like they have the full support to ‘exaggerate’ their sexuality.  

This year, her comments about Pride, her excitement seem different; but from my take not in a positive way.  They seem like..fashion or status.  Like she is wanting to show off and not take it for what it is; be happy/supportive and enjoy time with friends.  I feel like she is wanting the ‘trophy buck picture’ to put on Insta.  

It is not everyday life – which I get it is not supposed to be.  But its also not even reality – not one bit.  And I feel that the promotion, commercialized hype; is not helping Pride and not helping the youth.  Creating a false society.

The one member of the group who they gossiped about because of his social awkwardness let me know he was going, we've always been close and hangout pretty often. 

What was shocking is that the one in the group who I knew the least and have barely spoken to one on one replied to say he was busy that day with his brothers wedding.

The rest, including one I considered my closest friend of them  never replied or hit me up but I know they saw it because they're addicted to their phones and super active on Facebook daily. 

I feel like crap because I thought I did everything to earn their respect, I always went out of my way to make their bdays special and buy them gifts when most of them never bothered to get gifts for each other. 

I've noticed that wherever someone wants to plan a get-together one or two of them would hit me up and ask if I planned on going, basically they would figure out if enough people were going and then would decide accordingly. I've always shyed away from celebrating my birthday because people have always forgotten it or would always cancel/ghost and I'd be left feeling humiliated and depressed on my bday so this would be the first time I planned something in years.

My birthday is still like a week away so there is a chance they'd still respond but with how quickly they normally all respond in a chat together it comes off as them wanting nothing to do with me.

I'm all about equal effort so I've decided to unfriend and unfollow all of them on social media since I'm no longer a priority, am i the asshole for jumping the gun?"	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Also, happy pride month! 🏳️‍🌈
M/C- My awesome friend. I don’t think they did anything wrong.
PMP- Possibly mean people. Social bullies  me and M/C.
OP- The awkward kid, slightly chubby, me.
A bit of backstory; I am transgender female to Male, he/him. M/C is still questioning, they/them. Both me and them are read as female, and, at this point in time, there is nothing either of us can do. PMP talk crap about me and M/C behind our backs, and the school did nothing about it, even after one of them ripped the arm off the anxiety toy I carry with me everywhere. I have recently moved really far away, but we have stayed in really good contact.
Here’s what happened- M/C recently went to a party, forced to go by PMP. At the party, they started to panic. I told them what I normally do when I panic, happens a lot, and I know M/C likes to rant a lot. So we are ranting about these bullies of ours, and talking about pride, often giving words of encouragement. PMP didn’t like that M/C was on their phone so much. M/C started to panic more, but after the thing was ‘resolved’ were allowed to keep their phone. 
PMP took M/C’s phone and read our texts, the Pride talk, the encouragement and the rants. I feel so damn bad because of it and I can’t do anything to stop it, shaking as I type this out. They’re mad at me for ranting about them, and I feel as if I screwed my one chance of being accepted by them. Tried to apologise, they left it on read, and I feel awful. Can’t sleep.
TL;DR: My friend was forced to go to our bullies party. Friend panicked, and we ranted about them for a while, and also talked about pride. Bullies stole friend’s phone and read the texts. 
Help?
AITA?

Edit- Thanks for feedback. I went back and read the texts, and found minor ranting, nothing personal, despite being told everything was incredibly personal. It was more me asking friend to go calm down somewhere, and suggesting things they could do to help themselves, minor things like ‘Damn, wish they would accept ya’. Not trying to make myself seem less awful, I know what I did was wrong, and I know that I was an idiot, impulse decision, but I found almost no ranting, despite what I remember, told and thought.

bwfx6y	2019-06-03 20:57:31	hyperfrog101	AITA for almost sitting on top of my boyfriends stuff?	"Last night, my boyfriend and I were getting ready to leave my house to go to his. I’m packing up some stuff to bring over and I guess I was taking longer than expected and my boyfriend got impatient so he left and went to wait in his car. He had probably been waiting in his car for about 4 minutes until I was finally ready to go and walked out of my house to get into his car. I had my toiletry bag in one hand and my phone and a water bottle in the other. I started to get into his car but his backpack was on the passenger seat where I was going to sit. I was kind of annoyed because he had already been in the car for 5 minutes which was more than enough time for him to move the backpack and clear off the seat, so I stood outside the car waiting for him to move it. My hands were full so while I could’ve set my stuff down and moved it myself, I kind of expected him to help me out and do it for me. Well, he was on his phone not really paying attention to me which kind of ticked me off so since clearly the backpack on the seat wasn’t a huge priority to him, I started to sit down even though the backpack was covering the seat. This REALLY set my boyfriend off and he quickly yanked the backpack off the seat and started screaming at me about how there are “$1500 worth of stuff in his backpack” and how rude it was for me to just sit on top of it like that. First off, my butt didn’t even touch the backpack, I was in the middle of sitting down but hadn’t even touched the seat yet before he ripped the backpack off the seat, and second off, I’m barely over 100 pounds and definitely wouldn’t have damaged anything inside of his backpack by sitting on it. He was pissed at me for the rest of the night over this, and called me a selfish brat who has no respect for other people’s property, which I thought was pretty excessive. I know it wasn’t cool of me to sit on his stuff like that, but I didn’t even really follow through with it all the way, and I didn’t know the contents of his bag were so expensive. If it really meant that much to him, I kinda would’ve expected him to move it before I got in the car so as to prevent something like that. So, Reddit, AITA?

He is not the only free roam cat in the neighborhood; there are about 5 or 6 other free roam cats. We have had not previous incidences with Larry attacking other cats, but other situations where other cats (or raccoons) have attacked Larry.

Staring a month ago we began receiving a series of letters from a neighbor two houses down. The letter recounts how Larry is “tormenting” “abusing” and “terrorizing”  her two cats. The letter describes how Larry entered her house and attacked her two cats. She recounts in her letter that she was “stalked” by someone of the “human” variety” and Larry stalking her cats brings back her PTSD. The second letter states that Larry is a “terrorist to the neighborhood,” that she is losing sleep over the matter, and that her cats are emotionally damaged because of Larry. Then finally yesterday she leaves a letter saying that she has to stand guard to prevent Larry from harming her cats. She concludes each letter that time we need to rehome Larry. Since the first letter we have kept Larry indoors during the day and let him out at night. We have been as diligent as we can be with two young children in our house.

While I have no doubt that Larry is going over to her house to see the cats, I question all other allegations. I acknowledge that it’s in the realm of possibility that Larry is the instigator, it just seems highly doubtful given his history with us. I also don’t want someone to feel threatened by my cat, but the tone and language used in this lady’s letters makes me question her mental health and ability to be rational about the situation. Larry has been a cat with outside roaming for 8 years if he doesn’t get outside he is a hand full. I am certainly not going to give up my cat.

I can't remember the last time we had a conversation that ended well, and I don't have a relationship with her at all at this point. My parents say that she's upset that we don't have a relationship, but it feels like she doesn't put any effort into building one with me. I used to try and talk to her, but every time I did she would either ignore me or take the opportunity to say hurtful things just start a fight. She would try to bring up arguments that happened years ago or just completely trash me at any opportunity she had. She would make fun of my interests, my friends, or just call me names until I would get upset and leave, at which point she would laugh. She even sometimes brought up worse things that have happened to me in the past just because she knew it would upset me. I eventually stopped trying to speak to her because I didn't feel like there was any point in it. My parents think that I have no right to cut her out of my life since she's my sister, but being around her just results in me feeling awful because of the things she says. My parents also have tried to blame her depression on me because I don't speak her anymore.

"So one of my best friends since high school introduced me to this girl when I moved back home after about 5 years of being away. He introduced her basically as his girlfriend, which I would quickly find out was not a done deal. Though they spent a lot of time together, and even shared a google calendar so they could always see what each other was doing. 

About a month after meeting her she and I had become very good purely platonic friends. I was hanging out with both of them a lot, so I was in ground zero for the fallout when she decided to date one of his good friends rather than him. 

At first I only had his side of the story, that this was out of left field and completely shocking and hurtful. I quickly realized, however, that there was more going on than I knew. She told me she had made it clear to him that they wouldn’t be more than friends and she apologized for leading him on a bit which she had noticed upon retrospect. 

This decision was made back in December, and since then my old friend has been a wreck. He drinks heavily near nightly and even though we hang out as a group he has made it clear to me he doesn’t like to because it hurts too much. At first I was very supportive on both sides, trying to be a bridge to help their friendship survive so we could all keep being friends but as time goes on it feels like he isn’t making the moves to get better, and it feels like he’d rather wallow in self pity than move on. This past weekend he kept trying to hang out with me and my girlfriend which I finally just asked why he needed the company and he said he wanted to occupy his time so he wouldn’t think about things and get sad.  I get that he’s hurting, and I’ve suggested therapy to him numerous times but at this point I’m just so tired of giving myself to him as a support when it feels like he isn’t trying to get better.

bwfpk8	2019-06-03 20:39:21	nintendo_d_s	WIBTA for not inviting my father to my hs grad?	"I'm thinking of not inviting my father to my graduation next year and I want to know if I would be TA for doing so. Here's some backstory: 

My father is kind of a bad person. He has always struggled with money and alcohol, and smokes constantly. He has 4 kids and I'm the oldest, and each kid has a different mom. He recently had his fourth kid with a woman he'd impregnated after only dating for 3 months and only wants to focus on that kid. His reason for having my brother was ""I just want a family"" as if he didn't already have 3 other kids he never sees. He could easily visit my sister more as they live in the same city, but he doesnt. And she has special needs so she needs even more attention than a normal 10 year old, and her mother is a drug addict.

I don't want to invite him to my grad because he treated me horribly the last time I spoke to him (a year ago) and won't own up to his mistakes or apologize. He told me to go fuck myself on my sweet 16 just because I was helping with dinner when he texted and I only replied with ""thanks"". I then got a long paragraph later in the evening about how I was being a bad daughter and selfish for not calling him on my birthday.. as if he couldn't call me himself. He also lashed out at me a month or so before that when he told me his gf was pregnant. He had invited me to stay with him for a weekend and I agreed, but then he revealed the gf was pregnant and that made me uncomfortable and I decided not to visit him. He then got angry and told me I was being a disrespectful brat. I kept asking him to respect me and give me time to process the information he'd thrown at me, but he refused. 

My grad is coming up next year and I'm seriously considering not inviting him, but I am conflicted because my relationship with him is hurting my grandmother (his mom) and I know she'd take it poorly if I decided not to invite him.

"My husband and I worked at the same place up until last week when the owners decided to lay him off along with 2 other coworkers. It was done on Wednesday, with 30 minutes left in the day.

From what my husband has told me, they knew they were going to do this for about 2 weeks beforehand; even going so far as to have him stop working on important projects and do something entirely different(in the stupidest way possible). That stupid project wasted his potential and made him depressed the week leading up to his lay off. The tone of voice used when they told him to switch should have been a red flag.

The company is seemingly driving themselves into the ground; owners all going in different directions, laid off the entire quoting department, cut everyone else's hours 20%, etc. I've only been working here for about 4 months. The job I perform is not secure at all, and I fear I'm going to be next very soon.

I have always been the type of person to give 2 weeks notice, but the way they handled this lay off has made me angry. If they had told us early that the changes in employment were being made, my husband could have had a job lined up by now(2 highly valued degrees).

So, I'm a senior in college, and just moved into my 2nd off-campus house of my time here at school. I'm sharing the place with 3 other guys, and brought a lot of the stuff for the common spaces. I was the only one coming from a previous house, rather than a dorm or one of those privately-owned student housing developments, so I am the only one with a living room set, a microwave, coffee machine, etc. I didn't bring everything we'll need, though I did bring most of it. One housemate brought the dining table ($60), and neither of the other two really have anything to bring, nor do we need much more for the common spaces. I'm also setting up both bathrooms with soap, shower stands, floor mats, etc, because I already have all that. 

None of us have a decent TV for the living room, however, and my housemates started talking about getting a $400 TV, and splitting it to where we all chip in $100. I said that I feel I shouldn't be asked to chip in on the TV, because I brought thousands of dollars in other items to share. My housemates said that they disagree, they feel that we should split the TV equally so we can get a very nice one. They also said that since I claimed one of the two available larger bedrooms, they feel that makes up for the difference in contributions. The room I took isn't significantly larger than the other rooms, and is the same size as the other bedroom on the 2nd floor. 

After explaining myself further, they started talking about just skipping the TV altogether. I spoke up again and said that I feel that's even less fair, because now I've given so much to the house and they'll all have given basically nothing. They've all read that message, but nobody replied. That happened 2 days ago, the day our lease started. 

TL;DR: I've committed a fair amount of my resources to a shared house, my roommates want me to contribute more but I feel like I've done enough."	Not enough info	0	0	48.0	21.0	0.0	0.0

bwficx	2019-06-03 20:23:07		AITA for not visiting a grave	"My family are very close and have been since we were young. I was raised with my half siblings, we share a mother but their father passed away several years before I was born/my mother had met my father. I have never seen them as half siblings and we almost never address the fact that we have different father's. Around a week ago my brother decided to organise a trip to visit their fathers grave (the other side of the country). For many of my siblings this would be their first time in over 20 years seeing the grave, an understandably emotional time for them. For this reason I never replied when any of these plans were being made on the group chat.

I've also been in this situation before. I have half siblings from my father's side and was with them when they went to visit the grave of their mother (passed away before I was born). It was one of the most uncomfortable moments of my life as my siblings were all grieving and I felt as if I was intruding and my presence was unnecessary.

Today I got a phone call from my mum double checking I was ready for the upcoming trip. I explained that I wasn't going and hadn't replied to the plans because of how emotional and personal this trip would be. She didn't see it that way and is upset that I'm not going. Me having no personal attachment shouldn't be a reason for me to not go, and I should make the trip (7 hours each way) to support my siblings. Even when I explained what had happened the previous time I had been in this situation (which she wasn't aware of) she told me I was being selfish and should make sacrifices for the family.

 I'm really conflicted as I have no plans that would get in the way of me going, but at the same time I want to respect my mother and siblings privacy and right to grieve. AITA for not going?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

She’s good friends with this other girl now, and i don’t really enjoy being around her too much either. Anyways, me and her brother talk sometimes, just like friendly things 😂 nothing like inappropriate but one day we hung out just the two of us. One thing led to another and we hooked up. I kind of feel bad for this since i’ve known him and his sister since i was very very young, and since me and his sister used to be very close friends. plus I still hang out with her sometimes and go to their house and stuff, but not very often. I hope she doesn’t find out, because i feel like she’ll be really mad. Idk if she really can be though because she’s kinda a hoe.

At a party, after hearing a girls name and major I realized we matched on tinder. I pulled her up and showed her my tinder asking if it was her. She laughed (I later realized it was an uncomfortable, nervous laugh) and was like “omg, weird” or something. Her friend next to her laughed as well. It was then that I realized I’d matched with her as well and I showed her.

Next day after the party I receive a message from both girls separately saying I outted them and their friends didn’t know. One of them was quite rude while the other just explained her feelings.

Now, I didn’t say in front of people “we matched on tinder” I only showed them. I don’t think anyone else would have even paid attention if they hadn’t made a big deal about it. There are also quite a few women that use tinder to find friends in addition to finding men for hookups/relationships. I didn’t think saying we matched inherently broadcasted that they were queer.

AITA?

Edit: I’ve read enough comments to not feel bad despite what I believe will be an asshole verdict. Essentially the thought is “don’t bring up dating profiles it’s awkward” which might be true to awkward people but if you’re willing to put a dating profile online for anyone to see them own up to it.

“But only queer women would’ve seen”
No, tinder is not perfect and often lets people you’re not looking for swipe on you. You can send profiles to people. How many screenshots of dating profiles have you seen online being made fun of? Exactly.

I obviously know not to do this in the future bc a lot of y’all online are insecure apparently, but I will accept my asshole verdict in peace knowing many people also assume you are out if you are on tinder. Thanks guys!"	Asshole	0	0	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

bwfa2w	2019-06-03 20:04:26		AITA for telling my husband I need a break from his kid?	"Throwaway because family has reddit. 

I’m the step mother to a 4 year old, who comes to visit for about a month and a half a year. 
Right now I’m at work while my SD is at her grandparents house and my husband is working. I’m absolutely dreading going over there tonight to spend time with her (she stays there during the weekdays we work).
I told my husband I may not go over tonight, and while he said it’s cool, I still feel like kind of an asshole. 
Here is why there’s such a struggle:

1. I don’t really have that much of a bond with the kid. I have trouble finding interest in other people’s children, no matter whose they are. Yes, I will play with her and have fun but I’m never thinking “oh I can’t wait to see her”. She really likes me and I like her, but that’s as far as it goes, and I’m ok with that. 

2. I’m extremely introverted. And when she’s here to visit, it is a constant back and fourth between grandparents house and ours. ALWAYS around people. The only time I get to recharge my social battery is in the evenings, and truthfully it isn’t enough time. I still wake up resentful of the day to come (full of people, screaming kid, etc). I typically need a full 24 hours to recharge. 

3. My SD is a social energizer bunny who needs constant attention. CONSTANT. Unlike any kid I’ve ever seen.

4. I grew up with lots of step parents and the bonds we had were never enough that I considered them strong parental figures. My step parents were never expected to mother/father me. They would help be a SUPPORT, but never took on the full responsibility of a true parent. And that’s what worked for my family, and that’s how I think of the situation here. I’m here to be a support role, not a mother. 

Most of this is just the introvert thing I think. And my husband understands that, at least as far as he says. I just kind of feel like an asshole by telling him I need a break? I’m not really sure. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I (20F) had a wonderful, healthy relationship with my ex (23M) for over a year. We had plans of moving in together this month, but that all changed the day after our anniversary.

He met a girl from mainland China through a language exchange app. They quickly became friends and I was happy for him considering he did not have any friends—all he had was me, his gf and only friend, and his family (and maybe coworkers).

It went downtown stinkytown when he confessed to me that he wanted to send nudes to her. I was shocked, but we eventually talked it out. He didn’t want to lose the friendship with her, but also didn’t want anything to happen between me and him. *Okay.*

Then later, he confessed he has feelings for her. Then later, we made the ‘discovery ‘ that he might be ‘polyamorous.’
Then later, he told me he’s going to China this month.

This all happened from start of April to end of May. He didn’t give me enough time to process through everything, yet I was willing to work it out and enter an open relationship with him. But it was clear that I was cheated on and emotionally abused throughout the entire ordeal. It’s hard watching your SO fall in love with someone else (who’s not even in the same fucking country).

We broke up last week and wanted to stay friends. But I find it disrespectful that he’s still planning to go to China to pursue a relationship despite all this and all the times he said about wanting me to stay in his life in any way I can, whether as a partner or friend. I told him in order for us to *at least* have an okay relationship as friends, it’s best if he takes care of our relationship.

He got mad that I essentially gave him an ultimatum and yelled at me that he’s still going to China and that I “lost.” 
We haven’t spoken since.

I’ve talked with the girl he plans on visiting before, and she’s genuinely pleasant. She apparently rooted for me the whole time when he would come to her for help [concerning me], and even personally told me that she wants to see us happy “together forever.” But it doesn’t excuse the fact that she knew that he was in a relationship and continued to talk and “subtly” flirt with him. It was also clear she had feelings for him. He straight up told me that they both *love* each other, yet he also still loves me. /:

I’m not angry at her, but I do want her to know that she’s caused quite a lot of pain.
I not only lost my boyfriend, but as well as my best friend. He was my everything.

I (50F) turned 50 back in January. My husband (47M) of 20+ years is only a bit younger, turning 48 in November. At my 50th birthday party and several times since, he's made jokes about how I'm a ""cradle robber"" since he's younger than me. I rolled my eyes at first, but I got fed up and confronted him about it a few weeks ago, saying that it makes no sense and he's trying to paint me in a negative light for no reason other than his own midlife crisis, and there was nothing remotely inappropriate about us getting married at 27 and 25, let alone what that age difference means now. He didn't react very strongly when I brought it up, but a couple days later he said that it's been a problem that's been sitting with him for a while now. We had kids (twins, F) just over a year before we got married, so they are now in their early to mid 20s. He said he's been dwelling on his ""lost youth"" that he's seeing them go through that he never got (though they're still younger than he was when I got pregnant). He said he's upset I confronted him with accusations instead of asking him if anything's wrong, because he says he's been showing other signs of depression that I haven't bothered to notice. He's dropped a couple of hobbies, but they were mostly things he did with the girls so I just grouped that in with other changes as they've grown up. He's sleeping more and has gained minor weight. I said that he's lucky to get more sleep and his weight gain is minimal, so I barely noticed. That seemed to hurt him more. The argument didn't get anywhere from there, but he's been pretty withdrawn since.

I only have 3 semesters left so I’m fairly comfortable on getting around campus or figuring out what building to get to when I need something specific from faculty yada yada. 

Basically. She’s got a mandatory orientation in a few weeks, the same orientation I attended alone my freshman year. They basically receive a speech from the President of the school, team building, lunch, a tour of campus, and a workshop where they help you register for classes.  It’s from 8-2 and our Mom wants me to go with her because I will be on Campus that day for Summer classes, and I honestly don’t see the point in going. It’s a freshman orientation where she’s supposed to get acquainted w the campus and hopefully make a few friends. It just seems pointless for me to go with her because not only have I already gone, but I remember this event helping me realize that I was the only one in charge of my success, and on top of that, if I go with her she probably won’t socialize with people cuz she could just talk to me. 

I want her to know that I’m going to be here to help however she needs in regards to classes, fasfa, loans, anything like that, but there’s certain things that I believe she should experience and work through on her own. 

Our Mother disagrees because she thinks that since I already attend the school, I could help my Sister during the orientation, and I see her point but theres a ton of faculty, student Advisors, and upperclassmen group guides (100 people divided into 10 groups)

You could very easily kill somebody and go to prison. You can use your GPS or skip a song, but it just astounds me how many people you drive by with two hands on their phone looking down.

I dont actively look for people doing this, but if I glance over and the driver next to me is clearly looking at their phone and not paying attention while driving, I sometimes get behind them and honk for maybe 10 seconds to let them know what they are doing, and then drive by them, often swearing and usually with a finger... That probably makes me TA but i just want them to remember... I just feel like so many of these people that do this will go straight back to looking at their phone, so I want to at least let them realize what they are doing.

I only do this when I am driving alone, and realize I could do it to the wrong person. I just choose to do it aggressively because everybody knows it is wrong, and yet they choose to risk their lives and those around them... I wouldn't go out of my way to do this but will do it if they are right next to me and there arent many other cars around... I have probably done this 4 or 5 times ever.

So my boyfriend and I got in an argument and I would like to know your opinion whether IATA or not.

So we stayed for 6 nights in an apartment hotel (not a private holiday home, more like a complex that is professionally run) even with housekeeping on every third day of the stay - there are a few permantent residents there though. We cooked like 2 times and hat a lot of unwashed dishes in the sink of the day we were supposed to check out. My boyfriend kept on saying that we would need to wash the dishes before we checkout and I kind of agreed but didnt really ask what he meant or how he meant it exactly.

So fast forward to checkout day: I started to move the dishes into the dishwasher and he was like ""WTF - its too late for the dishwasher, it would be really rude to just load the diswhasher and start it  and then just leave"". So he wanted to clean all the dishes with a soap (no washing-up liquid was provided) and put it all neatly away.

So at this point in time (we had like 15mins left before checkout) i just couldn't take it anymore and said some along the lines of ""We paid over 100 dollars a night for this apartment, even putting the dishes in the dishwasher is polite but not needed, i am definitely not cleaning this apartment to the extent you are imagining""- and so the fight went on.

In my POV even putting dishes in the dishwasher is something i do out of politeness and not because i think it's what expected and cleaning the whole apartment super neatly is just an exaggeration as cleaning is (IMO) part of what we paid for.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Do you have to clean up an apartment in a holiday condo after checkout or is it pure politeness if you do so?

Let me start this off by saying I've brought this issue up with her several times and I have told her how I feel.

My issue is every time I go visit her, it's always spending time with her friends and I respect that, she works and studies and she needs time with her friends as well... but after that, she doesn't show any appreciation over the fact that I came to visit her. She spends the majority of the time socializing with her friends that she has the ability to see whenever she wants, having the time of her life, while I'm sitting there socializing with some of her other friends. Like... I didn't come to this city for your friends, I came for you...

We were in the car and dropped off one of her friends at the metro instead of at home and she asks me if she should've just dropped him off at home. I told her that she should've just dropped him off at the metro we were at earlier instead of driving around for 40 minutes for nothing. Then she blows up and says ""are you saying I'm an asshole?!"" and that's when I just shut up for the rest of the night and ignored whatever she was saying to me.

bwexst	2019-06-03 19:37:55		AITA for telling my mom no she cannot stay with us?	"Ok Reddit I need your help deciding if I am the asshole here.

TLDR: at the bottom

Last year I graduated from college. My mom and her boyfriend came from out of state and stayed with us. My fiancé and I put them in the master bedroom and slept on the couch in the living room while they were here. Neither I nor my fiancé really minded that much. It was nice to have them stay with us and I felt that everyone was comfortable.

During one of our conversations about my wedding my mom mentioned staying with us again. It caught me off guard. I addressed it right then and there as gently as I could. I explained to my mom it probably wouldn’t work out as well. I didn’t want to sleep on a couch the night before my wedding and I surely did not want visitors in my house on the night of my honeymoon. She completely understood this and even apologized saying she didn’t think it through. 

Skip ahead to today. We are putting in an offer for a bigger house, 4 bedrooms 2 bathrooms. I eagerly call my mom and tell her the news. I’m over the moon excited at the possibility of getting this house. She then casually says “4 bedrooms that’s great, so we can stay with you guys when we come into town for the wedding.”

\*\*insert record scratch noise\*\* I said “you want to stay in my house on my honey moon night?” She responds with “well aren’t you going to be on your honey moon?” I explain to her that no we would not be taking off from the reception straight to the airport to go on our honey moon. More likely we would leave a day or two after the wedding. She pressed on with “well am I supposed to stay in a hotel the whole time I’m there.”

I asked her how long she was going to be in town. I honestly don’t mind them staying with us for a few days but I don’t want anyone staying at the house the night before the wedding or my honey moon night.  She said maybe they would fly in the day before the wedding and lave the day after. I simply told her we would talk about it when it got closer. She said they may even fly out the day of the wedding. To which I said ‘So you don’t want to go to the reception?’ After that she got extremely quiet.

I didn’t mean to hurt my mom’s feelings but I just think this is a little off. I texted her later explaining that I didn’t want visitors on those two nights and other than that we would love to have them , that they are always welcome at our home. She texted back “You are asking for bad luck. Fiancé and you do not need to see each other after midnight (morning of wedding), no looking, seeing etc. It’s a tradition”. I told her we aren’t really traditional and how was not having family over bad luck. She just said “well you should be a little bit.” 

Am I the asshole for saying no to them staying with us for those two nights?

TLDR: My mom wants to stay with us the night before and the night of my wedding. I’m not a fan of this idea and told her so. Now she seems upset."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bwevvd	2019-06-03 19:33:34	eonicorn	WIBTAH if I don't have my older sister or my soon-to-be sister-in-law as my bridesmaids?	"I'm planning a wedding, and it's not for a year or so, but I've been thinking about the bridal party. I'm trying to decide if I want to have my little sister as my maid-of-honor, then two friends, my older sister, and my fiance's older sister as my bridesmaids. Or if I want to have my little sister as my maid-of-hknor, then two female friends, and two male friends as my ""bridesmaids"".

My relationship with my older sister is strained, since she's socially awkward, and I find it hard to talk to her. We used to be close when I was in elementary school, but as we got older, we drifted apart. Right now, I live with my fiance at 25 years old, while she still lives home with my parents at 31 years old. 

My relationship with my fiance's older sister is also strained, we were roommates during college, and she basically bullied me for a year. She said I dressed trashy, couldn't cook, and told me I wouldn't be able to get into a top firm in my field of work (which I later did). It's been several years since then, and she since apologized and is kind to me now, but we tend to avoid each other most of the time. 

Then I have my two male friends who I've known for ten plus years. They are open minded and wouldn't mind being ""bridesmaids"", and they are definitely more close to me than my fiance. However, I'm a pretty traditional person who wants a traditional wedding, and I do think it's a bit weird to have males on as both the groomsmen and ""bridesmaids"". My boyfriend has chosen a few of his groomsmen (all male), and is okay with me having my male friends as bridesmaids, but doesn't want them as his groomsmen since he doesn't feel that close to them. 

My parents are paying for most of the wedding, with my fiance and I paying for a small portion. My parents don't care about anything about the wedding planning. 

However, I don't want to enter my fiances family, who is quite traditional, with bad feelings. A lot of his extended family will be meeting me at this wedding or seeing me for only the second or third time. I don't want them to have a bad impression of me since I don't have one of my own sisters nor my fiance's sister as my bridesmaids...and then replacing them for two males. 

I know it's my wedding, but it's also my fiance's. And it's also a party for two families to join together...so I feel that I should follow tradition. But also, I want my wedding to be the day that I'm surrounded by people I love. 

TL;dr: WIBTAH If I don't have my older sister and fiance's sister in the bridal party and replace them with two of my close male friends instead?




EDIT:
I thought it'd be useful to mention my reply to a comment below. 

My older sister has not been diagnosed, but I think she does have slight autism. And she hates being the center of attention or in front of a lot of people, so not being a bridesmaid wouldn't bother her. 

Meanwhile, my fiance's sister is a bit of a attention seeker, so she'd love to be a bridesmaid, but would understand if she wasn't due to our tense past. 

I figured that if I left out my older sister then it'd make sense if I left out my fiance's older sister. However, having my little sister included but not the other is what makes it asshole-ish. Then including my older sister and not my SIL is asshole-ish. And I know for certain that I want my little sister as my maid of honor. 

I'm mostly worried about what my fiance's family would think, and I know that I'm not supposed to care about judgement...but these are people I will be interacting with for years and decades. And they aren't assholes either for judging...I would be skeptical too if I went to a wedding where siblings were excluded."	Not the A-hole	0	0	143.0	24.0	0.0	0.0
bwevj5	2019-06-03 19:32:52	unofficialShadeDueli	AITA for wanting to know how my ex is doing?	"Three years ago I decided I couldn't go on with my marriage - to cut a long story short, I was in that relationship for nearly 13 years, married for 4 and a half years of it, and my ex basically had one long mental and depressive breakdown for 6 years until then. All in all the relationship had always been one-sided, so after long, careful and often painful considerations, I pulled the plug.

I was very calm and logical about things and, due to his fragility, decided to not pursue my own gains from the marriage in order to not make things more painful and difficult than they already were. I was magnanimous, he wasn't always, but I chalked it up to his depression and his being hurt by me leaving, and I let it go. Despite everything I still cared about him as a person.  Part of my caring was that I repeatedly told him that we could still talk if he wanted to.

During my divorce, I started talking to more people, including the man I am now engaged to. We lived in different countries but there was a definite spark when we talked so we made plans to meet fairly soon. I told my ex I had met someone living at considerable distance, hoping it'd dull the pain somewhat, but he called me a fool and slowly started blocking me on social media. I figured it was his right and moved on.  I met my fiance for the first time once my divorce was final and within months I was planning to move countries to go and live with him, a decision that I have not and will never regret and would make again in a heartbeat.

Fast forward to about a year ago. I figured a year was plenty of time and removed my ex from my blocked list on Facebook.  Then, while I was enjoying a Saturday afternoon playing Warhammer with my fiance when my ex decided to message me, calling me a liar for promising he could always talk to me. I could tell he was having another depressive moment and I felt like I should talk to him, but at the same moment I was acutely aware that he had pushed me away himself and that I had left him for being manipulative. I told my fiance about the message, and he advised me to be kind but to still firmly push back and tell him he needed to move on as I had. I was apprehensive about how well my ex would take that, but he took it surprisingly well and even told me he was doing his best. After that, I didn't get any more messages, which is good. However, I can't help but wonder whether he's okay. Partly because I still care about him as a person I once was close to, and partly because I was very shaken by his message (now nearly a year ago) and I don't want to feel that hurt again. But somehow it feels wrong to care. I absolutely love my fiance and have zero regrets about ending my marriage and starting my new life with the man I hope to grow old with - I don't want anything to cast even a shadow of a doubt on all that I built in the past three years.

**""Sorry girl! I just saw this message and I’m already at the airport. I didn’t have my** *\*COMPANY NAME\**  **email on. I only turned it on to peek and see what’s waiting for when I come back. I would if def gone over. I’ll see you on Tuesday :)""**   
I went to my boss right after and calmly told him exactly what happened. I said I was slightly upset that this company paid for Molly to go to JCK las vegas (something that I already did not think would be cost beneficial to us) and she had actually turned off her work email the whole time. Our boss- he HATES confrontations or any type of drama really.  
 He inherited the business so he is missing some of those ""great leader"" characteristics that people have when they are hired for a job or build the business from the ground up, ya know?  So He listened to what I had to say and gave me political answers that were very vague but generally agreeing with me. I just went an sat back down at my desk silently annoyed because nothing would happen for this.  
my other coworker Sandy said she heard everything I told him and she said to me that it's not my place to rat an other coworker out, no matter what shenanigans they are up to. It's not my job as a CAD designer to worry about someone else. It's the bosses job.  
I do agree she's got a point but How would the boss know unless i told him? Personally i want to say something to Molly herself but now because of Sandy i feel like i have to mind my own business and not continue to be an asshole / rat.   
TLDR: Coworker went to Vegas for a paid business trip and she turned off her work email the whole time- I reported it to our boss and my OTHER coworker is saying I'm a rat now and to drop it."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bwesj4	2019-06-03 19:26:00	rebelwinded	WIBTA if I went to my best friend's ex's wedding?	"Let's call my best friend A and her ex B.

&#x200B;

A and B broke up almost 7 years ago. While A and B were dating, B and I became good friends. We would often hangout all in groups and also one on one. When A and B broke up, I took A's side and stopped talking to B for about 2 years. A and I started to become a bit distant from one another and I was going through some personal hardship so I reached out to B to try and rekindle our friendship and wanted a friend to talk to. We hung out once as a double date, which I didn't run by A beforehand, which was wrong of me. She found out about it secondhand and was really upset with me, which I apologized about. Other than that, B and I hung out one other time that I made A aware of after the fact.

&#x200B;

Last year, the group of us friends basically ironed everything out. Both A and B are in happy long term relationships. We all hung out together and I presumed everything was put in the past and in a much better place than they had been.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend happens to know B through mutual friends and knew her before we met. A week ago we got an invite in the mail to B's wedding. I had previously broached the idea to A that we might get invited. So today I sent them a message to say that we'd been invited and wanted to see how they felt about us going. The response I got was super harsh, saying I had lied to them about hanging out with B previously (the instance mentioned above), and basically said they didn't want to tell me not to go but they're upset and hurt about the idea.

&#x200B;

I genuinely want to go to this wedding, there are a lot of people going who I know and I know it would be fun. Not to mention, one of A and I's mutual friends is actually a bridesmaid in this wedding. So I feel like the treatment of me going is a bit unfair, since A seems fine with this. At the same time, I'm really struggling with the idea of upsetting A and it affecting our friendship.

It was going fine but some weird stuff happened. The first time we hung out Martha slept in a bed in Julia's  basement and the morning after Julia asked us why Martha's bed was wet. We didnt know and assumed maybe she spilled water or something.

Flashforward 2 weeks, and we're at another person's house (let's say Brian). Martha took Brian's bed without asking and the next day after work Brian realized Martha had wet the bed. Martha didnt tell anyone about either of the occasions, so after Julia found out she realized she's just had this piss bed in her basement for 2 weeks (I dont think anyone slept on it during that time though). It soaked through Brian's mattress pad, idk how bad Julia's is. Brian's pretty mad. 

Martha wants to hangout again soon but everyone but Julia is skeptical because A. Martha didnt discretely mention it to the host or lie and say she spilled a drink and help clean up (anything to clean it basically) and B. None of us want to drink with her again and have her sleep over and wet the bed or the couch or something. Would we be the assholes for just not hanging with her?

bwera4	2019-06-03 19:23:12	CrmsnCmt	AITA for not wanting to help at my mom's work?	"Lets just hop into this. Trust me.

My mom works at a doctor's office and has been with the same doctor for about 10 years now. She has worked her way up to the manager position, right under the doctor himself. She is very good at her job and I'm very proud of her. I mean, she's my mom. While she is doing well, the office itself is not. There are many new faces and employees, and people are leaving left and right. Despite this, my mom and the few other employees that have been there for longer than 1+ year are working through it. Right now they are a little short staffed, and they need 2 techs for to see patients and someone to help the front desk. Remember the office is short staffed. It is very important to this whole ordeal.

Now to me. I'm 16y/o and I'm out from school for Summer Break. This is my second to last one as I will be a Junior next year. I also started drivers education, and will be receiving a truck from my grandmother. To pay off insurance and other expenses, I realized I needed a job. A few friends reccomend a small chain. 1950s-Diner style. It's an easy job and I get minimum wage, which feels good for a high school student. Anyways, I work 5pm to 10pm. Because I get home late, my schedule has shifted a little bit.  I wake up at 11, get ready for work at 5, and get home at 10:30. I dont have tons of free time before work because I practice my trumpet for marching band. Because of this, I like to play Battlefield 1 with my friends *after* work, so I stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning. This causes me to be a little tired when I wake up, but it works because of my schedule.

(Almost done)

Today, I had 3 hours of driving with my instructor from Driver's Education. I had to be ready to leave at 9, and my mom woke me up at 7:30 to shower and get ready to go. When I was ready to hang up the phone, she told me she may need me to come in to her work today, and then she will drop me off at my work. I said that would be okay, as long as I got paid. She said that she appreciated it so much and that all I'll have to do is walk patients about 50 feet, and also clean up folders, like remove papers and the staples, and put them into correct disposal bins.When she picked me up, she said that she put me on payroll. I was confused, as this was a onetime thing. She then told me, after we left the house, that I would be doing this on Mondays and Thursdays for 6 weeks, until marching band starts. I was so angry. I told my mom I was tired and that it wasn't fair. She said I needed the money for insurance. I ALREADY HAVE A JOB. When I told her this that I had a job, she got upset with me, saying that she was stressed and I should be grateful for a job that she ""gifted"" me.

Thanks for reading!

At least this was what I wanted to do, but before i could finish my father started talking about wether the the restaurant we wanted to go to the next day was open.

 My Mother told him to let me tall, and he got angry because she cut him of.
Normaly I would have tried to defuse the situation, but I was hyped from the show and snapped at him.
My father got angry and went to go alone, while my mother and I walked together. 

The next day my parents fought again, and my mother asked me if she and my father should split up. This is'nt the first time something like this happened and I have the feeling every time I talke back my parents relationship gets worse. 

Am I the ashole/ an entitled brat for akting angry against my father for talking over me and making the relationship of my parents worse?

So in my friend group(all roughly 17-18), if we’re not hanging out to get food, we’ll usually go chill at someone’s house to talk/watch movies/etc. Normal teenager stuff. The issue comes in the fact that we have two houses we would normally go to, G’s house and A’s house. Now, with A leaving for the entire summer, we only have one option- G’s house. But.. everyone in the friend group agrees that G’s House is disgusting. And I don’t say that lightly. I understand everyone’s house is a little messy, but this is dirty to the point where it’s kind of ridiculous. I’ll bring over some food and before I leave, she’ll tell me it’s fine, I can just leave the trash on the table and she’ll take it out. I’ll come back 2-3 weeks later and it’s sitting in the exact same spot. They have things over all the couches to the point where you can’t even sit if you don’t move some laundry out of the way most times. There are constantly dirty dishes everywhere and I don’t think I’ve ever seen the bottom of her sink. Her dog will chew up kibble and just leave it on the ground, and when I asked G’s mom about it I was told “we just leave it there because he’ll eat it eventually”. We don’t even go into G’s room because you can’t even see the floor anymore- everything on top of it creates a new layer. You get the picture. I’ve known G since we were kids, and it’s always been like this, and when we suggest G might clean, she gets offended, even when they’re phrased as lighthearted jokes. 

I live relatively close to G, but the thing is that I hate having people over. My house is always clean, but it stresses me out to host. Not only that, but I have two younger siblings who go to bed early, and my parents are strict and go to bed early as well. G always offers to host and her parents don’t care, and she doesn’t have any younger siblings who we’d bother. It didn’t even occur to me that I might be TA for not offering to host until recently when a friend made a comment saying anytime we went to G’s, she wished we could go to A’s or mine instead because of the mess.

In that conversation he admitted to me that he literally does not care about this job and it pissed me off because we're always stuck picking up the pieces of the mess he makes, but I played nice in the conversation because I didn't want to start anything.

&#x200B;

So I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 6 months now and we got into a big fight recently that left me questioning if I was the asshole or not.

I work a full-time job making a good amount of money. I never go too overboard on my budget but for the most part been paying majority of our dates and outings. My girlfriend never asks for money or handouts but she does share allot about her financial standing. She currently owes money to ex , allot of college debt, and has items that are in the pawn shop. And she currently works part-time and doesn't want to work full-time because she wants to continue her education , which i'm all for.

She at my place allot to the point she's basically living here. And made comments about us moving in with each other or in the near future getting our own place in the city. So the conversation came up and told her about my concerns about how she's owes money and been borrowing money in order to keep up our lifestyle. And question how will we move forward in our relationship if we can't make the next step and live with each other.

that's where she blew up and called me a judgemental asshole for not trusting her to be able to make rent payments. That I was supposed to be her best friend and be able to share things with me without me throwing it in her face. And that she now feels uncomfortable in our relationship knowing she can't share anything with me anymore.

&#x200B;

So I get her point, but I feel like we should be able to be adults about this and talk about the logistics of our future. So am I the asshole?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Like a lot of girls our age, she'll go to a friends house with a pool or to a party or whatever...and often she'll just strip and change into her bathing suit in front of her friends like they do. Or she'll get done with a run or jog with a group of friends and she'll strip down and change into dry clothing when they get back. 

Now you can call me old-fashion, but personally I'm not a fan of her friends, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, seeing my girlfriend without clothes on. Now if it was just her best friend since elementary school or a sibling or whatnot, I probably wouldn't mind. But I prefer that we keep our bodies and nudity for only each other to see. Going to a party with her and knowing half the people in the room have seen her without clothes on bothers me. 

Plus there is the added fact that today, everyone has their phone with them and can easily take a photo thinking it is silly or funny or whatever and she'll end up on the internet on some porn site.

My mother is very petty and likes to hold grudges against anyone who disagrees with her. I grew up in an environment where she would talk so much shit about my family members that she prevented me from building my own opinion and relationships with my own extended family. 

Anyways, my mom and my aunt haven’t met eye to eye for the longest. For YEARS, my mom has been hassling my aunt to turn over property from our home country over to my mom’s name. My aunt refuses as my grandmother (mamita) gave it to her way before my existence.

After my mamita passed away, my mother made sure that she was the only name under her graveyard records. My mom had control over everything that had to do with my mamita’s burial including whether or not to put a plaque on her grave. My mom decided to not put a plaque on my mamita’s grave until my aunt turned over the property from our homeland.

2 months ago, my mom and I visited my mamita’s grave for her 2 year anniversary. While we were having a moment of silence, my mom shared that she wanted to add me as a beneficiary and give me control over my mamita’s grave if something were to happen to her. The condition, however, was to not put a plaque on my mamita’s grave until my aunt turns over the property.

I was livid. It’s been two years and my mamita has yet to be honored by her own name over some BS between my mom and my aunt. So, I reacted. I told her that under no circumstances would I continue her beef with my aunt because IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME OR MY MAMITA. I told her it was disrespectful to not have a plaque on my mamita’s grave and that it would be the first thing I do when I’m added as a beneficiary. She wasn’t happy to say the least and told me that she has every right to do whatever she wants. I agree. But I’m not gonna live my life doing her bidding.

Fast forward to yesterday: my sister calls and tells me that my mom expressed her distrust in me. Mom wants my sister to be the beneficiary instead and with the same conditions about the property. I was upset, but thankfully my sister and I are on the same page.

I love and miss my mamita so much. She practically raised me and I’m so greatful to have been able to be by her side during her chemo and radiation. It hurts to see her name be dragged over some drama that’s between my mom and my aunt.

bweh6e	2019-06-03 19:00:19	bulbasaurstits	WIBTA for rehoming my dog?	"I have an eight year old dog that I adopted from a family who no longer had time for him. We've had him for a little over a year and have had issues with him from the beginning, but I thought that it was just due to an adjustment period and that things would get better. Basically, he's terrified of everything in my house and voluntarily confines himself to my bedroom and refuses to go to any other part of the house other than to go outside.  


I learned pretty quickly that a lot of the issue is our flooring. He's fine on carpet, but is petrified of the hard floors, which is what most of my home consists of. I've tried everything possible to help this (short of carpeting my entire home), with little results. I keep his nails trimmed as well as the hair around his pads, I added an area rug to our living room, I bought him three different pairs of gripper sock/booties, put runner carpets down (which ended up causing even more problems because he refused to even go outside with them on the floor), and have been doing extensive positive reinforcement training for months now.

&#x200B;

He's also scared of the noises that my cats and kids make. Every time the cats jump down from somewhere or the kids play with something loud-ish, he barks his head off (he really barks his head off at absolutely everything because he can hear it but refuses to leave the room to see what it is). It's pretty obvious that he has anxiety, so I tried calming plug-ins, three different vet-prescribed anxiety medications, and even CBD oil and nothing is working!  


Truthfully, I think it's at the point that I can't help him anymore. We recently went away for the weekend and left him with a family friend, and she said that he was absolutely fine on her hard flooring and didn't really act all that anxious other than barking when he couldn't find someone to be around. I don't want to be that person who gives up their dog, but I really think we're just not the right house for him and I can't afford to keep spending money on fruitless efforts to help him.

I thought that response was ridiculous so I crumpled up the paper and threw it in her direction (but it didn’t hit her).

bwegp9	2019-06-03 18:59:12	tcavery	WIBTA for telling my dad and his partner they can't help me move into uni?	"So for the background, I (19M) am moving into university around 1 hour away from where I live and 3-4 hours from where my dad lives. I currently live with my mam and stepdad (SD) after moving out of my dad's house 2 years ago (following several years of manipulation and emotionally abusive tendencies from him, so while our relationship is okay, being around him can make me uncomfortable, especially in tense situations where he could be unpredictable).

&#x200B;

I'll be moving in mid-September, and my mam and SD will be helping. My dad was invited to join us since I'm his son too and it's a pretty monumental day for me (and my paternal family are only ever proud of me for my academic achievements, so I figured it'd be nice to have him be proud of me for a day). Having my dad, mam and SD around at the same time isn't an issue, as my bio parents get along fine and my dad and SD get along very well too.

&#x200B;

The problem then lies in the fact that my dad wants to bring my stepmum (SM). SM has a long history of being unable to be civil with my mam, starting arguments and, in the years I lived with my dad and SM, trying to prevent me from seeing my mam entirely. I know that if she comes, she'll refuse to speak to my mam and SD, and there might even be conflict. All in all, the day will be incredibly awkward and tense, and I'm not interested in having such an important day ruined by it.

&#x200B;

I understand that my dad is driving several hours to be there for me and probably wants some company, and that my SM is technically my family too (although I barely see her and she's done more harm to me and my relationships than good), but I can't trust SM to be friendly or even civil for the duration of the day and it's more important to me that my mam and SD are there as they've supported me in the last two years and are helping to fund uni as much as they can. SM has ruined several big occasions for my mam by not allowing her to be there (my secondary school prom, for example) and my mam is also not eager for this occasion to be ruined too, especially considering both my dad and SM are the main reasons I didn't speak to my mam for several years because of their lies and actions.

&#x200B;

My dad has made it clear that he's not happy with SM not being there, and he's always had a stick up his ass about me being close to SD but not SM. At this point, I genuinely think it might be best to just tell him he can't come at all and save myself and my mam the hassle and angst. However, I don't want to take the opportunity away from my dad to see his youngest son go to university (it's what I've wanted to do for a long time and hasn't been easy to achieve). I'm worried about what it'll do to our already-fragile relationship if I tell him he can't come, but I also find myself resenting him a lot for the things he's done in the past and continues to do now (like this).

He only found out it existed and was due when he got a letter in the mail saying the payment was almost 3 months late. He called me once he received the letter and told me I had to ""figure out"" how to pay it by calling the loan service and giving them HIS account number. He also expected me to pay the 3 months that were past due. I started paying it but stopped as I had to take care of things I needed to pay for for myself, such as my own loans, rent, and health care. I justified not paying it because he was emotionally and verbally abusive my whole childhood and throughout college. He also lied and said not paying HIS parent plus loan would drop my credit score. He once threatened to ""pull me out of college."" While I now know that is not possible without the student's consent, I did not know at the time because I was young and a freshman and didn't know how that worked. I went into a full blown panic attack and was taken to a psych ward following his threats. I also had pulled all the money from the joint bank account I had with my parents because they were threatening me and I thought they would cut off all of my supply of money as well. All of the money in the account was mine even though it was held jointly. They yelled at me for taking MY money out of the account as well. He also said he never wanted to talk to me again after I moved a few hours away when I graduated college. A few months later, he asked why I never called him. I told him it was because he said he never wanted to talk to me again and didn't reach out to me and that he really hurt me. He told me ""he didn't mean it"" and that was the end of the whole conversation as if I was supposed to just magically forgive him and nothing was wrong.

bwee09	2019-06-03 18:53:03	aitaditchingfriend	WIBTA for abandoning a friend due to all the drama he's brought into my life	"So I have a friend, Rob, who's constantly bringing drama into my life. Every time there's drama in our friend's group it's always between him and this girl Leah, who he's had a crush on for 2-3ish years. Despite having been rejected by her multiple times and her not showing romantic interest in him whatsoever, Rob still has this crush on her and seems to only ""think with his dick"" around her. Multiple times he's admitted to having been biased in her favor during discussions for no reason, and his overall personality changes when he's around her. It's like he becomes her white knight and it bothers me greatly because not only me but everyone else in our friend's group wishes he would just move on with his life and would stop liking her. He and I have spoken about this crush multiple times, and it seems to be the root cause for a lot of his self-esteem issues.  
  
Since Leah is really bad at setting boundaries and can't say no to him, he forces his way into spending time with her by asking her lots of times to the point where she doesn't wanna say no. Every time he spends time with her he comes back feeling like shit and vents to me about his life/problems, as well as tells me things Leah vented to him about her boyfriend. Every time he messages me, he always has the same problems and I always give him the same advice: that he needs to take some time from her so his feelings slowly fade away, and that he can't search for his happiness in her. I also tell him that he needs to set boundaries with her. And everytime I tell him that, he goes and forces his way into spending more time with her and gets even more hurt, creates drama for himself with her or her boyfriend (he's constantly straining their relationship), and ropes me into it (despite me having told him multiple times that I don't wanna be involved in it). It's like he completely ignores my advice and my request to not be involved in drama.  
  
Last week, Rob spent 4 afternoons in a row with her, despite her clearly looking like she didn't want to spend that much time with him. He said/did some things which caused strain on Leah's relationship with her boyfriend, to the point where they both said enough and decided to block him, because they just didn't want that strain on their relationship anymore (they had already warned him multiple times to stop). He's been venting to me about it and lied about a lot of things so as to not make him look like the one who's wrong in the situation. I'm tired of being roped into childish drama, especially drama which could be avoided.  
  
My question is, would I be the asshole for sort of 'abandoning' him and not giving him as much attention as I used to? Like not reacting to drama and just not caring about him as much. People have told me to block him because he fails to respect my wishes to not be brought into drama, however, I'm afraid he'll hurt himself If I do that and I don't want to be responsible for him doing something to himself."

bwedwh	2019-06-03 18:52:49		AITAH for not warning someone my preroll was Cannabis at a music festival?	"This happened a couple of years ago but was discussing it today with someone who couldn’t believe I didn’t warn the person.

Backstory: I use a rolling paper that is printed like a [cigarette](https://www.focus-planet.com/image/cache/catalog/products/fun-papers/urban_papers_focus-planet2-800x800.jpg) to avoid hassle from Festival security. It’s a music festival where Cannabis use is rampant, but I prefer not to be blatant about it and push my luck.  

The scene: 
I’m smoking a joint, there’s a group of people right next to me the whole time I’m smoking it. When I finish up, one of the guys leans over and says “hey, you got another one of those?” and being the generous person I am, smile and say “yeah, you guys can totally have one, happy *insert name of festival*!”.  He lights it and after a couple inhales angrily yells “holy shit is this pot? I hate pot! Fuck!”.  I say yeah, so he gives it to his friend(who presumably did like pot and smoked it with no complaint) and just grumbles to himself and they leave soon after.

Am I an asshole for not telling this guy it was Cannabis? They were literally right next to me so the smell was very much so in their zone, and other than the paper it didn’t look or feel like a cigarette. I also took it out of a film canister for him, and not a cigarette pack. I honesty thought he knew from the way he asked me."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I work for the school usually but I’m in a transition time and I’m not getting paid as much as I usually do. So I’m doing a lot of childcare to try and make up the difference over the summer. My husband makes about the same as what I used to make, though some seasons are better than others so work is very even between the two of us.

I’m always anxious about money. Though realistically we are OK financially (no debt), we don’t have a lot of extra money to spare. Today my husband said he was going to pay another agent to do a showing for him tonight (50$) so he can go play racquetball. His group of friends plays racquetball 2-3x a week (e.g., just played last Saturday), but he doesn’t always get to go because of work or other things he does (e.g., band practice). I told him I didn’t think he should spend 50$ like that when he doesn’t have to. That’s like 4-5 hours of childcare work for me and typically we only budget about 300 for fun/restaurant stuff. So it’s not a small proportion of what we usually spend on “fun stuff.” He said he would take it out of the “business funds”  - but I’m thinking of it as that is still money that would otherwise go towards our family. 

He also said it was for self care and to build a relationship with the other agent. I told him I still didn’t think it was a wise use of money but it’s his business and he can do it, I just don’t like it. He decided to go to play racquetball for a short time and then do the showing.

Some background:

15F

Living with my father

I cut contact with my mom about a month and a half ago, moved away from her a year and a few months ago. I moved away because she and my stepfather are highly narcissistic and incredibly abusive. I was feeling incredibly depressed living with them and I'm glad to be away from them. I won't go into great detail on what they did, but I'll list a few of many things that my birth giver specifically did:

-Abused me in favor of my other three siblings from her. My siblings are 3M, 5F, and 18M. 18M has never lived with us, but is still in contact. She'd let me starve because making me food would wake up the little ones. She'd procrastinate putting money in my lunch account, too. I was 90-100 pounds living there, and now I'm 170 pounds just from being able to get an adequate amount of food. Not only this, but she'd force me to share my food with my little siblings, and they always ended up never even eating it. She'd also compare me to my other siblings and say how lazy I was compared to them, how insubordinate, etc. I told her I was feeling depressed and she brushed it off. I told her 18M was feeling depressed a few months later, and she got super worried and asked a lot of questions and even accused me of treating him badly.

-Constantly berated me. I could never do anything right.

-Manipulated me and lied to people around me such as my teachers to make them hate me. A lot of gaslighting went on.

All this being said, I feel nothing towards her. She's not my mother to me, she's just the woman that pushed me out of her vagina ~15 years ago. Whenever people ask me about my mom for various reasons, I always have to explain that I've cut her out of my life, and they ask why, and it spirals down from there. Some people berate me and call me a dick, because ""she's your mother"". No, she's not. It would save me a lot of stress to just say that she's dead, or that I don't have a mother. I wouldn't do it for attention seeking reasons. She's just no longer in my life and she's dead to me, at least. I don't want to talk about her."	Not enough info	0	0	599.0	80.0	0.0	0.0

bweazw	2019-06-03 18:46:02	saucy_awesome	"AITA for ""abandoning"" someone whose issues are just too much?"	"Been casually hooking up with a guy (We'll call him E) for four years. He's an alcoholic, severely emotionally damaged, very non-communicative, lashes out in anger when he's frustrated, basically all the toxic shit that people tell you to avoid. But he has a good heart that I love, and that's what makes things complicated. 

I have feelings for him in the sense that I see so much potential for the beautiful life he could have if he'd get some help and address his issues. I want him to be well and healthy, and it hurts me knowing that he's hurting. I'd love to be part of the healthy life that I know he *could* have, but as it is currently, his life is a toxic mess. 

That said, I'm not necessarily a prize myself. I had a dear friend stand by and help me wade through a shit-ton of toxic shit that my parents handed down to me, and I wouldn't be who I am without that person. I know how important it is to have someone on your side, someone who at the end of the day loves you when you can't love yourself. 

I want to be strong for E, and be there in the way that my dear friend was there for me, but E just... he pushes all my buttons. He refuses to communicate in socially accepted ways (sometimes he doesn't text me back for days, ignores my calls, gets mad at me for his negative feelings, etc.) and it really plays on my insecurities. Several days ago he reluctantly said he had feelings for me, but then he cut off all contact and has ignored me for almost a week. The other day, he posted vacation pics on Facebook of a trip that he never told me specifics about (when he'd be leaving or returning, etc) and has been otherwise active on Facebook and yet said nothing to me. 

I'm torn. Part of me wants to be like ""Uh, hello... WTF?"" and part of me just wants to let his silence stretch on forever, because actions speak louder than words, as they say. I feel like if he wanted me in any significant way, he'd be texting me back and actually trying to make something work. Buuuut I also know that he's prone to freaking out over emotional issues, and could well be ""testing"" me to see if I ""abandon"" him like he thinks I will. 

I'm not sure if I'd be an asshole for not gently helping him through what I'm sure is a difficult time (he really doesn't do well with emotions, and has major abandonment issues, so him saying he has feelings for me is a pretty big deal and I'm sure he's freaked out) or if I'd be doing the right thing by allowing the natural consequences of his decision not to talk to me to take their course (that being that he damages this irreparably and I don't want to see him anymore.) I'm getting really tired of always questioning everything. 

*TL;DR: Guy I've been casually seeing is a toxic, emotionally-stunted person who has a good heart. I care about him a lot, and I want to see him well and healthy. I don't know if I'd be being an asshole by allowing him to push me away, thus eliminating any potential I would have to be a positive, healing force in his life.*"	Not the A-hole	0	0	884.0	42.0	0.0	0.0

"My next door neighbour Julia is Russian, in her 40s and married with 4 kids to a misogynistic, oppressive man. I imagine her life is lonely and difficult, though I don't believe she's being abused.

On Friday morning, I got a random message off a man named Nick who told me that Julia had messaged him to tell him his girlfriend Lucy, who he had met online 12 months ago, had been murdered in a deliberate hit and run. He was nothing short of devastated. 

After a bit of talking, as well as some texting with Julia, I figured out Julia had been catfishing this guy, more than likely with her niece Lucy's pictures. I didn't want to cause trouble (I would dread to see her husband's reaction) so told him I couldn't give him any answers, apologised and wished him luck. 


Fast forward to today, Nick has tracked down MY best friend, who ""Lucy"" also claimed as her own friend by a different name. He was still holding out hope that Lucy was real and it had all been a mistake, and his distress seemed to be worsening by the day. He had been out of work with shock and sickness at the thought of this girl being dead.

I felt so bad for the guy that I contacted him again to tell him that me and my family feel that someone we know is catfishing him but don't want to put her in an unpleasant situation by outting her. He sent me Lucy's number and sure enough, it was Julia's. 

I told him I knew who it was registered to and her name was not Lucy, and explained that the real person behind Lucy had probably found initial comfort in his friendship and attention and then let it get out of hand, before probably getting scared of being found out and trying to bury it and return to normal life. I explained why I didn't want to tell him who it was and apologised again.

At this point, he said he suspected Julia as she had spoken to his work friend before, and then abruptly went off line.

I never told him outright it was Julia but I laid on some heavy clues about it and feel really guilty about that.

A few years after our marriage, my parents retired and handed the business to me assuming that I will continue to provide for my sister. The earning was then split 50/50 between my sister and me. My wife is upset of this arrangement because my sister doesn’t work at the company. While this is true and I understand her reasoning, my sister is supposed to own half the company if my parents knew there were any conflicts. I’m not sure if my sister somehow got wind of this but shortly after, she discussed with my parents and me that she is finally able to make money doing what she loves (she’s an artist) and that it is unfair for me to do all the work at the company. She proposed a 70/30 split and we all agreed. I thought my wife is happy with this since she stops complaining that I’m spoiling my sister.

Almost a year after, my wife’s sister wanted to buy a house and we agreed to help with the down payment. I told my wife that we could help with a fifth or at most a third but my wife wants to take care of the whole thing. She said that it is nothing compared to what I’ve given my sister over the years. I told her that the situations are completely different and it’s not my money that I’m giving to my sisters, it’s hers. She screamed at me that I do not consider her family as family and took off to her parents. I’m sad, frustrated and alone in my house. I’m not sure what to do. Should I apologize? AITA?"

bwe6h5	2019-06-03 18:35:33	parentdinner73388422	AITA for uninviting friends from my house because of their kid?	"A relatively good friend of mine introduced me to a couple in the past few months that they are close to. The couple has 2 children, then younger of the 2 is 6 years old. I have a 5 year old, and it is always nice to meet other parent friends, as a large number of my close friends are child-free. It's not an issue or anything, it is just nice to meet parents within my social circle, as we're pretty tight and and I enjoy being around other more open minded weirdos that happen to have kids.

&#x200B;

ANYWAY, I have these dinners that I host in my home that are like an open house for a group of my friends. I keep them private, and add people that I feel comfortable opening my home to. I have only twice now taken people off the invite, one person only ever attended once and I am not very close with, and I do not get along with their partner. It didn't cause drama. Another person behaved inappropriately (another story) and I made the decision to leave them off going forward, which I believe to be a mutual decision and for the best.

&#x200B;

For the couple in question, they have been regulars at these events at my house and also my kid's birthday party. Their younger child, the 6 year old mentioned above, has some really bad behavioral issues. They are violent towards other children and adults, for example running into a room where other, younger kids are playing, pushing them down and then running away or purposely slamming a door on one of my friend's hands. They are destructive to things in our house (I have houseplants, and they were tearing leaves off one and scattering them through the house. My partner had to sit by the plant to protect it the rest of the day). When told not to do something, they try harder to do it, or ask why and when explained to, do it anyway. The parents are trying, it's not like they ignore the behavior entirely, but it is hard with a house with adults and kids to pay attention to everything a kid does. But it also seems to cause conflict between the parents, and one of the parents seems to get very angry when this behavior is going on. I had to tell them that the child was pushing a 4 year old down, and I felt weird, like a tattle tale or something. quiet place to go.

&#x200B;

We have kids frequently, but before they started coming, it was never like this. It wasn't calm, but this is beyond stressful. I don't look forward to the dinners anymore, and I try to make excuses to skip them.

&#x200B;

The next event is coming up, and I just left the couple off the invite. I didn't say anything to them because I don't know what to say and I feel like it will just make them feel bad about their kid. I'd hate to have that happen to me if my kid was being a jerk. I want to stick my head in the sand. Am I the asshole?

I am so tired. Of bending backwards and spending so much time and money on them.

I cannot even hug then without getting growled at.

    For the last three years, they've been looking for a bigger house to move into because dad's mom wants to move in as well, but needs her own space/kitchen. Without fail, every time they look at a house, mom will start texting me about how they can't afford anything, and how when dad dies (he's healthy, but severely obese) she's going to be homeless, or if he doesn't die, they won't have a pension and since she's never worked, they'll be living like paupers on the street. 
    In the beginning when she brought it up, I'd always assure her she'd always have a place with me and my fiance, we would take care of both of them if that was the case too. The trouble is, my fiance has the same type of job as my dad (government contractor, so good pay, no security) and she'll start just going to town on the fact that he NEEDS to get a better job, or I need to change careers and get that pension. Honestly talking to her about anything (because everything circles back around to this) is just draining and it freaks me out and I lash out on the fiance (quickly followed by an apology and explanation)
    At this point, I'm over it. If she brings it up in person, I say the same script as always, but if it's over text, I just completely ignore the text and wait till she either changes the subject or a few days pass. Am I the asshole for ignoring her and not just being upfront about how depressed I get after every time I talk to her?

" A little backstory to start off - I rush into dating a girl that I don't know too well and things are going ok, within a year we are engaged, and a week before the wedding things fall apart. She's very attached to her family and they were always telling her she could do better and that I wasnt worthy to my face. She never defended me. Then consistently made decisions alone that would affect both of us without at least letting me know. For example, she agreed to take care of her younger sister from 7am to 7pm everyday of the week after we were married. The biggest problem has always been her parents making our decisions (when I can propose, when and where the wedding is, who's invited and so on). About 2 weeks before the wedding we made some last minute additions to the wedding party. The numbers were uneven so she added someone she's known for awhile but that I was actually better friends with.  So we got into an argument and she said it felt like I was making her choose between me and her parents. That's when I asked what if I was. She said she would pick them. It was at that point I went home, did a lot of thinking, and decided it would be better if we broke up. She didn't want to so it was one sided. This was 2 days before the wedding. 

Now fast forward 7 months and now I'm dating the girl that was the bridesmaid that was added last minute. We had known each other for years, got along extremely well, and it's been the most wonderful relationship. But I have basically been told that I am a piece of shit for dating my exes bridesmaid by many, even tho I knew this person before my ex. Am I the asshole?

EDIT: I included most of the background between my ex and I to show why was breaking up with her, to make it clear I wasn't into someone else and that was the only reason I was dumping her. I would also like to add that when my current girlfriend was asked to be a bridesmaid, it was one of my ex's other friends that suggested it."	Not the A-hole	0	0	54.0	39.0	0.0	0.0

Most everyone flew to our destination, but my gf and I realized we were close enough we could drive over two days both ways (which ended saving us a lot of money and allowed us to do extra exploring). Between the 10 of us, we only needed to then rent one additional car. 

&#x200B;

The group decided we should split costs afterwards, and we're using splitwise. I was told I should add my gas for the weekend, so I added about half a tank worth of cost ($25). However, I noted that the person who rented the car also added the price of the rental and I was due a share. The amount was not huge but it was also a significant amount, and I was somewhat surprised ($40, so between my gf and I we now owe $80). Reddit, AITA for thinking since I saved the group $400 for not having to rent a second car that I shouldn't pay this amount? I'm not asking anyone to pay me for my use of the car and all the driving I did during the weekend, but I think it's kind of weird that I should pay into this vs. all the other thing that I reasonably added to (food, drinks, baseball, etc.).

&#x200B;

(There's also another cost where someone's boyfriend didn't make it, and someone else in the group volunteered all of us to pay for their share of the house we got \[had it been less people we could have gotten something for much cheaper\]—I guess this is less defendable, but I certainly would never ask for my money back if I ended up having to miss a vacation)"	Not the A-hole	0	0	4.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

"My partner recently went out for drinks with their coworkers (probably 8 people in total) and then went back to one of the coworker's houses to ""drink water and sober up"". I was in communication with her that night and could tell from her texts that she was noticeably drunk and asked if she wanted me to pick her up sometime. She said yes and gave me a time. In the intervening time, she started telling me that ""she was probably gonna be fine if she just sobered up for like 15 more min or something"", which was pretty obviously not true/not a good idea. So just as I am leaving to pick her up, she calls me and tells me that she's going to be fine and if not, she can just find a ride. I was frustrated with her bc I did not feel like she was being responsible and I was already on my way, so I told her I was already on my way and I was still coming. 

Apparently this infuriated her and she hung up the phone and became visibly upset at the coworker's house. Her coworkers asked her what was wrong and she exploded that I don't trust her and started telling them that I'm so insecure and who knows what else (she says she can't remember all of it). 

I picked her up that night and she was furious with me and we fought when we got home. I was worried about her safety and didn't feel she was in a right state of mind, but I admit I might have gotten pushy about it eventually. 

The next day, she apologized to me and told me she was way drunker than she thought and thanked me for picking her up. 

I can forgive that, and the fight that we had afterwards. But I am having a hard time forgiving her for saying those things about me in front of her coworkers/friends. I do have certain insecurities (as most people do, I assume) and that's something that I am working on, but I feel betrayed that she would air that in front of her work group. The next time I hung out with them, things felt especially tense and I was uncomfortable being around them. She did see her work group the next day and told them she was drunker than she thought and that it was good that I picked her up, but the things she said about me are still out there.

She has apologized to me and told me she won't do that again, but I'm still pretty bitter about the entire thing and haven't been able to really forgive her. Am I The Asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	5063.0	104.0	0.0	0.0

Ever since we had our first child (8 years ago) we moved to her country. It was a mutual decision. I was raised by shitty parents and I have cut contact with all my family. She is very close with her family so I didn’t want her to be away from them. It makes me happy to see that the kids are growing up surrounded by loving grandparents and extended family, so it worked out perfectly for us. 

The only downside is that my wife brings in more money than me and it honestly doesn’t make me feel good. 

I received a really good job offer that is hard to pass. It pays way more than my current one. Unfortunately it’s in the US and that would mean we’d have to move there. It also requires many business trips. I told my wife I want her to quit working and be a stay at home mom instead. I explained that there is no one around I trust enough that will be able to take care of the kids so she will have to. She’s being stubborn though saying that being a SAHM just isn’t for her and that she loves working. But I know that there is no way she’ll be able to find a good job in America because of her race. 

Her parents have told me that I’m being inconsiderate and that I should even reconsider the move. However, I feel like I’ve sacrificed a lot and now it’s her turn. Does this make me an asshole?

Edit: alright guys, I get it. I’m the asshole. It was wrong of me to say that ME women can’t find a good job in the US, my bad. Updated to say that my wife refuses to move back with me to the US. I have no idea what the plan is now"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My sister has a 4 year old son. I didn't get to spend a lot of time with my nephew, so we don't have much of a relationship. She delayed getting her son into school, and was sending him to a local daycare so she could work. A month ago, there was an abuse issue with a different local daycare, and my sister flipped. She didn't want to send her son to any daycare anymore, because she doesn't trust anybody else with her child.

So, she brings him into our office. Her son is a terror. She uses an iPad to keep him busy, but doesn't make him wear headphones. So, he sits in the office listening to cartoons at top volume, until he gets bored and starts running around, yelling. Whenever I tell my sister that it's distracting, she says he's just playing. He's walked into the conference room during meetings twice now, and my sister has just laughed it off. He'll draw on the whiteboard for a couple of minutes, maybe ask his mom for a snack or something, all while I'm trying to keep our client on track. We often run out of paper for the printer because he uses it to draw. There's crumbs everywhere from him eating, the glass on our copier is covered in streak marks from him, there's always noise going on.

Last Thursday, my nephew came into my office and just started playing with things on my desk, staring at me but not speaking to me. I asked if there was anything I could help him with, and he just kept doing it. I tried to show him how a desk toy I had worked, and he smacked my hand away and kept fiddling with it. I was like, fine, okay, and then, he kept forcing it the wrong way and broke it. But I just said ""uh oh"" and suggested he play with one of his toys. He says no. He picks up a little toy car I have on my desk. Drives it off the desk. Okay, fine. Picks up a stress ball, rolls it off the desk, fine. Grabs the broken desk toy and walks it off the desk, no worries. Takes a picture frame, and I see where it's going, so I take it from him. He starts hysterically crying and screaming. I explain what happened to my sister, she's pissed, tells me I have no right to try and parent her child, I'm bad with kids, I don't know her son. I'm mad, so I say she needs to keep her kid out of the office. I'm tired of dealing with all of this, it's done. He needs to go home or back to daycare. She bursts into tears, tells me it's not fair. And of course, she turns it back on me for being childfree - I don't understand a mother's love, I'm not being fair.

Our parents are pissed. My dad calls me and says he regrets bringing me in, I don't understand the value of family, etc. She hasn't shown up the last 2 days, doesn't answer my texts, calls, emails, so I'm stuck with all her work. My mom told me it's just ""what I deserve"", but I feel like I deserve a quiet workplace, too.

I apologized the next day and let him know I would help pay for any cleaning he decides to have on the door. Now he just so happened to be leaving on a trip the next day, so this is something we'll have to work out more when he gets back, but I figured that would be fine.

While I'm thinking everything will be all good, friends/coworkers who know about the situation say i'd have to pay for the entire detail. Typically its an all-or-nothing thing when it comes to car details. So they asked what id do if he got his whole car done, and I said id pay for a quarter which is the area I puked in. Their argument was that if he has to get a full car detail because of my episode, I should pay for the entire thing. 

If thats the case, WIBTA if I did'nt pay for the whole bill?

Edit: Hearing it from multiple people, you are right. It's my fault so it's on me to pay. That being said I reached ou to him again saying I'd pay for the whole thing and he said he'd only want me to pay half. I'll keep my offer open but I think everything will work out.

For context my neighbor is really rude, and his backyard is a huge mess with lots of garbage in it. His dog is pretty sweet, I have never interacted with her personally but she doesn’t bark often. 

From my bedroom window on the second floor I can look down at their back door where the dog is let in and out. All the time I hear the dog scratching at the door to be let in and this will go on for hours. It’s summer and it’s hot and I feel awful hearing her quietly scratch. 

The other day it was pouring rain and she was scratching to be let in for at least 20 minutes, so i opened my window and started whistling to get her attention. she immediately starting looking around and barking and soon the owner came to let her in.

So now when it is raining or she has been out for a long time, I whistle to make her bark so he lets her in sooner.

We both finished up our 2nd year of college, her having graduated from community college so she invited a few of her close friends after coming back home from being upstate. I went to the party, lot of fun, and I’ve been talking (mostly through text if that matters) to her a lot now since she’s been back.

I don’t have a ton of people outside of close family to vent about my mental health and such, so after she had been back and talking to me for a week I asked her if I could vent a little bit and she said no problem. I talked about recently losing my job, struggles with college and motivation/uncertainty etc and little bit into talking she straight up tells me the discussion is making her uncomfortable and she doesn’t want to talk about it anymore. I said that’s fine but why she said no problem then, and she said she was lying to make me feel better and can’t really relate to what I’m going through. I was a little upset but didn’t really feel it was worth it to say anything.
 
Not really sure whether or not I have a right to be upset or just feel like a dickhead and I was just being presumptuous. I think she should’ve just told me right away she was uncomfortable with talking about it and it hurts more because being able to come out about what I’m going through is very personal to me, but maybe I shouldn’t have bothered to begin with.

One of my friends, Kathy, is Irish and had been dating another kiwi named John. John claimed to be a member of the New Zealand Royal navy. I knew he was a phony from the beginning, since i am a member myself i noticed him wearing the uniform incorrectly on social media and when i met him at a party he told me stuff that didn't make sense such as serving in units that would've been impossible with his occupation and time he claimed to have enlisted etc. I have told Kathy and her friends my concerns but they never believed me because he had photos of him with groups of other navy guys on ships. Im guessing either photoshop or maybe he had a bunch of other phonies dress up on a ship or something idk. 

I was able to get someone i knew in the service to search up his name and i found that he actually enlisted but was dishonorably discharged within a week of entering for bad conduct. Obviously this means he is not a lieutenant and should not have any uniforms. I get this information within a few weeks before his wedding. There's several legal ways to do this but i don't want to get into it for confidentiality.

  Kathy's brother emailed around 1600 making announcements for the wedding. This allowed me to get everyone's emails. I sent an email explaining all the discrepancies of his uniforms, stories he told, and finally proof submitting his discharge papers. Kathy decided to cancel the wedding and there was massive flame war that occurred, via email. I didn't even know that was possible but it happened. People went on saying how was a scumbag that should've minded my own business. Other people have told me that i should've told Kathy this privately but i feel everyone should've known that this man was a lying piece of shit. Kathy was initially angry but has now thanked me. I have gotten angry hate mail from John's family but I've ignored it

TLDR; Designer opens my messages but replies very sporadically, even though they’re posting on other social media sites trying to get clients. AITA for telling them I’ve found someone else

I needed to commission a designer to sketch a plan for me so I could have someone make it. Pretty basic, I’ve done it before and it doesn’t take very long for the sketch. Essentially, we’d meet in person we’d go over specifics, the designer would then go about and do his thing. All in all about 2 weeks. I wanted the sketch done for the end of the month. 

Someone I went to school with in starting fresh and an independent contractor/ designer and always is posting about her work and how she’s trying hard to build up a client base. She’s always posting pictures of her work on social media for promotion. She’s built up a good base of followers and he designs are awesome!! I figured I’d like to go with someone I know, and if it works out I’d likely be a returning client. Win-win 

I reached out to her asking if this is something she could do. I let her know my timeframe and was okay with being a bit more flexible as I had reached out just now and Is Ashe sure how long it would take her/ if she had others before me. She read the message and never responded. I could see she was active on social media and was making posts of her in the studio “playing around”.

I was a bit annoyed she didn’t respond so I started reaching out to others. I found someone else I liked. The new woman had openings to meet with me in person and discuss specifics this week. Awesome. We put something on the books. 

The original designer reached out hours later letting me know it’s something she could do. I asked for availability and she responded and asked for a bit more detail. I assumed maybe she wanted to know how long it would take before giving me an answer. I sent her more details opened it, never responded. She kept posting self promotion posts and other social media posts. Over 24hr pass, no reply. I sent her another message this AM asking for what would work for her, opened and didn’t reply. 

My original plan was to meet with both and see who would work best for me. Now, I’m just annoyed at being ignored and want to not worry about meeting both and go with the designer that can see me this week. But I’m unsure if I’m just rushing things and should give this original designer more time.

bwdh84	2019-06-03 17:37:51		WIBTA if I cut off a friend forever?	"So some background for this. I'm in grade 12 and I have severe anxiety and some other issues from experiences in my past. This has caused me some issues in my education as I miss a lot of school.

Anyway to the issue at hand. I made a friend in one of my classes years ago. We would work together in groups, talk at school, and text when at home pretty often.

I eventually had an issue with her. We were working on a project and had to pick a political issue to address. I suggested that I would like to do same-sex marriage and she very clearly did not want to do that at all. I distanced myself a after that.

Eventually my anxiety issues started to get very severe and I missed the end of that school year pretty much (grade 10). She actually seemed really concerned and constantly messaged me saying she was worried and asking where I was. I tried to avoid it but basically told her I was dealing with some issues and would be back the following year, however issues persisted and I basically missed it all. This year we were in one of the same classes. I actually started talking to her again because it really seemed like she grew, when discussing gay marriage in class she actually supported it. Shortly after, I started to have issues again and stopped coming.

She again started messaging me as we had been talking in class and worked together on some things. I would help with her schoolwork, like spelling and just overall making her written work better and she would give me notes for when I missed days. I would also give her notes when she missed as well. She would also ask me for help with a lot of personal problems where I would calm her down or help her. Anyway now I'm trying to get back to finish the class, obviously not much time left. I messaged her to ask her to send me her notes so I could use them (she previously said she would). Now she has left me on read and has not responded at all.

I believe she's upset because she kept asking when I was coming back and honestly I didn't fucking know. I have panic attacks and other things I can't control so I barely know when, all I can do is try. I kept telling her when I would *try* to come back, but nothing set in stone. This has happened before and I did feel bad because I would say I'm planning to come back certain days, but I would try, fail and then I would end up not. The frustrating part though for me is that it's just as difficult for me, it's not like I want to miss school. I'm angry now though because I have helped her a lot, and it's not like I feel entitled to help in return, but I have done the same for her and she literally told me I could have them. It's lucky I have one good friend I have known forever to help (they have been awesome and incredibly understanding). I'm planning on not talking to her at all now. If she speaks to me it's not like I'll completely ignore her, but I'll be cold and don't plan on talking to her again after this. WIBTA?

&#x200B;

Edit: I think if I had been able to type more I could described the situation better but alas here we are. I've listened to what people have to say and I don't think of explained it well enough. I'm going to cut her off and probably not speak to her. I've helped her a lot and she still hasn't responded to me when she specifically said she would. She's been kinda a shit friend and I don't want to associate what little time left I have with her. If she has an issue with me she can take it up with me, otherwise she can have fun writing her work without my help and see where that gets her.

bwdgvd	2019-06-03 17:36:56	wandering_turnip	AITA for not wanting to accept my coworkers gift?	"Obligatory mobile post warning, TL;DR at the bottom

This happened a few months ago and I still feel a little grimy about it.

So for some background, I'm a college student working as an assistant at a hair salon. Coworker in question is in her early 40s. The job involves me helping with color services including highlights (which use chemical lightners). My dress code is all black, and I wear an apron to avoid getting wet or stained from the front.

So a few months back I was helping her out with highlights and we were working in really close proximity. It was a busy day so she was moving pretty quickly and ended up getting bleach on the side of the shirt I was wearing. The shirt in question was purchased at a concert of one of my favorite bands and I really liked the shirt (other ""less favorite"" shirts were dirty so I was in this one). I quickly went to wash off however much I could, but the damage was done: there's now a dark purplish spot right on the side of my chest.

Obviously my coworker felt really bad about it and offered to buy me a new shirt but I refused because I've had this one for years and it wasn't available on the band's store. Besides it's full of memories and the experience of buying it at their concert is part of why I loved it so much. I fully understand where she's coming from and I appreciate the effort but I told her it's not a replaceable shirt and it's ok, she doesn't need to do anything about it, I'll figure something out.

A few weeks later she texts me that she's ordered a new shirt for me from the same band (I was busy with school so I only came into work several months later). I felt really bad but still didn't want to come in during the semester to get it.

I had considered dying it back but due to the nature of the fabric (it's one of those grey-black, thin cotton shirts that aren't really a solid color), I was too afraid of dealing more damage to it and just chose to let it sit in my drawer. 

I also ultimately ended up taking the shirt when I came back in for work but haven't unpackaged it yet.

TL;DR coworker got bleach on one of my favorite shirts, bought me a new one, I refused to take it.

EDIT: since some of y'all are a lil weak on reading comprehension: I didn't have any other dark shirt to wear so I wore this one. I told my coworker from the start that it was ok to not get me anything and she wasn't obligated to at all. I ended up taking the shirt the next time I was at work, it just happened to be several months later because I was busy w school. I was wearing an apron that should've protected me as I dont usually work from that specific angle (apron has thus far protected me faithfully). As for fixing the spot, due to the nature of the shirt and my lack of knowledge on how to properly do it I can't just redye it to the right color. If it were that easy I wouldn't be on Reddit about it."	Asshole	0	0	100.0	47.0	0.0	0.0

The day of my birthday I was supposed to go to Florida with my friend and her mom. We were going to a small gated community for a week to relax and go swimming.  (i have known her for 4 years now, and both my parents like her)

I brought the trip up to my parents three months ago. They are very protective and don't even let me sleepover at friends houses so I did not think they would say yes. But they did. 

Then last night they called me downstairs and said they changed their mind about the trip. They are too worried about me travelling alone and they do not know my friends mom enough. Their main argument was that in our culture girls don't travel alone, especially this young, and by letting me go they are going against their values. They kept saying they are already stressed out with work and the war happening back in our home country, and me going on this trip adds more stress to them.  I had to call my friend to tell her I was cancelling on her because my parents are not allowing me to go. I felt terrible because we have been talking about this for months.

In the past, the school has taken the 8th graders to theme parks but due to budget cuts they can't do that this year (which is totally understandable). However, the 7th graders are still going to an arcade, trampoline park, and bowling thing hybrid while us 8th graders are going to a lake. The other side of the lake has a carousel and train and even an awesome water park area, but we aren't allowed over there. Another thing that bugs me, is that the reason we don't have enough money to go is because the school spent 2,000 dollars renting a bubble machine for the 6th graders, which was part of our field trip budget. We got a presentation on the trip the other day and I asked some questions like ""why don't we just go to the same place as the 7th graders if we're going on different days?"" to which I got the reply of ""you guys went last year and we didn't want you to do the same thing twice,"" and my other question was about why we didn't go to a theme park (this was before I knew about the budget thing and I was just upset by the answer I got), the answer given to me was ""kids don't like roller coasters as much as they used to,"" which is a stupid answer because I've been to that theme park that they talk about and it's primarily a zoo and has lots of different rides besides roller coasters. (I'm sorry to rant, but I find this all kind of upsetting)
Since my friends and I aren't big on swimming in public, getting a spa day, or doing sports, we decided to blow it off and spend the day at a different little arcade and racetrack thing with our families.

bwdab2	2019-06-03 17:21:21	Munchnator	AITA for buying a motorcycle	"I am 20 years old, and just finished my first year of college. I have some money saved up and a few weeks ago I bought a motorcycle off Craigslist. My dad rode for twenty some years before my mother forced him to stop as their relationship got more serious. She absolutely hates them and has told me on several occasions that I'm not allowed to get one, they're too dangerous, etc.

I've been wanting to get one and learn to ride for a long time now, and my dad is supportive of my ambition. I paid for the bike myself with money that I earned myself, and in footing all additional costs (gas, insurance, gear). But my mother was devastated. She was simultaneously pissed and worried and sad, and the bike has been a source of conflict since then. She claims that I'm being selfish and don't care about her or her feelings, and that I'm acting like an entitled millennial.

My argument thus far has been that I'm old enough to make this decision for myself and take the risks associated if I really want to, which I do. I've acknowledged that her worries are legitimate, but at the end of the day it's still my decision, especially since I'm the one paying for all of it. I bought it knowing how she feels, but I never did so with the intention of hurting her. My dad has been trying to help me out and mediate the arguments, and to try and get her to calm down over it. I know he resents her to an extent for denying him that freedom, and I feel like he's fighting for me to give me a chance to experience it. 

As far as in concerned this is my own decision, and how she feels about it is up to her. It's unfortunate and I don't feel great that she's so upset but this is a freedom that I have every right to and will pursue. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0	1522.0	184.0	0.0	0.0
bwd9zf	2019-06-03 17:20:31	AthenaPantheon	WIBTA if I told my parents I think my brother is autistic?	"A bit of context: my brother is eight years old, almost nine. I am fifteen year old female. My parents are in their mid 40s. I only see my brother on breaks, because I live with my grandmother during the school year. I share a room with my brother when I'm there.

As I said, my brother is eight years old, and I only see him on breaks. Despite his age, he speaks like a toddler. For example, he can't form a full sentence yet. Instead of asking, “How do you spell ‘_____________’?” he says, “How-a spell ‘___________’?”

This is really concerning for me. He was in speech therapy for his first few years of school, but my parents pulled him out of it last year because he wasn't being treated fairly. He has to retake the third grade next year, despite having a 3.8 GPA. He failed the state tests because he just clicked on whatever answer he saw first. 

Now, that isn't the only think he does. He constantly makes noise, no matter how nicely or meanly you ask him. He is constantly moving and being distracted. If you take away something he wants, he screeches like a banshee. 

Another thing that worries me is that my parents seemingly don't look after him. When I'm home for breaks, my step-dad (his father) expects that I take care of him. My SD wakes up around lunch time, maybe later. My mom works until 6 almost every night besides Sunday and Monday. 

I am responsible for watching after him, getting him food, and basically keeping him out of trouble. This causes me severe stress and made me have a mental breakdown last summer. They know nothing about this, and I am too scared to tell them in fear they'll either say I'm faking or send me to a mental hospital. 

I still look after him, whatever toll it takes on me. I love my brother more than anything in the world, but sometimes I resent him. I feel horrible. 

Today, I made him lunch, even though my mom was home. I was already making myself some, so I thought I might as well get him food too. I made him the exact same thing I did a few days ago. He threw a fit. He started screaming, saying how he wanted what I had. Instead of scolding him, my mom said I should share my food. 

Then, my mom and SD left the house to go run some errands, and yet again, I was left with babysitting duty. My brother ended up tripping and spilling his lunch all over, and skinned his knee. I cleaned the mess up and gave him an icepack and a painkiller, because he wouldn't stop screaming. 

I try to clean his knee, but he screams and runs off. I have to coax him off his bunk bed (I can't fit up there) and give him a bandaid. It took ten minutes for that entire ordeal to happen.

Right now I've got him playing video games. Parents are still gone. I have this itching feeling that something is wrong with my brother. I've tried telling them before but they brushed it off. They think essential oils and Taekwondo will fix his anger issues and everything else I mentioned.

bwd8i8	2019-06-03 17:16:53	gorementor	WIBTA If I accused my (12) sister of stealing money?	"So I have $190 out of $195 missing from my desk. Which I recall seeing this last Saturday morning in the drawer I had put it in. I know this because I had to grab my wallet from that same drawer; I saw the money there that morning. My girlfriend had spent the night and told me that's where the wallet was when she came over last night. (She saw the wallet and the money in there because she grabbed her charger I keep in the drawer for her).

&#x200B;

This $190 is $100 to my mom's savings (which I keep for her in my safe) and $90 for my mom's car insurance. So I'm very confident I never grabbed the money because I would've had to do math early in the morning. I was also running a little late for work. So I'm like 90% sure I did not touch that money.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this Sunday. My mom is telling me she is missing $40 from her purse that she could swear up and down was in there. So we figure she might have dropped it. So I go to grab $40 out of the $190 she previously gave me so she'll have money for the week. It's all gone. Only $5 is left. I feel like if I moved the money I would've move all $195. Immediately I figure I put it in the safe or moved it somewhere. Can't find it anywhere in the house nor my car.

&#x200B;

This brings me to why I believe my sister has something to do with it. She ""found"" an iPhone 7 Plus on Saturday. It was just laying in the grass apparently and unlocked. So she was able to reset it. No Apple ID required. You can definitely tell it's used. It has scuffs and a pop socket mark on the back. It's not that far fetched to believe someone could have lost it and never setup an activation lock. Very slim but possible. But the fact that there is $230 missing and she now has ""found"" an iPhone that could definitely have been purchased at that $230 price point is extremely odd.

&#x200B;

But I told her, ""I find it very weird but I would think you wouldn't lie to me. So I believe you."" So would I be an asshole if I went back on my word.

I have been very cordial about the whole thing. We haven't accused her since there isn't enough evidence to make it clear enough that it is her. I can't imagine her being brave enough to steal from both my mother and myself. But sometimes kids are fucking retards. She would be putting so much at risk if she did do it. Because this won't be a slap on the wrist. She'd be losing her entire summer and any plans/fun she though was going to have. Plus the simple fact that she would betray our trust like that.

&#x200B;

I'd rather have lost the money completely due to my own stupidity than her have stolen it. It hurts just to think about it.

&#x200B;

EDIT: She stole the money. I came home after work today and pressed her. My suspicions were right on the money (pun intended).

The surprising part was where she got it. I assumed from a friend in the complex or school. She bought it from an adult female off of OfferUp. She is beyond in trouble right now. She could have easily been stolen or robbed. It'd practically be without a trace.

My mom lives with me in my apartment. Dad isn't around. We are her sole providers. So it really fucking hurts to know she stole from us given how much we provide for her. The amount of times she lied to us on different occasions is astounding. Well, hopefully we can correct this behavior and she'll never do this again."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1149.0	51.0	0.0	0.0

bwd88z	2019-06-03 17:16:14		AITA for throwing away the smash cake my SIL made for my baby?	"I feel like an asshole right now because my MIL just told me that my SIL is very sad that I threw away the smash cake she made for my daughter’s first birthday party last month. 

A while ago, I asked my husband’s brother’s wife (who loves baking) if she’d want to make the “smash cake” for my little girl’s first birthday party. She happily accepted. I sent her inspo pics and she sent me pictures of her making it and I was so excited. She worked really hard on it and it ended up looking great! I thanked her multiple times and told her how great I thought it looked. 

We took pictures of it and posted them to Facebook. We took pictures of my daughter smashing it and eating it. I thanked her on social media (all pictures were posted the following day - not knowing she left the party upset). 

At the end of the party, while we were cleaning up -and I don’t remember this interaction - apparently she asked me if I wanted her to wrap up the cake for me to take home and I was told that I responded, “no, just throw it away”. When my MIL told me that I said that, I said “I didn’t say that?!” But she insists that I did. 

I agree that I should have just said yes and threw it away once I got home but let me try to justify myself here. 

1.  It is a KNOWN fact that I do not like sweets. I get a stomach ache when I eat sweets. SIL bakes desserts for family events all the time that I don’t eat. No one at my house would have eaten it. 

2.  She knew going into this that she was baking a smash cake - in my mind, smash cakes are for pictures. They’re for babies to smash and for us to laugh then be done. 

3. It was all smashed up. My baby smashed and smooshed it. Why would I want a smashed up cake? 

4. Although I feel like an asshole saying this now (I didn’t, and would never say it to her face), I did take a bite of it at the party and it was SO sweet. Like it tasted like a sweet tart - not even cake. This point is irrelevant anyway since I wouldn’t have eaten it no matter what it tasted like. 

Anyway, I feel really bad that she was upset but I also feel like she shouldn’t be upset 🤷‍♀️ 

I’m willing to learn from this if I truly am the asshole - I did learn that I should have accepted it and threw it away once I got home but I thought nothing of it at the time (to the point that I don’t even remember the interaction)."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I am currently in Physics and already know most of the stuff since I self studied the AP test. We have many labs and it is nearly the end of the year. I got a letter that I  might have to go to summer school. This means I could lose my place in a 7 year med program that is already competitive and the 22K in scholarships. If I report them, and I do have proof, they will get zeros. IDK what to do. I tried to confront them but they said that they have busy schedules but I do to. One of them called me insensitive and I responded that you are going to a state school as an undeclared and it won't hurt you. The other is neutral and doesn't care.

Tl/dr below

I was really into one of my friends in college, but there was a nasty rumor going around about him so I kept a reasonable distance. There were several parties where we were all over each other, so a girl who liked him asked me if we were dating. I said “no,” but mentioned I was interested in him. After I left with him, changed my mind, and came back to the party, this girl goes home with him. My drunk brain was very jealous and decided to spread said nasty rumor to her close friends who were also at the party. I felt really awful about it afterward and went above and beyond to correct myself on the rumor and apologize to all of them. Afterward, I was involved with him on and off for a few years. 

Since this incident I have blocked every girl he dates on all social media for their own protection. I am worried that if one day I am drunk or upset I will try to sabotage a relationship that he actually cares about and I will lose his friendship. I am now in a happy relationship and I think he is too (not certain because I blocked the last girl he was dating.) I am also one of the only people who posts photos with my friend, so I am worried that his latest gf will look back and realize that I blocked her. This is also something I have not told my bf because I do not see how this concerns him. AITA for blocking my friend’s gfs?

bwd3n1	2019-06-03 17:05:49		AITA Grandma selling beachhouse instead of keeping it in the family	"My grandparents bought a small cottage by the beach in Long Island NY about 20 years ago. I spent many summers there ever since I was a little boy. My grandpa was the person I was closest to in the family and had a huge impact on my life. When he died in 2016, out of respect to his memory I devoted a lot of time and energy to helping my grandma whenever she needed. I also spoke to her many times about my wish to keep the beach house in the family no matter what. 

About a week ago my parents informed me that my grandmother plans to sell the house. I immediately protested, offered to buy it and hoped to engage in a discussion. I was then sent a lengthy email by my father outlining the reasons why it is a bad idea and basically telling me I don't have their support.

Nobody else in the family cares about the house except me (I am extremely sentimental and this is the last home from my childhood still in the family). The house is not worth a ridiculous amount (less than $200k) and noone in the family including my grandma is hurting for money if you catch my drift.

I feel their outright refusal and unwillingness to even engage in a dialogue about this is very disrespectful and demonstrates a complete lack of appreciation for my feelings. I know I am not entitled to demand it be given to me, which is why I would never do that and instead offered to buy it if thats what it came to. This feels like one of the most hurtful things anyone has ever done to me, I have been in a depression since I received the news, and I don’t think my relationship with my parents/grandma will ever be the same.

He's a dog person, I'm a no pet person honestly. I've had a bird before but I'm not so fussy for pets in general. I made it clear to my boyfriend it's his responsibility to walk, groom, etc the dog. I warned that if his dog is out of control, it has to go, because we have a shared apartment so we both make these types of decisions.

To put it short, he hasn't taken care of the dog. It still pees in the apartment and leaves piles everywhere for me to find. It's disgusting. We had a talk about this three nights ago about the dog and he said he's trying but he said that since he works all the time and I'm home all the time, I should ""at least put an effort in"". I have no idea how to train a dog and I didn't even want the dog to begin with. I keep it in its cage and refill its dishes but it tends to escape. My boyfriend won't get a cage with smaller grills.

I told him I wanted to have kids eventually and this dog is putting a damper on that plan. If he can't take care of a dog, how could he take care of a baby? I told him the dog goes if things don't change, and three days later nothing has changed.

I think I have the right to rehome the dog to someone who'll actually take care of her. He said he would leave me but I doubt it. He's not a fit pet owner, he doesn't deserve a dog, and I don't want a dog.

I have a sibling that also lives in the same house at the time. We are a few years apart. Over the years, I began to notice that things weren't necessarily being allocated between the two of us in an equal way. Not just the typical ""they're older so they get X"" type of things, but as I got older I didn't get to have or do the same things the sibling was able to have/do. The cause was not financial strain, finances in my family have actually increased steadily over the years. The cause was not merit based in any way, shape, or form. My question is this, am I an asshole to expect fairness in this way? I have been told that expecting anything in the monetary realm from parents is asshole behavior because everything beyond the bare necessities is a gift (which it is), but I only ask because wouldn't it be  at least somewhat normal to expect monetary gifts and stuff to be relatively equal among siblings? Is it wrong to think that way? And if there are understandable reasons a parent would do this that I just may not be thinking about, let me know.

My nephew (call him John) is 22. He's had a shitty life due to an abusive dad. Drug and alcohol issues started when he was barely a teen, lots of anger issues, run ins with the law including an assault arrest and a couple of DUI's in his late teens. That said, he's been trying to get his act together. He's been clean and sober for the past year while going to a local community college and working part time.

His mom (my wife's sister) remarried a really wonderful guy who's been helping John get his act together. They have a six year old son (call him David) who is really close with John, his half brother. I have a daughter who is also six and she is really close to David. They're basically growing up together since we live close by, they go to the same school and so on.

**Current Situation:**

I'm out this week, traveling for work, and John's mom wants to take my wife (her sister) out for a girl's evening. She is suggesting that John watch his brother and my daughter for the evening. To be clear, John already baby sits his half brother on occasion and they have a really good relationship.

**My problem:**

On the one hand I really want to say yes. John is a good kid and I think he's genuinely trying to turn his life around. I've been encouraging and helping him along and I want to see him succeed. On the other hand, I am very aware of the stats around how kids get injured or die and John is literally a walking stereotype of the kind of family member not to let your kids stay home alone with. Anger management issues, substance abuse issues, criminal record, it's so bad it's a cliche.

If I say no I am very clearly saying I don't trust John to do this, which I think will hurt him, but the fact is that I don't trust John to do this. I'd lend him money, I'd loan him my car, I'd let him house sit my home no problem, but this is my 6 year old daughter we're talking about here.

To make it worse, my wife (who has been super understanding about this) asked me ""ok, but if not now then when will you trust him?"" and I didn't have an answer to that.

bwd1ca	2019-06-03 17:00:34	celtic_germanic_slav	AITA for not giving an old friend a second chance?	"Yesterday, my family threw a big party to celebrate my sister's graduation from high school. However, I got meddled in some drama. Below is my story.

&#x200B;

From sophomore through the first half of my senior year in high school (ages 15-18), I was very close friends with a girl, let's call her Ruth. We were almost inseparable. We shared many interests, took classes together in school, and planned on studying the same major in college. I trusted Ruth enough to confide in her about the traumatic experiences from my past. She was one of my best friends.

Our friendship came to a screeching halt in the second half of our senior year of high school (\~18 years old). Ruth started talking to some other girls in marching band, which didn't bother me. These girls, however, were jealous of the leadership role I was given. Ruth suddenly cut off all contact with me, blocking me on all social media and refusing to speak to me in person. They started spreading rumors about me and called me a plethora of insults, from ""bitch,"" to ""liar,"" to ""asshole."" She even accused me of manipulating and hurting my boyfriend at the time. I was heartbroken and devastated.

Even worse, she got most of my other close friends at school to stop talking to me as well. She manipulated them into turning against me. It was so disheartening to find out that they believed the rumors she spread. Luckily, I have since received professional help from counselors and therapists since then, and I've made new friends who I know I can trust. Nonetheless I still remember how badly Ruth hurt me, and it's still painful to think about at times.

&#x200B;

Fast forward about 3 years to yesterday.

&#x200B;

Now, even after everything that happened in high school, my mother remained friends with Ruth's mom. I never held anything against Ruth's parents since I knew they didn't play a role in their daughter's behavior. So I didn't mind when my mom invited Ruth's mom to my sister's graduation party, but neither of us expected Ruth herself to show up.

Later during the party, she pulled me aside and asked to talk to me. Even though I wanted to run away and avoid her, I knew the mature thing to do was have a conversation with her, so I agreed. Our little chat lasted about a minute. She briefly apologized for her actions 3 years ago and said that she wanted to be my friend again. But by that point, I had already made up my mind. She betrayed me once, and I wasn't going to let her hurt me again.

My response was something along the lines of: ""I appreciate your apology, and I think it's very mature of you to talk with me. But you hurt me badly and broke my trust. I forgive you, but I'm not going to forget what you did. I won't be your friend again.""

Ruth took it well and walked away. Afterwards, I told my mom and a few of my friends what had happened. They all respected my choice, but they also think that I should have given Ruth a second chance. Reddit, am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	35.0	17.0	0.0	0.0

So I(18 )just got my Abitur which is basically like a high school diploma. Because of that my mother gave me some money to go eat at a restaurant with my boyfriend so we could celebrate it together. I choose a rather fancy greek restaurant which normally is above my money budge but thanks to my mom I could afford it. I was looking forward to it for two weeks because their food is fucking delicious. The evening was great and I took some leftovers back home and told my parents they can happily taste a little bit of it. The next day I saw my leftovers no longer being in the fridge so I wrote in our family group chat (I try to translate word for word):

Me: Where is the food from (name of greek restaurant)

Dad: Your mother gave it to me as meal...soory (my mother always makes him lunch  for when he is working)

Me: Did you already eat it? I think this is a missunderstanding because with tasting I didnt mean having the whole :/

Dad: Should I bring it back?

Me: That would be nice because it is from that fancy restaurant which is actually above my money limit but because of my abitur (high school diploma) I decided to buy there. Is it possible for you to eat in the canteen of your working place?

Dad: Yes, I can eat in the canteen.

Me: It was really looking forward to the food. It would be really nice if you could eat there.

Dad: ok

Me: thank you

"My daughter passed away 6 years ago fighting a rare genetic condition. The condition was also responsible for my late wife's death when my daughter was only an infant. I don't want to discuss anything related to that now. Let me talk about the issue at hand. 

I'm now married to my amazing wife. I have a stepdaughter who will be starting high school shortly. I made a lot of investments for my late daughter. I thought I could give her a head start in life. But that never happened. So I decided to donate the money to a charity ( which helps kids with  genetic disorders ). The investments I made mature in an year and I plan on donating all of it. 

Now my wife wants me to use the money for my stepdaughter. She tells me that this will help her have a head start in life and that would partially fulfill the purpose of the investments. She thinks this will also help us finance her college education. She doesn't want her getting bogged down by loans, which is a sound argument. I love my stepdaughter, but I don't think I'm ready to do this. I want to donate the money. WIBTA here?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bwd073	2019-06-03 16:57:53	JoeRoganFan55	WIBTA for calling out my friend for not hanging out?	"Hey all,

A little background for you all: my friend and I have been friends for nearly 7 years. He joined the military and we talked nearly every week for an hour on the phone. He came to me with a lot of his personal problems. I didn’t mind helping but I have many of my own problems as well that I felt he never really asked about. Most conversations revolve around him and what he’s doing. Anyway, last year, he got married and he asked me to be his best man. He ended up pushing up the wedding and didn’t tell me and told me a week after that he got married. They rushed the marriage and got divorced this past April.

So now, he’s going through that, still dealing with family issues and he’s taken to the bottle to deal with this stuff. My friend and I have tried reaching out to him while he goes out with other friends and drinks. He’s blown me off a couple times and he hasn’t hung out with me in nearly 3 weeks now. I want to help him but he’s making it extremely hard to make plans with and he’s been going out with the other “friends” who drink with him. 

I feel kinda left out to dry. I always felt that he talked to me about his problems and needed to talk to me whenever something went wrong. Now that he’s in, he’s been hanging with these guys who barely talked to him while he was in the military and I just feel left out to dry. 
I’m frustrated with it.

We were high school sweethearts, and have been together ever since. Though the relationship with the inlaws was difficult at first, it seems that I was an accepted member of the family.

At the time of our wedding, we both decided that we wanted to have a relatively cheap wedding (budget of 10k) as we didn't really see the value of spending much more on a celebration for us. We purchased our own liquor from a wholesaler, went light on the decorations, limited our invitations, etc. 

The wedding went off without a hitch, and the next day we went through the various card and gifts, wrote down who gave what for thank you notes, and noticed something. We didn't receive anything from my wife parents, not even a card. We also found out that our leftover champagne was taken by my inlaws and given to my brother-in-law. 

I don't want to feel like I'm entitled to a gift, but the lack of even a card on such a memorable day (oldest daughters wedding, first wedding of their 3 kids) made me think that my inlaws don't even value our marriage enough to commemorate it with a card. AITA for expecting a little more from my inlaws?

Edit 1) Thanks for all the responses, definitely some perspectives in there I didn't consider.
For those asking for more information, they had no financial contribution to the wedding. In fact, we were so budget-conscious that we were considering not having a DJ (would just have a music service hooked up to the sound system) but they insisted that we needed one and said they would pay for it. After the wedding, they only provided half of what the DJ cost and that was from her grandmother. 
I want to say that we had roughly $150-200 worth of unopened champagne leftover.


edit 2) Some other information: there was no religious dispute (as far as I know), hopefully the card was not stolen/misplaced (no other issues), we see our in-laws at least once a week, we were even caring for my wife's 90+ years old grandmother with dementia in her home (we moved out because the inlaws were demanding rent on top of our almost 24 hour care)."

These are the friends I'm usually hanging out with on a daily basis, so that's why the chat and its ethics are a big deal. 

In the past, there have been arguments because if I'm ever logged off or asleep and the chat continues discussing things, they expect me to wake up and read every single message after. Every. Single. One. And that's usually around a thousand messages or a little under. It's ridiculous, and while I don't hate these people in any way, I refuse to do that.

We've (sorta) come to an agreement where if there's a conversation they think I do need to see, they'll tell me to read it when I wake up, or at least tell me where to start and stop. And I'll usually read it then. And if something important is asked, they'll ping me or forward the message to me to make sure I see it.

Well recently, while I was asleep I presume, they made plans to meet up with each other and hang out. All without me. Today I logged on to find everyone making sure the date was set, only for me to tell them I couldn't go. I would be on Vacation on the day they had set. They told me they had planned it and that they would be hanging out anyway. And this is a big deal because some of us hardly see each other in person, so the fact that everybody in the chat would at the same place at the same time WITHOUT ME was not something I wanted to just accept. However, they made it out to be my fault for not reading messages and telling them earlier that I couldn't come. 

Then, as I tried getting them to change the date, they were adamant on the date they had already set, not willing in the slightest bit to change it. We argued for a while over it, and eventually we came to a conclusion, but none of it would have happened if it wasn't for their expecting of me to read every conversation I'm not a part of.

bwcvph	2019-06-03 16:47:12	toobroketoplay	AITAH for accusing my leasing office?	"So I’ll make this as short as possible and I apologize in advance for any mistakes or formatting issues as I’m a first time poster. 


About a month ago I went into my leasing office to talk about renewing my lease. There was a new agent working whom I had never met. Among other immediately evident issues (she was dressed like a hooker, had no shoes on, and I had to wait at the front door for 3-4 mins. Knocking before she answered because she was down at the service entrance flirting with a maintenance worker-I didn’t know she was an agent when I saw her down there) she miscalculated my new rent for a new lease by more than $100 and then got an attitude when I asked her how she got her numbers. Now I will say I got an attitude right back, and was pissed at her non professional demeanor. So I said to have the property manager call me and told her “if I’m going to spend 875$ for a one bedroom in this neighborhood I’ve got a list of things that need to be fixed in my apartment” (I’ve been dealing with som issues because rent is cheap and I don’t feel like moving when I expect to be gone in 6months anyway) 

Then 3 days later I come home (to my embarrassingly messy apartment after the last day of school for my seniors (I’m a teacher) and I’m stressed as all hell. I move into my kitchen and realize something is off. I look for anything missing and while tidying up I find a tiny (smaller than a business card) card that says Maintence has been there. I’m pissed. I was once in a an abusive relationship where he entered my home without me knowing and beat the shit out of me. Now I have a gun and will shoot an intruder. They entered my home without telling me. I walked over to the office and told him about how someone could have been killed for not letting me know they were coming. Blah blah blah. And told him about the office working being so unprofessional days before. He apologized and we fixed the issue. 

Fast forward to today. The payment day of my new rent. I check my account and I’m overdrawn 700 dollars. I had been double charged my rent (old rent and new rent) I called the office and left a message (not supper mean but I said “I don’t care if the manager is on break or on a n off day he better call me). Then I called my bank to dispute the charges....come to find out it was a bank error not an error from my leasing office. So I decided I would wait till they open at 10 walk over and apologize to the office. 

Well the office just called and said I could call district office if I had anymore issues and That I couldn’t speak to them like dogs. I was shocked that he was so offended by my message when in my head it reasonable for me to think the issue would stem from a 3 error or the leasing office’s part rather than a first error through the bank. 

Now I feel terrible, so I sent them some flowers but my boyfriend thinks I’m NTA and my actions were justified. 

In the hopes of bettering myself for future situations similar to this..AITAH?

Edit: 

Okay just a few things, as people are not focusing on the actual issues as I know I am 100% justified for my first 2 interactions. 

1) when I went to the office the first time and interacted with the unprofessional woman.I apologize for equating her to a hooker but she was dressed totally unprofessionally for an office setting. Your boobs can not be hanging out and you can’t wear the equivalent of a green suit (skin tight body suits they wear for cgi) to your place of business. Its in appropriate and she was acting inappropriate. 

1.5) now if that had been all I wouldn’t have cared, but when she could have just back tracked, accepted she was wrong and had a civil conversation. I know people make mistakes but I also know basic math and hers was wrong and she was unwilling to admit it. (I know people struggle with that kind of stuff I would not have been bad if she just admitted she made a mistake instead of being rude)  But her unwillingness to admit she was wrong and the attitude she has was obnoxious. My rent is 615, she tried to tell me my new lease for the same apartment would be 815 a month. That’s obviously wrong and she got upset when I asked where I got her numbers from and got a big attitude so I got one too. 

2) She was new to ME. I’ve been living here 3 years and never go to the office. She had started working there last August ( so about 9 months ago) but I’ve never seen her because I don’t interact with them and I am a quiet tenant. So she knew how to do her job just fine.

3) it is illegal in my state to enter a residence without 24 hours VERBAL NOTICE. So they unlawfully entered my home. I didn’t threaten him saying someone could have died, I was stressing that if I had been off and a stranger came in my home while I was napping etc. we could have had a whole different issue on our hands (also I have a signed waiver that says they may not enter if I am not present that I signed with my lease-which wasn’t followed) 

4) I apologized to him today profusely and just still felt bad, I honestly feel justified for jumping to the conclusion based on how the last month has gone, and he even said himself that in the 7 months he’s worked there he’s never met me and now all the sudden there’s a problem.

5) the flowers were just an extra apology. I felt bad and thought they could brighten the office if it had a bad vibe from our interaction. I realize they won’t do much but obviously me “changing my attitude” won’t help until our next interaction which may never come...so yeah I think flowers were nicer than just an apology.

then, he starts telling me he likes to imagine a 3 some with one of my friends happening, and i kinda got hurt by this because i saw it as he wanted to fuck one of my friends, but he wouldn’t say which one. then later he tells me i made him realize he likes girls who look asian (i look asian, but i’m not) and then about a week later, i found out he’s been texting one of my asian friends for about 10 days behind my back.

This morning she sent me a text saying I owed her over a $100 from when she venmoed me while we were hanging out(I was a broke college boy) all of the money she sent me was voluntary and I never asked for any of it(she has rich parents).

bwcmry	2019-06-03 16:26:27		AITA for being pissed that my s/o's mom is making us pay rent?	"So here's a long, and rather complex story. For disclosure, I will *not* say anything to the mom, and the argument was between my s/o and I over whether I'm being too selfish and HE should say something (as I feel like it's not my place).

Brother's college was paid for, he dropped out, got a full time job and now pays half the mortgage because he's 30. He started paying this year. 

Their dad passed away a little over a month ago, and brother has done nothing to help. S/o already pays for her and his gas, the groceries, a couple insurances, all the vet bills, plus his own expenses. 
Brother doesn't. 

I took off two weeks of work to help after, with driving her around and then s/o did also. She refuses to drive and doesn't think she should have to, as the father always did. However, we can't keep taking work off. She started a meltdown, and now we have to pay rent. Our savings has taken a pretty big hit, and I'm a full time student with a job paying roughly ~400 a month, he works but only makes around ~1500 a month. I don't mind paying for these other things (his money is my money and vise versa), except she told us we needed to pay rent. As in, the other half of her mortgage.

This is what pissed me off. She's getting his salary, plus two different pensions, so she can definitely continue paying her bills, as the brother already pays for half on the house and we pay for lots of other aspects. This means that she now will only pay $100 a month, and the two kids will pay $1200 combined. 

S/O is currently job searching in hopes to find a job that can allow us to afford this, and I'm angry. Mom is planning two vacations, totaling $7,000 just in plane tickets. 

I told him that I think we should continue helping her for a few months, until she starts to heal and has a support system AT HOME (since she doesn't work), but move out. I'd rather struggle in a condo by ourselves, that we can own, than struggle living at home. the reason we are is because s/o is trying to buy a car off his mom, and trying to save up to go to uni also. we will now be scraping by, and savings won't be established until I graduate. S/O thinks this is selfish.

I think he's being taken advantage of in a hard situation so she can save to continue vacationing. I get it, we all deal with grief, but her kids shouldn't be paying all her bills. The only thing she's responsible for is electricity, heat, and water. She's well aware of him trying to save, and expects him to pay for all the other things. We just entered our 20s, and she has none of these expectations for the 30 y/o. I think he should talk to her about it, but he thinks that's assholish and selfish. 

tl;dr MIL expects us to pay for rent, despite paying the same amount in other expenses, to the point where we're not job searching in an effort to afford it."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Anyways, as the title says, my coworker’s father recently passed away. This is sad and I do feel very sorry for her. However, today a different coworker was walking around getting people to sign a card for her. When she got to me I signed the card, then she asked me for money. I asked what for, and she said that people were donating money as well. I told her no, I would not be donating any money. She gave me a sour face and moved on. I asked other coworkers and most of them stated they had donated some money. When I said that I didn’t because I felt that no amount of money would bring her father back, they all said I was insensitive and an asshole. I truly feel that asking for money in this situation at all is ridiculous but apparently it’s a trend that goes on in my workplace when someone’s family passes. The thing is, I know this money isn’t going to go to helping for funeral costs or anything like that because she said her father had good life insurance. I don’t see the point in lining her pockets just because she’s sad. Am I the asshole?

Edit: To be clear I never said the phrase “lining her pockets” out loud. If that makes me an asshole separately from what I’m asking about, so be it.

Edit: The money was not for flowers or a gift or anything like that. It was a strictly just giving her cash for her loss.

Edit: Like I mentioned in the post this money isn’t going to help pay for the funeral or any arrangements that needed to be made. The money was going to her specifically.

After she said that I felt kinda weird about the whole situation so I just let out kind of a quiet ""ahh i'm sorry about that"" then went back to stocking. The lady then came up to me and told me it's strange that a man my age would talk to a little girl that I didn't know and that I should really be more aware of what I'm doing. I really didn't know how to respond to that so I just kind of nodded and went back to work.

I have a friend who used to live in my house but moved out about three months ago. We get on really well, are really close and I enjoy his company - apart from one niggly thing... 

At first he was coming over, letting himself in and  acting as though that is normal behaviour. I told him this wasn’t OK and we need to have some boundaries now he’s moved out. He now kinda ‘lets me know’ by saying he’s coming over now or later but he doesn’t ASK me if it’s okay. It makes me feel like I can’t have any privacy and I can’t say no. I have a couple of times brought this up and said that I have a life too and I can’t just be worried about doing my own thing and working around his schedule in case he wants to pop over. He just laughs at this and says I’m over-reacting and need to chill out.

Anyway, yesterday he kinda said that he was thinking about coming over today and did actually ask if it’s okay. And I said yeah but I’m not sure when because I’m at work all day and have a few things to do when I get home so I’ll let him know. I was cooking dinner for myself when he announced via text that he was on his way. This made me annoyed as he hadn’t checked if it was a good time for me and I said that he needs to ask me properly if he wants to come over because it’s starting to feel a bit like he’s disrespecting my own personal space. He then said ‘well I’m not coming then if you’re gonna be like that’ and hasn’t text me back since. 

I’m now wondering if maybe I am overreacting and maybe I am being an asshole by insisting that he asks me properly and saying that if he doesn’t then I don’t want to see him at my house again. Maybe I don’t really have that right to tell him not to come if this used to be his house too?

"Earlier this morning I tried to get into my parents’ laundry room while my step-father was also doing some stuff in there to change out their cats’ litter. It’s a tiny space, so I had to wriggle past him a bit to get past. Then out of nowhere, he starts freaking out and acting all salty about how I didn’t say excuse me. I didn’t really think I had to since we’re basically family and it’s not like I shoved him out of the way. I don’t say it to any other family members either and they don’t seem to mind. I also thought excuse me was just so formal, that you’d only use it with strangers and people you didn’t know well. He just freaked out so much over it and started calling me a “rude-ass”. AITA?

EDIT: Wow!! I didn’t realize people did that with their family. I thought it was just a formality thing, especially cuz I don’t really see my other family members doing it. Thanks, though.

My current wife and I have been married for 2 years now. I have a daughter and so does she from a previous marriage. My late wife expired but my current wife's husband is still alive. She lives with us but her dad is always visiting her. My daughter is 14 and stepdaughter is 14 too. 

Every year, when my daughter graduates, I record a small video of her talking about that year. It's a small fun kind of montage. This has been going on since kindergarten. My stepdaughter and I are also close. I don't play dad but we have a healthy relationship. A couple of days ago, my stepdaughter asked my why I never do that for her. I told her that I don't have a problem, but she's aldready 14 and not many years have aldready been lost. So I suggested she ask her dad because it would be meaningful to her if her parents who are still in her life do that for her. I also personally don't want to come off as replacing her dad or something because they still have a great relationship. 

But later, idk what went down between my wife and her but my wife told me that I'm discriminating against my stepdaughter. So I got a bit mad and asked her why she didn't do the same to her daughter. Now apparently I'm selfish asshole. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My wife's ex and she were only married for about a year before he went on a crack binge and robbed three banks.  He's in prison now.

I don't like this picture, never have.  I see this stupid thing every day.  I told her today how about we take it down and she gets super pissed at me and says I'm narrow minded and petty. I just don't like seeing this reminder of some date she and he had every time I go into my bedroom.



EDIT:  I forgot to mention the words on the stairs are something like, ""I will always be with you"".  Also, the location the picture was take was a special place to her and him (they used to go on dates there a lot).  It's not just some random picture of some stairs, that wouldn't bother me...it's the location and what is written on them that makes me not like seeing this thing every time I go into our bedroom.  Also, I have never complained about her taking down pics at the house that I had up (nothing super personal, just random pics or whatever).  Her reaction to this request was strange to me.

bwcixs	2019-06-03 16:17:38	RowBoatCop36	WIBTA for leaving current job for one with higher pay?	"I know the title sounds like a very obvious NTA, but please read the details on this one. This one may be better suited for a career advice subreddit also...

&#x200B;

I worked for a company from February 2016 to August 2018, and left on good terms to work for a friend's company. After about 7 months, that job turned out not to be a good fit. There were some early signs, but I wanted to stick it out to see if it would get better. It didn't really get any better and there were a number of red flags (boss was extremely angry all the time, there were layoff threats, no input or guidance ever from manager/etc.) so I began applying for jobs. I had a few fairly quick interviews, and one job offer that wasn't great (and one pipe dream), but during that time I ended up in touch with someone from the previous company I worked at, and it sounded like my replacement was not working out well at all. I left on good terms, so I contacted my boss there, and we set up a sort-of interview. Well, it worked out well, and I'm now back working at the previous company.

&#x200B;

Here's where it gets messy. During my interviewing process and before reestablishing myself at my current job again, I had an interview that I thought went very well, but in the end, they contacted me and let me know they went with someone else, and they'll be in touch if anything changes. I figured fine, and sort of wrote it off as over. Well, now that I'm reestablished at the company that re-hired me, I was contacted by the pipe dream company again, and they made me a salary offer that's over 20% higher than my current... No need to interview since I interviewed fairly recently.

&#x200B;

I'm contemplating the offer, but I feel terrible now for asking to come back and work for my current company only to tell them ""hey sorry, got another job..."" I'm trying to analyze this from all angles. My GF and I aren't poor, but we're not far off. We don't have to pinch pennies to make ends meet, but we also don't have additional income to use for fun/vacations/etc. without a lot of planning in advance. This additional income would help out a lot, and also, **we're expecting a child.**

&#x200B;

Part of me wants to just stay put and keep my mouth shut. The other part of me says that loyalty is great and all, but it doesn't pay the bills. I suppose I can be entirely civil about it and approach my boss and let them I know I have an offer paying a lot more, and I don't really want to accept it, but I can't afford not to. My current company is a family company with a very laid back atmosphere. I respect them here and I don't want to take advantage of them.

bwcih0	2019-06-03 16:16:32	maplemuppet	WIBTA for telling my friend who’s in a committed relationship that I have feelings for him	"So I met a few friends about 3 months ago at a party. There were two guys, we’ll call them Brad and Greg. My friend, Amy spent all night chatting with Brad, while Greg and I did the same. Greg mentioned right away that he has a SO which had been a relief to me at the time. Amy and Brad really hit it off and wanted to continue seeing each other after the party. As it turns out Brad and Greg live very close to my house and are roommates with one another. Fast forward a few weeks and the four of us started hanging out often.

Greg’s SO lives about 600 miles away, so he has a lot of free time. Sometimes Greg would invite me for dinner when Brad was out with Amy. Or he’d want to hang out because Brad was working late and he was home alone. Or he needed to get out of the house to give Brad and Amy some alone time. I was equally as encouraging.

It was always a platonic friendship with Greg. There was one time early on that he had kissed me at a bar. He was so drunk that I’m not sure he remembers it and we never talked about it. But the amount of time we were spending together was a bit much. Like 3-4 times per week, sometimes as a group sometimes not. So one day, Amy starts questioning me about my feelings. All the sudden, I started tearing up. I was shocked.

So that’s when I realized I was in love with him. I’ve tried to fight it. More space seemed to help for a while. Until I met Greg’s SO. Greg still showed me so much attention around her. The morning that she returned home, Greg and I went to a concert. We had both been drinking and he grabbed my hand and continued to hold onto it throughout the night.

To add to the confusion, there is a cultural component. He is from India, I’m not. He met his SO through friends (not arranged) and they have been dating about a year and a half. She’s very serious about getting married. The parents are planned to meet each other in the fall. Greg says he’s not ready to get married, but they are basically as good as engaged.

To be clear, I don’t want to get in the middle, my head just won’t STFU. My feelings come in waves ranging from dull to “an entire day wasted because I can stop thinking about him”. I can’t help but think that I am seeing signs that he’s interested. They might all be figments of my imagination. Greg’s friendship is so important to me. I want to do whatever I can to continue being friends. But obviously something needs to change. Perhaps if these signals that he’s interested are real, he will ease up on being so close once he knows that I caught feelings. Even if it is in my head, it would at least explain why I need to pull back from the friendship. Telling him could make things awkward. Perhaps I need to keep quiet and deal with my feelings on my own. I’m talking myself in circles. WIBTA if I let him know that a change is needed because I have feelings for him?"

My girlfriend and I have really great sex, but the only time we ever get intimate with eachother is when we are sure it's going to lead to sex.

However, sometimes I'm just not in the mood for sex but would still like to get off. I have some big issues with my sleep, so I'm chronically tired and I just don't have the energy to go all the way, but I'd still like to finish without having to masturbate.

bwcgak	2019-06-03 16:11:22		WIBTA for refusing to watch my friend's cats?	"A friend (Sue) has asked me to feed her indoor-only pets while she's out of town attending a wedding for former mutual friend (Pam). As I said, I used to be friends with Pam, too, and her fiance Greg, but not well enough to be invited to the wedding.

While I didn't expect to be invited to the wedding, it's not like I want to be reminded that I wasn't invited either. There used to be a bigger group of friends including Pam and Greg, but over time people moved or got married, etc. Maybe I never fully recognized my outsider status, but that doesn't mean that I have no feelings and enjoy feeling excluded. I completely understand and respect Pam and Greg's choice but, even so, I find Sue's request a little bit offensive. 

Sue is more like a close acquaintance than a friend. We don't hang out that much or communicate often. But we do both have indoor pets and we live within walking distance of each other. So sometimes I ask her to watch my pets too, although I often hire a sitter from an agency. I don't think she ever has but I have suggested it more than once. 

The one other thing is that the last time I was asked to pet sit, Sue told me off-handedly, at the last minute, that she'd recently gotten over a bug bed infestation, which wasn't her first that year. She had apparently *very* recently had gotten over it; lots of things still in bags. I protected my feet and spent as little time as possible in her house. I wanted to be understanding, but I wish I had been told about it prior to being asked. Afterwards I kind of told myself that I wouldn't sit for her again. 

In any case, when she asked, I said I didn't have anything planned, which she took as not confirmed. I haven't given a definitive response either way. I feel like if I do it, I will resent it and I don't want that."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Whenever I am with my boyfriend or my friends, if I want to stay in the bedroom, I almost always ask my roommate if he will be there first; when I don't, if he enters the room, me and my hosts immediately go away so that he can have his space (unless he tells me that he will go out shortly). If he is there and one of my friends absolutely needs to enter the room (eg, to go the bathroom), I make sure they take as less time as possible so that he is not bothered.  I do this even when it would be really handy to stay in the bedroom (eg if outside it's raining or if we want to watch a movie).

Lately, it's happened twice that I enter the room, my roommate is with one or more with his friends and I have to go somewhere else to study, since I need silence, and they will stay there for several hours.

I am totally ok with them staying provided that I get to stay when I am with my friends.

If I asked my roommate to decide between:

* Getting to stay with his friends even if I am there provided that I can do the same
* Going away immediately if I enter the room and he his with someone

WIBTA?

EDIT: as someone made me realize in the comments, I did not explain myself fully.

The room is actually not very big and both me and him need silence in order to study.

As to common spaces me and my friends can stay in common spaces - but they are not perfect. We have rooms to study where silence is mandatory; a ""movie room"" with a tv which needs to be booked; and a kitchen whose tables are not sufficient, especially during the evening / night. The rooms to study are perfectly fine for me to go and study if I can't in the bedroom; the problems arise when I am with friends"	Not the A-hole	0	0	18.0	3.0	0.0	0.0
bwcfd7	2019-06-03 16:09:13	mateo360	AITA for wanting to end a few friendships after my experience at a convention this last weekend?	"I use to live in the state where the convention is held. There are a few people who came I knew from middle and high school. I came to this convention by myself. They came with groups. I had made it known I was coming out. I haven’t seen these people in several years (I think the last time might have been the last time as was at the con in 2015). At no point did anyone reach out to me for something as simple as maybe getting lunch or something together. I ran into one of them on Friday and they had to run off to a panel which is fair but I never saw them again after that. One friend I did not see at all. 

The lasts friend I saw Saturday then her group were leaving to go back to their hotel and get lunch. She said she would get in touch later. That never happened. I posted to Facebook about have a bit of a frustrating time for two days of being by myself and having failed to really make any friends like I have at other cons. Said friend from Saturday acknowledged my post and the frustration of making friends as adults.

When I bump into her again on Sunday, all I got was a “Hey, I’m actually going to look for someone right now. Have fun.” At this point I really don’t feel like these people are my friends anymore and if they want nothing to do with me, then I want nothing to do with them.

EDIT for more info: it was not a simple “hey I’m going too” thing. It was talked about for months that I was going and cosplaying and who I wanted to meet. I had tried reaching out but got no responses back. The friend I saw on Saturday gave the impression that would reach out to me later and when I tried I didn’t get anything back."

bwcexo	2019-06-03 16:08:12	sleepypuppythrowaway	AITA for letting someone else deal with the puppy?	"I'm trying to cut this down immensely since apparently there's a character limit on this sub...Bear with me:

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My puppy is usually put to bed by a relative, occasionally my mother. Relative has been sick this weekend, so puppy has been having a couple unusual evenings. For whatever reason puppy does NOT like being crated by me no matter what I do. I'm happy to assist when I can, but it falls on either of them 99% of the time.

Anyway, last night, my mother is staying up especially late, well into the puppy's bed time. I expected her help, but she threw a fit about how she ""doesn't ever"" put the dog to bed, ignoring me saying ""But you have in the past"" repeatedly, and essentially telling me to just deal with whatever happens, and leaving her locked in the kitchen and computer rooms if I go to bed and still can't get her in her crate. I said, ""Fine, but I'm not getting up with her if she whines because I'll have exhausted everything anyway.""

So all through the night, the expected happens. Puppy is extremely confused. Not only why her other family left her, but why she can't even go into the den and sleep on the couch--\*another\* elderly relative sleeps in there due to medical issues on a hospital bed, and family is afraid she would jump on him or whine. I think she'd mostly be fine this late, but regardless, they won't let her in. Several times through the evening I try to coax her into her crate as she's clearly confused. She'd go to the kitchen, look at the crate, look at me. I probably went through half a dozen handfuls of treats without her going anywhere near the door.

(It's probably here I should note this 'puppy' is just past a year old and just over 80lbs. She is not a dog I'm simply picking up and putting in her crate and letting her deal with it.)

In any case, eventually I go to bed around 2am which is normal for me, and the puppy remains in the computer room area. She whines a little, and eventually there's a pounding on my bedroom door, from my mother demanding I go downstairs and deal with her. I tell her exactly what I said here--I went through this many handfuls of treats, she's not allowed in the den, this could have been solved earlier if she'd \*helped me\* put the dog to sleep \~9:45pm anyway, and the only other option at that point if I went down was pulling an all nighter until my mother woke up again around 6.

At some point during the fuss, she stopped responding to me, and I realized she'd simply walked away while ignoring me. This morning, I woke up to a page long screed in my inbox telling me how selfish and awful a person I was, that I'd be the joke deadbeat character in a movie, and ranting about how dare I sleep through the dog and expect them to deal with it all, despite the circumstances leading up to it.

So... Reddit, AitA? Is she right? Should I have just pulled an all nighter or something if the dog wouldn't be satisfied alone?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

I’ve had this friend for about 10 years now (we’ll call her Steph) and we’ve been going through some really rough patches these past two years. As friends, we seem to be growing apart but the love is still there. She doesn’t like the guy i’ve been dating (we’ll call him Ben) and is seeming to punish me for it. Ben and i had fought a lot when we first started to see each other, and i would always go to Steph and vent about what he’d say to me/what i’d say to him, which grew her distaste for him. (Things were rough then, but better now. Ben and i dont fight like that anymore.) 

Anyways, fast forwarding a bit, my birthday was a few months ago, in February. A few friends were planning a surprise party for me, which got ruined (That’s a whole different story. It was a shitshow. A different friend ruined the surprise on purpose because they were annoyed with me because i tried planning my own party, not knowing they were planning a surprise. Really shitty feeling.) So basically, my group of friends gave up on planning the surprise party, which broke out in another shitstorm, because Ben was upset at them for being bad friends, so i eventually planned my own birthday party, which they didn’t even show up to. I even invited them to try to make amends and put the stupid fighting behind us, but none of them came. Not Steph, or any of the friends planning the original party. 
A few days later, after all of the ‘fuck you’s’ and emotional arguments, Steph and the people who were originally planning the surprise/who ditched me at my party, tried to make it up to me by taking me out to dinner. (It wasn’t Steph’s idea, she just agreed with someone else who suggested it.)  Which i appreciated and had fun. But of course, a few months down the line, here we are again, fighting. I’ve been distant from Steph because of the way things have been going, and she’s basically given me an ultimatum, if i don’t show up to her party, she’s not going to be my friend anymore. Which i find extremely hypocritical seeing as she didn’t even come to mine. (I forgot to even point out the fact that she deliberately made it a point to make sure Ben knew that he wasn’t invited, telling me she doesn’t want him there because she doesn’t like him.) All of this stress about if i even want to go or not just pushes me away further and further and i just don’t even want to go/give a fuck anymore. But at the same time, i still love Steph as a person, but as a friend, i don’t know anymore.

"So, three months ago, a friend, who I'll name Joe (not his real name) was caught up in an argument with another guy, who I'll call Jack, in our group of lads.  They had previously not liked one another beforehand, but it really started to escalate at this point in time.

It started when me and our group (except Joe) got invited to a party due to us being friends with the host. Joe found out he wasn't invited and tried to invite himself to the party. At this point, Jack stepped in and started telling him not to turn up because he wasn't invited and because he wasn't very fond of him in the first place. This went back and forth until it suddenly escalated to threats of physical violence, specifically Jack threatening to throw a chair at Joe if he turned up. It then died down after that, until the day after the party.

News comes in from Jack that Joe has called the police on him for the threat, though no serious action was taken. Following this, Joe and Jack get into another argument, but this time they start doing it in front us and the other lads. Me and the other lads decided to let them just sort the situation out between themselves, and not interject as that would cause an even bigger rift between all of us, Captain America: Civil War Style, though we did tell them both to do it civilly and privately as it was a matter between them.

Apparently this wasn't the right thing to do according to Joe as he went on a rant about how we should have all backed him  up. He came at us, saying that we didn't even didn't even try to get them to sort it out peacefully.

Joe then proceeded to then block all of us and call us assholes.

Were we the assholes in this situation?

Edit: a word

Edit 2: I forgot to mention that Jack tried to apologise for his actions and what he said to Joe afterwards, but he wasn't having any of it. Not from him and not from anyone else."	Not the A-hole	0	0	10.0	8.0	0.0	0.0

They’re very talented and super sweet, I greatly appreciate their work and am always willing to pay whatever commission they ask. We’ve had 2 previous transactions before and I paid right away & was shipped what I ordered. The first piece was a lot smaller than what I asked for and the second arrived a full 10 days late. I didn’t care/mind because they’re busy and I really like the work so I didn’t mind waiting.

Saying this in the nicest was possible, this friend is a bit of an airhead. Last week I asked for a commission piece based off of another one she created of two kittens. This new piece would consist of the parents of the cats, when I initially messaged my friend I said “hey, if you have the time would you be able to make a index card portrait of these adult cats? They’re the parents of the ones you drew before” she said sure! We further discussed details (size, medium, framing, etc) and she chats with me more about the previous work which I find a bit weird. Before the conversation ends I send her multiple photos of the adult cats from different angles and ask for a specific pose of them.

The day to ship comes and she usually sends a preview beforehand and pricing which she gives a general ballpark for. This one was supposed to be oil painted and the price was to be between $150-$250. She send the preview(s) and quoted me $450 which is definitely out of my budget. I was going to pay + tip and hopefully stay around $300 MAX. She’s somehow didn’t listen to what I asked and redone a painted picture of 2 kittens AND only done a quick pencil sketch of the adult cats (which was the main request, she didn’t even paint the sketch). I ended up paying for both because she’s a good friend and I enjoy her work but I felt really annoyed by the situation. I did tell her that’s not what I had requested and wanted to say just send the adult cats but she said she’d already packaged everything to ship. I also asked her to paint the adult cats and she said she wouldn’t have time, which annoyed me even more because that was the entire commission.

Would I have been the asshole if I asked for just my request & paid for what I requested? I ended up paying 2x the amount for half the quality of work."	Not the A-hole	0	0	667.0	58.0	0.0	0.0

bwcc4u	2019-06-03 16:01:42	JezzieNevaeh	AITA for venting to my boyfriend about my roommate	"My roommate and I have been friends for 10 years now, so when we moved in together we thought everything would be fine. Well, there were small things that annoyed me. Things like the fact that she always paid her rent on the 2nd or 3rd of the month since our landlord is nice and gives us a three day grace period. Personally I just found it annoying and slightly irresponsible as she gets paid weekly and its not hard to set money back for rent to make sure its in before the first. Also, she would wake up in the morning with only enough time to do her personal routine and leave me with feeding and walking her dog, without asking me if it was ok. So I vented to my boyfriend about this since these were minor things and I felt they did not effect enough for me to actually start an argument with her over. 

Recently she came to me with the complaint she felt my boyfriend was disrespecting her and she felt I didn’t stand up for her enough. I apologized, had a discussion with my boyfriend, and we changed. He stopped saying things about her, I corrected him and turned the comment into something positive if he did let one slip. Apparently this wasn’t enough. 

She then asked to borrow my IPad one night so she could watch Netflix. I thought nothing of it and agreed. Me and my boyfriend primarily communicate through discord, so when she saw a discord notification pop up (with no words in it. I have my notifications set to only show that someone messaged, not a preview of the message itself) she apparently clicked on it, saw her names since we were talking about how I was saying she needed to be respected but I’ll admit I was venting at this point. Seeing her name and my venting infuriated her. She then dug through all of our messages, took screenshots of every time her name came up, as well as going through my Facebook messenger and personal text messages to look for her name. Any time she found me complaint she took screenshots. 

She then came to me with a power point presentation of all my wrong doings, saying I stabbed her in the back, she can’t trust me since I talked behind her back, and that she no longer wants to be friends with me, I’m not allowed to touch any of her stuff, and my boyfriend is not allowed over. I then apologized profusely, told my boyfriend that I had exaggerated my complaints (as she requested) and she said that he could come over then. 

So this weekend he comes over, and she starts packing her stuff up, refusing to speak or look at me, and just being very pointedly mad but unwilling to talk. This I believe is my fault since I did forget to text her he was indeed coming. That Is my fault and I accept that. But overall I’m just wondering, am I the asshole for ranting to my boyfriend about things that I didn’t view as anything more than a mild annoyance?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

     This was right after I asked her to please stop being mad because people getting mad at me when I talk about my feelings is why I aren't open in the first place.

So this was the first wedding I've ever attended. It was for a good friend from college. I recently started a business that has been doing really well, and wanted to get a nice watch to go with the tux for the wedding since I didn't really have anything. I flew across the country to come to the wedding which cost me about $1500, and also went to Costa Rica for his bachelor party a couple of months earlier as well. I didn't even know a gift was required and so I asked all of my friends attending what they were giving and they all said $100 in a card. 

This friend has asked me about getting into my line of work (recruiting) and asked me how much I was making, so I showed him a recent wire I had gotten. For context, both of their families are extremely well off, they have even gifted the couple a condo in Boston. I didn't think it would be too out of place to wear an expensive piece of jewelry.

&#x200B;

My friend has since sent me messages claiming I'm an asshole for wearing such a nice watch and making all this money and only giving $100 as a gift.

bwc9g0	2019-06-03 15:55:32		AITA for sleeping with hook up's friend	"In my first year of college I started hooking up with a guy which we'll call Fred. Fred and I got along pretty well and quickly I was spending more nights sleeping over in his room than in mine. The problem was that in private although he seemed caring he would never express any feelings towards me, and whenever we were outside the room I was nothing besides an acquaintance. I obviously started having feelings for him and when trying to ask whether he felt the same, albeit not in the most direct manner, I got answer that did not get my hopes up. 

Fred and I had a mutual friend, John, in which I confided much of my feeling towards Fred. John always supported the idea that Fred really did feel much for me. One night at a party, I asked John to be honest and tell me what was going on with Fred and why he was always so distant. What he said shook me. Things along the lines of how Fred never cared about me as a person, made incredibly degrading jokes about me, and would love to see another guy just take me off his hands, but in harsher language. 

I was so hurt by this that being  immature and already drunk, I turned to the alcohol at the party. I blacked out completely. I woke up in John's room without knowing how I ever left the club. I understood what had happened. I was so sick when I woke up that i left the apartment to the hallway bathroom and just threw up for hours. Some of my friends who lived on the same floor found me and helped me calm down. 

I spoke to Fred, and apparently he had said all those things, but as jokes, not seriously like I had been told. In fact, he admitted he did feel something toward me, but now given the situation, it would be impossible. The entire thing caused a rift in our group, some believing I did nothing wrong, and some saying that John had no way of knowing I was blacked out and that since he claimed I came on to him, it was my fault for hurting Fred. AITA for blacking out at the party? I know I dealt with my feelings the wrong way and I feel awful about  losing two of my close friends either way..."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bwc91g	2019-06-03 15:54:36	whatwasoncemain	AITA for telling my parents it's either me or the dog?	"So to begin, my family has a dog. I am currently back at my parents' house from college. The dog is currently 8 years old. We bought him when he was a 22 days old, so he has been with us for pretty much all of his life. He is a Doberman, but not purely. He lives with my parents. I used to consider myself a dog person, atleast around 5 years ago. But that dog has made me hate dogs. I am not using ""hate"" lightly here.

That dog is a wild animal. Seriously. He acts like he owns the house. He has always been like this. He is agressive and knows no bounds. And the best part is, he only acts like that to me and my sister. He is totally fine with mom and dad. Hard to believe, yes, but I can verify this. I am not an outsider, as I have lived in the same house for 6 years with him.

Here is a rundown of things that he doesn't like and will attempt to bite if I do them:

>Me walking into mom's room (he mostly stays in my mom's room)

>Me hugging my mom

>Me trying to walk past my mom's room

>Me trying to pet him

>Me trying to get close to him

The list goes on. As apparent, he acts like he is some big shot. When I tell my parents to shut him up, they yell at him until he stops growling and then do nothing. **He never learns.** It's been 8 years of this. I still have some of the scars of his bites on my body. In all these years I have attempted to give him love so many times. I've tried petting him, hugging him, taking him for walks and even feeding him myself. Nothing has worked.

Fast forward to today when I was giving him his food. Same thing. My mom is sitting right there on her bed as he shows me his yellow teeth and gets in an attack position. She did nothing. I usually don't act like this but I lost my shit today. I yelled at her. I yelled at him. I told her it's either me or that rabid dog. 

She told me to stop overreacting.

Well, I realised that I am worth less than this wild animal in this house. I told her I will not come back once college starts again. 

In her defence, she loves the dog, the dog loves her back. She has no reason to put him down, leave him or even yell at him. I will be off to college in July anyway.

Tl;dr: My family has a beloved dog, the dogs treats me like dog shit. I told my mom to do something about it, she shrugged it off. She loves him, possibly more than me.

However, I recently moved back to the same state I used to live in when I was in highschool, and when I was  with my ex. My fiance will follow in a couple months. I have not been back to this area nor talked to my ex for 4 years. When I was living here my ex played a big part in my life, we worked together and saw each other every day. I was going through a rough time because my mom was terminally ill and eventually ended up passing away while I was still here. I was finishing high school and deciding what to do with my life, and had never been a very happy person overall. My ex shaped who I am today a lot. A lot of what I do and know now is because of him. We finished on very uncertain terms. Nothing was really clarified, I still have a lot of questions, and it does bother me because being back here brings a lot of memories. I dont want to get back together with my ex, I dont want a friendship, I dont even want him in my life, I just feel like a final meeting and some answers would give me a lot of closure that I haven't had these past four years. Honestly I've tried to just forget about it but I feel like it will always come up and always bother me until I see him and realize that he is different, I am different, and life is different and better now. AITA for wanting this meeting?

"My roommate decided to let her friend move into her room unofficially. She is paying for half of my roommate's part of the rent. I was fine with this since I get my room all to myself. However, our electricity bill is based on usage, and I do want that to be split among us evenly, especially since it seems like she uses the place much more than I do (working and school vs her just doing parttime and staying home). I've brought it up but my roommate basically says that all bills are split between the two of us, which I feel like she's saying just to keep her portion of the bills lower if her friend is paying her half of her part of the bills. So I'm essentially paying for at least a portion of her friend's electricity usage.

I'm going to bring it up again saying that it's based on usage and it's unfair to make me pay for her friend to use our services on my dime. If she disagrees, I'm going to tell her that she can start paying for her friend's portion of the bill then. Maybe that way she'll get her friend to pay since it would be costing her. I can't really enforce this though, so it'll be more of a battle to fight if she's not budging since i dont want to rack up late fees if she's being really stubborn."

Although I'm inexperienced and quite frankly super lame, he stuck around. Actually listened to my problems, gave feedback/advice, talked to me regularly and seemed to regard me well. As if there was some small understanding there and I wasn't just a sexual outlet of sorts. 

There was a large age gap, so I was often worried about not being able to keep him socially stimulated. I got the impression that he was interested in getting to know each other and casually talking too. There something was even said to confirm this (but I don't remember what exactly since I deleted my account). 

Yesterday I was having conflicting thoughts about pursuing this. It's only been ~1 week since we started speaking. I’d rather not be unfair to someone or do something that will make me feel bad afterwards although I enjoyed it sometimes. I wanted to keep his contact in case I decided I wanted to continue w/this new thing. I know it's literally not his concern, and it may seem like I'm taking this thing too seriously.

When I got to his profile, he had a bunch of other media linked publicly. I didn't think to ask, I just wanted to know what kind of person I was speaking to. Honestly surprised me that he'd have that stuff tied to an account he used for such matters. I saw a Twitter account... Saw a link to an old blog post that interested me... Ended up on a blog with tons of personal posts. Didn't expect it, and once I got there I couldn't stop scrolling? I was so fascinated and thought, ""Wow, this guy is something else."" Reading his inner self displayed on that blog made me reconsider deleting my account and instead try to push my limits (continue the dynamic). I wanted to know more about his current self and reflection. 

At some point I had to exit because I realized: I a stranger (who he has little-no information whatsoever on, not even a real name), most likely had no business looking into it. I didn't notice how far in I had gotten Then I just had to tell him; be honest. He was completely upset, almost disgusted with me (?) He didn't realize that he had that stuff linked apparently, and made it really clear with minimal responses. I apologized multiple times and just told him I'll delete the account + thanks for talking with me. His response to that was dismissive too. So I deleted the account. Made me pretty sad. I think it only bothered me so much because I don't think I've ever had a guy genuinely see me for me. I was also vulnerable with him, and something I was incredibly anxious about. But I wanted to trust him in particular with it, and found his voice/attitude reassuring. 

Now that it's no longer sad girl hrs at night, I feel okay tbh. But I do want to know whether other viewpoints. Thanks in advance and sorry for the shit ton of text (I can write for days)."	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I'm 1 of 3 people responsible for looking into filling a position in my department. The position is coveted and not so easy to get into as it requires some special education/knowledge.

My partner cheated on me some 4 years ago. It was devastating, and it took a lot of time and effort (from him) for me to take him back and work things out. Of course I was curious about this woman but I held myself back from knowing anything about her because I wanted to just move on with my life. The only thing I ever asked him was if they had sex and did he love her. Answers were yes and no (said it was a dark time for him and he felt like it was purely a sexual attraction). Whatever right. So yea, moving on, I managed to forgive him and give it another go. So far, he has been the perfect man. I havent thought about the entire thing for about a year now.

So fast forward to 1 week ago, we scheduled interviews for people. And simmered it down to 3 candidates, but one was outshining the rest. I really liked this woman, she has an unusual name but was charming, smart and seems to know exactly what she needs to do. And she did mention this was her 'dreamjob'

I talk to my partner about my day and told him about possibly hiring this girl and said ""the only thing I don't like is that I'll probably butcher her name each time I call her haha!""

He asked her name. And since I can't even pronounce it (its an old polish name apparently from her great grandmother or something), I pulled out her resume and showed him. He turned white. Asked me what she looked like and told me it was ""her"". I immediately felt a gigantic feeling of betrayal, like it was happening all over again. Apparently, he didn't know that I didn't investigate about the girl back then.

The next day, I told the other 2 people about not hiring the girl because I don't think she fits. They found it odd because they saw how much we 'clicked' but didn't question it since it was my department. 

One of them called her to cancel the 2nd interview. I heard she was very very upset and asked why she didnt get picked and we gave her a standard answer.

I told my brother about this and he said, although he understood, he said I was being unfair and used my power in a very wrong way. I told him, if I hired her, I'm pretty sure I wont be able to stand her. He insisted ""but still"". So idk, aita?

Edit: i really don't know if she knew about us, since like what I said, I literally did not ask anything else than those 2 questions. I think its an abnormal reaction from my side to have done that but I thought the less I know the better I can move on. What you don't know won't hurt you was kinda my motto.

Also, I would be her immediate boss/supervisor that is why the other 2 didn't really question my decision.

Edit 2: to people MESSAGING ME about being ""dumb"" for sticking around with a cheater.. i can't remember posting this on r/relationshipadvice. I'm not looking for your judgement on my relationship, I am looking for judgement for the issue I stated, and telling that part about my life is crucial to the story but is not open for discussion."

Tl;dr at the end 

So. A couple of months ago two of my friends who were in a very long-term relationship, 5+ years, broke up. This has caused all sorts of shit in our friendship group because we all play for the same club, and some people are taking sides, whilst others are trying to steer clear of it all. 

For one of the parties involved, this was a chance for them to explore their sexual side, and so they have had a merry old time getting as many sexperiences as they could. Because I'm the sort of person who's never going to say no to some juicy goss, we started chatting. One thing let to another, and they asked for my Snap, and pics and videos were exchanged and enjoyed. This was kinda weird, seeing as I was friends with both of the people who split, but hey, I wasn't about to complain. 

Not long after that, I started chatting more frequently with the other person involved in the breakup, and we have started a project together. Now I know that they didn't want the relationship to end and I don't think they're fully over it yet, which was a little awkward, but that's not where it stops. I continue chatting with my Snapchat ”buddy”, and we're now talking about fucking. Unfortunately (or futunately) our schedules never line up, so nothing happens for a few weeks. But then we go out for dinner to catch up with a mutual friend, have a few drinks, and I end up giving them a lift home. 

We're in the car outside their place just chatting for a while, talking about sex, and being very flirty. Then we kiss for a bit, and then they offer a backseat bj, which I very happily accept. 

Still chatting with them, and the possibility of sex is still on the table, but still kinda feel like I've crossed some sort of line with my other friend who I'm now having more to do with. 


Tl;dr got nudes and a bj from a friend's ex who I was also friends with. Am now having more to do with both of them separately then I did when they were together"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

bwbu2r	2019-06-03 15:18:27	perfectlyimperfect_8	AITA For Asking If She Only Wants To Hangout When It's Beneficial For Her?	"This past Saturday, the girl I had been seeing and I had plans to hangout after her friends and her went out. I was going to pick her up from the bar and what not. She stopped answering and it didn't happen, even though I had waited up until 2 am (she stopped answering at midnight) thinking she may just text me as the bar is closing. 

The next morning she texted to apologize and said that she felt bad. I acknowledged her apology, but brought up my concerns about how I am the only one to initiate plans and how when she cancels/bails it doesn't really seem like she actually wants to hangout with me. I told her the only times she has seemed eager to hangout with me was when I bought tickets to events she wanted to go to (which even one of them she cancelled on), she needed her car jump started, and when she was sick and wanted a ride to the doctors. 

After stating that she responded with a ""I understand where you're coming from, but I never once asked you to do any of that."" Which is true, I offered, but because I care about her and would do that for anyone I have any sort of relationship with - romantic or not. 

After going back and forth for a bit, it seems as though we may end things. AITA for telling her she seems only interested in hanging out when the situation benefits her?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	11.0	9.0	0.0	0.0
bwbtt0	2019-06-03 15:17:48	Ihavenoidea1331	AITA for not making the cakes?	"I am 22 and love to bake. I take the cakes into work for my coworkers. Recently. a coworker has been asking me to bake for her family events. She has been giving me money, but its usually not even enough to cover all the ingredients. 

&#x200B;

Recently, she messaged me to order 170 decoraticve cookies, 40 cupcakes, and 3 different 2 tiered cakes all but one for the same day, her kid's 1st birthday. Also to face paint at the party. I told her it would probably cost a lot. She said it was fine and the party was on a Friday. I agreed to facepaint for the friday.Later she messaged to ask for a price. I told her i couldn't face paint because she had changed the day to a saturday and i was busy. I was worried about finishing everything but a friend offered to help so i thought it was fine.

&#x200B;

I hate asking about money so, I had a friend help me write a polite message to her and check my price estimates. I had figured the costs and that it would take 40 hours to make (with help) I told her $350 for ingredients and then told her it would be 40 hours and she could decide what that was worth.

&#x200B;

She responded complaining that she had only budgeted $300 and that i had agreed to face paint. I repeated that i wasn't available cuz she changed the day. I told her i couldn't afford to make her order for less than $350 and that it didn't include my time and, for $300 she would have to cut back.

&#x200B;

She said she wanted everything for $350. I was confused since it wasn't a favour and i was getting nothing for my time, but i was already uncomfortable and agreed to try. She asked for a sample of the cookies in advance. I refused due to time constraints and costs.

&#x200B;

The next day, i got an offer for my uni course, An advanced graduate diploma and is full time, plus my actual job which is part time. I worried i wouldn't get her order done in time. There was over a month til her party so i messaged to ask if she could get someone else to do two cakes and i would do the cookies, cupcakes and one cake. I cut the price to $150 which doesn't really cover costs. I have never interacted with her outside of her asking me to bake stuff so it's a big favour. I told her that uni had to come first, particularly since i wasn't being paid for my time. I had two friends check the message to make sure it was polite and that my reasoning was clear.

&#x200B;

She got upset that it was last minute and would be hard to find someone else who would do the other cakes. I apologised. She said she would try to get someone else to do the other two cakes. She was planning to contact a bakery although im sure they charge far more than me. I now feel guilty. I was trying to be nice. I messaged as soon as I got my uni offer. i wanted her to have time to figure it out. She has 6 weeks til the party. I'm scared to message her. I haven't taken any money from her yet.

&#x200B;

So, AITA for backing out when i said i would do the cakes for her? I feel really guilty."	Not the A-hole	0	0	21.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

bwbqzk	2019-06-03 15:10:55	DisastrousKing9	AITA for not driving round to find a friend some new shoes.	"Me, my BF, and two friends I will refer to as K and L went away for the weekend for a festival in Central London (we are all 21 years old). We had a good time however in the evening during the final band K went into a mosh pit and lost one of his trainers. He instantly went in a mood about it, which we tried to be sympathetic about, however it was a litttllleee bit funny at the same time. 

After the festival ended we spent about 15 minutes looking for the shoe, we found nothing, and as you can imagine it would be impossible for us to search the whole site for one shoe. He reluctantly had to walk to the tube station with one shoe on. During the walk we suggested some ideas to help. He refused all, such as using prime now to get new shoes delivered to the hotel as we were going out for the next day into London. He asked me if he could sit in my car, in a car park all day while we were doing touristy things in the city, i refused as it was supposed to be 26c in the day and he wouldve been sat with the car doors open which isnt sensible, to which he had a go at me.

&#x200B;

The next morning he refused to come to breakfast which had been paid for by L. We suggested prime now, but he refused as he didnt want to buy any more expensive shoes, however if someone else was willing to pay that would be fine(???). L didnt bring any spare shoes and my bf did, however K is 5 sizes bigger and he tried to cram his foot in the shoes but it obviously didnt fit. L tried local supermarkets for any cheaper shoes however there was none at all and K then asked us to uber him to the closest cheap shoe shop which we all refused as we weren't responsible for him missing a shoe. He then asked if I could drive him around London to a shoe shop as there were none near our hotel (we stayed area north of the centre, about a 30 min tube journey in) however I refused as city centre driving wasnt something I felt comfortable with, and the hotel was straight off of the motor way which is why I had no issue driving us here. He huffed and went back to his hotel room, and told L he wont speak to me again after this and that im not helping him on purpose. He ended up getting the tube straight to oxford street and going in the first shop he saw, H&M and got himself some new shoes, however spent the rest of the day in a mood so we left early as he was bringing us down.

bwbmm9	2019-06-03 15:00:26		WIBTA for getting into a fight with my SOs mother over his medical care?	"So, my SO has a few medical issues, but the most pressing one generally is his epilepsy which popped up 6 years ago. His last seizure about 6 months ago destroyed his shoulder (shattered parts of both the socket AND the ball, his shoulder comes out every few days at least, last week it came out because he sneezed too hard😔). Multiple sports medicine and orthos have told us it’s the worst they’ve ever seen.

His mother has a terrible track record with doctors. The last one she found before this shoulder stuff came up told him he had a dead thyroid, had to cut out 3/4 of his diet, and sold him bottles of “liquescences” (wtf) for $80 a piece (I found the same bottles on Amazon for $4 each). His only practicing experience was 3 years as an ER doc in the early 90s. After my bf saw the “medicine” he called his parents to tell them he needed real meds if his thyroid was that dead, they said to take it anyways and don’t worry about it.  Turns out the only true thing that quack said was that he should avoid dairy, as he’s slightly LI. This is just one example.

Now to the issue, she found him a doctor for his shoulder, thankfully she agreed after the appointment that that doctor/clinic was terrible. I got him an appointment with the best ortho dept in our state (my parents work closely with them, the hospital takes the same insurance everywhere else she takes him does), they told us again that it’s the worst case they’ve seen, and that if he doesn’t get it fixed by about August, he risks losing use of his arm altogether. His mother was not present for this appointment. She then decided to get another doctor without reason, who is telling him he shouldn’t have surgery at all. I ran their reason by my dad and the doctors I know, they agree that it sounds like they just can’t do the surgery. We’ve had several doctors say they weren’t the person for this, but they always recommended someone else. This place is the only one giving the nuclear “nothing can be done” answer. If he doesn’t get this fixed, he risks losing usage of his dominant arm. Ive been really biting my tongue, but the longer his shoulder is like this I get more and more panicked.

He agrees with me, but any time he says something to his mom, she goes off about how it’s *her* insurance and *her* money so he doesn’t get a say. He’s 23 and just graduated from college like two weeks ago, he doesn’t have the option to get even somewhat decent insurance by August. I know if I bring this up, it **will** start a fight. I’m just terrified he’ll be permanently disabled so his mother can prove she knows best when she clearly doesn’t, and I know more about medical care than both of them so I know I could effectively argue.

Apologies for bad Grammer or so on so fourth writing on a phone.
I'm a 17 year old living with my Mom who normally doesn't get out much. My mom got me a job over the summer working under a contractor who buys and sells houses. Apparently when I had asked her before she was under the assumption this would be a unpaid internship which I was not too excited about. Although at the end of the first week surprise surprise my boss hands me a paycheck of 150$ for 3 days of work he tells me he dislikes unpaid internships and I should have some pocket money for the summer. After working out a 60$ per day contract I leave and head back to my mom's. This is where the am i the asshole comes in my mom after hearing that I would be paid starts to do the ""I'm really low on money right now. It's so hard paying for you and your brother..."" And so on, after she then asks for 25% of my paycheck, be aware I'm working 7 days a week so it's about 105 dollars from the paycheck. Am I the asshole for being annoyed and not wanting to do this? She is unemployed but haven't been actively looking for work just doing ""freelance"" jobs as she calls it.


Edit: thanks to everyone who responded I ended up talking to my Mom again about it with some of the suggestions people gave me. It worked out she told me as long as I pay for extra food i.e. lunch, workboots, and other expenses at work. I would also be giving some of the money I earn to her for food for my brother and so on I'll see how this turns out as people mentioned I should see how the money is used and then make a decision based on that.

One female is best friends with my cousin. My cousin has kids the same age as mine. Well that certain female was going to be at the birthday-party for my cousins son and out of respect for my wife, I told her I wasn’t going.

bwbfkf	2019-06-03 14:42:28	beeskneeees1	AITA for ghosting my habitually ghosting friend?	"I've known ""Alice"" since age 16 and we are 26 now so I have known her through thick and thin. I know that she has a terribly abusive family and that at heart, she tries very hard to be a good person and different from her family. I will of course preface everything by saying that she has her fun and good side - that's what I counted on throughout the years. Unfortunately, Alice is also extremely combative, hypocritical, and downright hysterical in her worst moments. I have seen her through literal screaming tantrums, sabotaging people to get ahead, talking shit about everyone about everything, and then turn around and do the same things herself, excusing herself because who knows why. She is also the type of person who needs your full attention during meltdowns - but if you come to her with a problem, she gets very cold and tells you to suck it up and get over it. I have been screamed at in public because I said something wrong, been berated and talked down to for doing or saying something that offends her, and most importantly - she completely shuts down and ghosts you if she feels like it.

This has happened more than 10 times in our relationship - so basically once a year, she flies into a rage and blocks me off all social media, refuses to pick up the phone, and ghosts me for about a month. Then she emails me to to say ""let's talk about it."" Usually she apologizes first and I think to myself ""I should be mature and accept her apology. Things happen."" I honestly don't know why I allowed this behavior to continue over and over. Probably because we have a long history together, but also because a part of me pities her. Her parents were very abusive to her - my parents are very kind, compassionate people and I think I am too, usually. I thought that she could at least find unconditional love and respect with me and my family.

Shit hit the fan last week when after months of her being generally flaky and short with me, I got into a huge fight with my boyfriend. He threw a glass near me and left. I was really upset. I called Alice but she wouldn't pick up so I texted her ""John has lost his mind. He broke a glass and I'm so scared. Please call me back when you can."" She texted back, ""Sorry, can't. I'm busy. Maybe later."" She never actually called me back that day. This was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. About 2 weeks later, she called me and I didn't pick up and she didn't call again.

A month later, she calls me about 5 times, obviously in a panic, in one of her meltdown modes. She texted me about how she thinks she pregnant, doesn't know what to do, freaking out and crying, SHE NEEDS ME. I didn't pick up, I didn't text her back, and I basically left her on read. She tried again a few hours later and I ignored it.

AITA for doing this? I HATE the idea of ghosting. When I see it happening to my friends (in dating situations) I think it's really messed up, but this time, I ended up doing it myself and I feel truly conflicted."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

bwbbc4	2019-06-03 14:31:58		AITA for nothing wanting to go to my dad's home country?	"First post on Reddit and English is not my first language so bear with me :)

So a bit of a backstory, my dad is from Senegal, my mom's from Belgium. They both got a teaching job at the same school in Gabon, fell in love and moved to Belgium. I have a much older (half-)sister and one younger sister.

Since my dad is retired now, he travels to Senegal at least once a year for a couple of months. The last time I went was when I (24F) was 11. My paternal grandparents both died so the only family we have there are my dad's siblings and their children. 

Like I said, last time I went there I was 11 so it's been a while. Senegal is beautiful and the people are friendly (although a bit nosy haha). The only downsides to the trip were the heat and my cousins. I still vivdly remember them demanding I give them my mp3 player (it was cheap but my dad gave it to me so I treassured it) and trying to emotionally manipulate me to hand it over. Both my dad and my older sister send them money (combined definitely over a €1000/month). 

A portion of that money is supposed to go medication for the elderly but we suspected that that's not the case. They've also requested that my dad buys them expensive computers (he didn't, we aren't rich) and once asked him to pay for a birthday party and then didn't even invite him (even though he was in the country at that time). There's a lot of other stuff but basically they see us as a wallet, not as family. 

My dad and sister mostly send the money for his brothers and the people who took care of my sister in infancy. It's a crude thing to say but they won't live much longer. Most of my cousins don't work and stay at home so they see this as easy money. I have no love for them, I ignore their fb request, I don't talk to them on the phone either. 

I may seem like a huge dick but the one time I helped them, they were incredibly disrespectful (story for another time). I feel like if I go there as an adult they may try to get me to send them money too so I always find an excuse not to go.

My mom is a single mother and very caring, but increasingly over the last few years I’ve gotten frustrated with her inability to let go.
She constantly gets on my case about what I should be doing with my life - you should really be studying, why don’t you apply for this job, why don’t you go read a book instead of using your phone, why don’t you go see these friends. It makes me feel like I have no agency over my life, especially because whenever she suggests something, it makes me way less likely to actually do it. Sorry but it’s true.
I have my own life. I have my studies and a part time job at the university. I have my own friends who I can schedule things with as I please. I can cook and drive and vote for President. But, no matter how many times I try to explain this to my mom, she just doesn’t seem to have any faith in me. She claims that she knows I don’t need or want her guidance for every little thing but acts as if she doesn’t care.
Just today, she got on my case about studying for the GRE, asking me to please take one of the practice tests. Apparently it’s stressing her out that I’m not doing more to prepare for it. Why should it even matter? It’s not like she’ll fail the test if I don’t study. Even if I don’t go to graduate school, I have plenty of avenues to support myself so she doesn’t need to worry about paying my bills forever.
Obviously this all comes from a place of love, and there are people with way worse problems and way worse parents. But I’ve been home for a month and it’s just driving me nuts.

bwb9uz	2019-06-03 14:28:20	astonezthrowaway	AITA for not consoling my husband about his pot usage when he has a drug test coming this week? More info inside cause of course there is.	"I'll try to keep this short because I've vented on other subs. My husband (30m) has been unemployed since March, we have been barely scraping by on my salary alone and I've been very frustrated with him because he's been incredibly picky about getting a new job. We both grew up in blue collar homes so I don't know why he has this notion, but he keeps saying he's ""worth more"" than a $15 an hour job. He has a GED and has only worked in one industry his entire life, and it's an industry he doesn't want to work in again. 


Anyhow, with a huge amount of luck he landed a high paying job that starts this week. Providing he passes a drug test.  


He quit smoking mid-March for a few weeks because he wanted to test clean, but then Endgame came out and he ""had to see that stoned"" so he begged me to be ok with it and promised he'd get clean again after. I told him I couldn't make him do anything, but I didn't think it was a good idea.


As you know, Endgame was a while ago and he just never quit smoking. He said he'd just pick up some QuickFix and go that route. I told him again I was uncomfortable with it, and he promised everything would work out.


Now a week before the job, they're letting him know that since it is such a high-paying, working with big machines position, the drug testing will be pretty thorough and they will probably have someone in the room with him. Now he is coming to me begging for reassurance that everything will work out.


I'm kind of over it. I have supported him and made things work by myself (he even refused a part time job) and HE was the one who promised me fake pee would be ok. I honestly feel like he put getting high over our financial security and I don't feel like reassuring him any longer. If this falls through, it's on him and it will be up to him to get a freaking job at Target or something because all my savings are now gone.


And before people say I should have been more firm about why I didn't want him smoking, I have always been vocal about my dislike. I have asthma and the smoke really bothers me. I also have an emotional aversion to pot because I was falsely arrested in a drug raid (ex was a dealer and I was at his house when they were busted) so I feel like if anyone should be getting reassurance that things are going to be alright, it should be me. 


AITA if I don't tell him everything will be ok and I think he messed up? He always said it was alright that he smoked weed because he ""always paid his taxes and showed up to work on time"" but now he might not be getting a job for it. I feel like he's prioritizing weed over our security while I've been bending over backwards trying to pay rent."	Not the A-hole	0	0	65.0	9.0	0.0	0.0

bwb96q	2019-06-03 14:26:41	inkylad	AITA for talking to a kid about tattoos?	"Context: I'm very heavily tattoooed. I have over 60 individual tatts, though some of them make up bigger pieces, i.e. sleeves. I also have a 10 year old little brother (I'm 25) who stays with me about 80% of the time as our mum is a single parent and she's in and out of hospital a lot (long story, not relevant). 

Situation: last week was half term here in the UK so my brother was off school. On Wednesday, he had a friend over for a sleepover. I've met this kid's grandfather as he's the one who picks him up from school, but never his parents prior to this. The grandpa is a nice dude and the sleepover was arranged mostly through him. Kid arrives, we get pizza for dinner, they play out for a while, I get my arse severely kicked on Fifa, we build a den in the living room for them to sleep in. Normal sleepover shit. As we're starting to get ready for bed, kid starts asking me about my tattoos, just the standard questions you tend to get from kids if you're blasted; do they hurt? Which ones hurt the most? When did you get that one? What does that one mean? Which one is your favourite? I like this one best!  So on and so forth. I explained it all to him because I think it's rad when kids are interested by stuff and I think it's our duty as grown ups to encourage their curiosity and educate them if we can.

Apparently this was a mistake on my part. The kid went home and told his parents all about my tattoos and how he wants to get lots like me when he's bigger. His parents are really pissed because they say don't agree with tattoos. I think they're quite conservative, and the kid is pretty sheltered. They say that they think tattoos are common and uncouth and that they make someone look like they've been to prison/are in a gang (to be clear I don't have any gang or prison affiliated tatts). They've essentially said they think I'm a bad influence and they're no longer comfortable with me taking care of him unsupervised. I'm pretty mortified - in hindsight I probably should have checked with them first, or gone out of my way to introduce myself to more than just the grandpa.

bwb8dn	2019-06-03 14:24:36		AITA For getting a tattoo?	"Apologies if this sound like one of those annoying validation posts, but I genuinely can’t help but to feel like an asshole. I need a 3rd party perspective here.

This past weekend, I (24/F) got a moderately sized tattoo on my back (its 3 words on the left side of my back, starting just below my shoulder blade and ending near my pant line). Its something I’ve wanted for a while and I think it looks dope. However, I can’t fully enjoy it because of my dad. 

My dad has been adamantly anti-tattoo forever. He is really outspoken about it, saying tattoos are stupid, ruining your body, etc.  I actually already have 1 small tattoo that my mom knows about, I really don’t think she cares but acts like she does because of my dad. When she found out she told me he can never know. I can’t even joke around with my dad about tattoos, he’ll get really serious and say “please do not get tattoos.” 
 
Now, I know I’m an adult and can make my own choices - my body, my decisions etc. But, here’s why I feel like an asshole. My parents are really great. They paid for my college tuition, and they let me live at their house rent free. They are really amazing people and I’m lucky to have them, which is why I feel like I almost betrayed my dad’s trust by doing the 1 thing he was always against.  
 
But I mean, I’m a college graduate and I have a great job. I’m financially independent minus living with them, and I don’t know, I’m just like a normal contributing member of society? Also, it’s not like I got the F word across my forehead. Still, I can’t help but feel like a disrespectful little shit. 

Luckily I can cover it up pretty easily with clothes, so I just plan on doing that until I move out. But idk, I just have a lot of guilt right now. So, AITA for getting a tattoo?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

One of that guy's friends made jokes about how that was super quick and that you're supposed to at least have drink together before you ""put out"" etc. 

Well my friend wasn't actually feeling her acquaintance after all, so when he noticed that she was not going to go home with him he left. A couple of minutes after that, my friend took a liking to the guy joking earlier and they ended up making out almost immediately...
 Now I did not think much of it, but it seems like she actually sees something in him which leaves me wondering if I should say something (or if it is something noteworthy at all or just leave it...

bwb7ok	2019-06-03 14:22:58	Five_Star_Golden_God	AITA for not wanting to help pay the cable bill?	"So I’m a college student and I lived in a house with 5 others throughout the school year. At the beginning of the year, we got a cable package for the year and we all paid an even amount each month for it. At the beginning of May, a few of us left the house for the summer, but a few stayed at school over the summer. Those who are still in the house want those who left to continue paying for the cable bill. Their argument is that we all agreed to get cable, therefore, we all pay for it regardless of who’s using it. The cost of the cable, as they have said, remains the same regardless of who is using it, and so now that there are fewer people in the house, it costs more per person than it did before, and that’s not fair to them. Furthermore, it is common for students who leave for the summer to sublet their room in the house. However, I and the others who left were unable to find sub letters. They argue it’s our fault for not being able to fill the house back to its original 6 people, and that if we had successfully replaced ourselves, the cost would be the same as it was before. My argument, however, is that I’m not using it, nor do I want it anymore as I have no need for it. I’m not there and not contributing to the reason why we still have cable in the house, therefore, I shouldn’t be paying for it. If I had the option to, I would want to cancel the cable so that I don’t pay for it anymore. They, however, still want cable. That’s fine, but since they are the only ones who still want it, I feel like the cost should be split between them and them alone. Furthermore, I don’t think it’s fully my fault I don’t have a subletter. Just because I didn’t find someone to live in my room and also want to help pay for cable for the summer doesn’t mean I should still pay for something I don’t want/use, does it?

So reddit, AITA for not wanting to pay the cable bill?

Edit to add a tldr; long story short, I’m no longer living in a house that has cable, but am still being charged for said cable. Am I wrong to not want to pay it?


Edit 2:

Roommates and I have talked more and it’s become apparent the terms of our contract were not clear to everyone. Some (myself included obviously, as well as someone still in the house for the summer) believed it to be month-by-month, whereas in reality it’s a 2 year (couldn’t tell you why 2 years when we’re only living there for one) contract. However, I believe it is my responsibility to know the contract regardless of how it was communicated, and I can accept Reddit’s judgement that I am in fact TA. I will pay the bill, and make sure to be more careful with similar situations in the future

Final edit:

I appreciate you all calling me out, I needed the third party perspective. I understand the arguments and while I don’t like them I agree that I got myself into this. The main point of conflict was due to a misunderstanding in how the contract works, and because of how it works I can agree with the almost unanimous opinion you all gave me"	Asshole	0	0	56.0	10.0	0.0	0.0

There’s a huge square of grass near my house surrounded by houses that are rented by older people. The grass area in the middle is public land. I walk my young dog there cause it’s the only area near my house we can walk to, play and walk back. He can’t walk too far cause he is a puppy and I don’t have a car to take him anywhere. He likes it cause I can give him a bit more leeway on the extendable lead to sniff about etc.

An elderly woman called me over and asked if I lived in the area and I explained I lived round the corner and pointed towards my house, smiled and went to keep walking. She then said “they don’t like you people walking their dogs here” because they do their business and don’t pick it up. I said I totally understood but he only goes in our garden and if he did I always keep bags attached to my lead. 

She then said they really didn’t like it, don’t know who she was referring too. That I should stop walking my dog here. I explained politely (although at this point I wasn’t appreciating her much) that he’s not trouble, and he doesn’t bark, I’d clean up after him if he went to the loo. She even agreed that he was a good little dog and “nicer than all the other little ones”.

It’s not private land, there’s no sign saying no dogs and nobody has even had a problem with him being walked there before...

We'll call this friend N. He's more of a guy you meet in a class and talk to often, but don't actually make plans with.

We're both in uni and we had a 3d design class together. I a;ways had a knack for it and did really well with little to no effort. Unfortunately, it wasn't the same for him. I would help him out with HW and stuff pretty consistently. He was a nice guy and I like to be helpful.

&#x200B;

 After the first exam wherein I did very well, and he got fucked pretty bad, he straight up asked me if he could cheat off of me in the next one. I said that I couldn't stop him from cheating but I would not actively help him/show him my stuff etc. I made it clear that I would not be an accomplice, but I can't stop him from doing what he wanted. Soon after this, I realized that if he got caught, there was a possibility of me getting in trouble even though I wasn't going to help him.

&#x200B;

So, I met with one of my TAs. Before revealing anything, I asked if I could tell something about a possible cheating situation while maintaining anonymity. I also got her word that she would help the student in question and not report him unless he actually cheated. She's a good person - she agreed to this, so I told her what N said and what my response was. From then, she went out of her way to help him out and he ended up not having to cheat, off of me at least.

&#x200B;

I did this to protect myself and I think, in a way that might've helped him not get screwed.

I put myself down often, and rarely think I’m good enough. I expressed this to my now ex girlfriend before we started dating and while we were dating.

Anyways, a few days ago I could see she didn’t seem herself. She usually always wanted to hang out but then she started telling me she was too tired to hang out. I knew this wasn’t right, because she would sometimes tell me this like at 2 in the afternoon. Then, yesterday we decided to go shopping. At around 4 I asked her if I could come to her place after because this is what we usually do after shopping. She said she would be too tired. I asked her if something changed because she doesn’t seem herself. She said no, but when we got in the car she started to break down. She told me that she feels like a bad person in the relationship, because I am always paranoid if she actually likes me and stuff. The only reason I was paranoid about this is because when I say “I love you” or give her a compliment she usually just respond with “ok” or “good to know.” I told her prior to this that her responses kind of bothered me because I felt like I wasn’t very special. She said me saying that compliment is the main reason we broke up. We both cried together for a couple hours in the car, and I was shocked that we were over.

She was the best, and I feel really terrible. I feel like an asshole for sure. I just need some advice. I already apologized, but I don’t know if I’m completely in the wrong.

My wife of 5 years and I have been arguing a lot lately because she thinks im an arrogant and pessimistic elitist.

Over the last 18 months I've been really interested in critical thinking, skepticism  and science.  I travel a lot for work and so have been listening to a lot of ""the great courses"" lecture series on the above mentioned subjects.

As a result of listening to these lectures, I've developed what I think is a pretty healthy skepticism of the world, and a desire to know the truth about any claim that someone makes to me.

My wife on the other hand is quite spiritual and has beliefs which lie outside of the realm of science. 

Lately though, when we discuss things, I've been asking her to support her claims with evidence. Or I've been arguing the point with her because I've learnt tnings that don't support her claims.

I'll admit that I have been dismissive and arrogant in a few of my rebuttals, but I apologised for that and said I'll try to avoid it in future.  But now she's saying that my inability to understand her beliefs is a problem.

We've been playing for almost two years now, and we've had a great time. Bob has introduced a new player, Anna, and her boyfriend Stan. We've had a great time playing together for almost a year now or so, and we even went on holiday together.

Now Bob really wanted play in a campaign as well, as he's always the DM. He knows I DM too, and asked me to DM so he can play.

There is another guy, Henry, who I don't know, but is a friend of all the aforementioned people and he is in the new campaign as well. We all agree to meet for the first session, and Henry is 1,5 hours late. (like wtf?) Eventually, he showed up with groceries and we played the game. I expressed that I wasn't pleased but we made some jokes and the first session turned out super fun regardless.

So I prepped and readied another session. Mind you DM'ing is a fuckload of work. The first date we planned got rescheduled due to scheduling conflicts. The next one as well. The third attempt was cancelled on the day. Someone needed to go to their family, Anna and Stan couldn't make it, I honestly can't remember. Fourth attempt. We all meet at Bob's place at 17:00. Approx an hour away from my place, and 40 minutes away from Anna and Stans. Fred (another player) was on his way and excitedly asked about what he should get from the supermarket. Henry asked at 16:30 if Anna could pick him up. And then shit hit the fan. Henry cancelled. Anna and Stan suddenly cancelled as well, apparently, Anna had a sudden migraine. They cancelled at 16:45. 15 minutes before the game was supposed to start. Even if Anna and Stan had not cancelled, it would have been physically impossible for them to have arrived in time for the game.

I messaged everyone in the groupsapp that I was not continuing the campaign. Mainly because the first session was almost 6 months ago, and I have too many campaigns I run already and I felt like this one wasn't going to make it anyways due to our scheduling conflicts, so it's better to just give up. After some talks with Bob and Fred we decided to call in some friends of ours who would like to play dnd that day. We had a blast, and I'm just gonna continue the campaign with them,(So I don't waste hours of work) and lie to Anna and Stan that we quit.

However, Anna and Stan are still players in Bob's campaign, in which I play as well. And we've got a session coming up soon, and they've not responded to any of the messages. I think they're very angry with me for being so insensitive towards them.

bwazez	2019-06-03 14:01:25	alarmbutton	AITA for not reporting someone to protect my own career?	"I'm [36F] a bank manager working at one of the UK's big high street banks. I have worked at the branch for 18 years and been manager for 7. I get along with all of my team and make a point to get to know them personally in order to help them with their careers. 

Occasionally head office send their specialists to high street branches in order to make sure everything is running smoothly. Some of these guys just observe from the office while others take a more hands on approach and have a go at the customer service stuff while observing our work. 

We had one of these visits over the course of last week. This time it was a beautiful young girl called Alicia. She seemed really lovely at first, but I noticed she had a real superior attitude towards my staff. One of the girls, Harriet, came into the office to inform me of something, Alicia said ''Good, now F off'' and then started saying that I was too soft on the staff. At that point basically stole my office so she could set up her laptop as she wanted some privacy while she worked. 

Over the week my staff were subject to verbal abuse. She swore at them, called them idiots, berated them for minor mistakes which would take seconds to sort out. It was horrible to watch and I did tell her to tone it down, but the fact is since she's way higher up than I am she was essentially running the branch at the time. 

The final straw came on Friday, when Alicia went to the toilets and when she came out was completely manic and out of control. I'm 99% she had been doing drugs in there. She decided to try out working on customer service and ended up frightening a customer and her child. They then asked to speak to the manager, and she tried to tell them that she was the manager. One of the customer service girls, Kim, called me over to sort the issue out. I managed to sort it and the woman left.

I took Alicia into the office and demanded to know what she was doing, but the drugs were making her act completely childish and silly. She left early and I haven't seen her since. 

I want to report her for both nasty behaviour towards my staff and her drug use. The problem is that while Alicia is high up herself, her father is one of the people at the very top. That's not to say that he got her the job or anything like that. I did a bit of digging on LinkedIn. She is a financial specialist with a relevant degree and other specialist certifications so she's obviously qualified and capable of doing the work. What I do think is that given her attitude, she chose this company so that daddy could look after her. Complaining about a senior from head office would be difficult enough, but one with family connections is impossible. I could lose my job or even be blacklisted.

I try to do right by my staff and have gone above and beyond with them in the past, but I'm not sure whether I can risk my career and livelihood, and I'm not sure it's worth it since she's gone from the branch anyway."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bwayx7	2019-06-03 14:00:09	imightneedhelp101	AITA for constantly being annoyed because my parents are being wasteful	"My parents are living quite wasteful and it's annoying me very much. I am not the usual green eco type of guy, but it really pisses me off  when food goes to waste. A few examples: 

Our refrigerator is constantly overfilled to the point where if you bought something for yourself you need 2-3 mins to even find it. Everything is stacked on top of each other so you need to grab stuff out so you can even look thoroughly. Sometimes I find stuff in there that was long overdue due to it being at the bottom of the stack. 

We literally got a new refrigerator 3 days ago and it's already completely full, btw.

When we have family dinner on sunday my parents are always cooking around 2-3 times more than what we actually need. And because I am the only one that doesn't want to see that food wasted I sometimes eat the same food for breakfast, lunch and dinner for 2-3 days. Not that it tastes bad, often it's actually quite delicious but eating the same food 3 times a day for multiple days just sucks. This really grinds my gears because they are often cooking new food or buying something else to eat on the next day.

Obviously I have talked to them about it multiple times. They aknowledge it, say that I am right but then forget about it the next day. Everytime I experience them being wasteful I just find myself getting frustrated and often just shut myself off from them and I am acting more cold towards them. Sometimes we even get into fights because of it. They are saying that I shouldn't be that annoyed about it all the time.

Am I being assholeish here? After all, it's their house and their rules.

EDIT: Seems like most people think that I am TA. That's fine. Literally the reason I made this thread is because I wanted some 2nd opionions. I will try to be more lenient with them and I'll try to find some other ways that the food won't be wasted as much."	Asshole	0	0	742.0	18.0	0.0	0.0

bway6c	2019-06-03 13:58:04	cwcrw23	AITA for my housemates financial issues?	"My housemate moved in in February, we were ‘friends’ but I didn’t want her to move in, as I knew she was very messy and has a low paying job, and wouldn’t pay her own way, but she contacted my landlord and asked to move in when my old housemate was moving out. I have had to stay home and not stay at my boyfriend for month and she doesn’t like sleeping in the flat ‘alone’.  

4 months later, the house is a bomb site and she hasn’t unpacked a thing. There are boxes all over here the house to the point that the dining table isn’t usable, because of her boxes all over it. She keeps saying she will unpack on her day off - and never has.

The final straw was last week, she went through my draw in my room and found an old council tax letter from January, from when my old housemate hadn’t paid his council tax, which I had to pay £800 for for him, from when he moved out and from when she moved in. She sent me an explosive message saying how this clearly meant I haven’t been paying the council tax for the past 4 months and I owe her the £50 a month she has sent me (I pay £110 a month, she pays £50 as she can’t afford that, plus rent) - and that thanks to me, she is broke and can’t afford food or travel for the next 2 weeks. She demanded £200 back as a result of this. She ignored the fact she went though my personal draws and belongings, where my medical records are sat in, as are my medication, my bank statements and several other private things. 

I sent her my online banking and proof from the council that this in fact, was coming out of my account each month. Her response was ‘fine’.

She works 3 days a week as waitress and an ‘actress’ who hasn’t had an extra role in a year. She also uses my card to online shop, and expects me to buy everything for the house, such as cleaning products, food, tidy and clean and hoover, and do the dishes, etc. If we would go on a night out, she would expect me to pay for the Uber there and back, drinks, and tickets. 

She now hasn’t spoken to me in a week, has she wants to move out, and ignored me at every opportunity. Furthermore, calling me a ‘slut’ for having brought my boyfriend home in the past. She clearly isn’t happy here, and can’t afford it, and has no real social life here, yet is making me feel like an asshole for her decision to move in here, even though I told her it was expensive. 

TLDR; my housemate can’t afford to live at our flat anymore, and has given me hell for her own financial issues."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

"My supervisor is a piece of work, to keep this anonymous as possible I’m going to keep pronouns out of it. They are leaving soon and suddenly attacked me out of the blue and seemed to want to make sure I would be miserable before they left. Why? They don’t like me. Why? Possibly because I don’t kiss their ass and stand up for myself, IDK. They once told me this trait was admirable but things have spiraled out of control for the worst. They’ve been horrible since day 1 when they started but for some reason or another they pick on me the most for every little thing (mind you they pick on me for the same things that other coworkers do too) I can never have a steady conversation with them without them starting an argument then telling me to stop arguing with them. It feels so frustrating and unprofessional. My work preferences and my feelings towards things are ignored while other coworkers are valued and checked in on (how they’re feeling personally, work related, etc.) I have been working at this particular place longer than half the staff yet they treat me like I’m new and refuse to give me a raise because I was part time up until this year. They lied to me and said that raises were given on how many full time years you put into a company not based on hours, which I soon read up in the handbook to be false. They have lied to be about numerous things and then dodge my questions when I get skeptical about them. On top of their unprofessionalism nobody in any department likes them. They dress inappropriately and handle situations inappropriately and use obscene language to be funny. (Okay?) long story short they gave me two unreasonable write ups before they decide to take off and I don’t want to sit in silence and let them attempt to ruin MY career because they don’t like me, should I “tattle” on them?

I also have major depressive disorder. Well, my boyfriend of 3 years cheated on me and in my turmoil my divorced parents called one another and gave me options to move to Arizona where my dad lives, or in Colorado with my mom. My mom was the one who actually told me that she and my dad would help me move wherever I wanted if I wanted.

Well, I got really really low and now close family on my mother's side is watching me as they are the closest relative to me. I have to be monitored because I'm a danger to myself. In the midst of all this I decided I want to move to Arizona because moving to Colorado just doesn't sit right with me. My dad would be paying for my therapy and medication while in AZ. My mom lost her shit. Saying I'm throwing my life away because a man dumped me, she said my dad is a POS and that she raised me by herself (only half true, he never paid child support while I grew up, but he did emotionally positively impact my life because he had partial custody. He has been paying my phone, medical, and rent bills  as an adult to make up for it). She said ""how dare you pick him over me"" 

 I asked her why she even suggested moving if she didn't want me to actually move and she told me ""I thought you would come to your fucking senses and stay"" I told her it was my life and that made her even angrier. I asked her if she preferred me to move to Colorado with her, she said I'd needed to gain residency for cheaper tuition so therefore by the time that happens I'll be too lazy to go back to school she claimed.

It started out all good I would talk to my mom and brother on the phone because we lived in different states. They lived in Illinois and I lived in georgia after my dad got a new job. Flash foward about 3 years and I didnt hear from them for a couple of months or so. By this time me and my dad moved back up there with my stepmom and brother only living about an hour away. When I called them it only went straight to voicemail. All the time I would see post on facebook from them. I tried talking to them and nothing. Before I graduated highschool i got a call from a random number and answered it and it was my mom saying how they was in a bad spot and needed money. By this time i was about to graduate and head to basic training. I told her everything I was about to do and couldnt loan any cash. After I was supposed to graduate basic I got a call from her again. This time saying she was sorry for asking me and not calling me like she used to and that she was in a bad relationship. I dont really know if I can believe her though because of her history of lying to me and everything that i really dont want to get into. She is kinda trying to make a connection with me again but she still only calls about once a month or so. I know the phones go both ways but it doesnt bother me to not talk to her. Everyone on my dads side of the family is telling me to not get involved with her.

I was given pain medication to take for the day and told to rest. Now, I am still sick. My right side of my face is swollen and I can barely swollow. My husbsnd wants me to call my doctor again. I told him, they told me the z pack is in my system for 10 days, so I have to wait. I haven't had a fever at my appointments, but am on Tylenol 24/7. My husband got mad that I won't call. I am exhausted and can barely talk. I want to save my energry for our kids, who need me to take care of them. I do think I need more meds, but am sure I will be told to wait it out.

bwarid	2019-06-03 13:38:59	airbag222	AITA if I got upset at my mother?	"Alright, we had a stupid argument, but I don't understand why does she react this way.

I live in an apartment because I attend college in another city. I went back to my parents because these days I don't have class, it's exam period. My mother is working on remodeling a bathroom in the house, so our home was a mess.

I was hesitant to come back, but since I didn't see them for 3 weeks and the city is not that far I came back. But I still have an exam to study for, and my major is heavy.

Today my mother went to buy groceries, and when she came back she realised we were out of yogurt. She says that I should've told her, since I am the one that eats those outside of lunch meals. I replied that she just said she took the last ones yesterday for our lunch, so it's not my fault that she forgot.

So she's been really pissed at me, and as I sat down to eat she told me that I shouldn't talk back to her, and that she's tired from the remodeling, that I haven't been helping around the house (which is not true, though I'm doing less than if I had more free time. Even so, I don't think it's my responsibility to help with the remodeling since I need to pass my exams) She also said I had a bad face when I went to help her get the groceries from the car (?)

She is right that the remodeling is a lot of work and she's doing most of it. My father is not home most days/weeks(due to work) and my sister is also a student. She must be exhausted from the past weeks.

During the argument I was silent the entire time because I don't wanna fight. Now I need to study but I can't really concentrate. I guess I'll go back to my place tomorrow in the early morning. I'll stay the weekend even though I won't have any exams left. I need to do a major cleaning because since I'm leaving for the summer. I'm afraid she'll take me not coming back bad, assuming things again.

Also, unrelated, but she just came to my room to ask me if I wanted to go to the beach with her in the afternoon. Um, no? Like, you just had a one-sided argument during lunch and I have to study, jeez.

bwapov	2019-06-03 13:33:48		AITA for taking three days off of work since April	Not sure if this is the best place to post this but I started work on a golf course around April 8th and have taken three sick days off since. All three of these sick days have happened in the last month though, and I’m trying to not make a habit out of it. I also took another day off for a doctors appointment, but I told them like three weeks in advance. I haven’t been “sick” any times I missed work, I have felt uneasy though. Usually it’s cause I ate too much the night before and now my stomach is bothering for most of the morning the next day. I also have like $30k saved up and not desperate for money at the time,  but I also don’t want to be thinking like that because $30k wouldn’t last that long. When I do work, I work pretty hard and try to be as efficient as possible. I do work early hours(530 am start) but also get out early in the day. We have about 25 other employees and I’ve definitely got them beat for days missed at work. I always regret taking the day off because I feel guilty if I go out in public, even if it’s just going to the grocery store. So I tend to just stay home the whole day and watch tv or sit outside.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bwapos	2019-06-03 13:33:48	Gameofthongsbalish	AITA for getting mad at my gf for not paying bills?	"Sorta.

So I work in a factory. 13 hour shifts 5 days a week.

I also ... try... to have some hobbies like gaming and guitar. But I only get to play maybe 1 to 2 hours of games a week if that. And I haven't touched my guitar in a few years lol.

Anyway, I get mad and start arguments myself because my gf who lives with me next to never cleans or washes dishes. Everything is always messy.

She does have a job. Sorta. She works around 3 days a week. Usually 3 to 4 hour shifts as a part time cashier.

I pay for all the bills. The most painful bill is food though. I spend around 150 bucks a week on food alone.

I'm sure to some that might not be alot. But  I'm also paying all the other bills.

Now she gets paid every 2 weeks and her checks are barely 300 bucks. 

Now it might sound crazy of me, at least it does to her family, but she thinks she should get to spend all her money on things ""she needs"".

Problem is its been about 9 months now. And everything she gets paid she ""needs"" something else. Like more clothes or makeup. Or to take her little siblings out.

So am I the ass hole? I just want some actual help. She does cook sometimes... sometimes.

Here’s a few things to know about my friend J.  J loves to cuddle with people. He calls it platonic intimacy. He just likes being near anyone and he doesn’t have to have an emotional connection to them. He also dated this girl, M, when he was younger, but she essentially ditched him for someone else. 

This year, J and M started to hang out more and more and we’re becoming friends again. They would hang out all of the time and, eventually, they started to cuddle. One day, M kissed J and he wasn’t really into it, but he went along with it to continue with the cuddles. They went on with this for a few months until M told J that she liked him and wanted to date him. J said he did not like her in that way and just wanted to be friends. He said he would like to still hang out and cuddle, but he didn’t want to kiss her or do any other romantic things with her. 

She continued to pursue him and would still kiss him and try to be his girlfriend. He continually told her he wasn’t interested, but he liked having someone to cuddle and hang out with. One day, at the skating rink M was there while J and I were hanging out and started to cry because J was hanging out with me and not her. She then told all of her friends that I was trying to date J and that I was a whore, even though I have a boyfriend of 2 years. This made J very upset and he essentially told her that he would never date her, he doesn’t like her personality, he doesn’t find her attractive, and he thinks that all she wants is attention. He told her he just likes to cuddle with her and nothing more. 
She cried over this, but, after a few days, she wanted to hang out, cuddle, and kiss him again. This happened multiple times, him telling her he isn’t interested and her ignoring it, and she continues to go back. 

All of my other friends say J is the asshole for continuing to cuddle with her even though he has no feelings, but I say he has done nothing wrong because he has made it very clear that he does not like her in that way on multiple occasions. It is her choice to keep coming back and keep getting her.

bwalcy	2019-06-03 13:21:31	hevehdgdbiskwn	AITA if I refuse to pay my share if somebody else spilled all of the drinks on me?	"Hi so the title doesn’t really give you the full scope of the story, but I wanted to get some opinions about my course of action. 

So last night, I went out dancing with a few friends. Before we get to the spot, we agree to meet at a bar beforehand. I get there late, and instead of going to the table and hopping on their tab, I go straight to the bartender and open up my own tab. There’ve been issues dividing the checks with this group so I decided to avoid it completely.

Anyway we all chill, turns out they ordered food which they offered to share. I said “no thanks I already ate”. The reality was I didn’t want to get involved in an argument over the check and how much I should be paying (again there have been issues). Server brings out a plate of wings and loaded fries, cool I’m chilling. Then he *accidentally* brings out a second order, saying that he gave us the wrong amount of wings. They already started eating, so he said that since he couldn’t take the wings back to the kitchen, we could kee it no charge. 

Free wings?

Now I say “alright I’ll have a bit” and I take exactly 4 pieces of the free 20 piece wings. Literally. So we close all the tabs, I’m good on my front thinking that I don’t owe anyone anything. 

So we get to the spot, and order a 30 dollar pitcher of beer to split between 5. We sit down at the table, and my friend who’s sitting across from me serves herself half a beer and the rest of the table a full cup. Before she gets to me, somehow the ENTIRE pitcher spills on me. Of course, there’s not much I can do aside from just taking the L in stride in the moment and laughing it off. What use would me flipping out do anyway? 

So I sort of get cleaned up but now I reek of beer. Turns out the (new) white pants I was wearing are dry clean only. So there’s a bill.

So that’s the backstory, now for this morning.

I get a text saying I owe $20 from the initial bar tab as my share, and then the $6 for the beer. Now if I literally had 4 pieces of *free* wings, I’m tryna understand why I would be charged as if we split the bill 5 ways. So no, I tell them I’m not paying that since I had my own tab and the wings were free. They still say “oh you had a little bit of fries so just send $10”. I was a bit drunk so maybe I had some fries, I wasn’t gonna argue further anyway, so I just sent the $10.

Now they’re demanding I send the rest even though I couldn’t have the rest of the beer and now I have a dry clean bill for these pants. Literally the person that spilled it said “don’t worry you got it”. Not that I’m demanding they pay for it, but it would be nice to at least be offered or at the VERY least say sorry.

I message this guy on a hook up app. We are texting/sexting and it's relatively late at night but he asks if he can come over  because he just got of work and was horny. He arrives at my place and we get to business because of the texts we had exchanged not too long ago. By this point we are making out and we are partially undressed. I have showered and prepped because that's common courtesy if you're about to get intimate with each other. 

He doesn't smell too strong, but it's still there, a sweaty male musk smell. I stop the action and ask him if he wants to take a shower. Again, common courtesy if my mouth is about to be near you genitals. He assures me he showered that morning, so did I and I tell him that I just showered 20 minutes ago as well. This goes on for a bit and I point blank tell him that I'm not hooking up unless he showers, if not he can go home.

This all ends with him leaving and calling me an asshole because he drove a 30 minute cab to my place. That did make me feel bad, but surely taking a quick shower to at least wash your genitals shouldn't be that hard?

bwakmh	2019-06-03 13:19:09	agudhooman	AITA for leaving my job with intentional havoc and confusion?	"Here's some backstory:

4 months ago I was employed at a nursery school on a 3 month probation as a student/assistant teacher. Working there has left me emotionally exhausted and borderline depressed, to the point where my boyfriend told me over the weekend to quit, stay at home and study, gain some skills and get a better job, because my happiness is more important.

So I did.

To name some of the few things I had to deal with, to add some context, the teacher I was working under was always reporting me to the boss because I didn't do enough work to satisfy her, even though she herself was out of the class most of the time walking around and talking to teachers. It got to the point where I would be on my feet all day, and I worked from 7:30-17:30, with an 1 1/2hr break. I worked with 15 babies. I had a meeting with the boss to talk about the teacher's rudeness towards me, and the teacher just lied and told her I swear at the children. Of course the boss believed her.

The boss would always find ways to take money away from me. I was supposed to get 2 days paid sick leave, but she refused because apparently I don't get sick leave on probation, and should look at the contract again because it was stated there, when in fact, it wasn't. And I already got paid minimum wage.

The nannies there were treated even worse. Teacher's get birthday teas and all the staff HAVE to buy them gifts, but the nannies didn't even recieve a gift from the boss on their birthdays, and earned just about as much as I did, though most have been working there for more than 15 years. 

We were constantly expected to lie to the parents about what was happening with the children, and I wasn't allowed to talk to any parents.

When my 3 month trail ended, instead of employing me permanently, and bringing up my pay, the boss said she will put me on another 3 month probation because I wasn't a natural with the children, and because of the aforementioned meeting and the fact that she now believes I swear at the kids. She didn't give me another contract though.

I could say more but this post would get too long.

So this morning I walked in, gave a few people some chocolates and thank you letters, the people who were decent to me, and walked out. Obviously, everyone was extremely confused and had a lot of questions. However, I said nothing to the boss. I wanted to screw them over as much as they had a screwed me over. It was only a bit later, when one of the other students pointed out that what I did was indecent, did I start to feel a bit bad. So I messaged the boss saying I resigned.

AITA for doing it on such short notice and leaving everyone confused and understaffed? And for not immediately telling the boss?

TL;DR I left my job this morning with every intent to cause havoc and confusion in retribution for my poor treatment over the past 4 months.

He called him dad too. He never seemed to have any issues growing up about it. 

We lived with our mom and I would go visit my dad during the summer and some weekends. Just normal visitation. 

When we were young he was abusive. This stopped when I got bigger than him. I played sports and exercised a lot. 

Some background. My brother was always a little angry all the time. I know it’s from underlying issues with his dad. But he was always an average student and never really played sports or did after school activities. 

I, on the other hand, straight a’s and was a semi decent athlete. HOWEVER, I never bragged. I hate bragging and I feel that being humble was the best part of my favorite athletes growing up. 

He always resented me for it. The older we got the less we would hang out. Which is normal. But he got to the point where he would just ignore me for weeks or whatever. 

Flash forward to the issue. 
I got out of the military and it was around Xmas. My dad invited the whole family to a get together. Not for me. But just because my dad loves these giant parties. 

Not one minute after it was created as an invite on Facebook my brother declined with no reason. 

My father was upset because he cares about my brother and his kids. And wanted to see them. So he calls me and asks if I had heard a reason for the quick decline. I then messaged my brother and got a message back that changed our relationship forever. 

Basically it was talking about how I was a “golden child” and everything was given to me. (Now I don’t care about this part. I know it’s bs because I worked hard for my success) next he called my wife a fatass. Then he said “your dumb f***ing family or stupid effing kid”

That was it for me. 
I didn’t read anything else. I just deleted all contact and waited for an apology. To me. To my wife. And to my son. I don’t care that my son is only 4. It needed to happen. 

But it never did. Flash forward. It’s been 2 years since the incident and any time we’re near each other I just avoid conversations. And he knows why. But refuses to acknowledge what he said.

"Okay, for some background me (f16) and my boyfriend (m17, we will call Bob) have been dating for about 6 months now. About mid way through March his friend needed to get arid of some kittens, so Bob took two of them. Bob's mom doesnt like cats so the kittens came to stay on my property, first in the woodshop for the end of the cold season, then in the barn (in a cage) for the beginning of the hot season. 

The agreement with my dad was that the cats would be off my property by June 1st, and within the first week of getting them the cats would have an appointment set to get spayed. Neither of those has happened. 

These kittens are super sweet and even my dad had agreed to me wanting them to be barn cats. Bob is highly against the idea. I have two barn cats right now who are super friendly and who seem to like the kittens.

Before anything happens they would need to be spayed, but Bob wont make the appointment, and I dont want them to have to be spayed when they get older after they started spraying and running off and what not.

WIBTA if I made the appointment and paid for the cats spaying, and then kept them to make them barn cats? Ive told Bob about me wanting to do this, but he just changes the topic. My mom has said I would be an asshole if I did, but my dad agrees with me."	Not the A-hole	0	0	285.0	25.0	0.0	0.0

The day after I found out, I called her husband, my stepfather (we have a very tenuous relationship, as he was verbally and emotionally abusive to everyone in the house when I was younger. He's also your stereotypical redneck man that makes his wife do everything for him. He still has a temper and is too immature to control it all the time) who said he spent 8 hours researching alz.

He showed me a book by a ""doctor"" that said you can reverse the symptoms and when I told him that anybody could write a book, he accused me of being pessimistic. I just let him do his thing, bc I'm on the other side of the state and can't do anything anyway.

We talked again and he told me that she didn't absorb stress right and didn't eat or sleep well and the book said if she had done those things then she wouldnt show symptoms. It felt to me that he was blaming her for getting sick. So I looked up the author of this book and the only study his name was attached to was an unblinded 10 person anecdotal study that said Alz can be reversed. I sent him the following text:

""While I do think we need to consider all possible options, I do think it's healthiest to look at these things with a little bit of healthy skepticism. The only published study I can find his name on is the trial that he talks about in his book, which was preliminary and unblinded with only 10 participants, meaning it's really unreliable data. I'm not saying it's not accurate, it's too early to tell and I'm not a scientist. But I do think in the interest of spending effort where it can be most efficiently spent, I think we need to make extra sure we're not being bamboozled. You can sell a lot of snake oil with the right pitch.""

He got really mad that I said that and hasn't talked to me since

He swears by this book and is under the impression that it's going to save the day when I'm sure we all know it's not. But 75% of the stress in her life is due entirely to him leeching her money (and my 14 year old brother's money he got from a settlement after our dad died) for his failed businesses (which he's trying again now to get mom out of work), plus the fact that he yells and screams when he doesn't get his way

I'm completely under the impression that he's killing my mom without realizing it, and I'm afraid to say anything to him, but he needs to understand that alz can't be reversed with a special diet otherwise we'd know there's a cure. 

WIBTA to tell mom he's wasting his time and to try and pursue scientific methods or do I just keep letting them both live blithely in their dream world where my mom isn't slowly dying

I told her I read a little bit about the accusations and I felt they were bs. She responded kinda aggressively and said ""there's no such thing as false sexual assult accusations"". 

To which I replied I think that is illogical. It's innocent until proven guilty otherwise people could easily spread libel information and there would be no justice.

bwaf2c	2019-06-03 13:03:18		AITA for dumping my GF on a trip to Europe?	"My GF of 4 months and I were on / off fighting for weeks leading up to a trip to Europe. We came close to aborting several times leading up to it. In hindsight we probably should have done our own thing from the beginning but it was both of our first times traveling abroad and we were figuring things out together.

Here’s the thing with the kind of fights we have... my (now ex) GF has OCD. Not the “it annoys me when pictures are slightly crooked” kind of OCD that everyone claims to have. There are ritual motions she needs to do every morning before we leave the house that can take hours. It also affects her ability to resolve conflicts to her satisfaction because things never “feel right” to her and she can’t let things go. She obsesses over details and reads into things that really have no meaning at all.

A small disagreement can snowball into a huge argument which devolves into name calling and rehashing arguments from past fights. it goes on for hours. I’ve wasted entire days on this trip listening to her  berate me for minor things like walking in front of her, wondering off, or thoughtlessly interrupting her mid sentence. She would constantly pick at me for stopping and looking in store windows or expressing a want to do something outside of a major city for a day. Mind you I’m not doing any of this to spite her, I just get spontaneous ideas, get distracted by things or wonder some times (ADHD.)

After days of this we got into another argument about finding a hotel while we were on our way to a new city by train. She vetoed my idea because she wanted to research for another “10 min.” I give it to her. 40 min later the original hotel is sold out and I’m rightly upset about this. Right at the end of our train ride we find another hotel that both of us agree on. Then she starts arguing about who should pay for it. She wanted the points on her hotel app and I wanted to pay down the balance I owed her for the flights by paying for hotels. I had the app and the payment screen already open so I just mashed the buy button. Done.

Nope. She refused to move from the train station until I apologized for buying the hotel. This wasn’t going to happen. She would have dragged us into another embarrassing public fight in a foreign country and I was done with that nonsense. I walked away to our hotel (5 min away) and left her at the station. She had the address and I gave her the room number once I checked in but she continued to carry on the fight via text. Both of us said things that can’t be taken back. I broke things off and now we’re traveling solo. 

Neither one of us was having a good time and even if our relationship survived the trip I feel it was doomed once we returned to the states. I think this is for the best. Now we can enjoy the rest of our trip in peace. AITA?"	Everyone Sucks	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"We had family over to our home this weekend for our birthdays. It was only supposed to be immediate family but somehow my husband's aunt and uncle were invited. This is separate issue that I am really angry about since MIL is the reason why they showed up. 

Anyway, this uncle is creepy and I don't care for him. I have previously told my husband about his uncle's weird behavior towards me. 

I am six months pregnant and showing, btw. When I finally came down to greet everyone (only a few people had arrived) the uncle immediately zeroed in on me and gave me a lengthy, uncomfortable hug. He kissed my neck and repeatedly whispered in my ear how good I looked. I tried ending the hug twice and he wouldn't let go. When it finally ended, I tried getting away without making a scene and he held on to my arm and kept rubbing it. He made groaning noises and just kept commenting on how I looked great. It was awful and I felt like I was violated in my own home in front of my family and husband. 

Husband said he clearly saw what was happening and froze. He feels like he should have said something.  

In any case, we've decided to not have people over to our house for a long time since we apparently are unable to control who is invited. We also have decided that we will not attend and future family functions where uncle is attending. 

I have confirmed creepy uncle's behavior with SIL and she told me he did the same to her while she was pregnant a few years back.

I am very hurt that my husband did not protect me in that moment and, probably irrationally, feel like he should make an announcement to his family why we won't be attending future family functions instead of being silent about it.

She and her boyfriend had been dating for about 2 months before she left, and he was super nice. Fast forward to the end of the summer and he found out she had been cheating on him the entire time. Even though I was her best friend, she ended up never telling me because she knew I had been cheated on in the past and was super sensitive to this stuff. 

&#x200B;

I ignored her for a few weeks because I was so mad at her. While I was ignoring her, she reached out and apologized a bunch of times but I wasn't ready to talk to her yet. When we got back to school, she wouldn't hang out with our friend group because she was kinda scared of me. Then, because I would rant to my friends about her, they all started to turn on her too. I didn't mean to get them to turn on her, but we all really liked her now ex-boyfriend, so it kind of naturally happened. So because of all this, she ended up loosing all of her friends and had to go the therapy because some of our other friends (not me!) started bullying her. I didn't mean for that all to happen, and I even started to try to be friends with her again because I felt bad, but she and I never got to the level of friendship before. 

&#x200B;

I really loved her when we were best friends, but now I've found out she's switching schools because of what all happened with the bullying and stuff. I can't help but feel like I'm the asshole here cause I caused all of this for her just cheating on her boyfriend over the summer (and we're young and in college so like people make mistakes rights?).

bwa91c	2019-06-03 12:45:15	randomacct6524	AITA for possibly being part of the reason my friend will not graduate high school?	"I’ve never posted on reddit before so I’m sorry for how this turns out, I’m also on my phone in school feeling horrible. I’ll post a TLDR at the bottom.

I’m a senior right now in high school. I’m already going to the college I aimed for and have gotten good grades throughout high school. I’ve worked extremely hard this year especially in my AP classes to the point where I don’t have to do the final project or show up for the final and still get a B for the year in this one class. That one class happens to also be the only final I have to show up for. 

My friend has done nothing all year. I had multiple conversations with her about how she is throwing her life away and she just says she doesn’t care. Now it’s the end of our senior year and she needs the one AP class we share in order to graduate. The thing is I worked hard all year so when it comes down to it I don’t have to do any work and still pass with a B. I even did more than half of the partner project for her and she still hasn’t done anything and is just waiting for me to do it. I told her I’m not and she just isn’t working on it. For the final, it’s a debate. She’s my partner and we debate against two other people. You can debate alone, she just says she doesn’t want to do it alone because she will choke up (probably doesn’t want to do the work). 

Originally I just wasn’t going to come in for the final due to the fact I don’t have to, I could be out for over a week of school doing nothing but picking up extra shifts at work and making extra money since I don’t need to be at any other finals. Then she gave me her whole pity speech and I just said sure. Now, I have an actual reason I can’t come in though. The one final happens to be on the day I leave to go three hours away with my family with an organization we volunteer with. I cant reschedule it as it isn’t just a family vacation it’s an actual event held by an organization. So I tried to get my teacher to reschedule it and he said he can’t. I told him I just won’t be able to come in then and I’ll take the zero for it. Then I told my friend and she goes “Wow, thanks for leaving me. I’ll probably fail now and not even graduate because of you.” The thing is though she’s the one who did nothing all fucking year. I had multiple attempts to try and make her fix herself before it was too late and now she’s graduating (possibly) with no job, car, license, or anything. I feel like it’s partly my fault but for the most part it isn’t. Everything is because of herself except for our final but that can be done alone too so even that won’t be my fault. I do feel bad though which is why I came here wondering if I’m an asshole for this or not.

bwa8cq	2019-06-03 12:43:02	riskyriskri	AITA for being upset that my gf is mysteriously getting money to pay for car repairs?	"Posting here because not too sure where else it would fit. Anyway so just yesterday my gf had the car for work and as she was leaving, her friend reversed out of a parking spot(like she must have floored it out of the spot) and now my whole front bumper is like crushed in and leaking coolant.

I was obviously pretty upset about this and her friend tried to talk her way into paying out of pocket. It's likely going to be too expensive for that so I was planning to go through insurance anyway. Long story short, by the time i got home everything was better, my parents assured me that her insurance would handle everything.

Then my gf tells me her licence is suspended, and everything just toppled down again. Again, I'm obviously pissed and backed into a corner. My father suggested that I just go through my insurance and report it as a hit and run, but as I was checking my deductible, I discovered that my insurance took collision coverage off.

My gf says that's she's going to get the money to do the repairs, but everytime I ask how she's getting the money and from where, she refuses to tell me. ""It wont impact our financial situation""   ""do you trust me to handle this""  ""I'm not getting it from blah(her ex)""

Those three things are all she says. Am I in the wrong for wanting to know where this mysterious money is coming from?

TLDR: gf got into accident(not at fault) with her friend but her license is suspended(I didn't know). My insurance took off collission coverage without informing me(can't report as hit and run). Gf says she'll get money for the repairs but wont say how she is getting it. Am I wrong for wanting to know where this is coming from. Also we have been living together for 2 years now

Extra info to answer any questions: her friend definitely isn't going to be paying all at once, and due to past experience with my own friends, I of course dont trust her to actually pay me back the money for repairs completely. She said the most she can give at this very moment is 500 to 1000.

My gfs plan was to use the mystery money to pay repairs and then her friend pays her back.

As far as I know, my gf has no way to source what my family estimated to be at least 5000 in repairs. She works part time and credit utilization is at 100 or damn near close, so I doubt she's getting a loan. I doubt she's selling drugs, because all of her contacts was through her drug dealing ex who disappeared about 3 years ago."	Not the A-hole	0	0	18.0	5.0	0.0	0.0
bwa7r3	2019-06-03 12:41:11	yrsonx	"AITA for not giving my ex ""the baby stuff""?"	"My ex and I split about 4 years ago, when our child was nearly 2. I kept all the baby items from the baby shower: clothes, bottles, crib, etc- aside from things with sentimental value to ex (some clothes blankets, toys), as I had primary custody of our child together. I have since remarried and have a 7 month old, and ex is expecting a child with a new partner. Today, I woke up to several voicemails and text messages demanding all ""the baby stuff"" that was left behind and, supposedly, came from ex's family. This somehow included almost everything that was left (crib, dresser, changing table, bottles, receiving blankets, and more) I said no. 

IMO ex has had 4 years, including the entire time my partner and I were expecting, to lay claim to these items but replacing them midway through my child's first year on next to no notice seems ridiculous. We are not inherently better off financially than ex and their new partner, but we make wiser financial decisions and are more financially stable for large purchases such as these. I'm upset that ex feels entitled to these items, as though my home has just been a storage unit all these years, and that instead of approaching me politely, ex demanded I give them ""back"" and got hostile when told no. Ex is also behind in child support for our child together, which has impacted finances in my home since I am still on maternity leave and only receiving partial pay.

She didn't like this and eventually came to me with these photos because it was making her really uncomfortable after which I spoke to Dean on messenger telling him to leave her alone. Instead of apologising he ran his mouth at me, tried to act like a keyboard hardman - so I got my sister to forward screenshots of the nudes/dick pics Dean sent (with his name tagged on them from messenger) backed them up to various secure places then passed them onto Dean warning him that if he didn't leave her alone I'd make it public that he was pestering a younger girl who wasn't interested in him and leaves printed copies of the nudes outside my old school (where he was still in sixth form, my sister was 2 years below him in y10). The threat of public humiliation seemed to work as he apologised then cut off contact and my sister didn't hear anything from him for a while.

The only reason this has come to mind again is because while on my personal laptop (I use it for education) at the college I was going through some old folders that I'd forgotten about with a few others and stumbled across one of the caches I had of Dean's naughty photos. Made for a humorous conversation ""oh fishcakes, I didnt realise she was that kind of girlfriend"" and so I explained the backstory behind it, only one person seemed to think I might've gone too far. So yknow just asking here for an opinion/thoughts

They've disclosed their mental issues to me (Bipolar, depression), and I really try to be there for them, but it's so exhausting to handle sometimes as I also suffer from depression (not on the same level, but still..)  and it often gets to me how I constantly try to be there for them, but nothing I say is ever right, or my input get ignored, brushed to the side, and comments that get under my skin, saying things like ""Anything you say to me, i'll do the opposite"" or ""It's funny you think your opinion matters"", and it hurts because I really really care for them, but as someone who has abandonment issues( sorry, cringe) and insecurity issues, when they say things like this it makes me anxious and sad as I feel like i'm worthless to them.  They often have manic episodes, being really up at times, wanting to do the craziest things, sleeping for only 14 hours the whole week, crazy drug use, to ignoring friends, cancelling plans, and super alarming comments that make me very uneasy. They have all the means to be on medication, and they were on them before, but stopped, and now it feels like i'm just watching a horrible, horrible situation unfold in front of me. On one hand, I want to keep being friends, because I have such a love for them, but on the other hand, It feels like im on a sinking ship, and I'm starting to feel resentment that I do not want to have! I feel like shit writing this out, and I literally have no clue if i'm being over dramatic, or what!

Edit: Just realized I said they the whole time, I'm terrified *they(singular)* will find this somehow lol.  Also, I want to put in that this friendship isn't all bad like I made it out to be, they are super generous to me, and treat me like family when in a more clear(?) state."

So My roommate also had to do laundry which I didn’t know, so he took my out of washer and put it on the table again he always did this kinda rub me the wrong way because my other roommate would have pop it the the dryer as he did laundry and I do the same for him. We all pay for our own detergent and I buy tide pods. I though like a couple months ago someone may be using my tide pods but I didn’t really care or keep track hell if my roommates needed them I didn’t care. Last week my roommate in question randomly gave my 2 tidepods and said here I owe u this. This kinda of caught me off guard and I was like just throw them with the other ones. So this morning I wake up go down stairs to put cloths in dryer and my wet cloths are on the table and my old empty tide pod case is on the ground and my new one which was already open had the lid off of it so I almost positive someone used it and I was just pissed so I went upstairs and texted him basically I don’t care if you put my cloths on the table but don’t use my shit and still put my wet cloths on the table.

bw9zu4	2019-06-03 12:17:02	ThatOneDeia	AITA for telling my teammate that she'snuseless?	"Sorry for format and any mistakes, I'm on mobile and English is not my first language.

For context, me and 4 another girls are in a group for gym class and we were asked to choreograph a dance this term. I did around 70% of the work with other two girls. We had planned to train and invent the last missing steps last Thursday morning.

That Thursday, one of them, she didn't show up and when she did, it was already class time and so, we didn't practice.

Today we had an obligatory ""charity"" event and I just happened to be next to her, so I greated her and she asked me:

(Paraphrasing) ""What are we going to do about that dance thingy?""

And I told her that it still wasn't finished because she didn't show up on Thursday.

(Paraphrasing again) ""And why didn't you finish it? I didn't have to be there for us to finish it.""

I told her that we needed everyone there to make sure we all agreed on what to do and asked her if she had any ideas for steps. She said no and I said I didn't either. She scoffed and said that at that rate we wouldn't be able to finish it in time.

Well, that made me pissed because she was one of the people who didn't help with anything and I told her that she had to come up with stuff or else we wouldn't be able to finish. That also made her mad and she started shouting:

(Paraphrasing yet again) ""If you don't work to come up with things, I won't either! Why should I work when you aren't?!""

That comment made my blood boil because, as I mentioned in the context section, I did 70% of the work! So I screamed back at her:

(Paraphrasing once more) ""I did all the work and you didn't do anything! How is it unfair for you to do ONE step when I did everything else?!""

And she answered:

""You didn't do it all and I did work!"" She worked on practicing, not choreographing, the only thing we needed everyone there for because our steps didn't interwine us.

At that moment, I just crossed my arms and told her that no, she said work. And she said back that she didn't want to participate anymore, even though our steps were made for 5 people. And I, nervous and angry screamed at her about how none of that changed anything because she was useless anyway and we didn't need her to do our dance.

By that time, the ""charity event"" had already ended and we walked to class avoiding each other. I told my other teammates that she didn't want to participate anymore and she huffed and commented to no one in particular that it was my fault and that my tone of voice was too aggressive. (That it is, I've always had a problem with that).

Some of our classmates heard her and after our next class ended, so during lunch time, they stopped me and had me explain the situation. I did and they told me I'm The Asshole, but I was just honest with someone unwilling to work (at least as I see it). And I've also already apologized for my tone of voice.

So, this happened over the course of a week, culminating to what happened on Friday night. My friend, let's call him Friend1, was invited to my other friend's, let's call him Friend2, 18th birthday party. A groupchat was made, everything was organised, but Friend2 was making some jokes about how he was going to ruin the party, and added people to the groupchat who weren't supposed to be there. So, Friend2 made up an elaborate lie about how the party was cancelled and nobody could go anymore. Friend2 actually made a second group chat without Friend2 in it. I lied to Friend1 about the party being off, and went without him. He showed up to the party, but wasn't let in.

Friend2 and Friend1 used to be very close, only last year, but they've drifted apart for whatever reason. They're both some of my best friends, and now they won't talk to eachother at all, and, Friend1 is avoiding me completely saying he's disgusted by my behaviour. Am I the Asshole?

"So I like to hang out with my friends a lot during the weekend, since there isn't much to do in the house that doesn't bore me quickly. With my friends, I get to do things that are more fun in a group, like play Bakugan Battle Planet, Yu-Gi-Oh, or Smash Bros. Though sometimes whenever I want to have friends over, my mom says no. Sometimes it's understandable, like if she needed to clean the house or if we were already doing something. But one time (a few weeks ago), when my mom said no, she let my BROTHER have friends over. When I asked my mom why I can't have friends over but my brother can, she said 1 ""hang out with them every weekend/to much"", which I think is complete bullshit, and now we have had this exact same problem today, where apparently I can't have friends over cause I hang out with them to much.

bw9tyj	2019-06-03 11:58:46	6wooforange	AITA for refusing to speak to my brother	"So my brother is 33 and I am 28. He always been a bit mean to me so it’s a running ‘joke’ when I say “my brother” as everyone asks if I’m talking about the nice the one. 

He tells me he loves me and I’m his favourite sister (only sister) when he’s drunk. 

Christmas and new year when all my family get together he makes digs at me constantly. I try to let it slide but most of the time I have to leave the room because I don’t want to be seen upset. 

We frequent the same pub and when he walks in he will say hello to everybody and ignore me. This is another running ‘joke’. Literally say hi to the people either side of me and nothing to me until he speaks to my boyfriend. 

Anyway. My friend and I recently went to the pub for her birthday. Walked in and he shouted “look at this pair of dykes walking in” the whole place went silent. It was a ground swallow me up moment. My friend and I are straight, but that’s not the issue it was the making us feel so small that I hated. He never normally says anything so why he felt the need to I have no idea. Anyway it pretty much ruined the atmosphere for us and after about an hour my mate wanted to leave. 

The next morning he apologised in a text when I said you’re only doing that because your wife has told you to and he said it does t matter if he’s been told to he’s done it. I go to pick up my boyfriend that evening from the pub and my brother says “I’ve apologised take it or leave it but what do you expect coming in here looking like that” (with a few swear words for good measure). I told him I didn’t want to speak to him and left. My boyfriend came out and got in the car and I just broke down. Literally wailing asking what do I have to do to make him respect and like me. My boyfriend is friends with him and all he could really say was he’s always been a dick, he isn’t going to change. 

So I’ve decided to stop bothering. I’m civil in the sense that we had a family gathering and I said hello and sat at the other end of the table to him.  I no longer look for him when I go in the pub, I don’t bother replying to his messages which are only related to my job because he wants a discount and this morning I replied with a competitors details and told him to speak to them for a price. 

My boyfriend has since told me I’m over reacting. So AITA?

Edit - My sister in law told him to apologise cos she was in the pub when he shouted at my friend and me and said that it wasn’t nice of him. 

I’m in England and I’m not sure if my boyfriend and brother being friends would be the correct word. They’re pub friends. So they don’t have each other’s phone numbers but they drink beer play pool and talk about football at the weekends. Pub friends is genuinely a thing in my local pub."

I bought the parts and went onto the app and submitted the job to the 3 recommendations that came up. One gentleman got back to me and said he could come on Saturday at 10am.  This was on Wednesday that we communicated. He sent me a note and asked my address on Thursday and I didn't hear anything else. I had to make a couple of appointments for Saturday, so I made them super early so I could have them out of the way and be done by 10am. Friday at 3pm I hadn't heard anything else from him, so I sent a message to confirm he would be there at 10am Saturday. At 7:35pm he sent me a message saying he had to cancel as he needed to bring his car in - it was having problems. He didn't apologize and didn't offer another time he could come out and do the work. I got the feeling he cancelled because it was a bit of a hike and maybe not worth it to him. (Just my gut).  WIBTA for leaving a review mentioning the last minute cancellation? I rely heavily on reviews myself for hiring people and making purchases. I would want to know that this guy had bailed at the last minute. I wouldn't add any of my gut feelings etc. Just the facts. He cancelled the night before and didn't offer to reschedule so I was left starting the whole process over. I don't want to mess with someone's livelihood and am not sure if I should just let it go.

bw9q1d	2019-06-03 11:45:26		AITA for not immediately clearing out a room in house where I don’t pay rent?	"Currently a third year uni (22m) student. The summer before 1st year, my parents moved to the Middle East from London, and I’d fly out to visit them in the holidays. As a result, some very close family friends said that I could come and stay with them in London whenever I wanted for as long as I liked - rent free (I offered, but they wouldn’t hear of it). I usually stay with them for a few days every holiday so I have the chance to catch up with school friends. 

Last week I finished my placement in Austria and was staying with them for a week before flying out to my family. The bed in their guest bedroom had broken so they said that I could have their older son’s (W) bedroom (a friend of mine) as he’d still be at uni for another few weeks. So, I moved my stuff up to his room. 

A couple days later I was with some friends in central London for a night out when I get a message from W saying that he was back and I had to come back right now and move my stuff from his room because he was home for a surprise visit. I said no, it’d take me at least an hour to get home, but of course he’s welcome to his room. I asked W if he could leave a pillow and a blanket out in the living room because their sofa could convert into a bed. He replied saying that he wasn’t my servant, and called me a fucking freeloader who’d be homeless without his parents so I was lucky he didn’t chuck my stuff out of the window and I had to clear my mess immediately. While probably accurate, I told him that it was hurtful and turned my phone off for the evening. 

I’m not sure what mess he was referring to - as it’s not my house all my clothes stayed in the suitcase, apart from stuff like chargers. My laptop was on his desk, though I feel that’s reasonable. The next day we argued saying that I probably owed his parents hundreds of pounds in rent (probably true, had they charged me) and that I was a guest and I was a complete arsehole for staying for free and any decent person would have paid. 

In my defence I always offered to pay but I was shut down by his parents whose house it is. I also try to show my appreciation however I could - W’s younger brother was struggling in German so I tutored him twice a week for free. From Austria I got all four of the family souvenirs. Finally, W’s dad travels a lot for business to the city my parents moved to so he always stays with my family - which everyone enjoys as he’s great friends with my parents and he doesn’t have to pay for a hire. However, I stay with W’s family more often than his dad does with mine."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My wife suggested to me to start teaching our oldest how to bicycle some time ago (yes I could've come up with that idea myself, but truth be told she was first to suggest). Two weeks ago we tried first but our child refused because he said he was scared. 2nd try he refused again because he had much more fun stuff on his mind, 3rd try we skipped because we changed plans.

Yesterday I come home and my wife tells me my son has something to show me. We go outside and he just rides off, pretty smoothly. My wife half-understands that was not how it was supposed to go and apologetically says ""I just wanted to get him used to the helmet and the bike, and next thing he just starts cycling. I didn't expect that. But I have it all on tape"". In any case, he showcases his skills some more, but I'm just really angry&upset for missing this life event (it's a big father-son thing in my opinion; I live in a country where everyone teaches their kids how to cycle). I have a hard time being happy for his accomplishments at that moment. I’ve never seen him more proud and try to keep up a good smile. Back inside I watch the video and it does seem she had to rush for the camera.

I ask her why she didn't call me upfront and discuss her plans, and I tell her I am very upset/angry. She tells me I shouldn't be angry and that I should be proud of my son. I tell her I want to continue the conversation after the kids are in bed.

I bring the kids to bed and come back. She says something to which I reply I really don't want to talk right now. She tells me she's really not looking forward to spending the evening with a grumpy person, so I should lighten up or leave. This touches a nerve and I yell at her (from 10ft away) how unbelievable I think it is she doesn't get it. Out of spite she yells at me that if I wanted to see my son learning how to cycle I should spend more time at home. This infuriates me, I slam the dishwasher (30ft away from her), which makes a lot of noise, confront her about what a spiteful thing it is to say (I work fulltime making a lot more, she parttime, its a regular discussion) and start leaving. She realizes the comment was off and says 'I shouldn't have said that, but'. I leave, slamming the door,not before telling her she should ask anyone with an IQ over 50 whether or not I am entitled to be angry. She yells I should pack my bags (a hollow phrase that she has said a handful of times before).

I take a long walk and come back, after which she asks me to explain myself, to which I tell her I don't understand her attitude at all. She tells me to sleep in another room and I tell her ‘no’.

I seriously regret making a lot of noise at the start of the evening with the kids in bed. I don't think they could hear what we said, but our oldest probably heard us having an argument.

I (M32) am in the middle of a divorce with my soon to be ex-wife(F31) after 9 years together.  
We have two kids, both age 6½, together and she left me this winter during the holidays after a 6 month long affair with another man, she moved out of our house in late January. I knew about the affair as it progressed during fall but she continued to lie about it throughout the entire process (therapy etc etc). The kids don't know anything about the affair as of yet.  


Now to my dilemma, my STBXW and her ""affair partner"" continued to date after she moved out and they are now planning on introducing him to the kid as her new partner. She has basically asked me to say nice stuff about him so that the kids will like him, to which I refuse. I have no intention of ever slandering her in front of the kids, since I don't want them to have a bad relationship with their mother, but I claim that it is really pushing the limits when asking me to talk him up, seeing as I hate the guy who helped destroy my marriage.

So, I recently started a full time job and was very happy that my roster gives me Sunday and Monday off. This is because while it’s nice to have weekend days off, having time off during the week with the house to myself has been really important for my mental health, so I was really looking forward to knowing at least most Mondays I could expect to just unwind and relax.

I can’t unwind and relax when my mum is home because she is very unpredictable and unstable. Even if she is not directly angry at me and yelling at me she’s slamming doors and huffing and making sure everyone knows she’s in a bad mood. It’s really hard to relax like that. For me, especially being mentally ill, doubling my work hours is quite stressful and honestly I easily get set off by my mum. There’s just a lot of tension and fighting. 

Anyways, a couple days after I announced my new job and hours she decided she’ll start taking Mondays off. This felt so awful. I’ll barely have any time which isn’t either at work or at home with her, both being incredibly high pressure environments. 

I gently asked why not take Fridays off instead and she just said something about wanting a longer weekend (??). I know its selfish to ask she change her schedule to suit me better but she’s said before she doesn’t like living with me either she just keeps doing things like this so she has an excuse to fight and get angry. 

Would I be the asshole if I asked her to change her day off? I keep flipping between “of course that’s reasonable” and “that’s unfair and selfish”. I know this seems silly but I’m really worried about all of this. TIA"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So I have ADHD-C which was undiagnosed for 18 years, (the reason it wasn’t, and who was to blame I already asked in another question here.) 

The parents seem to blame me for making their life and marriage hell through my tantrums and anger issues that they say “have worn them down”. I totally agree I wasn’t the easiest. ADHD provides mood instability that is closely alike to Bi-Polar but the two are distinct conditions.

But I don’t feel responsible for the outbursts, I just feel really guilty and upset that it happened. But the parents treat me like I actively and intently wanted to upset and anger them since I started showing symptoms.

I lashed out on them recently because I blamed them for being ignorant about thinking if they don’t acknowledge it will go away. They would say “if you had known about it you would have just used it as an excuse the entire time”. They actively refused to accept it because they thought it would use it as a crutch , just to let me suffer! After lashing out, my dad says he holds contempt for me blaming him, and my mom says she’ll never forget I blamed her.

My sister is out to most people but told me that she's waiting till she moves into her flat in 3 months to tell my parents so she doesn't have to face daily judgement. 

So basically she gets away with having her girlfriend stay over under the lie that they're just friends whereas I cannot have my girlfriend of 6 months over. I told her it's unfair and that she should not have girls over if she's gay. 

My parents went away for 1 week and I had my girlfriend over. My parents came back early and saw my girlfriend leaving and they laid into me. They told me that I was grounded and took my phone and interogated me as to what we did together. 
I was hit with this blind rage and told them that it's not fair that they allow my sister to have girls over, they were confused and I blurted out that she's gay and sleeping with the girl but they let her do that but I'm not even allowed to have my girlfriend round at all. 

My mother started crying, my dad began shouting. They waited for my sister to get home and sent me upstairs. I heard my dad shouting at her and then my sister stormed upstairs crying and packed her stuff. She admitted to being gay when confronted and as a result they told her to chose between ""getting help"" and staying at home or leaving. So she left. My parents told her she is no longer their daughter. 

My sister confronted me for telling them and said one day I'd understand when I'm older how wrong what I did was and that she wishes I'd just spoken to her. She cried and left. 

My older brother came over yesterday and found out. He took me aside and said what I did was really unfair and that I acted like an ass. He said I should've let my sister choose when to tell them. 
AITA?

**TL;DR** my sister is gay. I got caught with my girlfriend in the house, got grounded so told my parents my sister is gay and has been having her girlfriend round. Parents kicked her out."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bw9lc4	2019-06-03 11:29:16		AITA for refusing to take part in my brother's wedding	"Sorry about the clickbaity title, but there's too much nuance to fit in there.

I'm 30m, and my brother is 29. He's been with his girlfriend for a bit under 5 months, and they recently got engaged to be married in early July (on their 6 month anniversary). The reasons I have a problem with this are many.

First - I'm getting married in mid July. I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years, engaged for a year. I also listened to bullshit about gay people my whole life and we finally got to a point where the people that matter to us accept us and we're going to have a big gay ass wedding to celebrate.

Second - my brother has known his fiancee for less than 5 months. She just dropped out of university (she's 21 btw), has no job, no work experience, no place to live, nothing.

Third - they're in a hurry to get married because she's pregnant, and I'm the only one who knows this. Both of our families are very religious, and he said that her parents would ""fucking kill her"" if they found out. So they're in a rush because their plan is to pretend she only got pregnant after the wedding. Which is idiotic in itself (she'll be 3 months pregnant by the time they marry), but alright.

When they told us about the engagement, I got upset at the fact that they will be getting married one week before me, which will heavily influence who comes to which wedding. I already got calls from several people telling me they can't afford to go to two wedding or travel twice so little apart, so they'll only go to the first one. We had an argument about the date in front of our parents, and nobody except my fiance and myself thinks this is a problem. My brother used some bullshit excuse of ""we're soooo in love"" to justify why they're marrying so soon, even though he admitted to me they were marrying because she's pregnant.

My brother then asked me to be his best man and I said I wouldn't even come to his wedding, let alone be his best man. Everyone flipped out on me (parents, grandparents, several cousins, even his fiancee's parents had an opinion about it) and my fiance is the only person on my side. Here's why I think I'm still in the right despite everyone disagreeing: Sure, he can put his girlfriend/fiancee before me, I don't care, my fiance is the most important person to me, so it'd be hypocritical of me to demand otherwise from my brother. HOWEVER, all of this bullshit about her parents killing her for being pregnant before the wedding is just too much. If he puts THAT before me, then he can go fuck himself.

bw9i8k	2019-06-03 11:18:42	Momusu112	AITA for not wanting to stay over at my mother's place	"Background info.

I'm 17m, I have ADHD, I absolutely despise tabacco products and at around age 3/4 my parents divorced. It wasn't a 'bad' divorce, for a lack of better words. They stayed in touch and thought of my younger brother and I first. Not long after the divorce, my mother got a new boyfriend. Alot longer after that, my father got a new girlfriend. 

Me and my step-father got along fine, but I didn't enjoy his rougher play (I can say with confidence that it was not abuse). I told him this and he stopped playing with me, entirely. He still continued to play with my younger brother though.

My mom and I also got along fine, but at an early age, she dismissed things I wanted after asking me about it. Example: my little brother had recently moved out of our room (we shared a bunk bed) so the lower bed was now free. I loved to play on it with my toys. 

One day, my mom asks me if I want the bed gone, telling me things like ""the room would be bigger"". But I liked it the way it was and she said ok. The next day it was gone. She also forced me to have a haircut that I didn't like and untill I was old enough to decide myself, I had a haircut that was way too short. 

And the last example is when we decorated 'my' room. I like it when my walls have a single color. Just white, boring maybe, but it's the way I like it. My mother kept hounding me that she wanted something different, but my step-father told her if I wanted it white, it would be white. But he did what my mother wanted. When I confronted him about it, I told him this specifically (translated to english though) ""I would like the wall to be white, because right now all I can think of when I see it is 'We don't listen, mom and dad'

He told me that they don't have to listen, that it wasn't my room but the guest room, despite my mother telling me otherwise. And if she wanted it a certain way, it would be that way. He also told me I was very rude and asked me of I talked to my father that way (I talk very casually with my father and he is completely fine with it.)

Also on numerous occasions he tells me that if I want to be in 'my' room all the time, that it's ok. But I'm not, I'm doing my best reaching out to them in order to stay a family, while he spends all his time either in the shed smoking, or away from home.

Also a long time ago, they promised me that they would not smoke inside the house, only in the shed. But not too long ago, they started smoking inside. When I told them about the promise, they said they said no such thing. Later he even told me that if they want to smoke, they'll smoke, despite knowing how horrid it smells to me. And since they smoke inside now, the entire living room, kitchen and hallway stink of smoke. I told my mom it made me not hungry and she said that its not possible.

Hell, my step-father and I had a fight not too long ago and she was trying to comfort me while smoking.

The smell and the way they act is making me wanna stay in 'my' room and not come out.

Am I the Asshole for wanting out of this?

I share an apartment with a super annoying and messy roomate. Among all the annoying things she does (not cleaning, loud music, inviting people over without telling me), the thing that upsets me the most its the fact that every single time she goes into the bathroom she takes between 20-30 minutes. And when she showers around 60 min.
 
No, she is not doing drugs, she just likes to seat in the fucking toilet with her phone.

Sometimes I want to use the bathroom and it’s super frustrating to have to wait that long until she finally comes out. 
But sometimes I don’t want to use the bathroom and it upsets me anyway to see her stuck in the toilet for so long!!! It’s a share accomodation, she needs to be more considerate.

bw9ejr	2019-06-03 11:06:11		WIBTA if I confront my cousin (who I’m not close with) about her poor choices?	"So let’s try and keep it brief. 

None of my family is really ‘close’. We see each other a few times a year. Namely Thanksgiving and Christmas and maybe at a few birthday dinners throughout the year. 

Let’s call this cousin A. A has always been a sweet girl but just makes poor choices. I think the past few years she’s been really depressed and her mom and dad (my uncle and aunt) had a nasty divorce recently. 

So basically, she’s never had a serious ‘boyfriend’ and I believe she’s the type to be bothered by this as she sees the rest of the family with significant others that they’ve been with for years+ now. 



So here’s the drama. Apparently she met some guy in the military who’s half way across the country. This next part is important. She’s a) only known him for less than 2 months. And B) never physically seen him in person. 

So a week ago apparently she told my grandmother (who helps her financially) that such and such won’t matter in 2 months because she’ll be married come end of July. 

My grandmother proceeded to shit her pants (Not literally). 


I know people in the military make more money (I think like $10k base) for being married and I believe he’s suckering her into marriage with the promise of steady income or paying her bills idk. 

Like I said we aren’t close but a) it’s creepy to me for a guy to essentially propose to someone over the phone let alone to someone you’ve never seen in person before. 
It’s just not right. 


So WIBTA if I stick my nose in her business and ask her what the fuck she’s thinking?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bw9bha	2019-06-03 10:55:39		AITA for telling my friend that I don’t want unsolicited advice on how to take care of my kitten?	"*Backstory: I’m about to be a first time cat parent. My friend (H) has had cats their entire life. H‘s cats are mainly outdoors cats and their bond isn’t particularly close - it’s more or less a co-existence. H has said this as well.*

Onto the story: I’ve recently purchased cat essentials, anything from cat trees to food/water dishes. I made sure to get everything of high quality, so the cat will feel happy and comfy. 

H came over to visit and we wound up talking about my new kitten, who will be joining the family in a few weeks time. I mentioned my recent purchases and being excited about them arriving, so I can start prepping my house. 

H claimed it’s questionable that what I deem to be cat essentials are *really* 'essentials'. H elaborated that they don’t have cat trees, and that they’re not important and just a way for the pet industry to make money. 

My cat will be an indoor cat, with an exception of him being outside on a leash. (my neighborhood isn’t safe for cats due to foxes and the breed is recommended as an indoors cat) - I told my friend that I wanted as much enrichment as possible and for everything to be perfect. 

H then went on a rant: First off, why did I buy a cat from a breeder if I cared so much? I could have just adopted a cat in need. Second off, apparently I was being arrogant and implying that H doesn’t take sufficient care of their cats and should apologize. By saying that things should be perfect at my place, I was apparently telling them that things weren’t perfect at *their* place. 

I can be a bit of a people pleaser and normally just apologize to avoid conflict (working on it with my therapist though!), but these comments were completely uncalled for - I never criticized how H keeps their cats, even if I personally disagree with it. 

I told H that I getting a cat from a breeder was not a choice I needed to defend. Adoption is great and I would consider it for my second cat, but not as a new cat owner. Aside from that, H constantly pushes his cats off surfaces roughly, H‘s cats scratch and bite and they don’t have a close bond. H doesn’t provide enough stimulation indoors and that’s their choice, I’ve never commented on it, but it’s the truth. H does suck imo for not providing a cat tree out of spite (money or space isn’t an issue to H and you could DIY one really cheap). I want to have a close bond with my cat, and H is *not* someone I would ask for advice.

The whole thing ended in a bit of a fight and H left my house. It was the first time in our friendship that I was confrontational and H seemed really mad when they left - so that’s what brought me here.

bw98bq	2019-06-03 10:43:53		AITA? I bought my ex-boyfriend expensive tickets to see his favourite stand up comedian as a gift and he gave away his ticket to a friend. I asked the friend to pay me for the ticket he used.	"My ex-boyfriend’s dream is to become a stand up comedian. For the past two months, he’s been preparing for a stand up comedy competition. 

Although we decided to completely stop seeing each other, on the first competition day, he turns up on my doorstep after his gig because he's sad and says he feels being with me is his “safe space” where he can be vulnerable. On the 2nd day he's happy with his performance and also turns up. On the 3rd day, he loses. He's devastated and comes over. I make him his favorite food and gift him a ticket to see Louis CK, his favourite comedian, perform. 

3 days later something bad happens to me. I ask him if we can meet to talk. He says that he doesn’t have the space in his life to do that. Eventually he ends up at my apartment after I offer him some weed in exchange. 5 mins into the conversation, my drunk flatmate barges in. He talks about his problems for 2 hrs. My ex stays and gives him a lot of advice and support. 

When my flatmate leaves the house to go buy more beer, my ex decides to leave. I’m feeling pretty sad when I realize he isn't gonna reciprocate the same friendship he expected from me, so I cry. He gets angry & blocks me on all social media for making him feel bad by crying.

The next weekend I receive an email from him saying he’s away and won’t be going to the Louis CK gig. On the day of the gig he sees that I didn't sell the tickets and sends me an email accusing me of being selfish for not selling my tickets for the sold out event. An hour before the gig, he emails to say he gave his ticket to a friend.

I arrive and just before the show starts- my ex sits next to me. He is drunk. I’m not keen on speaking to him, so he starts to publicly mock me. He explains that he gave the ticket I gave him to his friend and bought himself an additional ticket to the show so that he (my ex) wouldn’t have to receive my present. 

After the show I couldn't find his friend, so I ask my ex if I could approach his friend to ask that he pay me for the ticket he used. He says ok and tells me to specifically ask for “the comedian” at the bar where his friend words, as his friend also did stand up comedy. 

The next day the friend posts an Instagram story about how he scored a free Louis CK ticket. I reply to his story with a friendly “haha sorry dude, it wasn’t free 😝 I bought those tickets, wanted to talk after the show but didn't find you so just let me know when you can pay me back”.  

Minutes later my ex contacts me. He’s livid that I contacted his friend and accuses me of getting his friend involved in our relationship drama. He denies telling me his friend will take the ticket (even when confronted with his own email). He denies telling me to “ask for the comedian” at the guy’s bar. He calls me a liar and crazy. He alleges I made the whole thing up in my head.

Am I the asshole here? 

N.B: It’s obvious he’s an asshole. My question is, have I also been an asshole for messaging his friend for the money?"	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bw97w9	2019-06-03 10:42:24	sexypolarbear22	WIBTA for telling my friend he is just needlessly pretending to be a victim?	"So a few weeks ago, my friends Michael and Josh were hanging out with Michael's gf and her friend, Alice at her house since she was having a bad day. I'm a little fuzzy with the details of what happened but **according to Josh:**

Alice and Josh made out, Josh was blackout drunk and he could only remember making out with her.

**According to Michael:**

Josh initiated the encounter between him and Alice, Alice and Josh were both completely drunk, and Josh asked Michael for condoms, however, Michael refused to give him any, Michael and his GF left the room, and  Josh fell asleep shortly after.

&#x200B;

After this encounter, Michael and Josh just stopped being friends altogether (for other reasons excluding this scenario), Michael told me his side of the story. I asked Josh for his side a few days ago, and told him my understanding of the situation. He became very upset and said he felt violated since he was drunk, Michael was encouraging him, and that it was on the level of r\*\*\*. We ended the conversation there because he became very upset.

However, I feel as though he is overreacting. I think he's being insulting to r\*\*\* victims by saying that what happened to him is on such a level. He only made out with Alice and they were both drunk. At worst, what happened was a silly mistake. Josh is a good friend to hang out with, but I find that when talking to him about anything serious, he becomes overly-dramatic and prescribes problems that are completely non-existent. Examples are when we are driving home from a social event, he will say things like ""Man, everyone there is completely depressed and fucked in the head."" ""They're only going there due to social pressure."" ""None of those people at the party enjoyed themselves, they're just drinking because they're depressed."" I want to tell him that he is just overreacting and victimizing himself for attention, but I know he will overreact and turn into a child.  Would I be the asshole if I told him this?  

&#x200B;

P.S sorry for being so hyperbolic, Michael and Josh's reactions to this encounter has been plaguing our social group for the last few weeks, I'm fine if they stop being friends, I just wish Josh and Michael weren't so awkward about things.

bw97nd	2019-06-03 10:41:27	nataszmata	AITA for not letting my dad and his friends stay at my apartment?	" 

Hey everyone, let's start with a little backstory to my current dilemma.

My dad (67M) has 4 children (38M, 37F, 25F, 13F). The two oldest are from his first marriage, and he was with them all through their childhood and through university. My mom raised me (25F) as a single mom, after my dad started a new relationship (with the mother of his youngest) shortly after my birth. We lived in a different country than my dad, so I saw him about biyearly, until I moved to his country 7 years ago. Since then, I've seen him about 4 times a year. Usually it's when he calls me up and tells me he is in my city for his youngest's swim meets, so we meet up at the pool and chat for about 30 minutes.

A few weeks ago, he calls me up and tells me there is a big swim meet in my city during the first weekend of July. He asked me if I could move out of my (small, 1 bed, 1 pullout couch) apartment (which I own) for that weekend so he, his wife, and their friends could stay there and save money on the hotel. I was really surprised and not really thinking things through since I am generally a people pleaser, and agreed to move out for the weekend.

Well, it turns out I don't really have anywhere to go for that weekend, and I wasn't planning on taking a vacation somewhere for that specific weekend either. I have a 130lb dog who I also have to take into account when travelling so it's not easy finding dog-friendly places to stay. I figured I'd just take a roadtrip somewhere UNTIL this past weekend when I saw my dad at one of these swim meets. He started telling my boyfriend and I about where he's travelled to in the past month, and also how much things in swimming cost, like a special speed suit can be up to $600 for the 13 year old and has to be replaced every 6 months because of stretching.

This kind of got me thinking, if he can fund this sport for his daughter and travel so much, why can't he afford a hotel for a weekend and has to use my apartment? I don't want to make this tit for tat but I never asked for and never got anything from him (didn't pay child support for me) so why should I switch my plans around and pay for my own trip for that weekend? He never invites me to his place because his wife has some unresolved resentment towards my existence, I was never and am not a big part of his life, so why shouldn't I go back on my word and make him find other accommodation?

My boyfriend thinks I am NTA here if I do change my mind, but I keep going back and forth on it because it is a little too close to the date (1 month out) to find a hotel, and I would most definitely be the asshole in his friends' and wife's mind as well because I didn't leave, so their kids couldn't be in the swim competition.

One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together. About a month later my bf and I wanted to try again so I ended things with the other boy

Around March this year, the other boy continuously messaged me on snapchat trying to convince me to cheat on my bf and I deleted him and haven’t even thought about him since. Yesterday I got a random Instagram follow from a girl and when I looked at her profile realised she was dating this guy.... for almost 2 years. I thought that maybe they had been on a break at the time but looking through her photos, she hadn’t deleted any from before then which is usually expected if you break up. So I messaged her asking if they were together between June and August last year, she said yeah. I confirmed it was the same and basically told her that we had slept together and he had been messaging me etc and I explained that I had no idea they were together until she followed me

I then didn’t get a response from her and she blocked me and my housemates that I tag a lot in my posts. The guy also blocked me.

"My MIL has made a small ""family quilt"" for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). The quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. I was really looking forward to getting ours because I admit I'm a bit of a hipster and I love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home.

She recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. I asked my SIL (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. I was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.

I message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little ""break"" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.

I ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. I tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says ""I'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs"" verbatim. I hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side.

But now I got a really mean voice message from my SIL telling me that I crossed the line and am acting like a huge B\*tch for no reason. I'm shocked because I have a great relationship with my SIL and she always defended me from other family bullshit. My husband wants no part in this now. AITA for what I said to my MIL?"

It wasn’t always fine and dandy whilst in the relationship it’s safe to say I know a few confirmed times where she had cheated, at the time this was devastating to me but I’m over it now and I’m happy. 

Last year in June she went to go visit family in France and she took my son, I was a college student at the time so money was tight, I did jobs here and there but I’d never accumulated enough income for my self to actually buy anything decent, it all went to my son, to her and putting petrol in my car, I wanted to earn some more cash so I decided to give my friends lifts every Friday and Saturday pick up and take back, as they’d be drunk so they can’t drive and I didn’t really drink at the time so I didn’t care. 

I managed to save up £400, it wasn’t actually going towards anything special it was just there incase I ever needed it any how It was time for my girlfriend to go on holiday and she has no money to take. She never asked for it but I offered it her as long as she would pay me back when she could, she said sure and even gave me a date which was October 2018 I had no issue with this as I seen us I as a family unit at the time and I’d feel like an arsehole if I didn’t give her some spends. 

She’s was in France for a week at this point and she messages me wanting to break up, I’m like oh okay, I wasn’t really taking it seriously as I thought she’d talk to me when she’s at home and make up what ever ... we never actually did talk when she got back, there was no communication no reason was given. Her mum spilled the beans and told me she met someone there, who I actually knew about for sometime as they had been talking for a while but I didn’t suspect anything because she said it was her cousin... pretty weird. (This is probably why wasn’t invited)

Fast forward a few months of crippling depression I’ve still not got my cash back, I’ve asked her for it back recently and she slams me with “what about child maintenance”. Imagine my shock. She’s blanked my request of asking for my money back, I was pretty livid I’d be more that understanding if our relationship was on good terms and her finical situation was in the shitter but that’s not the case.

I know she gets roughly around £600 a month for child benefits, I know she has some money left from a will that her grandfather left her, she has a new boyfriend if I know my ex girlfriend and I know her well he is literally paying for everything, she doesn’t pay rent and my son is in nursery for free. Me personally thinks she should find a job but that’s not my decision.  

I dunno reddit i feel like she can pay me back in increments, but it’s just not happening I feel a bit like a dick because she has my son to look after

bw92rv	2019-06-03 10:22:43	gourmet_slut23	WIBTA if i leave an internshipe after only 2 days because of their inability to commit to the working hours?	I just got a 1 month internshipe (unpaid) and its quite far distance from my home but I really wanted to get experience so i accepted i went on the first day and i noticed a general vibes of unprofessionalism but I though it's just in my head. So today I'm supposed to be there before 12 pm and I'm there at 11:30 am but there is literally no one at the company. I'm upset because I invested so much time, effort and money and the whole company can't commit to opening hours. So i left and decided that I'm not suited for this internship. A friend told me that by leaving after only one day I'm not committing to my word and giving up too easy.	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bw924v	2019-06-03 10:20:05	MedicMoth	AITA for wanting to hear about group events despite often declining?	"I'm a pretty introverted person and not too big on group events. I tend to get anxious and stressed out when there's more than 2 other people in a strictly social situation, but am otherwise totally fine with crowds, public speaking, etc.

I've expressed this to my friends, saying that I like to hear about open-invite group events when they happen and it makes me feel like I'm still be included, but I likely won't make most of them thanks to the anxiety stuff. Some of my friends say that it isn't fair for me to want their attention all to myself and that I need to make an effort to fit in with the group more or I shouldn't expect an invite. I don't think it's selfish to prefer more personal 1v1 hangouts, and if the events are open-invite anyway it feels like a specific exclusion to not mention them. (If you hear about an event, you're invited, and my only channel of hearing about them is these friends.) 

When my friends come back from these parties and talk about them to me, I'm often hurt that I didn't hear about them and feel like I missed out, but my friends reason I wouldn't go anyway so why bother asking... it feels like an excuse to me, and that they just don't want me there at all.

bw8yzr	2019-06-03 10:07:59	Watermelon_Waifu	AITA for getting angry when people touch or even use my things without permission?	"So I don't get annoyed that easily, but one thing that really ticks me off is when anybody uses or touches my things without me allowing them to. When I got my first Copic Markers and took them to school, my classmates began picking them up or even testing them without me allowing them to. They usually did it when I wasn't looking or some of them did it even when I was simply staring at them, not sure how to react. I was mostly annoyed by the fact that I spent a lot of money on them and they were just using them, but, when telling them nicely not to touch them anymore didn't work, I just snapped and raised my voice and that finally did it. 
Thing is I'm not okay with even my friends touching my stuff without my permission. Like sure, if we're using each other's stuff for, say, drawing or something, they're free to use whatever they want. Even if they randomly pick up my pens or stuff like that, it's totally fine. But if they decide to use the things I spent a lot of money on, I get kind of annoyed and nicely ask them to stop. A few times though they didn't listen and I got really annoyed, which I felt horrible about afterwards. 
I mean, I always let people use my stuff if they ask nicely, even my expensive stuff if I trust them and they let me use their stuff in return, but when they don't, I get extremely annoyed and lose my temper. 
My mother doesn't really know boundaries which makes me extremely uncomfortable, and that may be why people not respecting my boundaries ticks me off so badly. 
I decided to post this today because I just bought a lipstick my mother initially didn't want me to buy and I spent a lot of money on it because I really liked the color. Though it isn't a lot and I can't really afford to replace it constantly, thus deciding to not really let people use it if I want it to last. 
My mother, on the other side, has a crap ton of lipsticks and makeup and this morning she decided she wanted to test it (aka see if the color looks good on her and keep on using it). I told her nicely that I'd rather not let her since it's so little and she didn't even want me to but it in the first place, but she took it anyway, despite all my protests. She even called me rude and weird for getting annoyed at that."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

bw8vsk	2019-06-03 09:55:10		AITA for thinking my bf is gay?	"He is effeminate in ways. He went to school for screenwriting. Had many artsy friends who were in theatre in college. His Instagram name had “queen” in it and he enjoys musicals and many other artsy things. 

Anyways, I have dated him on and off and have left him twice for him not seeming as interested in me as I thought I was into him. For example, he would play his video games when I came over instead of chilling or basically just seemed not into my conversations. He also didn’t text back often and didn’t ask me much about my life. He also had trouble cumming with me mainly because he was drunk often, so I didn’t like that either. 

So we tried to become friends recently and ended up fucking and now he thinks we are dating and calls me babe and says he is dating a really cool girl. He now brings me food to work, has awesome sex with me (tells me it’s the best he has ever had), tells me he thinks of me almost every time he masturbates, kisses me, texts me often, changes things I tell him I don’t like immediately, makes plans to take me to events with him, and tells me he would do anything for me. 

So the other night I go to his bathroom and see a poop that looks bloody. He left it in his bathroom and didn’t flush and I’m a nurse and thought that looks like some poop I’ve seen from patients with anal trauma from sex. So, I asked him about it. I asked if he’s ever done anything sexual with a man (he said his parents ask him if he’s gay) and he said no, he felt bad saying it but he thought it was pretty gross. I asked a few more things about butt sex and sexuality and he denied it all. I told him medically he is fine and nothing is wrong except his poop looked like poop I’ve seen before in patients who have had something in their rectum. He flipped out thinking something is wrong then closed his eyes (it was five am and he was kind of drunk). He was so worried cause I said out loud “wow that’s some ugly bloody poop”. I reassured him there’s many many types of bloody poop and his didn’t look like serious. He has health anxiety (yet doesn’t workout or eat healthy and smokes and drinks) and I didn’t know how serious it was. 

I felt nauseous because of my acid reflux and went to leave like thirty minutes later and told him why I was leaving. He assumed it’s because the poop I saw and started to tear up and cry and said he hoped I wasn’t leaving him again like I did in the past and that he really liked me and didn’t want to lose me again and would do anything for me and reiterated how important I am to him. I hugged him. Wiped his tears, reassured him it was for my reflux I have been having and we cuddled for a until my acid reflux Made me go home to get my meds 

The next day we hung out for fifteen hours and had a great day. I’m weirded out how he was so emotional about and upset about the poop then tried to confess how important I am to him. I’ve had boyfriends be gay in the past"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bw8uj8	2019-06-03 09:50:01		AITA for not wanting to get a haircut as my Father says	"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Also on mobile. First ever post too, been lurking for 2 years. 
Alright so I’m (15M) growing my hair out. Nothing crazy like metal jesus, around the length of Anakin Skywalker. I have had very short hair my whole life. My dad DOES NOT want me to grow my hair. Like not at all, he hates it and constantly yaps about it. I don’t know what his problem is, maybe because he’s bald? I don’t know. I honestly think my hair looks decent. We’re not religious. I should add that he’s very shallow and thinks boys shouldn’t have longer hair. I live in his house like you would expect a 15 Y.O to. So, he pays all the bills and stuff. I get straight A’s btw so I’m not some lazy teen who sits on his ass all day. 
Now what he’s been doing is going to numerous people in my family and also my best friend and asking them to tell me that my hair looks ugly (literally) and I should get a haircut. All of a sudden I’ve got multiple uncles telling me out of nowhere that you should get a haircut, boys have short hair. I got the word that it’s him who’s telling everyone to go to me when my best friend snitched and told me what my dad was doing. (My friend even said I look better with longer hair now lol).  Other than my friend, every family member who’s told me that I should get a haircut says that I should “obey” dad because I live in his house and he gives me food. (Dad thinks he owns me or something). 
I know that my relatives are only saying this because he told them so, they don’t themselves hate my hair. So yeah I’ve actually been quite stressed about this. Each time a new family member mentions it, I get uneasy. Any answer is very appreciated :)

bw8th0	2019-06-03 09:45:34	Justiceee179	WIBTA for breaking off all ties with my mom ?	"I've (17F) always been very close to my mother. We've had a very close relationship, and I even were to consider her my best friend. She would often comfort me about my social problems, since I suffer from loneliness a lot, and relate to them, since she had a very lonely childhood as well. That until last year, when I told her that I wanted to leave the house someday to continue my studies in another city in France. It was purely out of curiosity for what's really out there, since I've always been quite independent.

&#x200B;

When I told this to my mom, her behaviour changed in a flash. I've been putting up with her verbal and psychological abuse for months now, and this urged me to leave the house fast even more. I won't get into too much detail here, but my parents have been divorced for a very long time, and I've been seeking emotional shelter at my dad's, who appears like the bad guy through my mom's words. Since I took my dad's side, my mom has been lashing out at me even more, and so is my brother (a brainless sheep, but he isn't the subject here).

&#x200B;

But that isn't all. My mom is very entitled, and also extremely emotionally dependent, and my aunt, my siblings and me are all the family she has left, and that could bring me to pity her, but I found out at my own expenses that my mom doesn't love anyone unless they forget themselves for her. She dumped my dad, and all her boyfriends because ""they didn't give her enough"", and clings on to me because she suffers from the breakups. She also ostensibly shows her jealousy towards me and my girlfriend (16F), with whom I live a very fulfilling Relationship.

&#x200B;

So between all the verbal abuse telling me that I am a selfish daughter who only thinks about herself, or that the world revolves around me because I refuse to give myself up for her, I see her coming back right after to implicitly beg me not to go.

&#x200B;

And if that weren't enough pressure on me already, after long conversations with my grandmother and my dad, I just found out today that she lied to me about all that she lived. The lonely childhood, the self-effacing, always left aside kid she pretended to have been were nothing but lies. According to my family on my dad's side (who knew my mom's family very well), my mom always was a spoiled child who always got everything she wanted, including her parents under her heel, always responding to her every desire. My father also told me that while he and my mother were still married, she always told him she hated my aunt,  all the while she pretends to like her only so she can look after my little sister, and incidentally lend my mom 10.000 euros to buy her own house.

&#x200B;

I feel so troubled from all the things that are happening, and even though this woman is my mother, I'm not sure whether I'm able to continue loving her like a few years ago.

The CEO at my company has our operations and HR teams push for every employee to contribute to a charity for people with a certain disease. His close family was directly affected by said disease and he is very engaged to help this charity which I think is great - I just don’t want to participate.
They sell T-shirts with the company logo on it for around 25€ and have a bake stand every week where people are supposed to sell home baked goods. We permanently get emails to go buy coffee at store X to contribute and eat lunch at restaurant Y. And why don’t you spend your weekends doing marathon Z or go spread the word about the charity on the street?

I think that I shouldn’t be feeling pushed to contribute. I contribute to a different charity myself don’t get me wrong I have no problem with the idea. 
As the bake sale wasn’t enough they now figure out who isn’t coming to buy anything and come to my and other peoples desks directly with a plate and set it down saying “you haven’t contributed”.

I only wear black, I have piercings, and I've had my hair in a mohawk, death hawk, undercut, and similar hair styles over the years.

My parents (and other people in the family) were cool with it in high school because it was ""a phase"", but ever since senior year in high school, and especially since I started university, they have been pestering me about it all the time. Their main concern is that I go to music school to be a violinist. They keep telling me it's unprofessional and inappropriate, but when I let my hair down and take out any visible piercings and wear a suit, I'd say I look ""normal"".

This has been going on for about 4 years. I've tried to explain to them that I just can't change the way I dress, I can't cut my hair and have regular adult male hair, I can't take my piercings out for good. That's not me. If I feel like Rozz Williams, I can't look like Adam Levine.

I'm fully prepared to tone it down for the sake of live performances in a fancy theater or opera house. But I don't want to change what has become a part of me for the sake of looking professional 2-3 hours a night, several years from now. My parents, grandparents and aunt aren't letting go, and it's becoming unbearable. I started to hate going home or spending any amount of time with any one of them, because I know the conversation will end up on: So, when are you going to grow out of your phase and become normal?? They always talk about me as if I'm not even there; for every birthday/Christmas in the past 4 years, they've given me ""normal"" clothes; my aunt sends me photos of male hair styles all the fucking time and my mom always embarrasses me in front of other people, trying to get them to agree that I'd look better ""normal"". This isn't just family friends, it's sometimes strangers as well. For example, I go shopping with her to help her carry the groceries, and we have a fight about my look, and she starts including random people like the cashier into our conversation, asking them what they think about me. The worst my dad's said to me was ""The grown-ups are talking. When you start looking like a grown-up, you can contribute"" during a conversation about my sister potentially dropping out of school.

Talking to them like reasonable adults hasn't worked. Ignoring them hasn't worked. I don't know what else to do, and I'm seriously considering simply not going home during break at all, and not answering their calls. I feel dumb about wanting to cut them off because I feel like it's an incredibly dumb reason to cut off your family, but I'm not sure what else to do anymore."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We feel uncomfortable addressing it with the people ourselves because we don't know what's going on,  we've had bad experiences trying to politely address very loud after-hours noise that was just bass-blaring music with past neighbors, and this is territory we just have no experience with from the outside. They've already received noise complaints from other neighbors via the landlord about being ""too loud,"" but as far as we've noticed, police have never been called, and the awful noise marathons continue. My husband and I were both abused as children and what we hear is often disconcerting, reminds us of the ""bad screams,"" and our past makes us question what's really happening on the other side of the wall. I've been around kids who misbehave. The screams of the neighbor kids sound like fear and pain, not like a frustrated child that's misbehaving/throwing tantrum/not getting their way, but I can't know for sure. The timing of when the screams start around other noises often strikes us as suspicous. While I don't feel comfortable calling the cops or CPS to do a welfare check, because I'd hate to have a parent go through that if they're not abusing their child, and I'd be worried about our safety if they are actually hurting their kids and also find out we reported them, I would never forgive myself if I found out something unspeakable was happening and we'd never spoken up/called for assessment of the situation ""anonymously."" So at this point I'm thinking that if it continues for another week, I'm going to call CPS and phrase it to CPS as asking for what to do in this situation, and if they want to go out and see what's up, then by all means. WIBTA for that?

Update: they moved in about a month ago. I’ll call CPS. Thanks for your responses."	Not the A-hole	0	0	42.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

I booked the airbnb and he was short on cash so he agreed to pay me back later for it. Fast forward to the day we were supposed to leave as im packin up the car so we can go he finds out he lost his debit card it being a holiday weekend theres no chance for him to get a replacement till after new years so i agree to lend him some cash for the trip. All good right? Hes made two payments earlier this year but we are now in june and im still waiting for the remainder. I text him yesterday saying ""hey dude really need that cash"" and he kinda back handed tells me that he will send me some in the next couple days but that he duznt understand why im crying about it because we never established a time frame he needed to pay it back. Keep in mind he takes trips outta town almost every weekend and just bought a brand new car. Granted we didnt establish a time frame but he obviously has the money to pay me back and is just taking advantage of the situation right? Am i the asshole for pestering him about 120 bucks?"

"Story time:

I have 2 older sibling who are in their late 20's, they were the best siblings to me especially when growing up. They both treated me equally and made sure to take time out of their lives to help me with school or just hang out watch movies etc.

So back in 2015 during the holidays both of my siblings who live together 3 hours away in a different city came over and spent almost a week with our parents and me which was fun, but one of the worst things to ever happen to me during those days was finding out the truth, finding out my siblings deep and darkest secret that they have been in a incest relationship and since then my relationship with them has been strained but they have no idea why.

Just few days ago my Brother texted me to join them at our parents house because they were coming over to announce some big news and that big news ended up being that both of my sibling were moving to Spain permanently soon, their excuse was that they are bored of their work and lives so they want a fresh start. My brother made it seem like that originally he was the only one moving there for work purposes and according to him once my Sister found this out she decided to move there to. The fucked up part is that both of parents although not happy at first gave their blessing and it just made me fucking snap. 

I said some horrible things to my sibling which none of it were me outing them to my parents or anything like that. I don't even know why I snapped, but in the end, I told my siblings that I want nothing to do with them and to have a great future together. I haven't spoken to them since and my parents and friends keep asking me why I was and still am so angry at them and that I should call my siblings to apologize but fuck that.

Before any of you ask No, I'm not interested in incest and I certainly do not have any interest or attraction to my siblings.

Also, I do not plan to out my Siblings to family or friends now or in the future, but I want no part in it and I don't want them to be part of my life anymore. I really hope that they are truly happy, but I'm fucking done.

So, am I the asshole here? I am too fucked up right now but I am sticking to my gun.


Edit: for anyone wondering how I found out, I was staying at my parents guest room which was at the top floor. Went to the washroom very early in the morning and heard muffled noises downstairs only to catch my sister giving my brother oral. It was pretty clear what was happening.


Edit #2: The more comments I read from you guys the more I question myself.

Edit #3: some of you guys not getting why I'm so upset is the very reason I'm upset. None of you guys are in my current position, especially those who fantasize incest.

Edit #4: I am thinking of texting my siblings and letting them know everything. Good or bad idea?

Edit #5: Just texted my Brother asking him if he and my sister are free tomorrow so we can talk and he replied back instantly saying that they will always make time for me in a heartbeat and that they'll be there on time and will be bringing some food and how they both love me no matter what my decision  is and now I'm crying hard"	Not the A-hole	0	0	161.0	44.0	0.0	0.0

This girl almost ruined me. I mean seriously, i'm in a lot of shitty places emotionally, because of the crap she did to me. She not only lied about the person i was, but she told people i cheated on her, and it took me 2 months, to convince everyone i wasn't in the wrong. Detailing all the crazy nonsense that she did would take me a while.

Obviously, i don't want him to end up in a toxic relationship like i did, and i only want him to be the happiest he can be. If he wants to start a relationship with her, i am at no position to stop him. But to some extent, the idea of them being together disgusts me as well.

I hinted at me being kind of pissed, at the fact that not only did he not stand by me when i was in a kind of dark period in my life, misplaced and distrusted, but that he now wants to date her. He hasn't said much since that conversation.

bw8lac	2019-06-03 09:11:23	sendpicsofurtoes	AITA for flying to see my best friend but not my family?	"A couple weeks ago, I was spending time with my cousin and we were talking about my trip to go see my best friend. I was going to see her for two weeks and we had a lot of plans together. I was incredibly excited. We were talking about it, then she goes, “Hey, you fly to your best friend but not us? We’re family.”

I shrugged because I didn’t know what to say at the time, and I forgot about it, but am now thinking about it. I have reasons for not wanting to go to [US STATE] and stay with her family.

My aunt is INCREDIBLY judgmental. I know she would be commenting on everything I did, from the way I eat to the way I talk. I have piercings and my aunt is incredibly religious, so I’d also like to avoid her berating me for them. When my cousin got her nose pierced, her mom forced her to take it out. My cousin was 20 at the time. My cousin was talking to a guy and her mom called her a whore and a slut and to find god. My mental health would be depleted within two hours of being in the same room as my aunt.

My cousin’s sister does not take care of her hygiene. The entire upstairs area is incredibly disgusting because she leaves her bloody pads open and on the floor. They pile up. Her dad avoids using that bathroom because the smell is so bad. I don’t want to smell that for two weeks. I’ve smelled her myself. I’m going to be blunt here: Fish and blood do not mix. The whole hallway smells along with her room. My cousin has to go downstairs to use the bathroom or else she’ll gag and throw up from the smell.

My cousin ran away from home at 17 to get away from her parents. Why would she want me to stay with them for two weeks?

I’m very introverted and like to keep to myself. My cousin is extroverted and sometimes tries to force me to go out even after I say no, and will sometimes hit me because she gets upset.

My best friend and I are pretty much the same way. We like to keep to ourselves and go out when we feel like it. I enjoy spending time with her and when I was with her it was always a lot of fun.

Sorry, I’m rambling at this point. I know I’m not the asshole for their behavior, but am I the asshole for wanting to visit my best friend over family?

Also, not sure if this is important, but I am a 19 year old girl."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
bw8l90	2019-06-03 09:11:14	bored-librarian	WIBTA if I donated my step-daughter's stuff and gave away her pet?	"I (32f) have a step-daughter (17) that we'll call Ashley. She came to live with us about a year ago when her mom moved out of state and she didn't want to go.

It's been a rough year. She had a lot of mental health issues, and ended up dropping out of high school and attending a full time therapy program. She finished the program, but got little out of it. She now stays in bed 24/7 watching Netflix and smoking weed all day.

Her dad and I have been trying really hard to get her to do basically anything. We enrolled her in online school. She lied about doing her work, and got kicked out. We signed her up for community college classes, she didn't go. I helped her get a job at my work, and she got fired before she started for not filling out the paperwork.

I guess she got tired of us pressuring her, and she waited for us to leave for work, and she packed her bags and flew to her mom's house. Evidentally they have been planning this for months. I am not sure why they didn't just tell us, because we wouldn't have been mad. We were planning on talking to her mom to see if she thought she'd do better there. Instead they said nothing and we were worried sick because we had no idea where she was. They actually did this once before. She lived with us for a few years and went for a visit to her mom's, and never came back. Her mom moved and wouldn't give us the new address for over 6 months.

When her dad texted her a few days ago, she said everything is his fault and she's done talking to him forever. Honestly, he has done so much for her. He has always been there for her, so he is super hurt by this. 

When she left, she just left everything in her room, including a bearded dragon (with no food or water). I have reached out to her several times over the past week to see if she has a plan to get her stuff, or if she wanted us to ship it to her. I would just ship most of it, but just like last time, we don't have their address. She hasn't responded to any of our texts or calls.

My plan is to leave her room as is for 30 days, then pack up all of her pictures/yearbooks and anything else that looks important. Everything else I will donate. A friend of mine who loves animals offered to take the bearded dragon.

We have a small house so storing all of her stuff indefinitely would really be hard.

So, WIBTA for donating her stuff and giving away her bearded dragon? Or as parents should we store her stuff until some day she can come get it? Her dad and I are both emotional and really hurt right now. We hope to rebuild our relationship with her some day, so I just want to make sure we're doing the right thing."

Her parents weren't too happy about their relationship, mainly because they're paranoid, but also because they didn't know him that well. As time went on he proposed to her and they got married close to a year ago. Her parents weren't too happy, but again, they're a little paranoid at times.

To get to the point: she used to be super protective of her money and had quite a bit saved up, but he on the other hand, will spend a full check or close to it in less than a week and misuses the money by buying expensive food, loads of candy (they both easily gained 60 lbs since they started dating) and other sweets plus a bunch of food they end up throwing out, un needed car upgrades (they want to buy a huge truck that they can't afford) and the sad thing is, she's picked up on his bad habits and developed the same ""I don't care, I'll do it later"" attitude.
She barely keeps in contact with her parents, which sure, they had issues and I can see how she's grown tired of them, and just overall really changed since she got married to this guy, which makes me sad because we grew up together and had a super tight relationship which I feel has deteriorated and I sometimes feel like she's just a stranger more and more. I get that people change and grow up but she's been changing negatively and  she has picked up all her husband's bad habits and just developed a rude attitude. 

Couple things I forgot to mention were that they both make plans but never do anything. They had the perfect chance to get a house, but didn't do it, he has had three or four jobs in less than a year and while they look happy in their marriage, they're just making really bad financial choices and the thing is, is that they both admit to having bad habits but never do anything to change

He wanted to hang out again after I was done with my friends, and I told him maybe and that I’d let him know. About two hours later I knew I would be too tired when I was done with my friends so I told him another time.

He then blew up my phone telling me he was done with me and he hates people who are flakey. I felt bad so I apologized and told him we could hang out another time, but he kept saying he didn’t know if he could trust me. Mind you we had only known each other for a day at this point. This combined with his off putting attitude made me realize I didn’t really wanna our much energy into somebody. 

That night he posted a video on Snapchat saying how much he hates girls and how they all play games. Which was awkward at best considering he has a following (that I didn’t know about until a few days later)

The next day he was wanting to hang out again, and I told him I was busy, which I really was. The next week he continuously texted me trying to fit into my schedule and he was being pretty aggressive about it, and would always say extremely sexual things to me, so I just stopped responding. 

He’s reached out to me a couple of times in which I’ve always ignored him, but today he messaged me asking me what he did to make me not wanna hang out with him. I felt uncomfortable considering it’s been a month and I didn’t really think it was worth my time explaining it to him, so I just told him I was busy and then he starts drilling me on my schedule trying to find time for him.

2. he has physically and verbally bothered a lot of the female staff, even when they have asked him directly not to.
3. he is spoiled af. his parents pay for his condo and bills, asking he only pay for his food.  The one time they asked for him to help with bills, he accused them of abusing him.
4. he claims to be poor, and then buys $10 milkshakes and goes to gaming conventions. \[Edit\] He also always asks to leave work early, despite ""needing money"" because he's ""poor""
5. he said he was moving to Florida, threw himself a party, and then revealed he wasn't actually leaving (called it btw)
6. He never shuts the fuck up.  He is always talking or beat boxxing.
7. he does nothing but talk about himself. if he asks about you, it's just so he can talk about himself.
8. he is homophobic
9. he is a ""nice guy"".  He has had a crush on every girl at work because they're all ""flirting"" with him (aka being nice). He accused some girl he knew of cheating on him, even though they weren't dating.
10. It doesn't matter if you're an expert in a certain field; you're wrong when it comes to his logic.

He is officially leaving this week; I have expressed extreme happiness over this.  Basically everyone is happy.  But because I'm being over-joyed about it, my assistant-assistant manager has said I'm being an asshole, and only hate him because I don't understand his struggles with autism.

Of course, the mandatory alcohol flows richly. And also, some possible relationship boundaries were crossed. I however, did not drink alcohol yet, and also did not engage in any form of physical contact with other women. 

I also do not call or videochat home daily. 

When I did however, I barely slept the night before and had basically no voice left from shouting all over the place. I always feel kind of awkward to be leaving the other guys so I can call home, so I tried to keep it short. My wife asked me about my voice. I said it was from shouting, she said it was from drinking. I told her I wasnt drinking, she did not believe me. I also told her some of the other guys were absolutely shitfaced and maybe broke some boundaries. She wanted to know details about who and what and where, but I told her I would tell her when I got home. Because I wouldnt tell her right there and then, she decided I did ‘something’ with another woman and hung up on me. 

Fast forward to two days later. She texted me saying we should call today, because she didnt want to feel like this. So I called her because I didnt like the situation either. 

I wanted to explain that I couldnt say everything because there would always be someone listening somewhere and I would tell her everything when we would be back home. 
She demanded I would tell her everything over text because I was being vague. So I wrote up a short summary of what happened. This pissed her off even more, because she figured that other guys’ “toxic” behavior would trigger me as well. It pissed me off she would just not believe me, so this time I said we were leaving the hotel and I had to go. I got this whole textual tirade about how I was being irresponsible, ridiculous, I was an asshole, you know what. She also told me that she wants a break in the relationship, and that I was not welcome at our home when we got back (after I told her I did not want her to pick me up from the airport anymore). She said that if I wanted to fuck other women, this would be my chance. I did not, and I will not. However, I am thinking about going back to the restaurant to try and hook up with the waitress who I thought was cute.

bw841o	2019-06-03 07:56:41	SameRound	AITA for not chasing after my mother?	"So my parents bought a new house recently and it needs a lot of work. Bare bone and lots of trash needs to be cleared. Me and my brother are both going to college for computer science and I'm living with my parents for summer break. I'm currently working and had planned on using my free time to hone my programming skills. Due to how we were raised, we never liked being around our parents and try to limit our interaction with them to a minimum.

&#x200B;

My mother called me in the morning and asked if I was free today. I had planned on updating some programs I wrote due to feature requests and bug fixes. I told her I had things planned for today and she started questioning me whether it's work-related or if I'm getting paid for this. I tried explaining it to her and she ends up ending the call. I started getting dressed to go with her but she storms out and left on her own. I tried calling her but she didn't pick up so I ended up just leaving her alone and stayed home. Few hours later, my dad calls me asking why I'm still at home and not with my mom. He then proceeds to also ask the same question of whether it's work-related or if I'm getting paid for doing it. After hearing my responses, he starts to rant. ""You and your brother always seems to be busy with schoolwork and that you're just using schoolwork as an excuse to not do anything. You do realize once you graduate you can't use that excuse anymore."" ""I don't even ask for your GPA and if I did, I bet you won't be in the top 10, so where is all this schoolwork coming from?"" ""You have a car so why didn't you drive?"" It didn't make sense on why he's bringing that up school right now since I'm out for summer break and my brother still has a month left on top of working part-time. He continues to rant but as of writing this, I vaguely remember what he said cause at that point, I just muted myself and pushed my phone away, seeing that anything I say would probably make it worse and I needed to calm myself from what felt like an anxiety attack.

This happened a while ago. My friend was having a bad day and in an effort to cheer her up I said ""You look better when you smile."" as a kind comment.

"I’ve known this girl since early college and she and I have had some terrible boyfriends but we finally found some great guys and we both got engaged in the same year (she got engaged, me a few months later). I’ve always considered her my best friend so as soon as I got engaged I immediately asked her to be my maid of honor which she said yes to. I knew I would be a bridesmaid for her since she has repeatedly told me we’re best friends but she has a lot of friends that have been around since childhood so I’m not her maid of honor (which is 100% fine by me since I have a lot going on right now).

We both come from the same background but my family is more conservative, so as a result, despite getting engaged later than her, my wedding will be happening 2 months from now while hers is happening sometime next year (date TBD). I love my fiancé so all that’s kept me going throughout this difficult time is the thought of being married to this wonderful man. Since getting both of us getting engaged, the following has happened:
- She had an engagement party which my fiancé and I had to miss due to family obligations
- Fiancé and I had 2 engagement parties and 1 religious engagement. She and her fiancé showed up to 1 of the engagement parties but left early and she complained out loud to everyone that neither fiancé nor I showed up to their engagement party so it didn’t matter that she was leaving early (she left because she thought my fiancé’s best friend’s wife was flirting with her fiancé but it was a misunderstanding and insecurity)
- Fiancé and I had to move up our wedding by 2 weeks due to religious reasons
- After she told me she could either make my wedding or my bachelorette party but not both due to financial and work reasons from date change. I said the only duty of maid of honor for my wedding was to plan the bachelorette but if it came to choosing I’d rather she was at the wedding
- She’s attending several expensive birthday parties between my bachelorette and her wedding that have all been booked since the date change. Also her bachelorette party is across the country and a huge expenditure
- I changed my bachelorette to be in the same city that she lives in and yet she still said she would “try to show up” so I have to plan my own bachelorette party by myself

As such, I have distanced myself. My fiancé and she live in the same city (I don’t, about 4 hours apart) but I don’t tell her every time I’m there. I also don’t think I’ll hang out with her as much as I used to once I move up there.

She was my best friend but AITA for distancing myself from her and only treating her as an acquaintance? My fiancé keeps telling me to give her another chance since the friendship has been so long."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

 Well after a few hours of trying to sleep, I tried to get him to talk about why he doesn't trust.

"I have long, natural red hair that I’m very proud of and I am very particular about taking care of it and making sure it’s nice. From the nape of my neck to the ends of my hair it measures about 21 inches. 

I was looking online and I found out that there’s actually a pretty high demand for human hair since wigs and extensions are so in-style right now. I found a calculator that approximates how much a given amount of my type of hair would be and I learned it could be worth upwards of $750.

I’ve brought this idea up to a lot of people I know and almost everyone has seemed borderline appalled. They ask me why I would ever want to sell my hair when I could donate it to Locks For Love or some other charity organization. I’ve explained the financial benefit it would bring me but several people have said that no amount of money would be more valuable to me than my hair would be to some kid with cancer. I strongly disagree. Bills gotta be paid. 

I believe that since it’s my hair I should get to do what I please with it. My friends believe that instead of selling I should bestow the blessing of my hair upon some random kid. It took a year and a half to grow from shoulder blade to hipbone. Why should I give away for free what I produced and worked hard to maintain, especially when it would be incredibly beneficial for me to sell?

I've gotten into the habit of drinking, taking xanax, dropping LSD, snorting an adderall, or smoking weed before virtually every social event for the past few months.

Before anyone thinks im an addict; I very rarely ever do drugs by myself or out of craving. I go weeks sober until a party comes up then I'll go full force before it. 

It's gotten to the point people think Im some asshole junkie who is constantly high even though im really not. I just can't stand being sober around large groups of people. It could just be paranoia but I always think that everyone dreads me showing up at a party, as I just act really fucking stupid and obnoxious.

bw7ym1	2019-06-03 07:32:38	beefandpotatoes	AITA for getting mad at my husband for not eating the dinner I made?	" 

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

A little context:

My \[27yo\] husband \[27yo\] can't cook. He's just...awful at it. He once made some caramelized onions and pork chops, but didn't know he had to peel the onions, so we ate pork chops and caramelized onion skin for dinner. He's good at other things and I love him, but dinner and kitchen stuff is usually my territory. He's been working a lot lately because his work as been having him come in on the weekends for overtime. I also work a lot (two jobs). Today was his day off and since we agreed we'd stop spending money on eating out, i bought ingredients last night to make a big ass pot roast that would just cook all afternoon while i was at work and would be done by 6:30pm.

I send him updates and let him know that all he needs to do is just flip the pot roast over and mix the veggies around, which he does. I also tell him that the pot roast should be done by 6:30. In the meantime, he's at home waiting for some taskrabbit guy to come to our place and build the new cabinet he bought. The taskrabbit guy comes \~20 mins before the roast is supposed to be done and at 6:30 I message him to turn off the slow cooker, which he does. 9:00pm rolls around and I message him asking if he's eaten yet. He says no, saying he ""can't figure out the roast"" and that it's a ""meat riddle."" Honestly, i find that kinda funny and i tell him to just slice it/it doesn't have to be pretty.

I get home at 10 and ask him if he'd eaten yet and he says no. Then I see a McDonald's cup on his desk and ask him if he got McD's instead of eating the pot roast and he says yes. I check on the pot roast and it hasn't even been touched. His reasoning is that he was that he was starving by the time 4pm showed up, so he ordered a Big Mac and a drink. His reasoning for not eating the pot roast was that he was very hungry and by the time the taskrabbit guy came, he didn't have time to eat. I ask my husband how long it took the taskrabbit guy to build it and he says he was finished by around 8:30p. I get mad and tell him that it was messed up and kinda disrespectful that he went and ordered out when there was food cooking in the kitchen. And he gets mad at me for getting mad at him, and that I shouldn't be surprised because I was the one who planned out when the food was gonna be done (apparently 6:30 is too late?). I spent the time to buy the ingredients for dinner, planned out everything so it'd be done around dinner, and even did all the food prep myself. All he needed to do was slice it up.

I'm not mad anymore and as I'm putting the food away, i realize that it was a dumb argument in the first place. But in the end, I still feel like it could've been so easy to just have a small snack before dinner, wait until the food was done, and then ate it while the taskrabbit guy was working.

bw7yib	2019-06-03 07:32:16	Itdoeswhatitdo	AITA bfs best friend make out in front of me.	"OK I recently started seeing a  Guy who I am  Really into and care a lot about him. I can go as far to say that I love the guy. He has a best friend who is a Chick we'll call her Morgan and his other best friend is her boyfriend of 5 Years who we will call Joe. Now that didn't bother me I'm not a Jealous person And believe jealousy leads to a toxic  Relationship.
  That being said one  Night my boyfriend, Morgan,  few other friends and I came home from the bar and continued drinking. My bf and I Sneak downstairs for sex and Morgan barges in. My bf and I are into kinky shit so let her watch and continued our thing. She played with my nipples a bit and kissed me..felt ok I guess but w/e. I didn't really care I thought it was fun... However my boyfriend and I have had a discussion about 3- somes but I told him I wasn't ready for that level In our relationship  Because I don't feel secure enough with him yet to involve another girl. Anyway she keeps coming in and out always saying ""I should leave"" and I'd respond by telling her she doesn't need to stay if she doesn't want to cause my bf insisted she could. About the 4th time she comes back she is all over my chest and kissing me whatnot. We finish and I'm getting dressed and see her and him making out. That bothered me. I kinda told the let's go back upstairs n shit to break them up. She's following us around and finally tell her to get an uber. 

Fast forward the next night. I talk to my bf that I'm upset about it because 1. Shes your best friend. How can I trust her now...I know we were fooling around but I didnt feel involved at that point. 2. Shes your best friends gf. You got a man yo and hes not even here tonight. 3. Bothering me the most is she said this says between the 3 of us. So you know what you did was wrong. 
The next night I had to tell Joe cause I respect him and had been in his shoes by supposed friends never telling me my ex cheated the beginning of our relationship. 
He says hes gonna talk to her. She comes up to me kinda passive aggressive and confronts me. I am her what she would do if I kissed Joe. Not tell her best friend (my bf)...
Anyway idk if I did the right thing. It was a messed up weekend mostly drinking. I felt like I should have told her that either she can tell him or I can and now idk where this will lead to in my relationship. He seems 100% on my side and he's glad I talked to him about it and wont do it again. She made it clear she wont ever touch me again and honestly I'm perfectly ok with that cause i really didnt find her attractive...not just physically but she is so negative all the time. If we aren't doing what she wants to do she gets an attitude. I am civil towards her because shes my bfs friend but I dont know how much longer I'll be able to get along with her.."

bw7weu	2019-06-03 07:23:16	throwaway20190603	AITA for expecting that a sick colleague is aware of the company's regulation during sickness, and for sending out an official warning when they prove uncooperative according to those regulations?	"Obvious throwaway account here. Also English isn't my mother tongue so I hope I don't mess up certain terms.
I'm new to being in a managing position so still learning the ropes., this also makes me second guess myself at times like these:

Colleague is sick, for near 2 months now. Company regulation/ procedure calls for at least once a week contact with the manager, either in person or a short phone call. This procedure is available online on the same site that provides employees with their paycheck/payslip, and I provided updated explanation to all of them of how to log in there a couple of months ago.
IMO, it's their responsibility to be aware of what is stated in those rules., especially if they're gone on sickleave for a prolonged amount of time. If they don't know how to find those procedures, then they can ask and I'd be happy to sort then out, but as they're all adults I don't feel that I should have to spoon-feed basic stuff like this to them.

Said sick colleague has been avoiding proper contact for a while now, and I've been lenient with it because I know they're going through a hard time. But after the umpteenth of them avoiding me, and not contacting me the day we had agreed to, I ended up sending an official warning after deliberation with the district manager.
Now the sick colleague is pissed with me because they didn't know about the procedure, and they're blaming me for lack in communication.

AITA for 
A) assuming they're adult and responsible enough to either know the procedure which is available to them even from home, or that they should ask me about it. 
B) not spoonfeeding them the procedure before sending an official warning through HR? (edit: by this point I assumed the avoidance was deliberate as they even refused to listen to voicemail or call back when requested) 

On one hand I feel like an asshole for kicking somebody who is already down. On the other hand I feel like I've been lenient enough and they were starting to abuse that to write their own rules."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bw7wa0	2019-06-03 07:22:47	LaphogWizard	AITA For refusing to dance at weddings?	"I went to a wedding this weekend as my girlfriend's guest.  I don't dance.  I hate dancing.  It doesn't make me feel good, like it apparently does most people.  She knows this.  Although, I did promise her a slow dance as a compromise.  I slow danced with her for a couple songs, and I left the floor when the music picked back up.  All throughout the night, my girlfriend and her family (some I've never met before) were coming up to me, begging me to come back to the dance floor, and forcibly pulling my hands.  I turned them down each time.  I raised my voice a few times, because their constant begging was annoying me.  I eventually ducked outside the venue to smoke a cigar, talk with guests, and get some peace and quiet from the blaring music and obnoxious drunks.  This is how I can tolerate these types of ceremonies.  I didn't try to yank anyone out there.


It seems at every wedding I go to, everyone tries to pull me on the dance floor.  Why is it such a big deal?  Of all the things you can refuse to do, why is dancing so weird?  Why is it acceptable to bicker someone who refuses to dance?  I'm always in the minority in these situations, so I feel like the asshole.  Like I'm somehow bringing everyone down, just because I, a person most people at the event don't even know, don't like to dance.  Am I an asshole for refusing to dance with my girlfriend and her family, even though we had an agreement that I'd only slow dance with her?


Edit:  When I said I raised my voice, I didn't yell.  That's specifically why I didn't use the word ""yell"".  I was just making myself more clear with a firmer tone of voice.  Also, when I said people were forcibly pulling on me, I mean some of them were literally putting their weight into it and kept doing it after I told them I wasn't interested.

So I was in my therapy group, like every other normal day. I was wearing ripped jeans, a zip up hoodie, and a tank top. When I went to snack, I took off my jacket because It was hot. One of the staff saw me, and told me to put my sweater back on because my tank top was ""inappropriate"" (it didn't even show my stomach and the straps weren't thin).

Disclaimer(my therapy group was for suicidal/bipolar people)

I refused and ignored her because she was being completely ridiculous. Then, she forced me to go to her office, but I refused and said no multiple times (eventually I had to go). We went in the office, and then we fought about a fucking shirt until they called my mom.

&#x200B;

My mom didn't give a shit though, because she though my shirt was fine.

&#x200B;

I got real mad, called my therapist a cunt, and then had a mental breakdown. (I will admit that I overreacted, but I was having a bad day) Not to mention, when I was sitting in the hallway, I heard the staff talking shit about me, saying that I was rude and condescending.

bw7ue2	2019-06-03 07:14:56	Eskelyojimbo	AITA for getting pissed that my sister gave my mother a new dog?	"So background, I still live with my family (father, mother and 3rd sister.) and we have one dog, a toy poddle.

For the longest time, I had wanted to get a new dog when our old dog inevitably passes away. I love my old dog but I just hated that we didn’t have a consensus about getting this dog because my mother just got it impulsively one day. Anyway, it annoys me that I see my friend’s family who planned together to get their dog and now this dog is quite discipline and well taken care of. My old dog on the other hand is not as disciplined and very hostile to strangers. Only my mother and sister take care of this old dog because my father and I did not even agree to this. 

So for my mother’s birthday, I was livid that my 1st and 2nd sister gave my mother a new dog without consulting the rest of the family about this. I got so pissed that I got into a huge fight with my mother to which I later apologized to her because I realized it wasn’t her fault that she got this new dog. However, I confronted my 2nd sister about this and she brushed it off like I was being over the top. I procededed to remind her that the previous dogs she got in our family were abandoned and died of neglect when she moved out. I proceeded to call her a hypocrite and told her that the new dog she got for herself would probably die of neglect one day. She got pissed and caused a rift between us. My family seems to also think I’m overreacting but I still feel like I have the right to be pissed at this point.

bw7u9v	2019-06-03 07:14:28	Val-the-Impaler	AITA for recommending an old horse be put down?	"I'm going to try and keep things as factual as possible.

1. The horse legally belongs to my Mother In Law (MIL). She does not live with us.
2. He lives on a farm owned by my Father In Law (FIL). My husband and I both reside there.
3. My FIL typically feeds him. I feed the other horses. MIL asked me to keep an eye on his health.
4. The horse came up during a phonecall with MIL. I raised concerns, and when she asked if it time to put him down, I said yes. She asked me to make an appointment via Veterinarian.

The facts, and arguments from both sides.

1. The horse is 38 years old; 105 in human years.
2. Last year he got a leg infection. Since then, he no longer uses all his paddock space. He only moves between his tree, his food, and his water. He does not trot or canter as he used to. I believe he is in discomfort. He does not otherwise appear to be in any pain. My FIL believes it's just due to age.
3. He has gone near-completely blind and deaf over six months. My FIL (who is losing his eyesight himself) is furious at 'putting him down for being old and blind', and 'would you do the same to me?'.
4. The horse longer has any teeth. He requires a special diet, which the other horses steal. He needs to be paddocked alone. Because he is blind, he can no longer see his friends over he fence. He can only detect them if they are in touching distance. The moment they step away, he thinks they have 'disappeared' and he becomes extremely upset, pacing and neighing. He frequently calls to them throughout the day and night, but as he's deaf, he cannot hear them answer.
5. He now stands in one place without moving, endlessly tossing his head, whereas before he used to follow the other horses along the fence. I think the isolation is hurting him, and I feel he is acting depressed. My FIL insists that the horse ""doesn't need friends"", as he's lived on his own before and ""he was fine"". He says as the horse still neighs for food and checks his feeder he's mentally fit and healthy.
6. Touching him causes him to jump in a panic as he cannot see or hear you, which is dangerous to both the horse and handler. Likewise, routine medical checks, rugging, etc, are borderline impossible. I fear his blindness may cause him to accidentally run into fencing, trees, etc. My FIL thinks I'm being dramatic.
7. Lastly, winter is coming. I feel him being outside in winter at his age will be asking too much. We do not have stables or other facilities. Nights are freezing while days are still hot, and taking his rug on and off is hard because of his flightiness.

My SIL (who does not live with us) accused me of being an animal hater etc. My FIL is angry at me for speaking because he's the one who feeds him. He claims he intends to leave him until 'he falls down and can't get up', but I feel the horse should be put down before then to save him unnecessary trauma. 

My MIL immediately requested the appointment be cancelled. I'm seen as the bad guy for saying something.

I'm also pretty sure I'm the worlds biggest asshole but I wanted to double check. 

so last week one of my colleagues was not looking 100% when she came into work, I asked her if she was ok and she told me that someone called CPS on them 3 times in 2 weeks to report abuse. 
she is in a relationship with a woman and they have a 2 year old girl. she is super adorable btw. 
I gave her a hug and told her she could call me whenever she needs to. 

word got around the office and it turns out that one of the girls bellow us called them in because she was super anti gay, she was fired.

she posted on Facebook about how she lost her job but never gave a reason why. I then decided to start replying to all the comments and telling them what she did, I replied to about 15 or so people. 

turns out that it's not ok do to that and I got some not so nice messages from her family telling me off for ruining her image. 

I'm now honestly thinking I took it a step to far and should of left it.

Been seriously considering this for a while so I'll accept whatever is reached here. I have a tmobile account with quite a few lines for people I know, one of those people used to be my roommate but over the past 3 years he's proven to be a bad person and an even worse friend so I sort of cut ties and the only relation we had was once a month when he pays his dues (which he was always a couple weeks late to do), I don't have anyone as an authorized user on my account as I dont trust anyone to be but last year this guy walks into Tmobile and just gets a phone on a payment plan on my account, they're not allowed to do that but I guess the salesperson just wanted to make a sale, I found out as soon as the next bill came so I called him and told him to bring his last month bill and the full price for the phone and that we are done. I paid off the phone 2 months ago but now I feel like calling Tmobile to bitch at them and demand they give me a full refund since I didn't buy the phone and they shouldn't have sold it without my permission, if they do decide to do that then they will for sure lock the phone so I get the money the guy gets screwed and that's a win win for me.

&#x200B;

So, I made an internet friend over discord a couple of months ago and we were really good friends for a while. We met on a server and I had made many friends there too. But, my friend can be really annoying when it comes to joining his servers because it always seemed he made a new one for me and a few others to join. He even got banned from the server we met on because of it. Anyways, one day he makes another server and for some strange reason it was the final straw for me. I got tired of him always changing a long while ago and I had planned to at least talk to him about it eventually, but instead I panicked because I can't handle making people feel bad about any aspect of themselves and I then proceeded to make everything worse by blocking him and leaving every server he made except the one we met in.

I had an alt that I checked then promptly deleted. Everything after was normal for a couple of days. But then, his alt comes in saying he's only back to talk to me. I panic as if I were about to die by a meteor. I leave the server almost immediately, leaving a whole group of who I considered my friends.  A mod even sends me an invite back, and we didn't talk often. I ignored it, and with the help of my irl friends, delete my main and create a new one, promising to never join another public server, so this doesn't repeat. I seriously don't know if anyone is looking for me, I even changed my instagram account and am on my way to deleting a lot of accounts because I'm too afraid to explain this to them and to my friend."

Whenever I am about to give bad news or, lose my ever loving shit on a close friend, family member or spouse,

I pull out a bribery pie from my freezer.

Depends on what my berries are doing and the season. I have strawberries, grape vines, raspberry bushes and rhubarb in my garden. Pumpkin is one of my best! Sweetened condensed canned milk. Boom.

I also bake my pies in bulk and throw a couple in the deep freeze for good measure to pull out for potluck/Christmas etc.

I make many a good pie. My family enjoys them very much but, now it seems they connected the dots.

She gave me pie....No one else is here....She looks kinda pissy or sad...Shits about to go down.

They always eat the pie.

Did I just do some Freud shit?

Editing: Yes. I use pies to soften the blow. I very rarely scream rant. I use this tool to prepare for a conversation that will be upsetting. I get it. I have ruined all pies."	Asshole	0	0	217.0	105.0	0.0	0.0

bw7nc7	2019-06-03 06:46:18		AITA for advising my friend not to switch jobs?	"For some context: We both went to the same college in a different state. We are also both originally from the same area. After college we both moved back home. I moved back because I was completing some requirements to apply to med school and would rather live at home and save money while doing that. He moved back bc he could not find a job in the area we went to college (not a college town). 


Fast forward a few months to now, and we are both working in our hometown area. Like I said before, he just started a job 3-4 months ago. He doesn’t enjoy living here, and began to look for jobs near where we went to college. My friend is also severely depressed and just got to a stable psychological level so to say. 

He found a job in the city where we went to college. Friend wants the job, but was feeling conflicted due to his depression. I told him that if it was a good career move then he should take it. I asked him what the other downsides were and he mentioned that the pay was a lot less. The job itself is similar to what he’s doing now. 

Since he would be paying rent in an expensive town + transport + other expenses, I recommended he use his current salary to negotiate for higher salary at this other job. Friend refused, saying that the company will not increase (he also said he didn’t try). I then suggested he look for jobs at other companies near that city. I gave him advice that he should not quit a job with good pay for a job with bad pay and a lot of expenses. 

Today he said he was dead set on that job, and I advised him to think about the pay. I said that he is making a short-sighted move, and that moving back to other state isn’t big enough benefit. He says I’m being a dick. I feel bad because I maybe offered unsolicited advice, but I wanted to stop him from making a mistake as he can make some impulsive decisions."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bw7n38	2019-06-03 06:45:21		AITA for going off on a girl that told me she had a boyfriend?	"The title is a little misleading. I didn’t necessarily go off on anyone, but I did call her out for not respecting her own relationship. Here’s the situation: 

Basically, I’m on social media, specifically Facebook and Twitter. I post pictures and some statuses here and there, and this one girl in particular would often heart react to my pictures. Now I personally don’t know how it is for full grown adults, but I know for us teenagers, heart reactions are basically our way of telling someone we think they’re cute without actually saying it. It’s basically something that, unless we’re just close friends or family, should always be perceived as someone being interested in you and wanting to talk to you. Immature thinking, but that’s basically how it is.

That said, I found the girl pretty cute myself, and I took it as she wanted to talk to me. I decided to post a tbh status (Cringe, I know. My social anxiety prevents me from just making a move without it), and she hearts it in just a matter of minutes. I decide to wait about an hour, and I give her one in her messages, saying she’s cute & that we should talk. She responded with, “Bitch, you know that I have a boyfriend. Bye.” She then unfriended me. I’ll say beforehand that this girl didn’t have a date on her bio, and she didn’t have any featured photos on her profile that showed she was in a relationship. I had to go through her pictures to find out, so it wasn’t at all obvious. 

I basically got petty and responded with, “No, I didn’t. If I did, I wouldn’t have given you the tbh. Also, I find it really funny that you felt the need to come at me like I don’t respect your relationship, when you yourself clearly don’t respect it, otherwise you wouldn’t have been reacting to my posts, knowing that you have someone, in the first place. Blocked.” 

That’s not word for word accurate, but it’s along the lines of that. As the quote says, I blocked her almost immediately after I responded, and that was that.

I just feel she baited me into that. I get that you shouldn’t take a heart react as someone wanting to talk to you, but I feel it’s only normal for it to be taken like that. Especially when someone hearts a tbh (To Be Honest for those who don’t know. It’s essentially a cringey way for shy people to tell someone else that they think they’re cute and want to talk to them. There’s never any actual honesty in it aside from that), that basically means they’re wanting you to give them one as that’s probably the only way the two of you are going to start talking."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

He needed a large sum of money and has already gotten some from me and other investors, I honestly he is gonna succeed, he is motivated, experienced and won’t be too emotional about it.

When me and my girlfriend were having dinner, I told her about it and how I was excited for him. She said cool, I am excited for him, how much money did you invest. I told her the number and she got really mad. She said how she could have paid off all of her debt and bought the new car she needed. I then told her that she shouldn’t hypothetically spend my money and it wasn’t hers anyway. I also reminded her that we don’t even live together or are engaged so I don’t think she should worry.

Ok, so it's 2am here now. 2am Sunday night/Monday. This morning a girl I'm casual friends with, messaged me on Facebook to start a conversation about a post I shared.

The post in question said ""the most addictive drug is another human being."" We made some jokes about how we can personally relate to that post, and she mentioned a few times how hard it is finding guys she actually wants to date and who aren't ~~fuckboys~~, and that she's lonely. 

Well, she's cute and I'm single, so I said I'd take her out on a date anytime. Ha, she said yes and we made plans for tomorrow night. 

Ok, but we texted for the majority of the day. She was ranting to me about her ex fiance until midnight. Off and on. About all the shit he put her through. 

They were together for 4 years, he's a heroin addict, he stole her stuff to sell so he could buy h, he was in jail, he cheated on her, now he's out and still texting her.

She was giving me LIVE UPDATES of texts he was sending her tonight and asking me what I think. Girl idgaf. 

I made comments about it the entire time or told her my opinion on whatever it is that he did, but it was annoying.

It's annoying because I don't like texting all day (I like to talk not text), I don't like when somebody rants about their ex for too long, etc. It's good to vent sometimes, but this was too much. 

I just texted about an hour ago saying I changed my mind and I'm not interested, I'm sorry for canceling but I'd rather not. She said ""then why did you tell me you were looking forward to it and why did you ask me out in the first place?""

I was honest (maybe too) and said I don't think you're over your ex and I don't really feel like talking about it, it's not a big deal. 

She called me an asshole and was like, boy bye, you wouldn't even come talk to me and just judge me from text messages.

bw7kya	2019-06-03 06:36:48		AITA for embarrassing my husband when I implied his colleagues were elitist at a work party?	"Fully expect to be called the asshole but here goes.

My husband and I come from extremely different backgrounds, like night and day. My parents were lower middle class and his were upper class. I went to a good state school and worked as a waitress part time while he went to an Ivy League college and got sent abroad every summer on elite finance internships. 

I now stay at home with our two children, but I never feel like I fit in with his friends and colleagues. He’s in finance and all of his friends have similar backgrounds.

We were recently at a housewarming party at some hedge fund owner’s penthouse and someone asked me what I do. I said I’m a homemaker, then she asked me what I did before having kids. I said I worked retail for a while and managed a clothing store. So this woman kind of chuckles and goes “well makes sense to stay home after that huh! Bet it’s a real step up after having to deal with customers all day.” I laughed and said yeah but I liked my job back then too. She then made a face and said something to the guy next to her like “god could you imagine working in a store every day, dealing with the kind of people who frequent [shopping center where I worked]?” 

I get that she was trying to be funny or whatever but something in me really snapped, especially since I’ve been hearing these kinds of comments ever since I got married. I told her that I probably dealt with more interesting people in a day at my old job than a year at hers catering to old rich fogies. She got really offended and said I had a problem and I kind of just word vomited a LOT of things that I hate about them, their friends, and their lifestyles. 

My husband ended up finding me in a near shouting match with this woman and taking me out. I found out through others that he told them I was drinking too much and had a bad day. I’m really upset because I feel like he always brushes these things away but I also feel like I fucked up and really embarrassed him. But he also defended this woman by saying that she’s known for having a “bitchy humor” around the office, and that she doesn’t mean to be rude. WITA here?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We barely talked to each other. The first two times, I truly couldn't; however, I did always try and reschedule.

Anyways, I barely knew what was going on with her. I've been through so much in the past few years. It's been hard to really focus on anything that doesn't directly affect me.

She hit me up to chill over memorial day weekend. I thought it'd be a great time to chill since it was the long weekend.

I picked her up; she was drunk. She started off our hang out sesh with ""dude I've been through some shit"". She explained to me that a couple of years back, she ended up in a psych ward, and she met the love of her life there. She told me that they had a tumultuous, but rewarding relationship. Multiple car crashes. DUI charges. Their families didn't like their relationship. Unwavering love. You get the jist. 

She told me that the boyfriend was a recovering addict. Basically, he hid it from her throughout the entire relationship. One night, he was begging her to drive him into an inner city area that is notorious for heroine. She refused. Then, he said that he wpikd hitchhike. She didn't want him to do that, so she got him an Uber. In the Uber, the boyfriend overdosed. She got the blow-by-blow story from the Uber driver.

He was brought to the hospital. He died..

So, we get to the bar. She proceeds to get shit faced and constantly talk about her situation (which I get). She started to break down and cry at sad love songs. I hugged and comforted her. 
I drove her home after a couple of hours. She proceeded to tell me that she hates home because her mom takes away her alcohol, and it helps her cope with her loss. She's 35.

I told her that if she needs anything, I'm there for her. Specifically, if she needed to talk, don't hesitate to call. We live an hour apart, so it's he'd to see each other. 

After the entire day, I was at a loss for words. I feel bad for her, but I feel like I can't be dragged into this mess. 

It's been a week. I haven't followed up with the status of her mental health. I feel like an asshole, but at the same, I just don't want to deal with it. I have so much going on in my world and can't take on the addifonal stress.

side note : we argued before this happened. i was using cotton buds to clear my ears while fasting (its ramadan) she told me u cant do that, you’ll break your fast. i told her shes wrong and provided evidence why using cotton buds wont break your fast. she didnt take it well

I get extreme anxiety going back to Wyoming City. I tried to spend just a week during the holidays and had to leave early because I just couldn't take it.

He couldn't afford the apartments this summer (college apartments that take the cost out of your loans during the semesters, but they charged both residents $900/month during the summer and neither of us had the extra cash), so he went back home until fall.

On a call today, he says he understands WHY I can't make more frequent visits, but still feels like I'm being shitty for ""not making the effort."" 

I thought we'd worked this out, what with me paying for him to visit. I didn't know he was so upset about it.

bw7ct1	2019-06-03 06:06:08	press4forapharmrep	AITA for hating my downstairs neighbors?	"I live in an apartment building with fairly thin floors/ceilings/walls and my neighbors below constantly bang on the ceiling when they think I’m making too much noise. Thankfully they don’t try to do it much during the day, but anytime after 9 or 10pm is fair game.
I would totally understand and feel sorry about making noise if I was jumping around or vacuuming or hosting a party that late but quite honestly the most noise I ever really make that late is just walking around getting ready for bed. I’m not stomping, just straightening up from the day turning lights off and whatnot. Regardless of this, my neighbors still feel the need to bang on their ceiling. On a few occasions they’ve even walked all the way outside to hold down my door buzzer for 30+ seconds (which I might add is a terrifying and unsettling noise to be startled by at 11:30pm)

I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for wanting to confront them while playing the victim when it’s possible they are justified in their actions because of how late it can be when the noise occurs.

As a note, I would like to add that I just enjoy staying up late and am up every night until like midnight or 1am. I try to be as quiet as possible but it seems to not matter. I’m not walking around all night long, but for 10-20 minutes at the end of the night you’ll find me moving around more."	Not the A-hole	0	0	380.0	66.0	0.0	0.0

bw7c9b	2019-06-03 06:03:53	Oliver_is_my_homie	WIBTA to cut ties with my close friend of 14 years after I wasn’t invited to her bday party bc her new “bestie” is dating my ex husband?	"Title. Jennifer was one of my best friends. We were extremely close in our college days. She was my ride or die best friend.  I was a bridesmaid in her wedding, she was one in mine to my ex husband. We threw each other bridal and baby showers. We are both in our 30’s with small children now.

Several years into our friendship Jennifer became friends with a girl we’ll call Holly. I had always really liked Holly. She and I never hung out alone, but we were frequently together as a group. 

I went through a very contentious divorce 5 years ago. It was very hard on me. Both Jennifer and Holly saw me cry over it. 

I’m happily remarried now with a soon to be toddler. I have also recently acquired some serious health issues. I haven’t seen any of my friends that much lately because i am frequently in the hospital, live farther away from them, have a toddler, and have a full time job. 

Well today I saw pictures on social media from Jennifer’s bday party last night. I knew nothing about it. Also, my ex husband is in the pictures. That’s odd because Jennifer was not friends with him. She only knew him because of our marriage. 

Then for some reason my mom (who is an asshole, but probably had good intentions to defend me) texts Jennifer to call her out, and Jennifer admits to me that Holly is dating my ex husband.. and has been for some time. Apparently Holly planned the party and told Jennifer that she did invite me, and that I just never answered her. Jennifer doesn’t believe Holly would lie to her about that. Well guess what.... she didn’t say a word to me. I even saw her 4 days ago. Nothing. 

Both of these girls had ample opportunities to be honest with me. It may have been a little awkward at first, but I wouldn’t have cared!!!! I liked Holly. I am happily married. I hold no more ill will towards my ex. 

I feel like a good friend would have told me about this months ago. I’ve been around all of them multiple times where I guess they just pretended not to be together. Jennifer has apologized that I was left out of the party, but I think she’s missing (or choosing to ignore) the point.

bw7bhd	2019-06-03 06:01:09		AITA for being pissed about s/o's mom making them pay rent?	"So, s/o and I are both in our early twenties. They're great, and we've been together for years, and frequently help each other pay for things, despite not living together. they pay for my student loans occasionally and i help pay vet bills or groceries. we share money, at this point. s/o is desperately trying to save for university.

s/o's dad just passed away. they've handled everything, from calling people to driving their mom places (she won't drive), and has always paid for her gas, groceries, and other expenses. sibling has done.. nothing. sibling is 29 and just started paying for rent a few months ago, after parents agreed it's too old and he has the means to pay for half the rent. his first year of uni was also paid off, but he dropped out and has a decent full time job. 

the mother just informed s/o today that he needs to pick up the other half of the rent, and the insurance, on top of him helping with groceries and gas since she won't be getting as much money. this means they cannot save up for much of anything .. and they've had to find a new job just to try to cover the expenses. 

i'm livid, and don't think it's fair that the brother never had to pay until recently, at basically 30, and is not trying to save for anything, as his university was paid for by the parents. we all know that she has enough money to pay for everything for the rest of her life, even though she doesn't have a job. however, s/o thinks i'm an asshole for pushing it and selfish for bringing it up. our savings is going to continuously take a large hit from this, as i'm also in school. 

i think s/o should bring it up, or move out and use the money to scrape by in an apartment rather than scrape by living at home. they think i'm an asshole and selfish for thinking like this, but i think she's an asshole for taking advantage of the situation in order to not pay for anything. if anything, it should be split 3 ways. not half between the kids. 

tl;dr mil is making kids split mortgage in half after passing of dad, despite the fact that s/o is saving for school and pays for lots around the house, and mil doesn't work at all."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bw7b29	2019-06-03 05:59:46		AITA for telling a friend I wouldn’t date her crush and then doing it anyways?	"Ok so this was all kind of long ago but I still wonder.

Basically one of my best friends had a crush on this guy who I found cute and she knew I found him cute but that wasn’t a problem because i would never date one of my friends crushes plus I had a boyfriend at the time.

As time went on they became somewhat of a thing in her head but in his they were nothing and he found her kind of annoying. I ended up breaking up with my boyfriend and another day I bumped into him in school and we ended up skipping class together and we talked all the time. I thought nothing of it I thought it would be a one time thing since I wasn’t all that close to him but it became a daily thing. And then we started skipping more classes and became closer as time went by. (This was after my I told my friend he didn’t like her, I told her this because I knew she was just torturing herself and wanted a straight answer so I gave it to her and she decided to talk to him and ‘end’ things).

I still thought nothing of it, he was flirty but he’s flirty with everyone so I didn’t question it. Then he started confessing he had feelings for me and I just took it  as a joke for some time until some other friends told me he was serious about me. Even then I thought nothing of it as I still had the “he as my friends crush I cant do anything about it” mindset and even talked to her about it. She said that she didn’t care what I did with him and that I could do whatever I wanted to which I replied that I wouldn’t do anything since he liked her and we were still friends. Some time passed by and me and my friend grew apart (because of this) even though I had done nothing (maybe it just bothered her knowing that he liked me?) and she eventually stopped talking to me.

Probably two weeks after she stopped talking to me I decided, what the hell we don’t even talk anymore I’ll go for it. So I ended up dating this guy but am I the asshole?? If me and my friend would’ve remained friends and would’ve never done anything but she’s the one that stopped talking to me, not only that but she said I could do whatever I wanted, and it was just her crush and they never had a thing so am I the asshole?"

bw76r1	2019-06-03 05:43:32	YeetedToJesus	AITA for being THIS mad over a joke?	"This post requires a fair amount of context. 

I had a friend who I'll refer to as F. F has a super difficult home life. Her parents are abusive, she has untreated depression and anxiety, she lives in a house with a lot of drugs and alcohol and it's overall just an awful living situation. My living situation is close to perfect. I live alone with my Dad (who makes a really good income- enough to support a family of 4-5 easily, so we don't struggle) who I get alone with extremely well. My Dad has never smoked, doesn't drink and certainly never does drugs. I don't have any mental health issues and I truly love my life.

Recently F has been distant. A couple of days ago she was EXTREMELY rude. She followed me around for the day constantly butting into conversations that she wasn't even involved in by saying ""I don't care"". I didn't snap at her, or really do anything because I know some people have worse days then others.

I was however talking to F about how I might have to put down one of my pets soon (a rat, but this rat literally means the world to me.) and she once again butts in with ""I don't care"".

I still didn't comment on it, because I'm more mature then that and I refuse to lose my cool over 3 words repeated over and over again. However, about 5 minutes later we were all cracking jokes/sharing funny stories and I mentioned how the day before I ""lost"" one of my rats (they all come when they're called, and if they don't, my dog loves them and she'll find them in an instant - my dog would never hurt them, she just likes to watch them). Pretty much she jumped off my table because I left them and she went after me. Before I could finish the story (she had jumped high onto my tv unit and was licking the TV) F suddenly blurts out ""Good, I hope she died"" and continued on cracking jokes like before.

I looked at her in obvious disgust, stood up and said that I wouldn't be talking to her again and that was extremely inappropriate for her to say something like that to me, especially so soon after I was talking about my pet needing to be put down. I told her that just because she has a bad day doesn't give her ANY right to behave this way to another human let alone a friend. She responded with ""I don't care"". I walked away and I haven't talked to her since.

She found me later that day and tried to apologise but I shot that down straight away by simply telling her I meant what I said earlier and I walked away yet again.

I know she was being completely childish but I also NEVER snap at people. I don't raise my voice and I do feel I might be overreacting. My friends have told me I'm being dramatic and I'm not thinking about F's life and how she might be stressed but it still left a bad taste in my mouth."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Now I don't even fit on this couch and it is very uncomfortable and I have woken up with back pain the last two days because of it. So I complained that one of them should sleep on the couch tonight and I sleep on a bed as I see it as completely unfair that I should be the only one to suffer while everyone else gets to sleep comfortably. My sisters were very against sharing the burden and my mom defended them making me out to be an asshole for wanting to sleep on a bed. Refusing to suffer another night on that uncomfortable couch, I'm lying in a bed feeling guilty for making this a big thing while my mother and sisters are treating me like I'm a huge asshole for thinking someone else should spend one night on that couch.

bw7565	2019-06-03 05:37:26	ctrthrower	AITA (WIBTA) for inventing a fake girlfriend to explain why I'm leaving the company?	"So I work for a tech company in Palo Alto. I just joined a few months ago. So far, the experience has not been great. I'm not really interested in the work, and I think the team and engineers are not that talented. I started casually interviewing a few weeks ago, and I have an offer from a company in New York that I'm probably going to take. I wasn't explicitly searching in New York, but this company seemed to be a good fit, and I've always wanted to live in New York for a bit.

I haven't told my boss that anything was wrong, and I don't really want to get into that conversation. If I were to do so, I think it might be kinda awkward to explain why I'm leaving after only a few months, and I might have to deal with my boss and my team's senior engineers trying to explain to me why I should stay.

So, since the new job is in New York, I'm thinking of explaining to my boss that I have a girlfriend who recently had to move to New York, which is why I need to move there (I don't have a girlfriend). I think that's an argument for moving that's pretty universal, and I'd consider it a ""white lie"" that just makes things easier for both sides. Plus it's pretty much guaranteed to not burn any bridges.

Is lying like this an asshole move? Would it be better if I just told the truth and explained why I'm leaving? I'm worried by doing so, I'll make leaving a lot more painful, and I'll also  maybe burn bridges with the company/the engineers working here. But I'm kind of hesitant to come up with such a big lie just to get out of an awkward conversation."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bw74ya	2019-06-03 05:36:40	Savvygirl011	AITA for wanting my boyfriend to live with me?	I (20F) have a mobile home that my father is fixing up for my boyfriend and I. It was my maternal great-grandmother’s. It is on an acre of land and has septic tank and a light pole already, praise be. All we have to do is repair minor issues of drywall and plumbing, lay flooring, finish the drywall, and install everything. This is all going to be paid for by my father and his crew is going to do the labor. My boyfriend (24M) refuses to help me clean up the yard, paint furniture, paint the home, etc. I did get him to help me and my cousin to paint the porch, but he wouldn’t fix the little drips or paint between the lattice so now when I fix it it’s not going to blend and will look ridiculous. I asked him to fix it and he said “it’s on the back side, no one will see it and I hate painting it’s gross!” Then proceeded to ignore my cousin and I and sloppily paint ONE SINGLE shuttle the same way and get paint on the white siding. He then ignored me again and painted the front and back doors against all common sense. He made it to where we couldn’t finish the porch for the door, he didn’t sand the back door and it’s alresdy flaking off and has paint covering most of the glass panels, and the front door isn’t even going to stay! He painted both knobs blue. We also finished clearing the yard of leaves and debris (had been vacant for nearly a decade, so a LOT of leaves). He made me do most of the work with my 16F cousin while he pouted in the car. My dad had to threaten him to help me before he (barely) would. He says he isn’t ready to play grown up yet, despite having already lived with me and the cousin for a year. He’s getting a free house and is mad that I want him to pay bills in it! I told him I had furnished all of the furniture, decor, supplies, etc. in our old home out of pocket, and my dad was doing this remodel for us, and my uncle let us live in the trailer, so he could stand to pay roughly $150 utilities a month and $200 grocery. That’s literally a week’s check. He says I yell too much, won’t let him smoke cigarettes or pot in the house, and want everything too clean and perfect for him to relax. He also doesn’t want to leave his mom again since his dad took a night shift job, but she has a pistol and lives on two acres of land with her sister-in law and brother-in-law and her mil and Fil up the hill.

My brother left the house and looked like he was going to be gone for a while. The dryer was was full of his first batch of clothes (let’s call this group A) and it was done the entire cycle from start to finish before he left the house. I need to do my laundry so I put his newly done washed clothes into the dryer (this is group B) and put in my own and put his group A clothes atop the dryer because there’s no hamper nor basket or anything to put them in.

After his clothes and my clothes are done I shift group B with group A on the couch because they’re becoming quite a pile and put my clothes in the dryer. All this takes about 4 hours when I come back to get my laundry to find them soaking wet atop the dryer with group A in the dryer. He comes back down to what I think was trying to reason his actions. I put in my clothes in the dryer and he try’s to (verbally NOT physically) stop me. He then tells me his clothes Group A are were not dry. (I picked group A which consisted solely of his under garments one by one out,  and they seemed dry to me. Also the full cycle was done so naturally.....) I confirmed we were talking about group A then I proceeded saying they were dry. Then he rebutted saying “they were not to my definition (or level) of dryness “ .

I've never been all that close to my Mom but after my Dad passed I have been trying to rekindle our relationship. I have been away for college since she has been born and since my Mom got remarried, so I've only met the kid less than 10 times.

 My issue is that whenever I come home to visit my Mom has me watch over my step-sister. My Mom expects me to be immediately in love with the kid and be a big brother, but under my watch alone she's constantly throwing tantrums and seems scared of me. My mom/step dad has also mentioned that she may have a mild form of aspergers so maybe that has some effect on her personality. Normally I love taking care of kids but the way she acts towards me does not sit well even if she is still a toddler. I get that I am not around that often so she's not too familiar with me but when I really think about it I cannot say that I care about the kid at all."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

She got into a fight with someone and I was kind of in the middle and I don’t really hold onto things so I dropped it and she wouldn’t. So I told her she needed to drop it and they both could talk when they calmed down. 

She told me she has so many feelings and she can’t drop it and she didn’t know how it was so easy for me to drop it. So I told her I’m diagnosed with borderline personality disorder so I don’t have a problem not feeling things towards certain people because I don’t care about 99% of people (super dumbed down version I know) 

She then told me that was really cool and wished she had it. I told her it wasn’t really that simple and that it wasn’t that I didn’t have feelings and that I just felt things differently than the average person. And that my FP (fav person which is my bf) was like feeling every emotion 10x what normal people do and that I idolize him and put him on a godly standard. 

She started super romanticizing this saying it was so cute and saying awww that’s adorable when it actually most times turns out to be extremely unhealthy relationships. 

Later she came up to me and asked if there was anyway she can develop it or anyway that she can become like me. I replied with “uhh no it’s actually caused by severe trauma. It’s the brains coping mechanism to sort of turn off part of different centers” and she said “Damn. That’s too bad.” 

I’m kind of offended. I don’t know if I have the right to be though because maybe I did a bad job of explaining? I did tell her after that it’s heavily stigmatized and that if she ever wanted to know more I can get into detail."	Not the A-hole	0	0	23.0	22.0	0.0	0.0
bw6w21	2019-06-03 05:04:47		AITA – Brother's electric razor used to shave dog	"My brother has been asking where his clippers are and I honestly told him I'd never touch your clippers and have no idea. 

A few days later he found them in the garage covered in dog hair and lost his shit at me. He was questioning me asking wtf happened (rightfully so). My misses wasn't home so I told him to calm down and I'll find out what happened and we will sort it out, not to worry. He chucked the clippers in the recycling bin and stormed out of the house. 

Turns out she needed to give our dog a haircut and found some trimmers in a draw, which turned out to be my brothers. She clipped the whole dog. I got mad and told her to not touch anything that isn't hers and that she needs to apologise to him. She owned it, apologised and said she will pay for a replacement and sent him a screenshot of the clippers she thought they were (don’t think they are the right model)

This morning. He called me 4 times consecutively this morning followed by a text “answer your fucking phone”. My misses and I are both at work today. I called him back and ensured that we will replace the beard trimmer but need to confirm the exact model number first and will find the beard trimmer tonight as I took the bins out last night. That’s when the phone call ended and he started messaging me. Read the message trail below:

[https://imgur.com/a/MMhtzci](https://imgur.com/a/MMhtzci)

TL;DR – my misses unknowingly used my brother beard trimmer on our pet dog, he found the trimmer full of dog hair and threw the trimmer in the bin only to return the next day when we are at work, and is looking through the bins for the beard trimmer. We’ve agreed to replace the beard trimmer for him but he is turning this into a bigger problem than it really is.

I understand that my misses could’ve prevented all this from happening if she just didn’t touch property that didn’t belong to her, but we are trying to resolve this and I think he is overreacting and being a complete wanker about it now. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bw6uxj	2019-06-03 05:00:59		AITA for not giving my father any of my inheritance money?	"Quick backstory: 

Parents divorced when I was like 2. My father hasn’t been a big part of my life, or very much of it at all.  But I’m totally cool with it because my mother is a total fucking badass and the strongest/best person I know. 

Father never paid child support and I probably have seen him a total of 300 times in my life. Maybe less. I’m 33.

He has lived with his mother and sister his ENTIRE life and never had a career, or really ever a “job”. He mooched off his family his entire life. I know I’m making it sound like he’s a total POS...but this is really all I know of him. 

He is fully capable of working. He recently married some lady from his past who doesn’t have anything going for herself either. It appears neither of them work and are living off government assistance and disability checks. 

His sister (my aunt) recently passed and left me with $90K in annuities and left my dad with her house which is worth ~$400k and completely paid for. 

He is asking me to send him half of the money to help him keep the house. A part of me wants to, but another part of me doesn’t.  At the end of the day I blocked his number and his gf’s number and essentially erased him from my life.

bw6uuh	2019-06-03 05:00:44		AITA for not wearing clothes in my place?	"Sup AITA, posting from my main account so be gentle, I guess, maybe.

So, I shower often and generally don't wear any clothes in my place. Neither do gf's or whomever I might be intimate with at a given time. Not really an ideological thing, but rather, its my place, and I see no point if it isn't necessary. I'm also a bit of a narcissist and happen to think I look pretty good and enjoy checking myself out in the mirror.

I lift, used to model and do gymnastics, and generally try to be aesthetically appealing.

ANYWAY,

I used to live in an 8th floor. I've since moved, and now I live in a 2nd floor. This second floor faces a building, a slope, and a valley. Generally there's not too many people in the street. But, I can see my neighbors rather clearly.

I am not sure if they can see me, or not. There are windows, and the sun might be behind my building most of the time.

Anyway, I wander naked in front of the windows, a whole bunch.

But, yesterday, it kinda hit me that, while I have a wonderful view of the valley, the people in the building in front of mine have a beautiful view of... our building, I guess.

So, AITA for not being particularly concerned with whether they can see me? I don't know for sure one way or the other, and neither do I know if they can see below the waist at any rate."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bw6u0o	2019-06-03 04:57:47	snakethrowingpunches	AITA (M23) Having Sexual Tension with a Married Woman (F43)	"We were always very flirty with each other even before we ""got to know each other more"", like she would do things to try and get my attention, I could really tell she got off on the fact I would roast her all the time and sometimes we would get physical touching each others arms and honestly stuff I bet her husband wouldn't like that I did. One thing that really stuck out to me that she said was one time she randomly admired to me ""I feel like I can be myself around you, and I can't really say that about many people in my life"". At the point I am going to be honest I started to catch mild feelings. Thats when I knew shit was going south.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

One of my defense mechanisms I have is I know I can cut people out of my life. So thats what I did, I did not speak to her for 6 weeks. I realized I shouldn't be catching feelings for someone who is married and I saw it as the best course of action of dealing with it. She did not like it one bit, she would blow up my phone asking if I was okay, sent me like a paragraph saying how she cherishes our friendship and didn't know what she did to make me stop talking to her. It reached a point where one day in the gym she snapped at me while I was putting some weights away, where she went off at me and then we started arguing in front of everyone in the gym. I ended the arguement by saying ""What do you want from!?"" and she had no response to that by the look on her face and said ""Fine, I guess I don't want to be your friend anymore!"" and stormed off. I felt like a huge dick because I knew at this point that me ignoring her really made it climax to this moment. So I felt bad and went to go look for her to talk about it.

&#x200B;

Turns out she was crying in one of the private rooms in the gym with a coach. And by crying I mean she was WAILING like I never heard someone cry this hard. She was saying things like ""I never want to talk to him again"", ""How could he yell at me in front of everyone"", Ironic because she was the one yelling at me first but moving on, I asked my coach to leave the room so we could talk and he did. I basically told her the truth of what was going on with me how all the spending time with her made me develop strong feelings for her and my defense mechanism is to try to run away from it and cut people out, and she understood it and wasn't even really mad about it surprisingly. She slowly stopped crying as hard, at this point she was in my arms as I am basically caressing her, it was very wholesome. 

She told me that some things are going on in her life atm and she didn't want to tell me what because she said she wasn't comfortable talking about it yet. And before we walked out she said she never yelled at anyone like that except for her husband... which I thought that was very telling of probably what her situation at home probably.

bw6tdt	2019-06-03 04:55:32	langleywaters	AITA for cutting off a former close friend	"I’m going to try to be as fair as possible in this post.

This guy (we’ll call him John) used to be my boss, during that time I was incredibly loyal to him. I planned and ran his wedding, I was a devoted assistant, and in exchange he brought me on a vacation, which was wonderful and I truly appreciated the gesture.

At one point, his boss brought me to her office and basically asked me to spy on him. I refused, and she ended up harassing me for a year...screamed at me in front of the office, berated me for being “too talkative” during a staff meeting (I wasn’t talking during the meeting, nor was I known for being chatty) until I started crying, and fired me the day I came back from vacation because she was selling the company and was afraid I’d tell the new HR about her. Her job is her life, that is her choice, so I left and tried my best not to gossip about her with John, since I knew he still worked for her and I didn’t want to add to his stress.

That was a year ago. During that year, I worked my ass off creating my own business, which has been doing well. John never showed any support for my business, and whenever I saw him he would ask if I’d ever apologize to his boss to get my job back. I’ve always said no, the closest I came to saying yes was “it would have to be in my contract that I have no communication with her”. He was always upset about this, but I thought he was just sad that we didn’t work together.

Fast forward to present day: he wanted me to attend his daughter’s graduation. Of course I would love too, but I was deathly ill that day. I messaged him the next day apologizing profusely for missing it and asking if we could schedule a dinner to celebrate with his daughter.

He told me no problem, then started gushing about the woman who fired me because she showed up at the graduation and gave his daughter money. I basically told him that was great but I wasn’t really comfortable talking about how great woman who fired me is. He then started arguing with me about how much he appreciated her and how great she’s been. I told him I’m glad they have a friendship but I cannot get past the fact that she harassed me and deeply damaged my family’s income. He basically told me I was bringing politics into it when he’s focused on how it’s his daughter’s special day and that “maybe” we could make dinner plans.

After that I just said sounds good, and decided to cut him off socially. My friends are very supportive as they feel like he never really had my interests at heart, my mother thinks I’m being selfish. AITA?

Edit: to be clear, I always told him everything that his boss said/did as it happened. He even told me she has done that before and has always picked his assistants based on who she thought would spy on him. It’s a big part of why I’m so hurt that he’s brought her up before. Sorry I realize that was unclear because I didn’t talk about her after I left, I more meant I didn’t want to keep talking about how much she sucked because I didn’t work there anymore and felt like it would just bring him down to constantly remind him."

bw6t89	2019-06-03 04:54:58	ishithefishi	WIBTA if I didn't call my dying biological father after he hadn't contacted us in years?	"BD = Bio-Dad  


So, my bio-dad met my bio-mom in Africa while they were both in Peace Corp. My dad from NY, my mom from Yemen. My dad has a second family. Like I have a half sister in NY somewhere from before this endeavor. Long story short, my BD kicks my mom and I out when I was 7, I did like half on half off for a year until I just never saw or heard from my BD again until I was 12. 

He was a long haul trucker, and I stayed with him for 2 weeks on his truck going up into Idaho and stuff. After the trip, I was stoked! I was going to hear from my BD on the regular! No! I didn't hear from him again until he added me on facebook when I was 18. But this is when the shitstorm started brewing. I got contacted by my second family. As a confused 18 year old, all I could understand that my BD was trying to reconcile with everyone, so I sent him an Email(because he told me it was better for him than fb) that everything was good between us. He never replied to that, so I blocked them all on FB thinking that I never had to think about this guy that I randomly had contact with, I also had a really cool step dad that adopted me when I was 24! So, I don't think of this guy as my dad, or even my bio dad, just a guy who aided in my birthing. 

He recently got my mother's number from a distant relative, and explained that he wanted to talk to me because he is dying and he wants to apologize. I don't feel the need for that since I don't feel any ill will towards him, just that he had made bad decisions. But he doesn't have ""any family"" anymore. I am also afraid that he will become obsessive towards me and call me constantly. Would I be the asshole if I didn't call him back?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	522.0	84.0	0.0	0.0

I have made an appointment with an optometrist the other day to check on me and my son's eyes. It's not that serious, but our eyes are a little bit red. I'm supposed to meet the doctor at around 12PM and because this is homecoming season, getting a doctor at this time of the year is extremely rare. 

Because it is a 15 minute drive from the Hospital, I figured that we'd leave the house at 11.15 just to be safe. My wife woke up at 11PM when we are about to leave. And even that is after I told her to wake up. Seeing how it usually takes more than 15 minutes for my wife to prepare, I thought that leaving her is acceptable since she doesn't respect me either. 

Note, a similar situation happened a few months ago but my son stalled and begged me to wait long enough to wait for her. However, I think this time around my son also has the same impression and decided to not wait for her. 

AITA?

"I sublet my room to someone and left a desk, a small mattress, and a completely uninstalled IKEA bed frame behind. The subletter has his own furniture so he doesn't need mine.

I was unwilling to do so in the beginning because of my past experience. My roommates from the past and I personally never minded furniture from previous tenants. But now I realized that leaving unwanted stuff was wrong. I caused an inconvenience for him, and I should pay him for having to deal with the furniture.

The issue is I assumed that he would be willing to move the furniture out by himself since the total work seemed to cost less than an hour. However, he would like to hire someone to move them out. I told him that I would be willing to pay for his time instead of a mover's time because hiring a mover is more expensive.

But he got extremely angry at me and called me shameless. I realized that I basically told him that his time worth less than a mover, which was definitely a mistake. But can you guys tell me if there's anything else I did wrong?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Her best friend (bff) reaches out and said friend and fiancé are going to elope while away. Yay! But bff wants to have a party for their elopement a few weeks before they leave, and I live in a place that could easily hold a party. I hesitantly said yes, but told her that we’re pretty close with friend and weren’t told, so we may want to frame the party differently.

I know he's done a shit ton of bad things and I know I'm probably an idiot for still being friends with him/wanting to give him yet another chance but as I mentioned earlier- I don't have a lot of friends and I don't have the want/need to meet new people. At the end of the day, we get along pretty well most of the time(as long as we're not living together) and we share a lot of common interests.

Anyway, I recently hung out with my friend and I don't know. It's weird and I can't say I feel like we're gonna be super close or anything but he does seem like he's changed somewhat. I'd like my girlfriend to come with me sometime to hang out so I can introduce them but when I ran the idea by her she told me that she doesn't really have any interest in meeting someone that was ""such a dick to me"". She told me that she finds him to be a terrible friend and she's angry at him for the things he's done to me. I told her that it's not up to her to hold some grudge for me and that if I've forgiven him than that should be good enough and she should be willing to meet him. 

She won't seem to budge though and I called her an asshole for not being willing to meet someone that I spent a large part of my life with. She called me an asshole for trying to force her to meet someone that wasn't a true friend. She just told me that slave owners owned slaves for large portions of their lives and that never made them friends and went on to say stuff about time not being a measurement of friendship but actions.

There is the Co-leaders and the Leaders which do the main big in charge stuff, like demote and promote people. There are Elders, and they can invite and accept people into the clan.

&#x200B;

The Co-leaders sent out a clan mail which said that you shouldn't accept people to the clan unless you ask a co-leader first. I didn't read the mail, and as such I accepted someones request to join.

&#x200B;

I was demoted, and the player I accepted was kicked out. I later said some snarky and kind of mean spirited jokes, directed at my friend. He was pretty offended and unhappy, but no further action was taken."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bw6i39	2019-06-03 04:16:44	Brahmin_Herders	AITA for playing hardball with my girlfriend after she made a 'mistake'	"Facts:

GF went to a party with her best friend and a bunch of single guys. There was booze. Her friend uses these parties to cheat on her fiance. The parties usually involve sex and flirting. I've been to a few with my girlfriend where we kept to ourselves in that regard. At this party, they played 'Never have I ever' with stripping instead of drinking.

&#x200B;

I asked my GF specifically if she stripped. She said No.

&#x200B;

A week later, I was invited to the party. One of the Dude-Bros there referenced the stripping game. I asked my girlfriend to explain why she lied to me. She said it wasn't a big deal and she only got down to her bra and jeans. I didn't want to argue at the party so I stowed it.

&#x200B;

The next day, I told her it upset me because it made it feel like I can't trust her. She said she didn't tell me because she knew I'd be mad.

I pointed out that now I'm mad that she stripped for a bunch of men and also lied to me about it.

&#x200B;

She insists that it's not a big deal because she wouldn't mind if I took my clothes off for other women.

&#x200B;

I said I wouldn't do that anyway. And that I'm not ok with her doing it. In the past, she played strip poker with her friend and her friend's much older paramour. Then, she claimed she was peer pressured into it. I made it clear that I do not want her stripping.

&#x200B;

She accuses me of harping on her for one little mistake.

&#x200B;

My opinion is that you would only do something like stripping to attract someone. If you are trying to attract someone, then you obviously aren't happy with me. If you aren't happy with me, then we need to break up. You are wasting both of our time in that scenario.

&#x200B;

I know I don't own her body but I want exclusivity in my relationship or no relationship at all.

&#x200B;

I told her that if she lies to me about something like this again, we're breaking up. And if she strips again, we are breaking up. I don't care if it's just your shirt. She's apologized a few times, some more sincere than others.

&#x200B;

We fought about this multiple times. I brought it up in a joke which caused another argument. We got invited to a party with the same people. I said 'If you go I might have to tag along to keep an eye on you :P"" which she was offended by.

&#x200B;

It escalated from there. Both sides argue the same thing. I feel like my judgement is being affected by my emotions too much. I had a dream where she cheated on me. Maybe my ego is fragile. Anyway, she lied to me. There's a lot of context I don't have room to put here but this is the gist of it. This has called into question on whether or not I can trust her while at college or if I get deployed. Am I right in being indignant or am I an emotional petty Asshole?"

bw6fpl	2019-06-03 04:09:05		AITA for ignoring a (former) friend who ghosted me?	"tl;dr- one of my friends ghosted me on my birthday, now I’m ignoring his requests to make it up several months later. 

A few months ago I invited my friends over to celebrate my birthday. The plan was to eat some tacos, play video games and have some drinks at my place. I invited 6 guys in total and 5 showed up. The 6th guy, I’ll call him Mitch, ghosted us that night. I know he’s got kids and a job that takes him out of a town frequently so I made sure to ask a week ahead of time if he’ll be able to make it and he said he would. Then the night of my birthday he not only didn’t show up, he didn’t respond to my fb message asking him if he was still coming after I noticed he wasn’t there after an hour. He did the same thing last year but that’s another story.

I didn’t hear from the dude for months. He even saw me at a gas station a couple months after my bday and he just looked down at this phone instead of acknowledging me. I also made no effort to say hi either, since I felt slighted that he just didn’t show up and didn’t offer an explanation. Then recently he messages me after he saw I posted a link to something he was selling on Facebook to a group I belong to for this specific hobby. Somebody was looking for the exact thing he was selling so I figured why not. We exchanged a few messages, nothing too deep but overall friendly. Then he says something along the lines of “what’re you up to next weekend? I wanna make it up to you for missing your birthday.” 

That kinda pissed me off so I just deleted the message without responding. He sent some follow up texts related to something else that I also ignored. I have no doubt he’s an asshole for ghosting me, but my question is AITA for not giving him an explanation as to why I don’t want to hang out with him? For context I’ve known this guy for probably 7 or 8 years."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bw6f7b	2019-06-03 04:07:26	somuchwood	AITA for docking my employees pay?	"Alright, so I know this typically wouldn't be a question but I feel like these are different circumstances and it's making me uneasy.

 I run a landscaping company and have hourly employees, I occasionally hire people based on a daily rate. Let's call the employee in question ""Juan"". Juan is a contracted worker and I agreed to $180 per day prior to the job, which was scheduled for two days. Prior to agreeing to the daily rate I asked Juan to provide me with an hourly rate or a total price for the job and I would be happy to pay it. He told me he doesn't work by the hour, just by the ""day"".

The crew consists of myself, Juan, and one other hourly employee ""Bob"". 

Day 1, Bob and I start working at 9am, Juan shows up at 11am. Juan works fairly well today but still lags far behind Bob. Juan tells me at 3pm that he will need to leave early but requests to start earlier the next day around 7am, I tell him that's fine and he leaves, Bob and I continue to work until 5.

Day 2, Bob and I start working at 7am with no Juan to be found. He shows up at 930 this time. He doesn't work near as hard today either. I have to leave the job site occasionally to pick up more materials, these trips typically take 30-40 minutes or so. When I leave I typically give my employees 1-2 simple tasks which they can complete in 10 minutes. Every single time I come back to the job site I see Juan sleeping on the homeowners deck. Boots off, hat over his face, sleeping. He realizes I pulled up and gets back to work in a hurry.

I have not said anything to Juan about him taking breaks, I encourage employees to take breaks whenever they need, I also encourage them to drink the water and eat the food we provide without question. I had exactly ZERO issue with him sitting down as long as the work gets done in a timely fashion.

After the job is complete at 5pm we have a walk-through with the homeowners. During this walk-through they inform me that Juan was sitting down most of the day and didn't get much work done, especially when I wasn't on site. They said Bob worked very hard and never seemed to stop for more than a few minutes.

After this is complete we leave the job site and I make out checks for both employees. Due to Juan's tardiness on both days I feel it is only fair to pay him accordingly so I take his 180/10 for $18 per hour and pay him for his hours worked, even the sitting hours. 

Juan has a huge problem with this and begins to yell at my wife for the short check. He accuses me of treating him like a slave because he is Hispanic, and says nobody works 10 hour days so he shouldn't be paid based on a 10 hour day.

In the end, I still docked Juan's pay, and he still got paid more than myself and more than Bob.

But, it feels wrong because we had agreed to a daily price. AITA for docking Juan's pay?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	6.0	3.0	0.0	0.0
bw6et0	2019-06-03 04:06:05	char020	AITA for telling my flat mate to stop asking me to do his washing.	"So my flat mate moved in about a month ago and in general he is a bit disorganized. I have told him a few times if he could stop doing some things (leaving bathmat on floor after shower, writing food on the list when you use the last thing, to not use my special preserving jars to take food to work in)
Since he moved in he has asked me to help him out with washing three times. The first time I didn't mind too much cause he was leaving home really quickly for a family emergency but since then he has asked twice. I know I could say no but I feel bad saying no to helping people out. I feel like he should not be asking this of other people in general, and he has a habit of asking favours that are a bit too much.
I finally got sick of it today and told him to stop asking me because it's making me feel obligated to. I tried to do it in a polite way but I feel like I have been whining at him too much AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	4.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

They both work over 40 hours a week, closer to 60 or more. They decided to take a ""break"", each got a ""free pass"" for 1 person. My friend joking said she should use it on his friend, the virgin. She didn't take it as much of a joke, as we found out only a few days into the ""break"". My friend thought this whole scenario would be a good way to test if his girlfriend ""loved"" him. If she used the past then no, if she didn't use the pass then yes. The virgin thought it was fine sense it was my friends idea. My friend is pretty distraught after what happened, however he did give the virgin permission. Is the virgin in the wrong for having sex with her, or is my friend in the wrong for acting like it was fine and getting upset afterwards, he didn't expect either of them to actually follow through with it.

bw6d2f	2019-06-03 04:00:44		AITA for “being selfish”?	"Hey reddit, here’s the story of a dilemma I’ve been having recently with my SI, So sound off in the comments about what you think. 

A week and a half ago there was a party, my SI and I both were not drinking, Regular party things happen and we decide to go home driving home 3 other people who have drank but are okay. We are walking to the car when he sees his friend who is insanely drunk needing a ride home. He gets a bag because he knows she might throw up. We get into the car and he says “Can you sit beside her in the middle” and I said no because I have a phobia of vomiting aka emetophobia. I’ve had it all my life and I cannot handle the vomit coming out of the mouth, (Only seeing vomit come out of the mouth or thinking about it is what I can’t handle) as it causes me extreme anxiety. I was a very sick kid so I guess that’s where it came from since whenever I threw up I would think it’s a bad thing, I Have been having extreme anxiety attacks because of myself / my brothers vomiting ever since I could remember. He said okay. Throughout the car ride I am holding her hand and trying to relax her (there is someone else sitting beside her as well) and we have the garbage bag positioned infront of her so that if she does throw up it’s right there. We’re driving and everything is smooth when all of a sudden we hear the garbage bag be moved and hear her vomit. She moved the bag and threw up on the floor of his car. I almost vomited myself and he starts screaming at me saying it’s my fault and I should have sat beside her, to the point where everyone else in the car had to scream at him to stop. He still continues and calls me selfish as fuck and that “when I have kids I’ll have a fun time” (has said that a hundred times since.) We get home and I clean the car since her vomit was only water because she didn’t eat before. He than drove off to go home and the only times he talks to me he speaks to me with few words and tells me to fuck off and that I’m a selfish bitch. He has barely talked to me since and has been fighting with me about this every single night since. All my friends have said he is TA, but I don’t know if it’s biased because they’re my friends, Reddit please help me out and tell me what you think! If I’m TA then I would love to know so I can apologize (again) to him (already apologized after incident and after many times)"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
